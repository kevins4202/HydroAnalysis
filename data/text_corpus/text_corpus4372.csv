wind turbines wind wave misalignment three dimensional vibration control pounding tuned mass dampers three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 1 introduction offshore wind energy production is becoming increasingly attractive due to the increasing demand for renewable energies and advantages including higher wind speed less noise constraints and less visual impacts in marine areas the need of larger wind turbines with larger capacities e g 10 or 20 mega watts renders offshore floating wind turbines receiving more research effort than their fixed bottom counterparts however due to severe environmental conditions in the marine area such as combined wind wave and current loadings the fwts suffer from excessive three dimensional vibrations which will cause potential instability issues and severe fatigue damage of the structure and mooring cables eventually the structural service life will be reduced and the maintenance cost will increase due to excessive vibrations in the fwts to reduce the excessive vibrations of offshore wind turbines owts structural vibration control methods which have been previously applied in controlling vibrations of civil structures is being studied to mitigate the vibrations of owts structural vibration control strategies fall into three main categories 1 passive control 2 active control and 3 semi active control numerous passive controlling methods have been studied for owts colwell and basu 2009 investigated the structural vibration reduction of the monopile fixed owt by implementing a tuned liquid column damper it was concluded that the tuned liquid column damper is able to mitigate the vibrations and increase the fatigue life of the tower dinh and basu 2015 installed multiple tmds in the blades tower and platform of spar type fwt to reduce in plane vibrations of the fwt it was found that multiple tmds are more effective in reducing the in plane vibrations of the fwt zuo et al 2017 suggested utilizing multiple tmds to reduce the tower vibrations of owts the authors concluded that using smaller multiple tmds can improve the robustness of the control system hemmati et al 2019 studied the vibration mitigation of owts using a combined tuned liquid column damper and tmd the authors found that the tmds are more effective in operational conditions while tuned liquid column damper has a better performance in the parked condition si et al 2014 used a passive tmd to reduce the vibrations of a spar type fwt using a numerical search approach the passive tmd was optimized and it was shown that the tmd is able to reduce the vibrations of the fwt hu et al 2018 studied the application of an inerter tmd to reduce the responses of a barge fwt it was found that the inerter tmd can reduce the motion of the fwt however a trade off between the nacelle fore aft displacements and the tmd stroke was observed sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 used a tmd inerter to reduce the vibrations of the tower in a spar type fwt the authors concluded that the tmd inerter is able to reduce the vibrations of the tower with a smaller stroke in comparison to the classical tmd however this study did not address the vibration reduction of the platform zhang et al 2014 studied the in plane vibration reduction of wind turbine blades using roller dampers it was found that the proposed roller dampers effectively improve the structural vibration of the wind turbine blades to enhance the damping effect li et al 2015 studied and compared the robustness of a pounding tmd with a regular tmd in controlling vibrations of a subsea jumper it was found that the pounding tmd is able to reduce the structural vibration of the subsea jumper when the tmd natural frequency was off tuned wang et al 2019 proposed an in plane pendulum pounding tuned mass damper pptmd to reduce the vibrations of lightly damped structures subjected to harmonic and seismic loadings it was shown that the pptmd could achieve considerable effectiveness in controlling the responses of the structure at the resonant frequency passive controlling methods are highly efficient within the desired frequency range however they might lose their capability due to existence of environmental and system variations to overcome the variations in owts brodersen et al 2016 employed an active tmd to reduce the nacelle vibrations of a fixed owt using the feedback from the relative velocity of the tmd and nacelle responses it was shown that the active tmd is more effective than the passive tmd in mitigating the structural responses fitzgerald et al 2018 demonstrated the effectiveness of an active tmd in improving the structural reliability of a wind turbine it was shown that active tmds are able to increase the reliability of the tower in another study fitzgerald et al fitzgerald and basu 2014 proposed a cable connected active tuned mass damper to reduce the blades in plane vibrations the authors found that the proposed new active control method considerably mitigates the in plane vibrations of flexible wind turbine blades in addition to active control semi active control is investigated to reduce the vibrations of structures considering system and environmental variations sun et al 2014a sun and nagarajaiah 2014 sonmez et al 2016 sun 2018a 2018b developed a semi active tmd with tunable damping ratio and natural frequency to mitigate the offshore wind turbine vibrations it was found that in the presence of damage the passive tmd loses part of its effectiveness due to the reason that tmd becomes off tuned while the semi active tmd can effectively reduce the structural response with damage presence park et al 2019 evaluated the impact of passive and semi active tuned mass dampers on reducing the responses of a monopile fixed bottom and a tension leg platform type fwt it was found that the semi active tmd results in more response reduction with a smaller stroke than the passive tmd sarkar and chakraborty 2019 used a semi active tmd with multiple magneto rheological tuned liquid column dampers to control the vibrations of wind turbine tower it was found that the semi active control scheme is effective and robust in reducing the vibrations of the tower while most of the aformentioned studies focus on reducing the out of plane vibrations owts suffer from significant in plane vibrations caused by vortex induced vibrations xu et al 2018 or misalignment between wind and wave loadings to address this problem lackner and rotea 2011 intorduced dual linear tmds to reduce the bi directional structural vibrations of both fixed and floating offshore wind turbines it was revealed that the dual linear tmds can improve the bi directional responses however the tmd installed in a fwt required a large stroke to be able to reduce the response of the fwt to overcome the limitations of dual linear tmds such as higher cost of installation larger mass and space on the basis of sun et al 2014b sun and jahangiri sun and jahangiri 2018 2019 jahangiri and sun 2019 developed a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 3d ptmd to control the excessive bi directional vibrations of a fixed bottom monopile offshore wind turbine it was concluded that the proposed 3d ptmd outperforms the dual linear tmds in reducing the bi directional structural vibration however little research is available on response mitigation of the three dimensional vibration of fwts to control the three dimensional vibration of the fwts the present paper utilizes multiple tmds consisting of a 3d ptmd installed in the nacelle and dual linear pounding

platform are fed to the mass stiffness and damping matrices in eq 17 the generalized forces corresponding to aerodynamic loading are calculated using the approach in section 3 the buoyancy force and restoring stiffness is fed to q b u o and k r respectively different mooring cable models have been developed the lumped mass model in hall and goupee 2015 the finite element model in bae 2014 and the openmoor model which considers the current loading on cables in chen et al 2018 in this study the mooring cable model developed in hall and goupee 2015 is used during each time step the hydrodynamic loading is computed and the platform state is updated and fed to the dynamic linking library moordyn and then the mooring load q m o o r i n g is determined and fed back to solve the system response matlab codes have been developed to determine the response of the system at each time step 6 optimum design a numerical search approach is implemented to obtain the optimum design of 3d ptmd and 2ptmds the displacement rms is set as the optimum objective since displacement is the most important concern for wind turbines to optimize the design parameters of the 3d ptmd which is installed inside the nacelle to mitigate the responses of the tower simulations with different mass ratios has been carried out based on numerous simulations with mass ratio values ranging from 0 05 to 5 a mass ratio of 0 1 7774 4 k g is found to be appropriate for spar owt with a mass ratio of 0 1 the optimized frequency and damping ratio to minimize the rms response of the tower is found to be f o p t 0 97 and ζ 8 based on a numerical search approach similarly a numerical search method is used to obtain the optimum design of the 2ptmds the displacement rms in pitch direction is set as the optimum objective it should be noted that the 2ptmds stroke in y z plane is smaller than the considered gap distance and hence the pounding is zero in this plane therefore only the displacement rms in pitch direction r q 13 is set as the optimum objective the objective optimization function is defined as 37 j o p t m i n r q 13 preliminary simulations reveal that an increasing mass ratio can improve the mitigation effect which however can cause potential instabilities in the floating wind turbines based on numerous simulations with different mass ratio values a mass ratio of 2 is found to be more effective in mitigating the structural response without causing potential instability issues therefore a 2 mass ratio is used for 2ptmds with given mass ratio the rms displacement corresponding to different coefficient of restitution and pounding stiffness values are calculated and plotted in fig 8 the coefficient of restitution and pounding stiffness values that produces the minimum rms is selected as the optimum design considering the available space inside the spar and the reduction performance the coefficient of restitution is constrained in a range of 0 3 0 7 and the pounding stiffness is constrained in a range of 10 4 10 7 n m 1 5 it should be noted that different wind wave misalignment angles have a slight effect on the optimum design parameters thus as a general case a 30 wind wave misalignment angle is implemented when determining the optimum design values 7 results the fwt dynamic responses and the effectiveness of the 3d ptmd and the 2ptmds in reducing the responses of the fwt tower and platform is evaluated and presented in this section 7 1 model validation the established model is validated by comparing the natural frequencies of the established model with that determined using fast jonkman and buhl 2005 natural frequencies of the fwt is obtained via frequency analysis with respect to the free vibration response figure 9 illustrates the free vibration response and the power spectrum of the tower the power spectral density function of the tower top displacement response in fore aft and side side directions is shown in figure 9 b and d the natural frequencies of the tower can be determined to be 0 485 h z in fore aft and 0 493 h z in side side directions figure 10 and figure 11 show the spar response time history and corresponding spectral density functions in translational and rotational directions it should be noted that fore aft surge and pitch degrees of freedom are coupled with each other thus the natural frequency component of the system in surge direction 0 008 h z and fore aft direction 0 485 hz is included in the power spectrum response of pitch direction similarly side side sway and roll degrees of freedom are coupled with each other the identified natural frequencies of the established model are tabulated in table 2 and compared with the data presented in ref matha 2009 it can be found that the natural frequencies of the fwt can be calculated accurately by the established model thus the established model is valid and can be used for further application 7 2 responses of uncontrolled fwt the structural responses of the spar fwt are computed following the framework presented in fig 7 the mean wind velocity is 12 m s with a turbulent intensity of 10 and the significant wave height is 3 m and the wave period is 10 s four representative wind wave misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 are considered to demonstrate the fwt responses under misaligned wind wave loading fig 12 a and c show the tower top displacement in side side and fore aft directions the response spectrum of the tower in side side and fore aft directions is illustrated in fig 12 b and d the spar rotational frequency f 0 033 h z the wave frequency f 0 1 h z and the tower frequency f 0 49 h z is observable in the response spectrum of the tower in side side and fore aft directions one can find that the wave frequency is the dominant response frequency in the side side direction fig 12 b while the tower natural frequency is the dominant response frequency in the fore aft direction as portrayed in fig 12 d fig 13 a 13 c and 13 e show the spar platform response in surge sway and heave directions and the corresponding response spectrum are shown in fig 13 b 13 d and 13 f respectively a large drift in surge direction can be seen which is due to the constant component of the wind loading acting on the fwt the surge and sway dominant response frequencies f 0 008 h z can be observed in the response spectrum of the floater in surge and sway directions also the heave frequency f 0 032 h z is observable in the response spectrum of the floater in heave direction fig 14 a and c portray the rotational response of the platform in roll and pitch directions the response spectrum of the platform in roll and pitch directions is illustrated in fig 14 b and d similar to the response of the spar in surge direction the drift in pitch direction is caused by the constant component of the wind loading the in plane vibrations side side sway and roll are primarily caused by the misaligned wave loading the rotational frequency f 0 033 h z and the wave frequency f 0 1 h z are observable in both directions the natural frequency of the fwt in roll and pitch directions are the dominant frequencies 7 3 response mitigation of controlled wind turbine the performance of the 3d ptmd and 2ptmds in reducing the three dimensional vibrations of the fwt is presented in this subsection 7 3 1 tower response mitigation based on numerous simulations with mass ratio values ranging from 0 05 to 5 a mass ratio of 0 1 equivalent to 2 of the system mass excluding the floater mass is found to be appropriate for spar owt with a mass ratio of 0 1 the optimized frequency ratio and damping ratio to minimize the rms response of the tower is found to be f o p t 0 97 and ζ o p t 8 based on a numerical search approach fig 15 illustrates the relative displacement of the nacelle in fore aft direction with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misalignment angles it can be found that the vibrations of the tower can be effectively mitigated using the 3d ptmd quantitatively the rms response of nacelle can be reduced by around 32 using the 3d ptmd in fore aft direction fig 16 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 15 with a 30 misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum peak can be reduced by around 85 however the mitigation effect is minimal around the wave and pitch frequencies this is because the 3d ptmd is tuned to the natural frequency of the tower fig 17 shows the relative displacement of the tower in side side direction with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misalignment angles it can be seen that the 3d ptmd is ineffective in reducing the relative response of the tower in side side direction this is due to the reason that the frequency of the 3d ptmd is tuned to the natural frequency of the tower however the dominant frequency which is caused by wave loading is around 0 1 h z as shown in fig 18 also by comparing the tower top displacement of monopile owt represented in ref sun and jahangiri 2018 with the tower top displacement of the spar fwt presented in this study one can find that the tower top response for floating owt is 50 smaller than the tower top displacement for fixed owt 7 3 2 spar response mitigation in the present study dual linear pounding tmds are adopted and located at the swl to mitigate the response of the spar in roll and pitch directions for this purpose the tmd frequency is tuned to the natural frequency of the fwt in roll and pitch directions f 0 0338 h z according to ref lackner and rotea 2011 a suggested mass ratio of 2 is chosen for the 2ptmds and the corresponding optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio are f o p t 0 94 and ζ o p t 11 according to the results presented in section 6 the pounding stiffness is chosen as k p 10 4 n m 1 5 and coefficient of restitution is e 0 3 a gap distance of 3 m is considered for the 2ptmds considering the allowable space inside a real spar whose diameter is 9 m it is worthy to mention that the space constraints inside the spar is ignored in existing literature lackner and rotea 2011 where the tmd stroke is up to 20 m which is infeasible in real application fig 19 shows the roll response of the spar with and without the 2ptmds under four different misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 in fig 19 one can find that the roll response of the spar is minimal when wind and wave loadings are aligned also the response in roll direction increases as the wind wave misalignment angle increases through comparison it can be found that the 2ptmds reduce the rms response of the spar in roll direction by around 18 it should be noted that the tmd stroke in y z plane is smaller than the considered gap distance 3 m thus the pounding force is zero and the pounding tmd is equivalent as a regular tmd fig 20 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 19 with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum can be reduced by around 45 when using the 2ptmds fig 21 illustrates the pitch response of the spar with and without the 2ptmds under four different misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 it can be observed that varying the wind wave misalignment angle has slight effect on the magnitude of the response in pitch direction this is because wind loading is the dominant loading causing the spar pitch response in fig 21 significant mitigation is observed after 200 s because the 2ptmds need time to respond from the perspective of long term operation the true mitigation of the damper should be calculated after it is fully involved therefore the 2ptmds mitigation of the response is calculated to be around 50 fig 22 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 21 with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum can be reduced by around 30 when using the 2ptmds as mentioned before the 2ptmds frequency is tuned to the natural frequency of the pitch and roll response the 2ptmds has little reduction effect on fwt response in other directions surge sway and heave fig 23 illustrates the tmd stroke in x and y directions it can be seen that the stroke in x direction is larger than that in y direction because the pitch response is larger than roll response although the tmd stroke is relatively large in x direction it is much smaller than that of a regular linear tmds studied in ref lackner and rotea 2011 where the tmd stroke is up to 20 m as shown in fig 23 a with dashed line also it can be seen that the tmd stroke in y directions is smaller than the gap distance hence the pounding force in this direction is zero 8 conclusion in the present study a 3d ptmd and 2ptmds are adopted to mitigate three dimensional vibrations of a spar offshore floating wind turbine under misaligned wind wave loading a three dimensional pendulum tmd is adopted and installed in the nacelle to reduce the vibrations of the tower and dual linear pounding tmds are utilized and installed in the platform to reduce the response of the platform under misaligned wind and wave loadings an analytical model of the spar fwt coupled with the 3d ptmd and 2ptmds is established the optimum design parameters pounding stiffness and coefficient of restitution of the 2ptmds has been determined via a numerical search approach according to the results and discussions presented previously the following conclusions can be determined 1 an analytical model of a spar floating wind turbine is established and verified with fast due to the constant component of the wind loading a large drift occurs in out of plane responses of the fwt including the response in surge and pitch directions frequency spectrum of the tower reveals that the wave frequency is the dominant response frequency of the vibration of tower in side side direction in comparison the tower dominant response frequency in the fore aft direction is the tower natural frequency 2 the optimum design parameters of the dual linear pounding tuned mass damper are obtained via a numerical search method the proposed optimum design values are based on reducing rms response in platform roll and pitch directions the established model and the numerical search approach can be used to obtain the optimum design values for the 2ptmds under other different conditions 3 the tower top response in fore aft direction is 90 larger than that in side side direction hence the frequency of the 3 d ptmd is tuned based on the fore aft response dominant frequency which is the natural frequency of the tower it is found that such a 3d ptmd with a mass ratio of 0 1 can reduce the rms response of the tower in fore aft direction by around 32 in comparison the 3d ptmd has slight mitigation on the response in side side direction due to the mechanism that how the 3d ptmd is tuned from the perspective of reducing the resultant fatigue load of the tower this tuning approach is effective therefore tuning the frequency of the 3d ptmd based on the natural frequency of the tower is suggested for a spar type fwt 4 the dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers proposed in this study is able to reduce the three dimensional response of the spar in roll and pitch directions quantitatively the 2ptmds can effectively reduce the rms response of the spar by around 18 in roll direction and 50 in pitch direction moreover the 2ptmds are able to reduce the response spectrum of the spar by more than 45 in roll direction and 30 in pitch direction 5 due to limited space inside the platform it is important to reduce the required space of the tmd using the optimum design values obtained in this research the 2ptmds can reduce the response of the platform with a much smaller stroke in comparison with regular linear tmds which is valuable for practical application credit authorship contribution statement v jahangiri data curation formal analysis writing original draft c

21860,offshore floating wind turbines fwt subjected to misaligned wind and wave loadings experience extreme three dimensional vibrations which will increase the fatigue loadings on the structure and mooring cables the present study uses a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 3d ptmd and dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers 2ptmds to mitigate the three dimensional vibrations of a spar

oc3 hywind spar buoy wind turbine results show that a well designed 3d ptmd and 2ptmds can effectively reduce the three dimensional vibrations of the tower and the platform more importantly it is shown that the proposed 2ptmds experiences a smaller stroke which is 50 smaller than that of traditional linear tmds this is of significant value for practical applications keywords floating offshore wind turbines wind wave misalignment three dimensional vibration control pounding tuned mass dampers three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 1 introduction offshore wind energy production is becoming increasingly attractive due to the increasing demand for renewable energies and advantages including higher wind speed less noise constraints and less visual impacts in marine areas the need of larger wind turbines with larger capacities e g 10 or 20 mega watts renders offshore floating wind turbines receiving more research effort than their fixed bottom counterparts however due to severe environmental conditions in the marine area such as combined wind wave and current loadings the fwts suffer from excessive three dimensional vibrations which will cause potential instability issues and severe fatigue damage of the structure and mooring cables eventually the structural service life will be reduced and the maintenance cost will increase due to excessive vibrations in the fwts to reduce the excessive vibrations of offshore wind turbines owts structural vibration control methods which have been previously applied in controlling vibrations of civil structures is being studied to mitigate the vibrations of owts structural vibration control strategies fall into three main categories 1 passive control 2 active control and 3 semi active control numerous passive controlling methods have been studied for owts colwell and basu 2009 investigated the structural vibration reduction of the monopile fixed owt by implementing a tuned liquid column damper it was concluded that the tuned liquid column damper is able to mitigate the vibrations and increase the fatigue life of the tower dinh and basu 2015 installed multiple tmds in the blades tower and platform of spar type fwt to reduce in plane vibrations of the fwt it was found that multiple tmds are more effective in reducing the in plane vibrations of the fwt zuo et al 2017 suggested utilizing multiple tmds to reduce the tower vibrations of owts the authors concluded that using smaller multiple tmds can improve the robustness of the control system hemmati et al 2019 studied the vibration mitigation of owts using a combined tuned liquid column damper and tmd the authors found that the tmds are more effective in operational conditions while tuned liquid column damper has a better performance in the parked condition si et al 2014 used a passive tmd to reduce the vibrations of a spar type fwt using a numerical search approach the passive tmd was optimized and it was shown that the tmd is able to reduce the vibrations of the fwt hu et al 2018 studied the application of an inerter tmd to reduce the responses of a barge fwt it was found that the inerter tmd can reduce the motion of the fwt however a trade off between the nacelle fore aft displacements and the tmd stroke was observed sarkar and fitzgerald 2019 used a tmd inerter to reduce the vibrations of the tower in a spar type fwt the authors concluded that the tmd inerter is able to reduce the vibrations of the tower with a smaller stroke in comparison to the classical tmd however this study did not address the vibration reduction of the platform zhang et al 2014 studied the in plane vibration reduction of wind turbine blades using roller dampers it was found that the proposed roller dampers effectively improve the structural vibration of the wind turbine blades to enhance the damping effect li et al 2015 studied and compared the robustness of a pounding tmd with a regular tmd in controlling vibrations of a subsea jumper it was found that the pounding tmd is able to reduce the structural vibration of the subsea jumper when the tmd natural frequency was off tuned wang et al 2019 proposed an in plane pendulum pounding tuned mass damper pptmd to reduce the vibrations of lightly damped structures subjected to harmonic and seismic loadings it was shown that the pptmd could achieve considerable effectiveness in controlling the responses of the structure at the resonant frequency passive controlling methods are highly efficient within the desired frequency range however they might lose their capability due to existence of environmental and system variations to overcome the variations in owts brodersen et al 2016 employed an active tmd to reduce the nacelle vibrations of a fixed owt using the feedback from the relative velocity of the tmd and nacelle responses it was shown that the active tmd is more effective than the passive tmd in mitigating the structural responses fitzgerald et al 2018 demonstrated the effectiveness of an active tmd in improving the structural reliability of a wind turbine it was shown that active tmds are able to increase the reliability of the tower in another study fitzgerald et al fitzgerald and basu 2014 proposed a cable connected active tuned mass damper to reduce the blades in plane vibrations the authors found that the proposed new active control method considerably mitigates the in plane vibrations of flexible wind turbine blades in addition to active control semi active control is investigated to reduce the vibrations of structures considering system and environmental variations sun et al 2014a sun and nagarajaiah 2014 sonmez et al 2016 sun 2018a 2018b developed a semi active tmd with tunable damping ratio and natural frequency to mitigate the offshore wind turbine vibrations it was found that in the presence of damage the passive tmd loses part of its effectiveness due to the reason that tmd becomes off tuned while the semi active tmd can effectively reduce the structural response with damage presence park et al 2019 evaluated the impact of passive and semi active tuned mass dampers on reducing the responses of a monopile fixed bottom and a tension leg platform type fwt it was found that the semi active tmd results in more response reduction with a smaller stroke than the passive tmd sarkar and chakraborty 2019 used a semi active tmd with multiple magneto rheological tuned liquid column dampers to control the vibrations of wind turbine tower it was found that the semi active control scheme is effective and robust in reducing the vibrations of the tower while most of the aformentioned studies focus on reducing the out of plane vibrations owts suffer from significant in plane vibrations caused by vortex induced vibrations xu et al 2018 or misalignment between wind and wave loadings to address this problem lackner and rotea 2011 intorduced dual linear tmds to reduce the bi directional structural vibrations of both fixed and floating offshore wind turbines it was revealed that the dual linear tmds can improve the bi directional responses however the tmd installed in a fwt required a large stroke to be able to reduce the response of the fwt to overcome the limitations of dual linear tmds such as higher cost of installation larger mass and space on the basis of sun et al 2014b sun and jahangiri sun and jahangiri 2018 2019 jahangiri and sun 2019 developed a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper 3d ptmd to control the excessive bi directional vibrations of a fixed bottom monopile offshore wind turbine it was concluded that the proposed 3d ptmd outperforms the dual linear tmds in reducing the bi directional structural vibration however little research is available on response mitigation of the three dimensional vibration of fwts to control the three dimensional vibration of the fwts the present paper utilizes multiple tmds consisting of a 3d ptmd installed in the nacelle and dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers 2ptmds placed in the floater to control the three dimensional vibration of the fwts the application of the pounding mechanism is expected to limit the tmd stroke within the allowable space of the spar novelty of the present research is twofold first a new three dimensional model of the spar oc3 hywind buoy wind turbine with the 3d ptmd and 2tmds is established the aerodynamic loading wave loading and the mooring models are incorporated in the model second the optimal design parameters of the 2ptmds to minimize the spar rotational motion rms will be determined using a numerical search method with the optimized parameters the effectiveness of the 3d ptmd and the 2ptmds under misaligned wind wave loading is evaluated results show that the 3d ptmd with a mass ratio of 0 1 7774 4 kg can reduce the fwt tower vibrations by around 32 it is also found that the 2ptmds with a mass ratio of 2 161370 kg can reduce the spar rms response by around 18 in roll

depth can be determined based on the rigid motion of the spar from the motion of the spar at the system s center of gravity the spar is divided into n segments and the hydrodynamic force on each segment can be computed by eqs 27 to 29 based on the strip theory matlab codes have been developed to calculate and integrate the hydrodynamic loads based on the expressed equations 4 wind turbine

tower is located at an elevation of 87 6 m above the swl 5 coupling analysis fig 7 illustrates the flowchart for solving the response of the fwt system the system parameters of the blades tower and platform are fed to the mass stiffness and damping matrices in eq 17 the generalized forces corresponding to aerodynamic loading are calculated using the approach in section 3 the buoyancy force and restoring stiffness is fed to q b u o and k r respectively different mooring cable models have been developed the lumped mass model in hall and goupee 2015 the finite element model in bae 2014 and the openmoor model which considers the current loading on cables in chen et al 2018 in this study the mooring cable model developed in hall and goupee 2015 is used during each time step the hydrodynamic loading is computed and the platform state is updated and fed to the dynamic linking library moordyn and then the mooring load q m o o r i n g is determined and fed back to solve the system response matlab codes have been developed to determine the response of the system at each time step 6 optimum design a numerical search approach is implemented to obtain the optimum design of 3d ptmd and 2ptmds the displacement rms is set as the optimum objective since displacement is the most important concern for wind turbines to optimize the design parameters of the 3d ptmd which is installed inside the nacelle to mitigate the responses of the tower simulations with different mass ratios has been carried out based on numerous simulations with mass ratio values ranging from 0 05 to 5 a mass ratio of 0 1 7774 4 k g is found to be appropriate for spar owt with a mass ratio of 0 1 the optimized frequency and damping ratio to minimize the rms response of the tower is found to be f o p t 0 97 and ζ 8 based on a numerical search approach similarly a numerical search method is used to obtain the optimum design of the 2ptmds the displacement rms in pitch direction is set as the optimum objective it should be noted that the 2ptmds stroke in y z plane is smaller than the considered gap distance and hence the pounding is zero in this plane therefore only the displacement rms in pitch direction r q 13 is set as the optimum objective the objective optimization function is defined as 37 j o p t m i n r q 13 preliminary simulations reveal that an increasing mass ratio can improve the mitigation effect which however can cause potential instabilities in the floating wind turbines based on numerous simulations with different mass ratio values a mass ratio of 2 is found to be more effective in mitigating the structural response without causing potential instability issues therefore a 2 mass ratio is used for 2ptmds with given mass ratio the rms displacement corresponding to different coefficient of restitution and pounding stiffness values are calculated and plotted in fig 8 the coefficient of restitution and pounding stiffness values that produces the minimum rms is selected as the optimum design considering the available space inside the spar and the reduction performance the coefficient of restitution is constrained in a range of 0 3 0 7 and the pounding stiffness is constrained in a range of 10 4 10 7 n m 1 5 it should be noted that different wind wave misalignment angles have a slight effect on the optimum design parameters thus as a general case a 30 wind wave misalignment angle is implemented when determining the optimum design values 7 results the fwt dynamic responses and the effectiveness of the 3d ptmd and the 2ptmds in reducing the responses of the fwt tower and platform is evaluated and presented in this section 7 1 model validation the established model is validated by comparing the natural frequencies of the established model with that determined using fast jonkman and buhl 2005 natural frequencies of the fwt is obtained via frequency analysis with respect to the free vibration response figure 9 illustrates the free vibration response and the power spectrum of the tower the power spectral density function of the tower top displacement response in fore aft and side side directions is shown in figure 9 b and d the natural frequencies of the tower can be determined to be 0 485 h z in fore aft and 0 493 h z in side side directions figure 10 and figure 11 show the spar response time history and corresponding spectral density functions in translational and rotational directions it should be noted that fore aft surge and pitch degrees of freedom are coupled with each other thus the natural frequency component of the system in surge direction 0 008 h z and fore aft direction 0 485 hz is included in the power spectrum response of pitch direction similarly side side sway and roll degrees of freedom are coupled with each other the identified natural frequencies of the established model are tabulated in table 2 and compared with the data presented in ref matha 2009 it can be found that the natural frequencies of the fwt can be calculated accurately by the established model thus the established model is valid and can be used for further application 7 2 responses of uncontrolled fwt the structural responses of the spar fwt are computed following the framework presented in fig 7 the mean wind velocity is 12 m s with a turbulent intensity of 10 and the significant wave height is 3 m and the wave period is 10 s four representative wind wave misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 are considered to demonstrate the fwt responses under misaligned wind wave loading fig 12 a and c show the tower top displacement in side side and fore aft directions the response spectrum of the tower in side side and fore aft directions is illustrated in fig 12 b and d the spar rotational frequency f 0 033 h z the wave frequency f 0 1 h z and the tower frequency f 0 49 h z is observable in the response spectrum of the tower in side side and fore aft directions one can find that the wave frequency is the dominant response frequency in the side side direction fig 12 b while the tower natural frequency is the dominant response frequency in the fore aft direction as portrayed in fig 12 d fig 13 a 13 c and 13 e show the spar platform response in surge sway and heave directions and the corresponding response spectrum are shown in fig 13 b 13 d and 13 f respectively a large drift in surge direction can be seen which is due to the constant component of the wind loading acting on the fwt the surge and sway dominant response frequencies f 0 008 h z can be observed in the response spectrum of the floater in surge and sway directions also the heave frequency f 0 032 h z is observable in the response spectrum of the floater in heave direction fig 14 a and c portray the rotational response of the platform in roll and pitch directions the response spectrum of the platform in roll and pitch directions is illustrated in fig 14 b and d similar to the response of the spar in surge direction the drift in pitch direction is caused by the constant component of the wind loading the in plane vibrations side side sway and roll are primarily caused by the misaligned wave loading the rotational frequency f 0 033 h z and the wave frequency f 0 1 h z are observable in both directions the natural frequency of the fwt in roll and pitch directions are the dominant frequencies 7 3 response mitigation of controlled wind turbine the performance of the 3d ptmd and 2ptmds in reducing the three dimensional vibrations of the fwt is presented in this subsection 7 3 1 tower response mitigation based on numerous simulations with mass ratio values ranging from 0 05 to 5 a mass ratio of 0 1 equivalent to 2 of the system mass excluding the floater mass is found to be appropriate for spar owt with a mass ratio of 0 1 the optimized frequency ratio and damping ratio to minimize the rms response of the tower is found to be f o p t 0 97 and ζ o p t 8 based on a numerical search approach fig 15 illustrates the relative displacement of the nacelle in fore aft direction with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misalignment angles it can be found that the vibrations of the tower can be effectively mitigated using the 3d ptmd quantitatively the rms response of nacelle can be reduced by around 32 using the 3d ptmd in fore aft direction fig 16 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 15 with a 30 misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum peak can be reduced by around 85 however the mitigation effect is minimal around the wave and pitch frequencies this is because the 3d ptmd is tuned to the natural frequency of the tower fig 17 shows the relative displacement of the tower in side side direction with and without the 3d ptmd under four different misalignment angles it can be seen that the 3d ptmd is ineffective in reducing the relative response of the tower in side side direction this is due to the reason that the frequency of the 3d ptmd is tuned to the natural frequency of the tower however the dominant frequency which is caused by wave loading is around 0 1 h z as shown in fig 18 also by comparing the tower top displacement of monopile owt represented in ref sun and jahangiri 2018 with the tower top displacement of the spar fwt presented in this study one can find that the tower top response for floating owt is 50 smaller than the tower top displacement for fixed owt 7 3 2 spar response mitigation in the present study dual linear pounding tmds are adopted and located at the swl to mitigate the response of the spar in roll and pitch directions for this purpose the tmd frequency is tuned to the natural frequency of the fwt in roll and pitch directions f 0 0338 h z according to ref lackner and rotea 2011 a suggested mass ratio of 2 is chosen for the 2ptmds and the corresponding optimal frequency ratio and damping ratio are f o p t 0 94 and ζ o p t 11 according to the results presented in section 6 the pounding stiffness is chosen as k p 10 4 n m 1 5 and coefficient of restitution is e 0 3 a gap distance of 3 m is considered for the 2ptmds considering the allowable space inside a real spar whose diameter is 9 m it is worthy to mention that the space constraints inside the spar is ignored in existing literature lackner and rotea 2011 where the tmd stroke is up to 20 m which is infeasible in real application fig 19 shows the roll response of the spar with and without the 2ptmds under four different misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 in fig 19 one can find that the roll response of the spar is minimal when wind and wave loadings are aligned also the response in roll direction increases as the wind wave misalignment angle increases through comparison it can be found that the 2ptmds reduce the rms response of the spar in roll direction by around 18 it should be noted that the tmd stroke in y z plane is smaller than the considered gap distance 3 m thus the pounding force is zero and the pounding tmd is equivalent as a regular tmd fig 20 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 19 with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum can be reduced by around 45 when using the 2ptmds fig 21 illustrates the pitch response of the spar with and without the 2ptmds under four different misalignment angles 0 30 60 and 90 it can be observed that varying the wind wave misalignment angle has slight effect on the magnitude of the response in pitch direction this is because wind loading is the dominant loading causing the spar pitch response in fig 21 significant mitigation is observed after 200 s because the 2ptmds need time to respond from the perspective of long term operation the true mitigation of the damper should be calculated after it is fully involved therefore the 2ptmds mitigation of the response is calculated to be around 50 fig 22 illustrates the response spectrum of the data presented in fig 21 with a 30 wind wave misalignment angle it can be found that the response spectrum can be reduced by around 30 when using the 2ptmds as mentioned before the 2ptmds frequency is tuned to the natural frequency of the pitch and roll response the 2ptmds has little reduction effect on fwt response in other directions surge sway and heave fig 23 illustrates the tmd stroke in x and y directions it can be seen that the stroke in x direction is larger than that in y direction because the pitch response is larger than roll response although the tmd stroke is relatively large in x direction it is much smaller than that of a regular linear tmds studied in ref lackner and rotea 2011 where the tmd stroke is up to 20 m as shown in fig 23 a with dashed line also it can be seen that the tmd stroke in y directions is smaller than the gap distance hence the pounding force in this direction is zero 8 conclusion in the present study a 3d ptmd and 2ptmds are adopted to mitigate three dimensional vibrations of a spar offshore floating wind turbine under misaligned wind wave loading a three dimensional pendulum tmd is adopted and installed in the nacelle to reduce the vibrations of the tower and dual linear pounding tmds are utilized and installed in the platform to reduce the response of the platform under misaligned wind and wave loadings an analytical model of the spar fwt coupled with the 3d ptmd and 2ptmds is established the optimum design parameters pounding stiffness and coefficient of restitution of the 2ptmds has been determined via a numerical search approach according to the results and discussions presented previously the following conclusions can be determined 1 an analytical model of a spar floating wind turbine is established and verified with fast due to the constant component of the wind loading a large drift occurs in out of plane responses of the fwt including the response in surge and pitch directions frequency spectrum of the tower reveals that the wave frequency is the dominant response frequency of the vibration of tower in side side direction in comparison the tower dominant response frequency in the fore aft direction is the tower natural frequency 2 the optimum design parameters of the dual linear pounding tuned mass damper are obtained via a numerical search method the proposed optimum design values are based on reducing rms response in platform roll and pitch directions the established model and the numerical search approach can be used to obtain the optimum design values for the 2ptmds under other different conditions 3 the tower top response in fore aft direction is 90 larger than that in side side direction hence the frequency of the 3 d ptmd is tuned based on the fore aft response dominant frequency which is the natural frequency of the tower it is found that such a 3d ptmd with a mass ratio of 0 1 can reduce the rms response of the tower in fore aft direction by around 32 in comparison the 3d ptmd has slight mitigation on the response in side side direction due to the mechanism that how the 3d ptmd is tuned from the perspective of reducing the resultant fatigue load of the tower this tuning approach is effective therefore tuning the frequency of the 3d ptmd based on the natural frequency of the tower is suggested for a spar type fwt 4 the dual linear pounding tuned mass dampers proposed in this study is able to reduce the three dimensional response of the spar in roll and pitch directions quantitatively the 2ptmds can effectively reduce the rms response of the spar by around 18 in roll direction and 50 in pitch direction moreover the 2ptmds are able to reduce the response spectrum of the spar by more than 45 in roll direction and 30 in pitch direction 5 due to limited space inside the platform it is important to reduce the required space of the tmd using the optimum design values obtained in this research the 2ptmds can reduce the response of the platform with a much smaller stroke in comparison with regular linear tmds which is valuable for practical application credit authorship contribution statement v jahangiri data curation formal analysis writing original draft c

21861,inflow turbulence is the primary source of propeller unsteady forces especially for broadband components in this work the inflow turbulence and unsteady force on a 10 blade propeller are numerically studied on the basis of large eddy simulation to provide insights into the generation mechanism of this type of excitation we use turbulence grid and fourier synthesis method to produce incoming turbulence with spatial flow structure and temporal fluctuation in simulation the predicted thrust spectrum from this numerical method achieves better measurement consistency than that obtained from theoretical calculation the turbulence spectra and velocity distribution reveal intrinsic broadband characteristics and spatial inhomogeneity of grid induced inflow the transient velocity field and time dependent thrusts on adjacent blades are cross contrasted to illuminate the generation process of broadband humps in the unsteady force spectra additionally the broadband unsteady forces are simultaneously decomposed into four frequency bands to reveal the corresponding excitation sources for various spectral components and into nine radial blade strips to explore the contribution rates of fluctuating loading at various radial positions the research is beneficial for comprehensive understanding on turbulence induced exciting force and practical engineering design of noise reduced propellers keywords unsteady force large eddy simulation turbulence propeller broadband 1 introduction unsteady forces on propellers caused by turbulence ingestion are the primary source of underwater broadband radiated noise at low frequency lf these forces usually consist of periodic and broadband components blake 2017 the narrowband periodic components at blade passing frequency bpf and its harmonics are derived from non uniform inflow pinkus et al 1963 bennaya et al 2013 caused by ship appendages such as rudder and fairwater the model experiments operated in idealized wake screens valentine and kader 1977 jessup 1990 minniti et al 2015 have systemically researched the interaction between blades and cyclic inflow numerous programs have been developed to predict these periodic forces and their accuracy has been fully evaluated zawadzki et al 1997 fuhs 2005 however the broadband force components were found spreading over a wide frequency band ranging from several to several hundred hertz with humps centered at bpfs sevik 1974 thompson 1978 these components are generally embedded by enormous energy and would exert great impact to propeller shaft vibration and radiated noise anderson et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b therefore the mechanism of broadband propeller force has attracted considerable interest in recent decades factors such as boundary layer turbulence at duct walls random variations of tip vortex strength or vortex shedding from blade trailing edges te were first regarded as the major sources of broadband force and noise sevik 1968 however as more measurements and observations have been conducted high frequency components were found to be induced by vortex shedding whereas the lf ones were caused by the interaction of inflow turbulence with propeller blades blake 1975 jiang et al 1991 on this basis many investigators employed hydrofoil lift theory and turbulence statistics to predict and analyze the broadband force components the simplified correlation approach revealed that the spectrum of broadband thrust depends on the turbulence level integral scale of turbulence and geometrical dimension of rotor sevik 1974 jiang et al 1991 incorporated propeller rotational effects with the modified velocity correlation and proposed a new correlation approach the blade rate humps were calculated analytically in this approach and their amplitudes and bandwidths were proportional to the turbulence scale other follow up prediction methods used asymptotic lift relationships for large blade numbers martinez 1996a b or a thin foil theory based model lysak 2001 in these theories the magnitudes of broadband humps enlarge with the increment of blade numbers rotating speed and turbulence scale an analytical prediction on the turbulence ingestion rotor unsteady force has been recently formulated to include correlations among three axial components and spatially inhomogeneous turbulence anderson et al 2014 2015 the results revealed that the radial forces remain highly correlated over large subtended angles about the rotation axis and the coherence between axial and radial forces should not be ignored for spatially inhomogeneous turbulent inflow although many experimental investigations involved in turbulence measurement have been conducted scharpf and miller 1995 wojno et al 2002a b minniti et al 2015 the high resolution full field measurement technique is still deficient to clearly characterize the turbulent inflow and the establishment of analytical functions for complex propeller geometry is challenging thereupon the applicability and accuracy of analytical methods are limited in that some theoretical hypothesis and empirical simplification must be introduced with the progress of numerical techniques and computer performance the unsteady response of propellers in complicated inflow conditions should be studied using numerical methods urans has been performed to calculate propeller transient forces in various conditions krasilnikov et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 by contrast rans models based on time average equations are incapable of capturing the transient vortex structure and time dependent fluctuation the results of a urans les hybrid method have presented the unsteady flow structures at the stern and partial broadband force around blade rate frequency abbas et al 2015 zhang and rajeev 2019 other studies attempted to predict the vortex blade interaction and fluctuating forces in multiple operation modes by using les jang and mahesh 2010 mahesh et al 2010 jang et al 2012 keller et al 2017 the acquired power spectrum density psd of the unsteady thrust and torque were both broadband in the large frequency range although the ideal method to solve the fluctuation and vortex in all frequencies is dns the computer cost is huge and the lf components are dominated for unsteady forces in addition given that the les method is more theoretically accurate in calculating the boundary layer flow than hybrid models it would be suitable for unsteady force prediction in this problem this work aims to numerically predict the turbulence induced forces on a propeller and investigate the correlation between the incoming turbulence and the broadband unsteady force the finite volume method with les model has been used to solve the vortex and time dependent flow field that induce the unsteady forces in a concerned frequency range the turbulence generating grid and fourier synthesis method on inlet condition were combined to produce inflow turbulence with temporal fluctuation and spatial coherent structure the accuracy of simulation method was verified with test and theoretical values first then the streamwise evolution of grid turbulence spectrum and radial disparity of incoming flow were emphatically discussed the correspondence analysis on time dependent thrust and instantaneous velocity field was conducted to reveal the generation of blade rate humps from the point of flow mechanism finally the signal processing and flow analysis were adopted to reveal the interaction between the spatially inhomogeneous inflow and the consequent loading distribution in radical direction 2 geometric and numerical method 2 1 propeller model the investigated propeller shown in fig l has ten equally spaced blades with constant chord length the blades are designed with an aspect ratio of 3 1 and without rake or sweep the main geometric dimensions are listed in table 1 the blade angles ba range from 63 3 at hub to 28 9 at tip the maximum thickness of the blade section is located at 45 chord length from the leading edge le this propeller is a benchmark model for many mechanism researches scharpf and mueller 1995 martinez 1996a b wojno et al 2002 lynch et al 2005 anderson 2015 because of its simple and representative structure the 2d response function is practicable to be applied in the analytical prediction methods such as spectrum blake 2017 and correlation approaches jiang et al 1991 wojno et al 2002a b 2 2 numerical schemes the large eddy simulation method was adopted to solve the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in commercial finite volume solver fluent 17 0 the unsteady mass and momentum equation operated by spatial filter function are expressed as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x i 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j τ i j x j where u i and p denote the filtered velocity components and pressure respectively τ ij represents subgrid scale sgs stress which reflects the momentum transport between small scale fluctuation and resolved scale vortex the sgs stress is an additional term required to be solved to close the governing equation it is commonly modeled from boussinesq hypothesis hinze 1975 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where μ t is the sgs turbulent viscosity and s ij is the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale in this work the sgs eddy viscosity was calculated using the smagorinsky lilly model smagorinsky 1963 where the eddy viscosity is modeled with mixing length hypothesis the equations for μ t are written as follows 5 μ t ρ l s 2 2 s i j s i j l s min κ d c s δ δ v 1 3 where l s is the mixing length for sgs κ is the von karman constant d is the distance to the closest wall and v 1 3 represents the local grid scale computed from the volume of computational cell the smagorinsky constant c w was taken as 0 1 to yield optimal results for a wide range of flows the central differencing scheme with an accuracy equivalent to second order was employed for the diffusion term the convection term was discrete in the bounded central differencing scheme where the non physical oscillation can be effectively avoided 2 3 computational domain and boundary conditions to validate the simulation with the experimental results the computational domain was established in accordance with the water tunnel in sevik s 1974 paper see fig 2 the propeller was located 20 mesh sizes c downstream of a grid to guarantee that the turbulence reaching the propeller is fully developed the grid with a mesh size of 152 4 mm not only increases the turbulence intensity but also changes the vortex scale that dominates the turbulent kinetic energy transport mikhailova et al 2001 naudascher and farrel 1970 the inlet was 4c upstream of the grid due to limited computing resources the outlet was set 10c downstream of the rotor to eliminate the attenuation effect of the numerical boundary on flow fluctuation around the rotor under the boundary condition of velocity inlet and outflow outlet the perturbations should be added into the inlet mean velocity the precursor simulation rhie and chow 1983 and kondo et al 1997 and synthesis methods maruyama et al 1999 xie and castro 2008 have been successively proposed and employed in many problems to generate random instantaneous velocity with a pre defined temporal and spatial correlation in les leonard 1992 erlebacher et al 1992 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in this study we used spectral synthesis kraichnan 1970 smirov et al 2001 for inlet perturbation where the fluctuating velocity components were extracted from the divergence free vector field synthesized by summation of fourier harmonics the transient inlet velocity consists of the following fourier series 6 v i x t 2 n n 1 n p i n cos k j n x j ω n t q j n sin k j n x j ω n t 7 x j x j l t t τ c l τ k j n k j n c c j where l and τ are the length and time scales of the turbulence respectively p i n and q i n conform to a normal distribution to control the fraction of components with corresponding wave number k j n and frequency ω n and c j is the coefficient of the diagonalizable velocity correlation tensor this method can be used to complement the turbulence generating grid to produce a highly authentic turbulence with temporal fluctuation and spatial coherent structure 2 4 computational mesh and unsteady simulation settings the whole domain was divided with hexahedral structured meshes fig 3 the meshes of rotating domain were generated through periodic replication of a single channel h type blocks were used at blade edges and o type block was made to refine the meshes of the blade surface boundary layer the non dimensional distance y was within 1 3 on blade surfaces indicating that the first layer meshes were controlled in a viscous layer fig 3 b demonstrates the surface mesh on single blade segmented in the blade strips corresponding to fig 1 with regard to the meshes around turbulence generating grids the y type topology was used for cylindrical junction the rotation speed ω of propeller was 18 43 rps the advance velocity u i e the mean inlet velocity was set as 4 57 and 4 38 m s corresponding to the advance ratios of 1 22 and 1 17 designed condition respectively the simulation was started from the steady result solved by k ω sst the fluctuating data were recorded after 0 66 s 20c u which is the time point when the vortex structure generated by the grid passed through the rotor to guarantee enough temporal resolution the unsteady data were sampled every time step the mesh independence test on hydrodynamic performance was conducted with three different cell numbers according to cfl criterion for convergence the time step sizes in these cases were set as 3 0144 10 4 1 5072 10 4 and 7 3564 10 5 namely the time in which the propeller rotates 2 1 and 0 5 respectively the time averaged thrust coefficient in the designed condition based on a propeller disc area sevik 1974 was calculated using eq 8 the unsteady thrust at the main blade passing frequency 1bpf and second blade passing frequency 2bpf in j 1 22 were computed from fast fourier transform fft the amplitudes were converted into db units using eq 9 due to the different orders of magnitude for various frequency components 8 c t t n 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 9 t d b 20 log 10 t n where u is the advance velocity and πr 2 equals to the area of propeller disc t n represents thrust in terms of newton and t db represents thrust in decibel db the results in table 2 show that the medium and fine meshes have less than 1 discrepancy with respect to the time averaged thrust coefficient whereas the coarse mesh underestimates the thrust in addition the static thrust coefficient in these two cases are close to the designed value 0 183 published by sevik 1974 to have a clear picture on flow characteristics the time averaged axial velocity from the location near the hub 0 25r to the tip 1r is shown in fig 4 the coarse mesh has a relatively high axial velocity especially beyond 0 7r this finding qualitatively illustrates that the undervaluation of blade thrust in coarse mesh is mainly derived from the small attack angles in this region the distribution of medium mesh solution is quite close to the fine mesh except a slight diminution around 0 6r with regard to the unsteady performance at j 1 22 unless stated the results are for j 1 22 the amplitude of fluctuating thrusts at 1bpf and 2bpf denoted as t1bpf and t2bpf in table 2 in db unit from eq 9 in coarse mesh are higher than those in the medium and fine meshes the different wake appearances shown in fig 5 demonstrate that the mesh refinement leads to complicated vortex structures near the te of blades however the steady and unsteady performance reveals that the impact of these differences on the propeller loading was limited considering the high computational cost for refine mesh the medium one was selected as the final mesh for further research in the following sections the final computation time and sampling length were extended to 3 53 s corresponding to the time in which the propeller rotates 64 revolutions for a sufficient resolution in the frequency domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 broadband extraction algorithm and experiment validation the original thrust spectrum and the processed results are depicted in the semi logarithmic diagram in fig 6 the amplitude was converted into db units from eq 9 the frequency range concerned here covers the first three blade passing frequencies the original time history of unsteady force was divided into segments with 1 3 overlap a hann window was applied before transforming each segment into the frequency domain by fft the thrust spectra were then averaged over all segments this procedure is similar to that used by kumar and mahesh 2017 the original thrust spectrum shows obvious broadband characteristics over the entire frequency range with relatively significant discrete components appearing at each bpf since most spectral peaks are adjacent both in frequency and amplitude the upper boundary of the thrust spectrum is visually inclined to show a broadband pattern to avoid the underestimation on the actual magnitude of the fluctuation loading this paper used a two step algorithm to extract the continuous broadband spectrum first the local maxima of original spectra were calculated to obtain an upper estimation of the fluctuating amplitude then an adjacent averaged weighting approach was utilized as shown in eq 10 10 g i j 1 n w j f j i n 2 n w j 1 j i 1 n 1 2 2 where f i and g i are the ith input and output data points respectively n represents the number of points in the window and w j is a quadratic weight factor this algorithm can properly reflect the fluctuating amplitude of the unsteady force and eliminate the random components fig 6 indicates that the entire level of calculated spectrum is in encouraging agreement with the experimental results in literature jiang et al 1991 especially in frequency below 100 hz and above 450 hz the humps centered at various bpfs have been calculated clearly therefore the accuracy of the unsteady simulation results over the concerned frequency range is basically validated 3 2 characteristics of incoming turbulence the turbulence characteristic downstream the turbulence generate grid is significantly different from that of the uniform incoming flow in this section the flow upstream the rotor from les is first analyzed fig 7 shows a graphical representation of the monitor points the velocity ranging from x 152 4 mm to x 25 4 mm at radial locations of 0 3r and 0 9r were sampled since this grid turbulence meet the weak turbulence criterion urms u 0 1 taylor s hypothesis pope 2000 was used to calculate the streamwise wave number spectrum from the temporal auto spectral density of monitored turbulent velocity this transformation was implemented based on the convection velocity wojno et al 2002a as follows 11 k 1 2 π f u 12 φ k 1 φ u u f δ 2 π f k 1 u where k 1 is streamwise wave number and δ is dirac delta function in fig 8 the acquired wave number spectra at 0 3r and 0 9r in front of the propeller disc are compared with theoretical spectrum in the manner of liepmann hinze 1975 the streamwise developments of the axial velocity spectra are shown in fig 9 the same extraction algorithm described in section 3 1 has been applied here the pressure fluctuation close to the blade le and that far upstream the propeller x 160 mm at radial location of 0 8r were also sampled all these monitors are in the same axial plane in addition to the temporal sampling of turbulence information at fixed points fig 10 depicts the spatial sampling of axial velocity on the spiral line at locations of 0 3r and 0 9r the pitches of these two spiral lines are equal to those of blade strips at the corresponding radial location and they go through five cycles as shown by the tracks illustrated in the frame at the top corner of fig 10 these spatial samples were converted to equivalent spectra in the rotating frame using eqs 13 and 14 13 t n x n x 1 u 14 u ω n 1 n u t n e i ω n where x n is the axial location of the nth sampling point u t n represents the axial velocity at the nth sampling point and n is the sampling number along this spiral line on the basis of taylor s hypothesis for fully developed turbulence this approach is theoretically equivalent to the turbulence spectrum measured by a rotating sensor similar to the study of wojno et al 2002 these equivalent turbulence spectra describe the velocity variations impacting one blade in a certain time period according to the relation between frequency f and streamwise wave number k in eq 11 the lf components in the temporal spectra are corresponding to the large scale axial vortex whereas the high frequency components represent the small ones 1 since the wave number spectra share a parallel trend with theoretical one especially in the low wave number region the accuracy of inflow field in this simulation method is basically confirmed the deviation in amplitude would be attributed to the incompletely isotropic turbulence in the vicinity of propeller for instance the large scale vortex is more likely to induce by the solid boundary making the spectrum of 0 3r exceed the theoretical one in low wave number region more prominently all the turbulence spectra in figs 8 and 9 show a tendency of rapid decaying from low to high which reveals that the fluctuations induced by large scale vortex play a dominant role in turbulence downstream of the grid 2 at radial location of 0 9r the high frequency velocity fluctuations gradually decrease from v9 8 to v9 5 which indicates the dissipation from small size eddies in the streamwise development of turbulence however the flow fields adjacent to the rotor are excited by the propeller rotation and the blade rate humps emerge as it gets closer to propeller i e from v9 4 to v9 1 these bpf components become more significant and the high frequency fluctuations are synchronously enhanced 3 fig 9 b shows that the streamwise evolution of velocity spectra near the hub becomes more complicated the high frequency fluctuations increase from v3 8 to v3 6 and then decrease from v3 5 to v3 3 behind the tip of hub cap to the range of 1 5l upstream the propeller a slight hump emerges at 1bpf fig 11 shows that v3 8 v3 7 and v3 6 are successively close to the low velocity region near the stagnation point thus the flow perturbations are enhanced a high velocity region is observed downstream of the stagnant point the flow here is rectified by the guidance of the hub cap to suppress the high frequency fluctuation from v3 5 to v3 3 in general the difference between the shapes of the velocity spectra in stationary reference frames fig 9 and the equivalent turbulence spectra in the rotating reference frames fig 10 are similar to the previous measurement wojno et al 2002a b lynch et al 2005 the equivalent velocity spectra on the hypothetical inflow track at 0 9r differ from those at 0 3r in the overall level and decay trend their correlation with unsteady thrust will be discussed in section 3 3 from the perspective of time averaged velocity field shown in fig 11 the circumferential distribution is observed to get more irregular from hub to the blade periphery the contrastive analysis on the unsteady loading response of typical blade strips near hub and blade periphery will be given in section 3 4 the other aspects of pressure fluctuation such as the time histories and psd are presented in fig 12 the time dependent pressures at these two points have approximately synchronous variation however p2 contains more high frequency fluctuation components the absolute values of pressure close to the propeller increase due to the energy input from the rotating blade the flow field around propeller is consequentially disturbed by the blades sweeping periodically thus the discrete 1bpf component is prominent in the area adjacent to the propeller whereas no obvious discrete tones appear in the far upstream position similar to taylor s hypothesis for velocity spectrum mentioned above the spatial pressure spectrum is also equivalent to the temporal spectrum observed at a fix point the slopes close to theoretical f 5 3 scaling in these spectra indicate that the resolved scales in the present case are asymptotic to inertial subrange ji et al 2015 and the mesh is sufficiently fine to solve the major proportion of the energy 3 3 generation of the blade rate humps in the thrust spectra the thrusts on various numbers of blades in this propeller were counted in the time domain and converted into spectra fig 13 to effectively reveal the generation mechanism of the broadband bumps around 1bpf and its harmonics discovered in section 3 1 no blade rate humps appear for single blade thrust and the spectrum shows a continuous decaying pattern to high frequency the slope of this curve is almost constant in this mono logarithmic coordinate which reveals a potential logarithmic decay law for the unsteady thrust spectrum it is noted that the thrust spectrum for single blade shows similar broadband pattern to the modified grid generated turbulence measured by lynch et al 2005 and the equivalence of turbulence spectra in fig 10 especially that of 0 9r this consistency in spectrum indicates the direct correlation between inflow turbulence and unsteady loading when summing up the thrust spectra of multiple blades the humps at bpfs emerge and become more pronounced as the examined blade numbers increase meanwhile the slopes of spectra in the lf increase in view of the flow field fig 14 shows the instantaneous velocity on the axial and circumferential planes around two adjacent blades at some typical moments accompanied by the time history of thrust on these two blades in the corresponding time periods the six images were divided into two groups to illustrate the generation of various bpf components the intra group intervals are δt1 2 71 ms and δt2 1 35 ms equivalent to the time for blades rotating over 18 and 9 respectively the circumferential cross sections were selected at 0 9r on the basis of the prior assumption that the flow field near the blade periphery excites the majority of entire loading fluctuation and the axial plane was located 100 mm upstream the propeller the flow angle distribution surrounding the two blades on the 0 9r surface is demonstrated in the blade to blade view to compare with the ba equal to 24 7 at 0 9r in fig 15 fig 14 shows that the instantaneous inflow strongly exhibits circumferential uniformity for t1 5 21975 s the le of blade α is located in the low speed region and is about to penetrate into the high speed region the flow angle before le of blade α is generally smaller than ba in fig 15 a therefore the loading on blade α in fig 14 g shows a local maximum at this moment as time goes by the flow structures are transported by convection velocity u the entire blade α is immersed in the high speed zone for t1 δt1 the flow angle is then approximated to ba in fig 15 b the loading on blade α diminishes for the same time as blade β moves out of the high speed zone the flow angle around blade β decreases relative to that in fig 14 a and its loading increases to a further moment for t1 2δt1 blade α is still in the sphere of the high speed zone with larger circumferential scale than the blade spacing hence the flow angle around blade α in fig 15 c nearly maintains the same value as that in fig 15 b the thrust remains at a relatively low level while blade β is predominantly affected by the same low speed zone as the circumstance for blade α at t1 a similar peak in blade β thrust emerges for this moment the flow angles around blade β share a similar distribution as that of blade α in fig 15 a according to the above discussion the unimodal sequence of each blade thrust contributed to the bimodal sequence in the resultant thrust where the time interval is 2δt1 corresponding to the frequency of 1bpf on the other hand blade α at t1 2δt1 and blade β at t1 are in the high speed zones with various values due to the circumferentially inhomogeneous incoming flow this condition is verified by the different flow angle distribution in the corresponding moments in fig 15 consequently the two peaks in resultant force for t1 and t1 2δt1 are nonequivalent this occurrence would account for the broadband components around 1bpf namely the blade rate humps in general the circumferentially inhomogeneous inflow directly induces the 1bpf components another group of flow distribution was selected from t2 5 25472 s to t2 2δt2 in fig 14 d f fig 14 g demonstrates that a secondary maximum exist on the thrust of blade α for t2 2δt2 meanwhile the thrust on blade β only increases monotonically from t2 δt2 to t2 2δt2 this phenomenon results in the broadband humps around 2bpf in the resultant thrust on the perspective of flow mechanism the velocity streamline on the axial plane and velocity distribution on circumferential cross section show that the scales of instantaneous vortex are more irregular during this time period and the circumferential inhomogeneity is more severe than the one discussed in fig 14 a c hence the blade loading is affected by the inflow variation in a more complicated way for instance the le of blade α penetrates exactly into the low speed region in fig 14 d and the flow angle in fig 15 d is generally smaller than the ba consequently the primary peak appears for t2 as blade α sweeps out of the low speed region the attack angle increases making the blade loading decrease the low speed region is synchronously transported downstream by u the local high speed detour flow around the te of blade α is distorted by the low speed region in fig 14 f the le of blade α is still in the influence scope of the low speed region from fig 14 f as a result the equivalent flow angle at t2 2δt2 is smaller than that at t2 δt2 thereby slightly improving the loading on blade α this phenomenon reflects that the harmonic components are derived from the local flow structure in the incoming flow and the circumferentially multimodal distribution of velocity in addition the load fluctuation during this period is smaller on magnitude order due to the lower circumferential gradient magnitude of the incoming velocity than that from t1 to t1 2δt1 3 4 unsteady thrust properties at the blade hub and tip region apart from the analysis on unsteady loading blade by blade the following sections investigate the radial distribution of unsteady loading by calculating time dependent forces acting on various blade strips to uncover the different responses for the blade strips at various radial locations the unsteady thrust on blade strips at two typical blade strips s 3 and s 9 as highlighted in fig 1 b are analyzed first due to its broadband characteristics the time dependent force was decomposed into components of four frequency bands namely lf below 94 4 hz fh 94 4 283 2 hz sh 283 2 472 5 hz and th above 472 5 hz whose ranges covered the humps at different bpfs the time frequency analysis based on short time fourier transform stft was applied on the whole thrust signal in figs 16 d and 17 d the hamming window was adopted to divide data into small sections and reduce leakage in figs 16 e and 17 e the root mean squared error rmse of local pressure was introduced to estimate the magnitude of pressure fluctuations around the blades as defined by eq 14 15 r m s e p n 1 n p x t n p x t 2 n where n is the number of time steps p x t n is the static pressure in location x at the nth time step and p x t is the time average static pressure the instantaneous velocity streamlines are concurrently depicted in figs 16 f and 17 f to trace the source of different pressure distribution figs 16 and 17 show that the broadband components of lf are the dominant parts for both blade strips in the term of magnitude the time dependent thrust of fh in fig 16 b embodies the feature of amplitude modulated wave as the intervals between the peaks are fixed while the amplitudes vary over time however fig 17 b manifests that the components above 94 4 hz are more disorganized in the time domain and the force fluctuations in fh and sh are approximately in the same magnitude the stft results indicate that the components above 94 4 hz are generally concentrated around each bpf with random frequency deviation in the entire time periods for s 9 by contrast the components of s 3 spread over a wide frequency range and no apparent blade rate humps are observed fig 16 e reveals that the pressure fluctuation around s 9 is generally concentrated at blade le the pressure distributions in this region are sensitive to the fluctuation of the incoming flow because of the impact effect and occurrence of circumfluence at le the streamlines in fig 16 f indicate that the fluid flowing past the two surfaces of the blades always converge at te thereby making the local velocity finite hence the kutta condition is satisfied xu 1998 and the blade strip is capable of producing lift force however both the pressure fluctuation at le and te are dramatic for s 3 and the latter is more prominent given that the advance coefficient j 1 22 of the unsteady case exceeds the design value the attack angles are generally closer to the negative in addition the thickness of blade root should be designed above the specific value due to the strength requirement in manufacturing this strategy increases the stall angle of attack and the gradient of suction surface for the blade strips here then the flow separation emerges and the streamlines passing s 3 can t meet at te accordingly the kutta condition is not necessarily satisfied and no lift force is produced from fig 17 f it can be concluded that the majority of pressure fluctuation at te is generally due to the unstable shedding vortices induced by the boundary layer separation from the rear part of suction surface 3 5 distribution of unsteady forces in the radial direction as discussed in section 3 4 the fluctuating thrusts on s 3 and s 9 are different the whole propeller was then divided into blade strips s 3 to s 9 centered at r n with a fixed span length r 10 to fully study the unsteady loading distribution in the radial direction the three axial force spectra of different blade strips are separately shown in fig 18 without regard to the potential radial correlation of fluctuating loading the radial force was decomposed into two orthogonal directions namely horizontal and vertical moreover the unsteady energy proportion of thrust ept and resultant radial force epr of various blade strips in the four frequency bands introduced in section 3 4 were calculated quantitatively as follows 16 e p t i j f i min f i max p s d t h r u s t j d f j r o o t t i p f i min f i max p s d t h r u s t j d f 17 e p r i j f i min f i max p s d z j p s d y j d f j r o o t t i p f i min f i max p s d z j p s d y j d f where indexes i and j denote the frequency segment and blade strips respectively psd thrust psd z and psd y are power spectral density of three axial forces and f imin and f imax represent the upper and lower boundaries of each frequency band respectively the energy proportion statistics are illustrated in fig 19 fig 18 shows that the forces in the three directions assume a generally similar spectral distribution for all the strips the energy proportions in fig 19 a illustrate that the majority of thrust fluctuating is imposed on s 8 and especially s 9 hence the prior assumption presented in section 3 3 is validated here by the comparative analysis between the spectra in fig 18 and distribution in fig 19 some notable trends are singled out below 1 the magnitudes of the fluctuating horizontal and vertical forces in the blade strip are almost equal the magnitude of the unsteady thrust surpasses the lateral forces near the blade periphery 2 similar to fig 18 where the blade rate humps become pronounced from hub to blade periphery the portion of dominant fluctuating components fh for all force and lf for thrust in fig 19 also enhance as the radius increases however the lf component of lateral fluctuation is equally distributed on each blade strip 3 the broadband humps in the unsteady force spectra of blade strips near the hub are apparent especially for s 3 and s 4 this feature is quantitatively reflected in the energy proportion of fig 19 where peak fractions can be observed for the fluctuating force of blade strips near hub s 3 s 4 and s 5 in high frequency ranges fh sh and th as discussed in section 3 4 not all the blade strips in this propeller were lift body at advance coefficient of 1 22 the spectra of s 3 and s 4 represent the resistance fluctuation and the magnitudes of three axial fluctuating forces for these blade sections are in close proximity this finding reflects that the turbulence near the hub is nearly isotropic in three directions as the radius further increases the kutta condition is satisfied and the lifts are converted into thrust meanwhile the magnitude disparity between thrust and lateral forces enlarges in the whole frequency band which indicates that the anisotropy of the turbulence is enhanced when the location draw near to the blade periphery according to the analysis in section 3 3 the generation of blade rate humps is directly derived from the interaction between blades and circumferentially non uniform flow field the distribution of time averaged velocity in fig 11 shows a more circumferentially homogeneous inflow near the hub the local linear velocity at hub is the lowest and the lifts of thick hydrofoils here are generally more insensitive to the variation of attack angle as the result of these reasons there exist no apparent bpf components for s 3 and s 4 with the increment of radius the enhancement of humps at blade rate harmonics is basically derived from larger velocity and more subtle foils as well as promoted by the intensive small scale flow structures near blade periphery the latter factor has been revealed by the foregoing discussion on the velocity spectra of v3 3 and v9 3 when comes to the fluctuating force induced by large scale vortex it can be concluded that the radial distribution of unsteady thrust in lf range is still consistent with the conventional rule of steady load on the other hand since the large scale fluctuation in incoming flow shares the same spectrum in different radial location as revealed in section 3 2 the lf components of radial force almost distribute equally on each strip in practice the large scale vortexes in incoming flow are mainly influenced by the characteristic scales of upstream structure and boundary hence the large scale fluctuations in the incoming flow are generally uniform in propeller disc plane and this kind of distribution law for lateral lf components would be instructive to most cases the second hump for s 4 remarkably shows distinct right shifts relative to 2bpf previous studies jiang et al 1991 martinez et al 1996 reported that the geometrical pitch of the blade and inhomogeneous turbulent flow is attributed to this latent right shift as previously discussed the inflow is nearly circumferentially homogeneous near the hub hence the force fluctuation for the blade strips near the hub is inclined to reflect the similar spectra as incoming velocity in comparison with the spectra of unsteady force on s 3 and velocity spectra in fig 9 the same slope in lf is certainly observed however the deviation between the spectra of force and velocity is mainly embodied as the broadband humps marked in fig 18 the central frequencies of these broadband humps are randomly distributed these broadband humps are derived from the pressure fluctuation induced by the vortex shedding on the suction surfaces as shown in fig 17 e when the blade strip gets thicker the scales of vortex shedding decrease and the intensity would decay thus the hump shifted toward high frequency until no corresponding components below 600 hz emerges in the s 5 spectra it is noteworthy that similar shedding vortex are observed on other form of propeller zhang and rajeev 2019 cai et al 2019 since this 10 blade propeller model is representative by its simple but universal structures and has been used as a benchmark in many other researches the revelation of this distribution rule would be beneficial to a bulk of propeller models 4 conclusion large eddy simulation on the turbulence induced propeller force has been carried out in this work the combination of fourier spectral synthesis and the turbulence grid has generated authentic turbulence in simulation the broadband spectra have been effectively extracted by a two step algorithm the predicted thrust spectrum including the entire level decay rate and broadband humps has encouraging consistency with the experimental measurement through source separation and physical analysis on the flow field the following conclusions are derived 1 there is a naturally interaction between inflow and propeller on one hand both the velocity and pressure fluctuations of the inflow in the vicinity of propeller are influenced by the blade disturbance on the other hand the broadband fluctuations of incoming flow immediately generate the broadband unsteady force on blades as the radius increases the time average circumferential inhomogeneity of incoming velocity on the propeller plane enhances and the intensity of small scale fluctuating component rises these spatially differences in the distribution of inflow constitute the external factors for loading diversity in the radial direction 2 by investigating the unsteady loading blade by blade the unsteady thrust spectrum of a single blade is directly correlated with the equivalence of turbulence spectra in the rotating reference frame where a logarithmic decrement exists and no bpf components are present the forces on the adjacent blades have a fixed interval but hardly identical temporal fluctuation due to the time varying and spatial irregular inflow structure this condition produces the broadband blade rate humps in the resultant thrust of multiple blades the hump at 1bpf is directly caused by circumferentially inhomogeneous distribution of the incoming flow furthermore the humps at other harmonics are induced by the local vortex structure with smaller scale and circumferentially multimodal distribution of velocity the energy attenuation from large scale whirls to small ones in turbulent cascade leads to the magnitude difference of these broadband components in force spectra 3 the different blade profiles in the radial direction become the internal factors for the loading distribution with various magnitudes and components the blade strips near the hub have isotropic loading fluctuations the high frequency broadband humps in the force spectra of these parts are attributed to the pressure fluctuation induced by unstable vortex shedding on blade surface what s more the blade rate components of fluctuating force become more pronounced as the radius increases thus the blade rate humps in the total thrust are predominantly originated from the blade strips near the periphery 4 in terms of contribution rates majority of the fluctuating thrusts are concentrated on the blade strips near the periphery which is identical to the steady loading for lateral force the blade strips near the hub generate more intensive high frequency fluctuation whereas the lf components almost distribute equally on each strip consequently in the practical problem of unsteady force controlling on low frequency and blade rate components it is highly important to weaken the large scale vortex from the inflow and reduce the circumferential nonuniformity of mean velocity field moreover a balance between strength and flow performance for blade root profile is crucial to relieve the high frequency broadband force induced by shedding vortex from the trailing edge credit authorship contribution statement haoyu yao conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization

21861,inflow turbulence is the primary source of propeller unsteady forces especially for broadband components in this work the inflow turbulence and unsteady force on a 10 blade propeller are numerically studied on the basis of large eddy simulation to provide insights into the generation mechanism of this type of excitation we use turbulence grid and fourier synthesis method to produce incoming turbulence with spatial flow structure and temporal fluctuation in simulation the predicted thrust spectrum from this numerical method achieves better measurement consistency than that obtained from theoretical calculation the turbulence spectra and velocity distribution reveal intrinsic broadband characteristics and spatial inhomogeneity of grid induced inflow the transient velocity field and time dependent thrusts on adjacent blades are cross contrasted to illuminate the generation process of broadband humps in the unsteady force spectra additionally the broadband unsteady forces are simultaneously decomposed into four frequency bands to reveal the corresponding excitation sources for various spectral components and into nine radial blade strips to explore the contribution rates of fluctuating loading at various radial positions the research is beneficial for comprehensive understanding on turbulence induced exciting force and practical engineering design of noise reduced propellers keywords unsteady force large eddy simulation turbulence propeller broadband 1 introduction unsteady forces on propellers caused by turbulence ingestion are the primary source of underwater broadband radiated noise at low frequency lf these forces usually consist of periodic and broadband components blake 2017 the narrowband periodic components at blade passing frequency bpf and its harmonics are derived from non uniform inflow pinkus et al 1963 bennaya et al 2013 caused by ship appendages such as rudder and fairwater the model experiments operated in idealized wake screens valentine and kader 1977 jessup 1990 minniti et al 2015 have systemically researched the interaction between blades and cyclic inflow numerous programs have been developed to predict these periodic forces and their accuracy has been fully evaluated zawadzki et al 1997 fuhs 2005 however the broadband force components were found spreading over a wide frequency band ranging from several to several hundred hertz with humps centered at bpfs sevik 1974 thompson 1978 these components are generally embedded by enormous energy and would exert great impact to propeller shaft vibration and radiated noise anderson et al 2014 chen et al 2017a b therefore the mechanism of broadband propeller force has attracted considerable interest in recent decades factors such as boundary layer turbulence at duct walls random variations of tip vortex strength or vortex shedding from blade trailing edges te were first regarded as the major sources of broadband force and noise sevik 1968 however as more measurements and observations have been conducted high frequency components were found to be induced by vortex shedding whereas the lf ones were caused by the interaction of inflow turbulence with propeller blades blake 1975 jiang et al 1991 on this basis many investigators employed hydrofoil lift theory and turbulence statistics to predict and analyze the broadband force components the simplified correlation approach revealed that the spectrum of broadband thrust depends on the turbulence level integral scale of turbulence and geometrical dimension of rotor sevik 1974 jiang et al 1991 incorporated propeller rotational effects with the modified velocity correlation and proposed a new correlation approach the blade rate humps were calculated analytically in this approach and their amplitudes and bandwidths were proportional to the turbulence scale other follow up prediction methods used asymptotic lift relationships for large blade numbers martinez 1996a b or a thin foil theory based model lysak 2001 in these theories the magnitudes of broadband humps enlarge with the increment of blade numbers rotating speed and turbulence scale an analytical prediction on the turbulence ingestion rotor unsteady force has been recently formulated to include correlations among three axial components and spatially inhomogeneous turbulence anderson et al 2014 2015 the results revealed that the radial forces remain highly correlated over large subtended angles about the rotation axis and the coherence between axial and radial forces should not be ignored for spatially inhomogeneous turbulent inflow although many experimental investigations involved in turbulence measurement have been conducted scharpf and miller 1995 wojno et al 2002a b minniti et al 2015 the high resolution full field measurement technique is still deficient to clearly characterize the turbulent inflow and the establishment of analytical functions for complex propeller geometry is challenging thereupon the applicability and accuracy of analytical methods are limited in that some theoretical hypothesis and empirical simplification must be introduced with the progress of numerical techniques and computer performance the unsteady response of propellers in complicated inflow conditions should be studied using numerical methods urans has been performed to calculate propeller transient forces in various conditions krasilnikov et al 2009 zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 by contrast rans models based on time average equations are incapable of capturing the transient vortex structure and time dependent fluctuation the results of a urans les hybrid method have presented the unsteady flow structures at the stern and partial broadband force around blade rate frequency abbas et al 2015 zhang and rajeev 2019 other studies attempted to predict the vortex blade interaction and fluctuating forces in multiple operation modes by using les jang and mahesh 2010 mahesh et al 2010 jang et al 2012 keller et al 2017 the acquired power spectrum density psd of the unsteady thrust and torque were both broadband in the large frequency range although the ideal method to solve the fluctuation and vortex in all frequencies is dns the computer cost is huge and the lf components are dominated for unsteady forces in addition given that the les method is more theoretically accurate in calculating the boundary layer flow than hybrid models it would be suitable for unsteady force prediction in this problem this work aims to numerically predict the turbulence induced forces on a propeller and investigate the correlation between the incoming turbulence and the broadband unsteady force the finite volume method with les model has been used to solve the vortex and time dependent flow field that induce the unsteady forces in a concerned frequency range the turbulence generating grid and fourier synthesis method on inlet condition were combined to produce inflow turbulence with temporal fluctuation and spatial coherent structure the accuracy of simulation method was verified with test and theoretical values first then the streamwise evolution of grid turbulence spectrum and radial disparity of incoming flow were emphatically discussed the correspondence analysis on time dependent thrust and instantaneous velocity field was conducted to reveal the generation of blade rate humps from the point of flow mechanism finally the signal processing and flow analysis were adopted to reveal the interaction between the spatially inhomogeneous inflow and the consequent loading distribution in radical direction 2 geometric and numerical method 2 1 propeller model the investigated propeller shown in fig l has ten equally spaced blades with constant chord length the blades are designed with an aspect ratio of 3 1 and without rake or sweep the main geometric dimensions are listed in table 1 the blade angles ba range from 63 3 at hub to 28 9 at tip the maximum thickness of the blade section is located at 45 chord length from the leading edge le this propeller is a benchmark model for many mechanism researches scharpf and mueller 1995 martinez 1996a b wojno et al 2002 lynch et al 2005 anderson 2015 because of its simple and representative structure the 2d response function is practicable to be applied in the analytical prediction methods such as spectrum blake 2017 and correlation approaches jiang et al 1991 wojno et al 2002a b 2 2 numerical schemes the large eddy simulation method was adopted to solve the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in commercial finite volume solver fluent 17 0 the unsteady mass and momentum equation operated by spatial filter function are expressed as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u i u j x i 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j τ i j x j where u i and p denote the filtered velocity components and pressure respectively τ ij represents subgrid scale sgs stress which reflects the momentum transport between small scale fluctuation and resolved scale vortex the sgs stress is an additional term required to be solved to close the governing equation it is commonly modeled from boussinesq hypothesis hinze 1975 3 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j 4 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where μ t is the sgs turbulent viscosity and s ij is the rate of strain tensor for the resolved scale in this work the sgs eddy viscosity was calculated using the smagorinsky lilly model smagorinsky 1963 where the eddy viscosity is modeled with mixing length hypothesis the equations for μ t are written as follows 5 μ t ρ l s 2 2 s i j s i j l s min κ d c s δ δ v 1 3 where l s is the mixing length for sgs κ is the von karman constant d is the distance to the closest wall and v 1 3 represents the local grid scale computed from the volume of computational cell the smagorinsky constant c w was taken as 0 1 to yield optimal results for a wide range of flows the central differencing scheme with an accuracy equivalent to second order was employed for the diffusion term the convection term was discrete in the bounded central differencing scheme where the non physical oscillation can be effectively avoided 2 3 computational domain and boundary conditions to validate the simulation with the experimental results the computational domain was established in accordance with the water tunnel in sevik s 1974 paper see fig 2 the propeller was located 20 mesh sizes c downstream of a grid to guarantee that the turbulence reaching the propeller is fully developed the grid with a mesh size of 152 4 mm not only increases the turbulence intensity but also changes the vortex scale that dominates the turbulent kinetic energy transport mikhailova et al 2001 naudascher and farrel 1970 the inlet was 4c upstream of the grid due to limited computing resources the outlet was set 10c downstream of the rotor to eliminate the attenuation effect of the numerical boundary on flow fluctuation around the rotor under the boundary condition of velocity inlet and outflow outlet the perturbations should be added into the inlet mean velocity the precursor simulation rhie and chow 1983 and kondo et al 1997 and synthesis methods maruyama et al 1999 xie and castro 2008 have been successively proposed and employed in many problems to generate random instantaneous velocity with a pre defined temporal and spatial correlation in les leonard 1992 erlebacher et al 1992 versteeg and malalasekera 2007 in this study we used spectral synthesis kraichnan 1970 smirov et al 2001 for inlet perturbation where the fluctuating velocity components were extracted from the divergence free vector field synthesized by summation of fourier harmonics the transient inlet velocity consists of the following fourier series 6 v i x t 2 n n 1 n p i n cos k j n x j ω n t q j n sin k j n x j ω n t 7 x j x j l t t τ c l τ k j n k j n c c j where l and τ are the length and time scales of the turbulence respectively p i n and q i n conform to a normal distribution to control the fraction of components with corresponding wave number k j n and frequency ω n and c j is the coefficient of the diagonalizable velocity correlation tensor this method can be used to complement the turbulence generating grid to produce a highly authentic turbulence with temporal fluctuation and spatial coherent structure 2 4 computational mesh and unsteady simulation settings the whole domain was divided with hexahedral structured meshes fig 3 the meshes of rotating domain were generated through periodic replication of a single channel h type blocks were used at blade edges and o type block was made to refine the meshes of the blade surface boundary layer the non dimensional distance y was within 1 3 on blade surfaces indicating that the first layer meshes were controlled in a viscous layer fig 3 b demonstrates the surface mesh on single blade segmented in the blade strips corresponding to fig 1 with regard to the meshes around turbulence generating grids the y type topology was used for cylindrical junction the rotation speed ω of propeller was 18 43 rps the advance velocity u i e the mean inlet velocity was set as 4 57 and 4 38 m s corresponding to the advance ratios of 1 22 and 1 17 designed condition respectively the simulation was started from the steady result solved by k ω sst the fluctuating data were recorded after 0 66 s 20c u which is the time point when the vortex structure generated by the grid passed through the rotor to guarantee enough temporal resolution the unsteady data were sampled every time step the mesh independence test on hydrodynamic performance was conducted with three different cell numbers according to cfl criterion for convergence the time step sizes in these cases were set as 3 0144 10 4 1 5072 10 4 and 7 3564 10 5 namely the time in which the propeller rotates 2 1 and 0 5 respectively the time averaged thrust coefficient in the designed condition based on a propeller disc area sevik 1974 was calculated using eq 8 the unsteady thrust at the main blade passing frequency 1bpf and second blade passing frequency 2bpf in j 1 22 were computed from fast fourier transform fft the amplitudes were converted into db units using eq 9 due to the different orders of magnitude for various frequency components 8 c t t n 0 5 ρ u 2 π r 2 9 t d b 20 log 10 t n where u is the advance velocity and πr 2 equals to the area of propeller disc t n represents thrust in terms of newton and t db represents thrust in decibel db the results in table 2 show that the medium and fine meshes have less than 1 discrepancy with respect to the time averaged thrust coefficient whereas the coarse mesh underestimates the thrust in addition the static thrust coefficient in these two cases are close to the designed value 0 183 published by sevik 1974 to have a clear picture on flow characteristics the time averaged axial velocity from the location near the hub 0 25r to the tip 1r is shown in fig 4 the coarse mesh has a relatively high axial velocity especially beyond 0 7r this finding qualitatively illustrates that the undervaluation of blade thrust in coarse mesh is mainly derived from the small attack angles in this region the distribution of medium mesh solution is quite close to the fine mesh except a slight diminution around 0 6r with regard to the unsteady performance at j 1 22 unless stated the results are for j 1 22 the amplitude of fluctuating thrusts at 1bpf and 2bpf denoted as t1bpf and t2bpf in table 2 in db unit from eq 9 in coarse mesh are higher than those in the medium and fine meshes the different wake appearances shown in fig 5 demonstrate that the mesh refinement leads to complicated vortex structures near the te of blades however the steady and unsteady performance reveals that the impact of these differences on the propeller loading was limited considering the high computational cost for refine mesh the medium one was selected as the final mesh for further research in the following sections the final computation time and sampling length were extended to 3 53 s corresponding to the time in which the propeller rotates 64 revolutions for a sufficient resolution in the frequency domain 3 results and discussion 3 1 broadband extraction algorithm and experiment validation the original thrust spectrum and the processed results are depicted in the semi logarithmic diagram in fig 6 the amplitude was converted into db units from eq 9 the frequency range concerned here covers the first three blade passing frequencies the original time history of unsteady force was divided into segments with 1 3 overlap a hann window was applied before transforming each segment into the frequency domain by fft the thrust spectra were then averaged over all segments this procedure is similar to that used by kumar and mahesh 2017 the original thrust spectrum shows obvious broadband characteristics over the entire frequency range with relatively significant discrete components appearing at each bpf since most spectral peaks are adjacent both in frequency and amplitude the upper boundary of the thrust spectrum is visually inclined to show a broadband pattern to avoid the underestimation on the actual magnitude of the fluctuation loading this paper used a two step algorithm to extract the continuous broadband spectrum first the local maxima of original spectra were calculated to obtain an upper estimation of the fluctuating amplitude then an adjacent averaged weighting approach was utilized as shown in eq 10 10 g i j 1 n w j f j i n 2 n w j 1 j i 1 n 1 2 2 where f i and g i are the ith input and output data points respectively n represents the number of points in the window and w j is a quadratic weight factor this algorithm can properly reflect the fluctuating amplitude of the unsteady force and eliminate the random components fig 6 indicates that the entire level of calculated spectrum is in encouraging agreement with the experimental results in literature jiang et al 1991 especially in frequency below 100 hz and above 450 hz the humps centered at various bpfs have been calculated clearly therefore the accuracy of the unsteady simulation results over the concerned frequency range is basically validated 3 2 characteristics of incoming turbulence the turbulence characteristic downstream the turbulence generate grid is significantly different from that of the uniform incoming flow in this section the flow upstream the rotor from les is first analyzed fig 7 shows a graphical representation of the monitor points the velocity ranging from x 152 4 mm to x 25 4 mm at radial locations of 0 3r and 0 9r were sampled since this grid turbulence meet the weak turbulence criterion urms u 0 1 taylor s hypothesis pope 2000 was used to calculate the streamwise wave number spectrum from the temporal auto spectral density of monitored turbulent velocity this transformation was implemented based on the convection velocity wojno et al 2002a as follows 11 k 1 2 π f u 12 φ k 1 φ u u f δ 2 π f k 1 u where k 1 is streamwise wave number and δ is dirac delta function in fig 8 the acquired wave number spectra at 0 3r and 0 9r in front of the propeller disc are compared with theoretical spectrum in the manner of liepmann hinze 1975 the streamwise developments of the axial velocity spectra are shown in fig 9 the same extraction algorithm described in section 3 1 has been applied here the pressure fluctuation close to the blade le and that far upstream the propeller x 160 mm at radial location of 0 8r were also sampled all these monitors are in the same axial plane in addition to the temporal sampling of turbulence information at fixed points fig 10 depicts the spatial sampling of axial velocity on the spiral line at locations of 0 3r and 0 9r the pitches of these two spiral lines are equal to those of blade strips at the corresponding radial location and they go through five cycles as shown by the tracks illustrated in the frame at the top corner of fig 10 these spatial samples were converted to equivalent spectra in the rotating frame using eqs 13 and 14 13 t n x n x 1 u 14 u ω n 1 n u t n e i ω n where x n is the axial location of the nth sampling point u t n represents the axial velocity at the nth sampling point and n is the sampling number along this spiral line on the basis of taylor s hypothesis for fully developed turbulence this approach is theoretically equivalent to the turbulence spectrum measured by a rotating sensor similar to the study of wojno et al 2002 these equivalent turbulence spectra describe the velocity variations impacting one blade in a certain time period according to the relation between frequency f and streamwise wave number k in eq 11 the lf components in the temporal spectra are corresponding to the large scale axial vortex whereas the high frequency components represent the small ones 1 since the wave number spectra share a parallel trend with theoretical one especially in the low wave number region the accuracy of inflow field in this simulation method is basically confirmed the deviation in amplitude would be attributed to the incompletely isotropic turbulence in the vicinity of propeller for instance the large scale vortex is more likely to induce by the solid boundary making the spectrum of 0 3r exceed the theoretical one in low wave number region more prominently all the turbulence spectra in figs 8 and 9 show a tendency of rapid decaying from low to high which reveals that the fluctuations induced by large scale vortex play a dominant role in turbulence downstream of the grid 2 at radial location of 0 9r the high frequency velocity fluctuations gradually decrease from v9 8 to v9 5 which indicates the dissipation from small size eddies in the streamwise development of turbulence however the flow fields adjacent to the rotor are excited by the propeller rotation and the blade rate humps emerge as it gets closer to propeller i e from v9 4 to v9 1 these bpf components become more significant and the high frequency fluctuations are synchronously enhanced 3 fig 9 b shows that the streamwise evolution of velocity spectra near the hub becomes more complicated the high frequency fluctuations increase from v3 8 to v3 6 and then decrease from v3 5 to v3 3 behind the tip of hub cap to the range of 1 5l upstream the propeller a slight hump emerges at 1bpf fig 11 shows that v3 8 v3 7 and v3 6 are successively close to the low velocity region near the stagnation point thus the flow perturbations are enhanced a high velocity region is observed downstream of the stagnant point the flow here is rectified by the guidance of the hub cap to suppress the high frequency fluctuation from v3 5 to v3 3 in general the difference between the shapes of the velocity spectra in stationary reference frames fig 9 and the equivalent turbulence spectra in the rotating reference frames fig 10 are similar to the previous measurement wojno et al 2002a b lynch et al 2005 the equivalent velocity spectra on the hypothetical inflow track at 0 9r differ from those at 0 3r in the overall level and decay trend their correlation with unsteady thrust will be discussed in section 3 3 from the perspective of time averaged velocity field shown in fig 11 the circumferential distribution is observed to get more irregular from hub to the blade periphery the contrastive analysis on the unsteady loading response of typical blade strips near hub and blade periphery will be given in section 3 4 the other aspects of pressure fluctuation such as the time histories and psd are presented in fig 12 the time dependent pressures at these two points have approximately synchronous variation however p2 contains more high frequency fluctuation components the absolute values of pressure close to the propeller increase due to the energy input from the rotating blade the flow field around propeller is consequentially disturbed by the blades sweeping periodically thus the discrete 1bpf component is prominent in the area adjacent to the propeller whereas no obvious discrete tones appear in the far upstream position similar to taylor s hypothesis for velocity spectrum mentioned above the spatial pressure spectrum is also equivalent to the temporal spectrum observed at a fix point the slopes close to theoretical f 5 3 scaling in these spectra indicate that the resolved scales in the present case are asymptotic to inertial subrange ji et al 2015 and the mesh is sufficiently fine to solve the major proportion of the energy 3 3 generation of the blade rate humps in the thrust spectra the thrusts on various numbers of blades in this propeller were counted in the time domain and converted into spectra fig 13 to effectively reveal the generation mechanism of the broadband bumps around 1bpf and its harmonics discovered in section 3 1 no blade rate humps appear for single blade thrust and the spectrum shows a continuous decaying pattern to high frequency the slope of this curve is almost constant in this mono logarithmic coordinate which reveals a potential logarithmic decay law for the unsteady thrust spectrum it is noted that the thrust spectrum for single blade shows similar broadband pattern to the modified grid generated turbulence measured by lynch et al 2005 and the equivalence of turbulence spectra in fig 10 especially that of 0 9r this consistency in spectrum indicates the direct correlation between inflow turbulence and unsteady loading when summing up the thrust spectra of multiple blades the humps at bpfs emerge and become more pronounced as the examined blade numbers increase meanwhile the slopes of spectra in the lf increase in view of the flow field fig 14 shows the instantaneous velocity on the axial and circumferential planes around two adjacent blades at some typical moments accompanied by the time history of thrust on these two blades in the corresponding time periods the six images were divided into two groups to illustrate the generation of various bpf components the intra group intervals are δt1 2 71 ms and δt2 1 35 ms equivalent to the time for blades rotating over 18 and 9 respectively the circumferential cross sections were selected at 0 9r on the basis of the prior assumption that the flow field near the blade periphery excites the majority of entire loading fluctuation and the axial plane was located 100 mm upstream the propeller the flow angle distribution surrounding the two blades on the 0 9r surface is demonstrated in the blade to blade view to compare with the ba equal to 24 7 at 0 9r in fig 15 fig 14 shows that the instantaneous inflow strongly exhibits circumferential uniformity for t1 5 21975 s the le of blade α is located in the low speed region and is about to penetrate into the high speed region the flow angle before le of blade α is generally smaller than ba in fig 15 a therefore the loading on blade α in fig 14 g shows a local maximum at this moment as time goes by the flow structures are transported by convection velocity u the entire blade α is immersed in the high speed zone for t1 δt1 the flow angle is then approximated to ba in fig 15 b the loading on blade α diminishes for the same time as blade β moves out of the high speed zone the flow angle around blade β decreases relative to that in fig 14 a and its loading increases to a further moment for t1 2δt1 blade α is still in the sphere of the high speed zone with larger circumferential scale than the blade spacing hence the flow angle around blade α in fig 15 c nearly maintains the same value as that in fig 15 b the thrust remains at a relatively low level while blade β is predominantly affected by the same low speed zone as the circumstance for blade α at t1 a similar peak in blade β thrust emerges for this moment the flow angles around blade β share a similar distribution as that of blade α in fig 15 a according to the above discussion the unimodal sequence of each blade thrust contributed to the bimodal sequence in the resultant thrust where the time interval is 2δt1 corresponding to the frequency of 1bpf on the other hand blade α at t1 2δt1 and blade β at t1 are in the high speed zones with various values due to the circumferentially inhomogeneous incoming flow this condition is verified by the different flow angle distribution in the corresponding moments in fig 15 consequently the two peaks in resultant force for t1 and t1 2δt1 are nonequivalent this occurrence would account for the broadband components around 1bpf namely the blade rate humps in general the circumferentially inhomogeneous inflow directly induces the 1bpf components another group of flow distribution was selected from t2 5 25472 s to t2 2δt2 in fig 14 d f fig 14 g demonstrates that a secondary maximum exist on the thrust of blade α for t2 2δt2 meanwhile the thrust on blade β only increases monotonically from t2 δt2 to t2 2δt2 this phenomenon results in the broadband humps around 2bpf in the resultant thrust on the perspective of flow mechanism the velocity streamline on the axial plane and velocity distribution on circumferential cross section show that the scales of instantaneous vortex are more irregular during this time period and the circumferential inhomogeneity is more severe than the one discussed in fig 14 a c hence the blade loading is affected by the inflow variation in a more complicated way for instance the le of blade α penetrates exactly into the low speed region in fig 14 d and the flow angle in fig 15 d is generally smaller than the ba consequently the primary peak appears for t2 as blade α sweeps out of the low speed region the attack angle increases making the blade loading decrease the low speed region is synchronously transported downstream by u the local high speed detour flow around the te of blade α is distorted by the low speed region in fig 14 f the le of blade α is still in the influence scope of the low speed region from fig 14 f as a result the equivalent flow angle at t2 2δt2 is smaller than that at t2 δt2 thereby slightly improving the loading on blade α this phenomenon reflects that the harmonic components are derived from the local flow structure in the incoming flow and the circumferentially multimodal distribution of velocity in addition the load fluctuation during this period is smaller on magnitude order due to the lower circumferential gradient magnitude of the incoming velocity than that from t1 to t1 2δt1 3 4 unsteady thrust properties at the blade hub and tip region apart from the analysis on unsteady loading blade by blade the following sections investigate the radial distribution of unsteady loading by calculating time dependent forces acting on various blade strips to uncover the different responses for the blade strips at various radial locations the unsteady thrust on blade strips at two typical blade strips s 3 and s 9 as highlighted in fig 1 b are analyzed first due to its broadband characteristics the time dependent force was decomposed into components of four frequency bands namely lf below 94 4 hz fh 94 4 283 2 hz sh 283 2 472 5 hz and th above 472 5 hz whose ranges covered the humps at different bpfs the time frequency analysis based on short time fourier transform stft was applied on the whole thrust signal in figs 16 d and 17 d the hamming window was adopted to divide data into small sections and reduce leakage in figs 16 e and 17 e the root mean squared error rmse of local pressure was introduced to estimate the magnitude of pressure fluctuations around the blades as defined by eq 14 15 r m s e p n 1 n p x t n p x t 2 n where n is the number of time steps p x t n is the static pressure in location x at the nth time step and p x t is the time average static pressure the instantaneous velocity streamlines are concurrently depicted in figs 16 f and 17 f to trace the source of different pressure distribution figs 16 and 17 show that the broadband components of lf are the dominant parts for both blade strips in the term of magnitude the time dependent thrust of fh in fig 16 b embodies the feature of amplitude modulated wave as the intervals between the peaks are fixed while the amplitudes vary over time however fig 17 b manifests that the components above 94 4 hz are more disorganized in the time domain and the force fluctuations in fh and sh are approximately in the same magnitude the stft results indicate that the components above 94 4 hz are generally concentrated around each bpf with random frequency deviation in the entire time periods for s 9 by contrast the components of s 3 spread over a wide frequency range and no apparent blade rate humps are observed fig 16 e reveals that the pressure fluctuation around s 9 is generally concentrated at blade le the pressure distributions in this region are sensitive to the fluctuation of the incoming flow because of the impact effect and occurrence of circumfluence at le the streamlines in fig 16 f indicate that the fluid flowing past the two surfaces of the blades always converge at te thereby making the local velocity finite hence the kutta condition is satisfied xu 1998 and the blade strip is capable of producing lift force however both the pressure fluctuation at le and te are dramatic for s 3 and the latter is more prominent given that the advance coefficient j 1 22 of the unsteady case exceeds the design value the attack angles are generally closer to the negative in addition the thickness of blade root should be designed above the specific value due to the strength requirement in manufacturing this strategy increases the stall angle of attack and the gradient of suction surface for the blade strips here then the flow separation emerges and the streamlines passing s 3 can t meet at te accordingly the kutta condition is not necessarily satisfied and no lift force is produced from fig 17 f it can be concluded that the majority of pressure fluctuation at te is generally due to the unstable shedding vortices induced by the boundary layer separation from the rear part of suction surface 3 5 distribution of unsteady forces in the radial direction as discussed in section 3 4 the fluctuating thrusts on s 3 and s 9 are different the whole propeller was then divided into blade strips s 3 to s 9 centered at r n with a fixed span length r 10 to fully study the unsteady loading distribution in the radial direction the three axial force spectra of different blade strips are separately shown in fig 18 without regard to the potential radial correlation of fluctuating loading the radial force was decomposed into two orthogonal directions namely horizontal and vertical moreover the unsteady energy proportion of thrust ept and resultant radial force epr of various blade strips in the four frequency bands introduced in section 3 4 were calculated quantitatively as follows 16 e p t i j f i min f i max p s d t h r u s t j d f j r o o t t i p f i min f i max p s d t h r u s t j d f 17 e p r i j f i min f i max p s d z j p s d y j d f j r o o t t i p f i min f i max p s d z j p s d y j d f where indexes i and j denote the frequency segment and blade strips respectively psd thrust psd z and psd y are power spectral density of three axial forces and f imin and f imax represent the upper and lower boundaries of each frequency band respectively the energy proportion statistics are illustrated in fig 19 fig 18 shows that the forces in the three directions assume a generally similar spectral distribution for all the strips the energy proportions in fig 19 a illustrate that the majority of thrust fluctuating is imposed on s 8 and especially s 9 hence the prior assumption presented in section 3 3 is validated here by the comparative analysis between the spectra in fig 18 and distribution in fig 19 some notable trends are singled out below 1 the magnitudes of the fluctuating horizontal and vertical forces in the blade strip are almost equal the magnitude of the unsteady thrust surpasses the lateral forces near the blade periphery 2 similar to fig 18 where the blade rate humps become pronounced from hub to blade periphery the portion of dominant fluctuating components fh for all force and lf for thrust in fig 19 also enhance as the radius increases however the lf component of lateral fluctuation is equally distributed on each blade strip 3 the broadband humps in the unsteady force spectra of blade strips near the hub are apparent especially for s 3 and s 4 this feature is quantitatively reflected in the energy proportion of fig 19 where peak fractions can be observed for the fluctuating force of blade strips near hub s 3 s 4 and s 5 in high frequency ranges fh sh and th as discussed in section 3 4 not all the blade strips in this propeller were lift body at advance coefficient of 1 22 the spectra of s 3 and s 4 represent the resistance fluctuation and the magnitudes of three axial fluctuating forces for these blade sections are in close proximity this finding reflects that the turbulence near the hub is nearly isotropic in three directions as the radius further increases the kutta condition is satisfied and the lifts are converted into thrust meanwhile the magnitude disparity between thrust and lateral forces enlarges in the whole frequency band which indicates that the anisotropy of the turbulence is enhanced when the location draw near to the blade periphery according to the analysis in section 3 3 the generation of blade rate humps is directly derived from the interaction between blades and circumferentially non uniform flow field the distribution of time averaged velocity in fig 11 shows a more circumferentially homogeneous inflow near the hub the local linear velocity at hub is the lowest and the lifts of thick hydrofoils here are generally more insensitive to the variation of attack angle as the result of these reasons there exist no apparent bpf components for s 3 and s 4 with the increment of radius the enhancement of humps at blade rate harmonics is basically derived from larger velocity and more subtle foils as well as promoted by the intensive small scale flow structures near blade periphery the latter factor has been revealed by the foregoing discussion on the velocity spectra of v3 3 and v9 3 when comes to the fluctuating force induced by large scale vortex it can be concluded that the radial distribution of unsteady thrust in lf range is still consistent with the conventional rule of steady load on the other hand since the large scale fluctuation in incoming flow shares the same spectrum in different radial location as revealed in section 3 2 the lf components of radial force almost distribute equally on each strip in practice the large scale vortexes in incoming flow are mainly influenced by the characteristic scales of upstream structure and boundary hence the large scale fluctuations in the incoming flow are generally uniform in propeller disc plane and this kind of distribution law for lateral lf components would be instructive to most cases the second hump for s 4 remarkably shows distinct right shifts relative to 2bpf previous studies jiang et al 1991 martinez et al 1996 reported that the geometrical pitch of the blade and inhomogeneous turbulent flow is attributed to this latent right shift as previously discussed the inflow is nearly circumferentially homogeneous near the hub hence the force fluctuation for the blade strips near the hub is inclined to reflect the similar spectra as incoming velocity in comparison with the spectra of unsteady force on s 3 and velocity spectra in fig 9 the same slope in lf is certainly observed however the deviation between the spectra of force and velocity is mainly embodied as the broadband humps marked in fig 18 the central frequencies of these broadband humps are randomly distributed these broadband humps are derived from the pressure fluctuation induced by the vortex shedding on the suction surfaces as shown in fig 17 e when the blade strip gets thicker the scales of vortex shedding decrease and the intensity would decay thus the hump shifted toward high frequency until no corresponding components below 600 hz emerges in the s 5 spectra it is noteworthy that similar shedding vortex are observed on other form of propeller zhang and rajeev 2019 cai et al 2019 since this 10 blade propeller model is representative by its simple but universal structures and has been used as a benchmark in many other researches the revelation of this distribution rule would be beneficial to a bulk of propeller models 4 conclusion large eddy simulation on the turbulence induced propeller force has been carried out in this work the combination of fourier spectral synthesis and the turbulence grid has generated authentic turbulence in simulation the broadband spectra have been effectively extracted by a two step algorithm the predicted thrust spectrum including the entire level decay rate and broadband humps has encouraging consistency with the experimental measurement through source separation and physical analysis on the flow field the following conclusions are derived 1 there is a naturally interaction between inflow and propeller on one hand both the velocity and pressure fluctuations of the inflow in the vicinity of propeller are influenced by the blade disturbance on the other hand the broadband fluctuations of incoming flow immediately generate the broadband unsteady force on blades as the radius increases the time average circumferential inhomogeneity of incoming velocity on the propeller plane enhances and the intensity of small scale fluctuating component rises these spatially differences in the distribution of inflow constitute the external factors for loading diversity in the radial direction 2 by investigating the unsteady loading blade by blade the unsteady thrust spectrum of a single blade is directly correlated with the equivalence of turbulence spectra in the rotating reference frame where a logarithmic decrement exists and no bpf components are present the forces on the adjacent blades have a fixed interval but hardly identical temporal fluctuation due to the time varying and spatial irregular inflow structure this condition produces the broadband blade rate humps in the resultant thrust of multiple blades the hump at 1bpf is directly caused by circumferentially inhomogeneous distribution of the incoming flow furthermore the humps at other harmonics are induced by the local vortex structure with smaller scale and circumferentially multimodal distribution of velocity the energy attenuation from large scale whirls to small ones in turbulent cascade leads to the magnitude difference of these broadband components in force spectra 3 the different blade profiles in the radial direction become the internal factors for the loading distribution with various magnitudes and components the blade strips near the hub have isotropic loading fluctuations the high frequency broadband humps in the force spectra of these parts are attributed to the pressure fluctuation induced by unstable vortex shedding on blade surface what s more the blade rate components of fluctuating force become more pronounced as the radius increases thus the blade rate humps in the total thrust are predominantly originated from the blade strips near the periphery 4 in terms of contribution rates majority of the fluctuating thrusts are concentrated on the blade strips near the periphery which is identical to the steady loading for lateral force the blade strips near the hub generate more intensive high frequency fluctuation whereas the lf components almost distribute equally on each strip consequently in the practical problem of unsteady force controlling on low frequency and blade rate components it is highly important to weaken the large scale vortex from the inflow and reduce the circumferential nonuniformity of mean velocity field moreover a balance between strength and flow performance for blade root profile is crucial to relieve the high frequency broadband force induced by shedding vortex from the trailing edge credit authorship contribution statement haoyu yao conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation writing original draft visualization

21862,the paper presents the results of the study of natural frequencies and the corresponding decrements of harmonic vibrations of rectangular plates located in air or on the free surface of the fluid using a specially designed experimental setup the excitation of vibrations was carried out by the electromagnetic field the measurements were taken with a polytec pdv 100 digital laser vibrometer the locations of points on the surface of the plates at which an electromagnetic force was applied and the vibration velocity was measured were determined from the solution of the modal problem by the finite element method the decrements of plate vibrations were experimentally found for different schemes of plate clamping and dependences of decrements on the amplitude were determined it was found that the decrement corresponding to one mode of vibration bending or torsional increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines the obtained results showed that during the interaction of the plate with the fluid this relationship could be disturbed sometimes keywords rectangular plates fluid structure interaction natural frequencies decrement of vibrations electromagnetic excitation 1 introduction in our study the method of laser vibrometry is used to investigate natural frequencies and corresponding decrements of harmonic vibrations of thin plates interacting with a fluid for different schemes of plate clamping interest in the problem is dictated by the necessity of introducing new technical applications which will be able to meet the increased safety and performance requirements typical examples include grids for solid waste filtration used at hydroelectric power plants huang et al 2013 parallel plate fuel assemblies païdoussis 2016 floating airfields and offshore platforms for oil and gas production in the recent literature there has been a large number of publications devoted to a theoretical analysis of the influence of various factors on the natural vibration frequencies of plates interacting with a liquid païdoussis 2016 bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a canales and mantari 2019 experimental studies on this topic are represented by much fewer works in particular modal tests of annular and circular plates placed on the bottom of a rigid tank partially filled with water were carried out in work of amabili and dalpiaz 1998 horizontal circular and annular plates completely immersed in a liquid are studied by askari et al 2013 kwak and amabili 1999 kwak and han 2000 and hengstler and dual 2011 and rectangular ones by lindholm et al 1965 and haddara and cao 1996 the influence of the depth of plate immersion on its natural frequencies is studied by kwak and han 2000 and hengstler and dual 2011 the setup developed by lindholm et al 1965 allows one to change the location of a sample and perform tests on vertical plates partially immersed in a fluid in work of liao et al 2017 the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a horizontal plate the upper surface of which is interacting with a liquid layer were obtained experimentally here measurements were made by the two methods in the first case measurements were taken with a polyvinylidene difluoride based sensor pvdf and in the second case the authors used the amplitude fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry af espi method in addition to these characteristics of considerable practical interest for the dynamics of thin walled structures is the study of damping properties in the case of hydroelastic interaction they can also be determined by viscous properties of the fluid it is necessary to mention a series of works in this field paimushin et al 2014a egorov et al 2014 paimushin et al 2014b 2016 which introduced a theoretical experimental method for determining the aerodynamic and mechanical components of the logarithmic decrement for cantilevered plates performing vibrations on the lowest fundamental mode in a viscous medium the possibility of applying the obtained analytical expression to the case of torsional or bending modes of vibrations differing from the first one is not discussed paper of carra et al 2013 is concerned with the experimental study of the dynamic behavior of rectangular plates interacting with a fluid on the one and or two sides it was found that hydrostatic pressure and the level of liquid in a rectangular tank influence the nonlinear harmonic vibrations of small and large amplitudes the authors also proposed a method for determining the vertical displacements of the free surface of a fluid caused by the plate vibrations a comparison between the two methods of obtaining the natural vibration frequencies of a rectangular plate interacting with a liquid is given in work of khorshidi et al 2017 the first method is based on recording and analysis of the sound generated during vibrations of the sample excited by an impact of a hammer in the second method the measurements are taken by a sensor glued to the plate surface the results obtained agree to an accuracy of 7 and depend on the level of filling the tank with a fluid experimental studies of partially immersed cantilever plates with piezoceramic sensors and actuators were carried out by kwak and yang 2015 the obtained frequency response curves and vibration frequencies found numerically by the rayleigh ritz method made it possible to assess the reliability of the theoretical model proposed by kwak and yang 2013 which takes into account the effect of a liquid by virtual added mass matrix in article of verma et al 2019 the results of the impact hammer test performed both for a dry cantilever plate and for different levels of its immersion in a liquid are compared with the numerical and analytical solutions it was shown that fundamental frequencies for all three approaches are well matched in paper of odintsev 2018 the author demonstrated the possibility of using electronic speckle pattern interferometry espi to study the vibrational characteristics of aluminum rectangular cantilever plates fully or partially immersed in water experimental studies of a disk attached to a shaft and immersed in a rigid tank with fluid covered by an elastic casings are presented by valentín et al 2017 the influence of the mass and stiffness of the covers on the natural frequencies of the disk at a different distance from the elastic housing and rigid bottom is analyzed along with the problems listed above of particular practical interest are the studies of structures located on the surface of a liquid medium and making contact with it only on one side ice floes floating airfields and platforms for example work of yoon et al 2014 a simplified analogue of such structures in the form of a thin plate is studied in this paper using the developed experimental setup the paper presents information on the natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations under resonance conditions and establishes their inherent qualitative and quantitative relationships some preliminary calculations necessary for conducting an experiment were made using the finite element algorithm for solving the problem of hydroelastic vibrations of plates interacting with a fluid bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2016 bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016b bochkarev et al 2018 since the algorithm was developed and tested by the authors in their recent papers it does not come to the focus of this study 2 description of the experimental setup and research technique the experimental setup is a thick walled prismatic tank which instead of the top lid is fitted with a thin plate of length a width b and thickness h fig 1 the design of the tank provides the possibility of clamping or leaving free any of the four edges of the plate which allows us to analyze various options of its fixing the vibrations are excited by an electromagnetic field which is generated by the interaction of a light neodymium magnet glued to the top surface of the plate and a coil suspended from the u shaped frame above the magnet an alternating current of a given frequency or a rectangular pulse is passed to the coil from a signal generator through an amplifier the resulting electromagnetic force acts on the magnet and sets the plate into motion although this method of excitation add extra mass to the system it provides concentration of the force in the pre determined region its advantages also include the possibility of studying samples made of materials showing no magnetic properties the tank is mounted on a metal platform the horizontal position of which is regulated with the help of lifting legs and a digital level to reduce the probability of occurrence of air bubbles at the plate surface we used the following technique the plate is placed in a special groves in the side walls of the tank and is pressed to the wall at one edge by a clamping bar the opposite edge of the plate is bended up the tank is filled with a fluid to the level which is slightly higher than the level of the plate the raised edge of the plate is slowly lowered down which expels the arising air bubbles side ward in the direction of plate movement the excess of fluid is pumped out if necessary the study of natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of the plate was carried out using the method of laser vibrometry the measurements were taken with a polytec pdv 100 digital vibrometer with a sampling frequency of 48 khz and a resolution of 0 3 μ m s in the velocity range 500 mm s the device was mounted on a tripod the tilt angle of the tripod head was controlled using a digital level the vertical component of the velocity vector w was determined using the expression w w α sin α where α 4 5 is the tilt angle of the laser beam to the surface of the plate at rest w α is the measured value of the velocity the reliability of the values obtained in such a way was confirmed by comparing them with the results obtained when measurements of the normal velocity component were taken directly i e at α 9 0 this technique allowed us to study not only bending vibrations but also membrane modes the positions of the points on the surface of the sample at which excitation and measurements were carried out were determined based on the results of numerical solution of the corresponding modal problem by the finite element method bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2018 2016 the natural frequencies of the plate vibrations were determined from the fourier transform of the signal received after the sample was excited by a short time rectangular pulse duration of 0 5 ms for the excitation of harmonic vibrations an alternating current with the frequency equal to the natural vibration frequency of the plate was supplied to the coil from a tektronix afg3021c signal generator through a power amplifier after reaching the steady state the electric circuit was broken which caused damping of harmonic vibrations their decrement δ was determined from the vibrogram obtained from the results of measurements after approximating its envelope by the analytical function the experiment workflow is shown in fig 2 when performing the experiments it is necessary to take into account the fact that the magnitude of the excitation force depends on the frequency of the alternating current this fact is illustrated by the results presented in fig 3 a where the strength of the coil current is plotted as a function of frequency the obtained relationship can be explained by the following factors first the inductance coil leads to the occurrence of reactive resistance in the electric circuit the imaginary part of the impedance which increases linearly with increasing frequency second the coincidence of the frequencies of the delivered signal and the current in the city electric network 50 hz leads to the appearance of resonance in the system amplifier coil thus the amplitude of the harmonic excitation force at different vibration frequencies remains constant only if an alternating current of equal magnitude is supplied to the coil in the experiment its effective value was monitored with an ammeter and if necessary maintained unchanged another important factor is the distance from the coil to the magnet as it increases the electromagnetic force decreases exponentially this is confirmed by the experimental results shown in fig 3 b here the electromagnetic force is plotted against the distance between the coil and the magnet for two values of the current strength in the figure the obtained values are denoted by circles and squares whereas solid lines correspond to their approximations by the analytical function represented as a e b t constants a and b are determined by the least squares method in the course of this study a change in the weight of the plate with a magnet was measured at different distances from the coil to which a direct current was supplied note that by measured values one should understand a certain resulting force referred to the entire volume of the magnet the developed excitation device and the technique described below can be used to determine the decrement of harmonic vibrations for different modes using the obtained vibrograms and to construct curves describing its dependence on time and amplitude processing of the results consists of the following steps step 1 the measured signal is filtered in the vicinity of the examined natural frequency of vibrations using a fourier filter this makes it possible to reduce the effect of noise which is normally present in the experimental data causing distortion of the overall picture step 2 from the vibrogram y w t a working amplitude range a m a x a m i n is selected excluding the initial section of steady harmonic vibrations and the final section after which the vibrations are considered insignificant in the latter case the threshold value of velocity was taken to be 1 2 mm s for comparison a person while walking near the experimental setup creates a perturbation of 2 5 mm s step 3 within the selected interval a m a x a m i n n instants of time t 1 t 2 t n corresponding to the zero value of velocity are found this operation is carried out in several steps first the discrete relationship is used to identify the points at which the function y w t changes the sign then a line is drawn through each pair of points after which the point of its intersection with the abscissa axis is determined step 4 the zeros of the function found on the intervals t k 1 t k k 2 n are used to determine the half period of vibrations and frequency ω step 5 finally the extrema are found on each of the sections t k 1 t k k 2 n the discrete relationship a j t j j 1 n 1 obtained as a result of this operation is the envelope of decaying vibrations fig 4 to construct a smooth dependence of the vibration decrement on time we approximate the experimental values a j t j by the analytical function 1 a t a 1 e a 2 t a 3 e a 4 t the parameters a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are determined by the nelder mead method lagarias et al 1998 from the condition of minimum of the function 2 f a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 j 1 n 1 a j a j 2 where a j are the values of a t found at time t j using expression 1 the logarithmic decrement of vibrations is calculated by the formula 3 δ ln t 1 ω t d ln a t d t 1 ω t a t d a t d t where ω t are the vibration frequency in hertz using expression 1 and 3 one can obtain the relation δ ln a in some cases for quantitative comparison of the results instead of expression 3 it is more convenient to use the expression 4 a t a 1 e δ t where δ is the decrement the unknown parameters a 1 and δ are determined in a similar way the variants of plate fixing considered in this work and its position are shown schematically in fig 5 the samples of the required dimensions were cut from a sheet of duralumin d16 at equivalent to 2024t in iso 209 2007 by the electroerosion method with a tolerance of 0 02 mm which ensured high accuracy of their manufacture and repeatability the geometric dimensions of the samples are shown in table 1 excluding the regions involved in their fixing their thickness was taken equal to an average value obtained from ten measurements at different points 3 selection of points for measurement and force application the most suitable points for measurements and application of the harmonic excitation forces the points of magnet location were selected based on the solution of the problem of natural vibrations obtained by the finite element method its statement and some aspects of the numerical implementation are described in articles bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2018 and bochkarev et al 2016 the obtained natural frequencies and vibration modes of a cantilever plate fig 5 case 1 are shown in fig 6 here the solid line corresponds to the undeformed state of the body and the dotted lines to the nodal lines knowing that the points lying on them do not move during vibrations we excluded them from the process of measurement the color scale corresponds to dimensionless normal displacements w i w i max w i except for ω 5 in which case the ratio of transverse displacements v 5 v 5 max v 5 is used parenthesized data indicate the vibration mode classification and the number of nodal lines in the transverse x c o n s t and longitudinal y c o n s t directions the dimensions of the sample are so selected that one can study bending torsional and membrane modes of vibration at relatively low frequencies the data presented demonstrate that the maximum displacements occur at the corners of the free edge of the plate therefore measurements will be taken at point c at a distance of 2 mm from the corner of the plate fig 5 case 1 during excitation of harmonic vibrations with an electromagnet it is essential that the point of force application be selected in such a way that all modes of interest can be realized such a choice can be made by solving the spectral problem using the following criterion 5 f x y i 1 8 w i x y max fig 7 a shows the normalized displacement of the plate along the line a b fig 5 for some of the examined natural vibration frequencies from the data shown it can be seen that at the free edge of the sample x 150 mm w i reaches a maximum in all examined cases the location of the additional mass magnet in this region will lead to a change in the frequency spectrum therefore in expression 5 we restrict the choice of coordinates to the condition x 0 5 a then the optimal values are x 67 5 mm and y 0 mm in the course of numerical experiments it was found that the interaction of the plates being studied with a fluid does not lead to qualitative changes in the shape of vibration modes but changes their order in the spectrum and cause a slight displacement of the nodal lines based on the analysis we glue a light neodymium magnet of mass of 0 1 g diameter 3 mm height 2 mm to the plate surface at a distance of 66 mm from the fixed edge of the plate and a distance of 3 mm from its long side the indent is made for ease of use its position is shown in fig 7 by a vertical dashed lines it is known that in the system with the added mass there is not only a decrease in its natural frequencies but also a change in the vibration modes for the sample under consideration this is manifested in a break of symmetry of the bending and torsional modes with respect to the o x axis this effect is demonstrated more clearly in fig 8 which presents the results of the numerical solution of the modal problem found by the finite element method the location of the magnet is indicated by the circle the relative difference between the natural vibration frequencies obtained with and without concentrated mass does not exceed 2 5 similar preliminary numerical studies were carried out for a plate rigidly clamped at both edges fig 5 case 2 the location of magnet was selected based on the analysis of the vibration modes shown in fig 7 b in this case it was located at a distance of 38 mm from the left edge of the plate and at a distance of 3 mm from the long side the effect of the added mass on the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the test sample is shown in fig 9 the comparison shows that the relative difference does not exceed 2 4 experimental results 4 1 natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of plate in air at the first stage of the study we determined the natural frequencies of plate vibrations in air the average values of natural frequencies for the sample with added mass magnet and without it are given in table 2 before each new measurement the plate was demounted and installed again the values of the mean square deviation s obtained from 30 measurements are given after plus minus symbol 6 s i n 1 30 ω i n ω i 2 n 1 i 1 8 where ω i are the arithmetic mean values classification of vibration modes b bending t torsional m membrane and the number of nodal lines in the transverse and longitudinal directions are indicated in the mode columns the δ columns show the relative difference between the frequencies of the plates with and without the magnet fig 10 shows a typical fourier transform of the signal obtained after the sample was disturbed with a short time rectangular pulse the study of decaying vibrations was carried out according to the method described in section 2 information on the spectrum of natural frequencies of the plates was used to provide their excitation with harmonic electromagnetic force under resonance conditions all experiments were carried out at the same distance from the coil to the magnet the results obtained for the cantilever plate case 1 are shown fig 11 for two variants in the first of them fig 11 a the amplitude of the harmonic excitation force was maintained constant throughout the experiment the data obtained demonstrate that in the steady state different vibration modes have different amplitudes of velocity and different decay times in view of the fact that the decrement of vibrations can depend on the amplitude we performed an additional study during which the initial amplitude of the velocity was kept constant for all modes under consideration due to an increase or decrease in the exciting force the results are shown in fig 11 b it can be seen that in this case too the decay times of harmonic vibrations at different modes differ significantly the approximation of envelopes using the analytical function 4 allows us to quantify the decrement of vibrations these results are presented in table 3 the mean square deviation is calculated by formula 6 where δ is substituted for ω and the number of measurements is equal to 10 the values of δ i 50 were obtained at the initial velocity amplitude of 50 mm s which was kept constant during one experimental measurement therefore they are given without averaging based on the analysis of the obtained data it was concluded that the decrement corresponding to one vibration mode bending or torsional mode increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines this tendency is well traced for the lined up bending modes b 0 0 b 1 0 b 2 0 b 3 0 and b 4 0 the corresponding decrements have the following values δ 1 0 3021 δ 2 1 9861 δ 4 2 4875 δ 6 4 5636 δ 8 6 5616 table 3 a similar pattern holds for torsion modes t 0 1 δ 3 0 8155 t 1 1 δ 7 1 4452 in order to determine decrement of the membrane form δ 5 the coil was shifted laterally with respect to the magnet in such a way that the resulting electromagnetic force could cause the plate vibrations in the plane see fig 8 ω 5 in this case a correct comparison of the results is possible only in the case of equality of initial velocity amplitudes see column δ i 50 since the equality of the exciting forces is not maintained similar studies were carried out for a plate fixed at both edges see table 3 case 2 in this case the decrement corresponding to a vibration mode of one type also increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines in particular for five bending modes being considered it increases from δ 1 1 3274 for b 0 0 to δ 7 4 6156 for b 4 0 and for three torsion modes from δ 3 1 1890 for t 0 1 to δ 8 2 6319 for t 2 1 the experimentally found decrement of vibrations is associated with all dissipation mechanisms inherent in the system the internal and structural damping determines its mechanical component and viscous and vortex aerodynamic paimushin et al 2014b with an increase in the amplitude of vibrations the vortex component will play a dominant role due to the formation and detachment of vortices from the edges of the plate for this reason decrements at small and large amplitudes will vary in the examples presented in fig 12 the logarithmic decrements of the first seven modes of vibration decrease with decreasing velocity amplitude but in most cases at w 10 mm s the variation in δ ln is insignificant the above dependencies allow us to assess qualitatively and get a general idea of the behavior of the studied quantities their quantitative estimation should be carried out for a specific case since the accuracy of the obtained values depends on the quality of approximation of the envelope and its derivative 4 2 natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of plates located on the free surface of a fluid the natural frequencies of vibrations of plates during their interaction with the liquid significantly decrease from tables 3 and 4 it can be seen that the difference reaches 30 45 for the cantilever plate case 1 and 35 55 for the fixed plate case 2 the fluid has the most pronounced effect on wide plates with larger areas of hydroelastic interaction a significant decrease in the frequency spectrum for bending modes is also observed for other geometric dimensions of plates and kinematic boundary conditions this phenomenon is widely discussed in literature an exception is the frequency corresponding to the membrane vibration mode its relative change is 2 2 this can be explained by the fact that the main interaction and resistance to the movement during vibrations occur at the ends of the plate not along its lower surface as in bending mode in order to assess the effect of hydroelastic interaction on the frequency of the membrane vibration mode a series of finite element calculations were performed the ratio of the plate length a to its width b was used as a parameter characterizing the geometry of the plate the obtained results showed that during the interaction of the structure with the fluid in the range of changes in the a b ratio from 5 to 20 the natural frequency of the membrane mode decreases by no more than 2 maximum difference this value is dozens of times smaller than the change in the frequencies corresponding to bending and torsional modes thus the results of numerical modeling qualitatively substantiate the obtained experimental data a comparison between the obtained data and the results of finite element modeling see column ω i fem led us to conclude that in both cases the first torsional vibration mode demonstrates a shift towards a higher spectrum values in the case of fluid structure interaction it corresponds to a frequency ω 4 rather than ω 3 as it does before in addition for the cantilever plate the mode shapes m 0 0 and b 3 0 are interchanged with each other in order of appearance in the frequency spectrum along with the added mass effect the presence of fluid enhances the dissipative characteristics of the system which results in a much faster decay of vibrations this is evidenced not only by the increased decrements δ i see table 4 but also by the increased width of peaks in the fourier transform of the frequency spectrum figs 13 and 10 from a comparison of the spectra in figs 13 and 10 it is also seen that at the excitation forces of equal values the normal component of the velocity vector of the plate decreases by more than ten times in the case of its interaction with the liquid in the course of observations it was found that at the lowest frequency ω 1 the free surface of the fluid experiences considerable perturbations in the form of waves which are reflected from the walls of the tank and again run on the plate fig 14 a this leads to a significant distortion of the envelope of the decaying vibrations and complicates its approximation by the exponential one see fig 15 a with increasing excitation frequency the wave amplitude decreases at the frequency of 50 hz they become less noticeable and at 100 hz and higher their influence becomes negligible fig 14 b note that a detailed analysis of the effect of free surface waves on the spectrum of natural vibration frequencies of a circular plate lying on a liquid layer is presented in the analytical study by amabili 2001 here it was shown that the influence of these waves is rather high when the vibration frequencies of the plate together with the fluid are close to the first sloshing modes of the free surface it was also demonstrated that when a simply supported plate is shifted from a rigid wall by more than two radii the effect of surface waves is significantly reduced in the experiment reported in this article the distance to the rigid wall in each direction is more than two plate widths nevertheless the dimensions of the experimental setup were not large enough to reduce the effect of free surface sloshing on the vibrations of cantilevered plate for other clamping options fig 5 case 2 the system execute vibrations at higher frequencies see table 4 therefore the amplitude of the surface waves is much lower and their influence is insignificant the application of harmonic force near the edge of the plate leads to the excitation of both bending and torsional modes the vibration modes ω 3 and ω 4 have close frequencies and demonstrate different damping rates therefore when one mode decays there always appears another traceable mode see fig 15 a since the difference between the frequencies ω 3 and ω 4 is only 14 hz it is impossible to properly eliminate one of them using the fourier filter and correctly construct the envelopes in this regard table 4 shows the decrements of vibrations δ i only for the cases in which the curve was reliably described by the exponent 4 see fig 15 b in a study of damped harmonic vibrations of plates in air see section 4 1 it was demonstrated that the decrement corresponding to one type of vibrations increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines the results presented in table 4 demonstrate that for a plate clamped at two edges case 2 and interacting with the fluid this feature is not always observed in particular it is disturbed in bending vibration modes but is preserved in torsional ones it should be point out that there are some factors which exert a more significant effect on the decrement of harmonic vibrations than on the frequency thus in the case when only the lower surface of the plate is in contact with the fluid or when the plate is partially submerged in the liquid to a depth of h 4 h 2 or 3 h 4 the difference between the values of δ is as high as 10 the second factor is the surface tension due to this phenomenon the liquid does not stick to the vertical faces of the plate at right angles but forms a meniscus the decrement of oscillations will depend on its radius it is known that with an increase in the viscosity of a fluid the damping of hydroelastic vibrations increases to demonstrate this effect a series of experiments was conducted with a mixture of glycerol and water of different concentrations fig 16 shows the envelopes of harmonic vibrations of a cantilever plate obtained for solutions of different concentrations the volume fraction of glycerol is indicated in percent 0 corresponds to pure water the experiments showed that as the viscosity of the fluid increases the amplitude of the surface waves occurring at the lowest frequency decreases a step like shape of the envelope is gradually smoothed out and at a glycerol concentration of 50 the curve can be reliably described by the exponential dependence 4 fig 16 a 5 conclusion an experimental setup has been developed and used to study natural frequencies and the corresponding decrements of harmonic vibrations of plates interacting with air and located at the free surface of a quiescent fluid taking into account different schemes of plate clamping it has been shown that during the interaction of plates with a liquid medium the frequency of membrane mode decreases insignificantly whereas the relative change in the frequencies for bending and torsional modes is an order of magnitude greater the results of numerical modeling qualitatively substantiate this feature the decrements of harmonic vibrations of rectangular plates fixed on one and two sides corresponding to different vibration modes have been experimentally determined their dependence on time and amplitude has been obtained it was found that the damping coefficient corresponding to one mode of vibrations bending or torsional increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines however this peculiarity of the system behavior may be disturbed due to the interaction of the plate with the fluid credit authorship contribution statement s a bochkarev supervision writing review editing a o kamenskikh investigation s v lekomtsev investigation software

electromagnetic excitation 1 introduction in our study the method of laser vibrometry is used to investigate natural frequencies and corresponding decrements of harmonic vibrations of thin plates interacting with a fluid for different schemes of plate clamping interest in the problem is dictated by the necessity of introducing new technical applications which will be able to meet the increased safety and performance requirements typical examples include grids for solid waste filtration used at hydroelectric power plants huang et al 2013 parallel plate fuel assemblies païdoussis 2016 floating airfields and offshore platforms for oil and gas production in the recent literature there has been a large number of publications devoted to a theoretical analysis of the influence of various factors on the natural vibration frequencies of plates interacting with a liquid païdoussis 2016 bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a canales and mantari 2019 experimental studies on this topic are represented by much fewer works in particular modal tests of annular and circular plates placed on the bottom of a rigid tank partially filled with water were carried out in work of amabili and dalpiaz 1998 horizontal circular and annular plates completely immersed in a liquid are studied by askari et al 2013 kwak and amabili 1999 kwak and han 2000 and hengstler and dual 2011 and rectangular ones by lindholm et al 1965 and haddara and cao 1996 the influence of the depth of plate immersion on its natural frequencies is studied by kwak and han 2000 and hengstler and dual 2011 the setup developed by lindholm et al 1965 allows one to change the location of a sample and perform tests on vertical plates partially immersed in a fluid in work of liao et al 2017 the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a horizontal plate the upper surface of which is interacting with a liquid layer were obtained experimentally here measurements were made by the two methods in the first case measurements were taken with a polyvinylidene difluoride based sensor pvdf and in the second case the authors used the amplitude fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry af espi method in addition to these characteristics of considerable practical interest for the dynamics of thin walled structures is the study of damping properties in the case of hydroelastic interaction they can also be determined by viscous properties of the fluid it is necessary to mention a series of works in this field paimushin et al 2014a egorov et al 2014 paimushin et al 2014b 2016 which introduced a theoretical experimental method for determining the aerodynamic and mechanical components of the logarithmic decrement for cantilevered plates performing vibrations on the lowest fundamental mode in a viscous medium the possibility of applying the obtained analytical expression to the case of torsional or bending modes of vibrations differing from the first one is not discussed paper of carra et al 2013 is concerned with the experimental study of the dynamic behavior of rectangular plates interacting with a fluid on the one and or two sides it was found that hydrostatic pressure and the level of liquid in a rectangular tank influence the nonlinear harmonic vibrations of small and large amplitudes the authors also proposed a method for determining the vertical displacements of the free surface of a fluid caused by the plate vibrations a comparison between the two methods of obtaining the natural vibration frequencies of a rectangular plate interacting with a liquid is given in work of khorshidi et al 2017 the first method is based on recording and analysis of the sound generated during vibrations of the sample excited by an impact of a hammer in the second method the measurements are taken by a sensor glued to the plate surface the results obtained agree to an accuracy of 7 and depend on the level of filling the tank with a fluid experimental studies of partially immersed cantilever plates with piezoceramic sensors and actuators were carried out by kwak and yang 2015 the obtained frequency response curves and vibration frequencies found numerically by the rayleigh ritz method made it possible to assess the reliability of the theoretical model proposed by kwak and yang 2013 which takes into account the effect of a liquid by virtual added mass matrix in article of verma et al 2019 the results of the impact hammer test performed both for a dry cantilever plate and for different levels of its immersion in a liquid are compared with the numerical and analytical solutions it was shown that fundamental frequencies for all three approaches are well matched in paper of odintsev 2018 the author demonstrated the possibility of using electronic speckle pattern interferometry espi to study the vibrational characteristics of aluminum rectangular cantilever plates fully or partially immersed in water experimental studies of a disk attached to a shaft and immersed in a rigid tank with fluid covered by an elastic casings are presented by valentín et al 2017 the influence of the mass and stiffness of the covers on the natural frequencies of the disk at a different distance from the elastic housing and rigid bottom is analyzed along with the problems listed above of particular practical interest are the studies of structures located on the surface of a liquid medium and making contact with it only on one side ice floes floating airfields and platforms for example work of yoon et al 2014 a simplified analogue of such structures in the form of a thin plate is studied in this paper using the developed experimental setup the paper presents information on the natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations under resonance conditions and establishes their inherent qualitative and quantitative relationships some preliminary calculations necessary for conducting an experiment were made using the finite element algorithm for solving the problem of hydroelastic vibrations of plates interacting with a fluid bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2016 bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016b bochkarev et al 2018 since the algorithm was developed and tested by the authors in their recent papers it does not come to the focus of this study 2 description of the experimental setup and research technique the experimental setup is a thick walled prismatic tank which instead of the top lid is fitted with a thin plate of length a width b and thickness h fig 1 the design of the tank provides the possibility of clamping or leaving free any of the four edges of the plate which allows us to analyze various options of its fixing the vibrations are excited by an electromagnetic field which is generated by the interaction of a light neodymium magnet glued to the top surface of the plate and a coil suspended from the u shaped frame above the magnet an alternating current of a given frequency or a rectangular pulse is passed to the coil from a signal generator through an amplifier the resulting electromagnetic force acts on the magnet and sets the plate into motion although this method of excitation add extra mass to the system it provides concentration of the force in the pre determined region its advantages also include the possibility of studying samples made of materials showing no magnetic properties the tank is mounted on a metal platform the horizontal position of which is regulated with the help of lifting legs and a digital level to reduce the probability of occurrence of air bubbles at the plate surface we used the following technique the plate is placed in a special groves in the side walls of the tank and is pressed to the wall at one edge by a clamping bar the opposite edge of the plate is bended up the tank is filled with a fluid to the level which is slightly higher than the level of the plate the raised edge of the plate is slowly lowered down which expels the arising air bubbles side ward in the direction of plate movement the excess of fluid is pumped out if necessary the study of natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of the plate was carried out using the method of laser vibrometry the measurements were taken with a polytec pdv 100 digital vibrometer with a sampling frequency of 48 khz and a resolution of 0 3 μ m s in the velocity range 500 mm s the device was mounted on a tripod the tilt angle of the tripod head was controlled using a digital level the vertical component of the velocity vector w was determined using the expression w w α sin α where α 4 5 is the tilt angle of the laser beam to the surface of the plate at rest w α is the measured value of the velocity the reliability of the values obtained in such a way was confirmed by comparing them with the results obtained when measurements of the normal velocity component were taken directly i e at α 9 0 this technique allowed us to study not only bending vibrations but also membrane modes the positions of the points on the surface of the sample at which excitation and measurements were carried out were determined based on the results of numerical solution of the corresponding modal problem by the finite element method bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2018 2016 the natural frequencies of the plate vibrations were determined from the fourier transform of the signal received after the sample was excited by a short time rectangular pulse duration of 0 5 ms for the excitation of harmonic vibrations an alternating current with the frequency equal to the natural vibration frequency of the plate was supplied to the coil from a tektronix afg3021c signal generator through a power amplifier after reaching the steady state the electric circuit was broken which caused damping of harmonic vibrations their decrement δ was determined from the vibrogram obtained from the results of measurements after approximating its envelope by the analytical function the experiment workflow is shown in fig 2 when performing the experiments it is necessary to take into account the fact that the magnitude of the excitation force depends on the frequency of the alternating current this fact is illustrated by the results presented in fig 3 a where the strength of the coil current is plotted as a function of frequency the obtained relationship can be explained by the following factors first the inductance coil leads to the occurrence of reactive resistance in the electric circuit the imaginary part of the impedance which increases linearly with increasing frequency second the coincidence of the frequencies of the delivered signal and the current in the city electric network 50 hz leads to the appearance of resonance in the system amplifier coil thus the amplitude of the harmonic excitation force at different vibration frequencies remains constant only if an alternating current of equal magnitude is supplied to the coil in the experiment its effective value was monitored with an ammeter and if necessary maintained unchanged another important factor is the distance from the coil to the magnet as it increases the electromagnetic force decreases exponentially this is confirmed by the experimental results shown in fig 3 b here the electromagnetic force is plotted against the distance between the coil and the magnet for two values of the current strength in the figure the obtained values are denoted by circles and squares whereas solid lines correspond to their approximations by the analytical function represented as a e b t constants a and b are determined by the least squares method in the course of this study a change in the weight of the plate with a magnet was measured at different distances from the coil to which a direct current was supplied note that by measured values one should understand a certain resulting force referred to the entire volume of the magnet the developed excitation device and the technique described below can be used to determine the decrement of harmonic vibrations for different modes using the obtained vibrograms and to construct curves describing its dependence on time and amplitude processing of the results consists of the following steps step 1 the measured signal is filtered in the vicinity of the examined natural frequency of vibrations using a fourier filter this makes it possible to reduce the effect of noise which is normally present in the experimental data causing distortion of the overall picture step 2 from the vibrogram y w t a working amplitude range a m a x a m i n is selected excluding the initial section of steady harmonic vibrations and the final section after which the vibrations are considered insignificant in the latter case the threshold value of velocity was taken to be 1 2 mm s for comparison a person while walking near the experimental setup creates a perturbation of 2 5 mm s step 3 within the selected interval a m a x a m i n n instants of time t 1 t 2 t n corresponding to the zero value of velocity are found this operation is carried out in several steps first the discrete relationship is used to identify the points at which the function y w t changes the sign then a line is drawn through each pair of points after which the point of its intersection with the abscissa axis is determined step 4 the zeros of the function found on the intervals t k 1 t k k 2 n are used to determine the half period of vibrations and frequency ω step 5 finally the extrema are found on each of the sections t k 1 t k k 2 n the discrete relationship a j t j j 1 n 1 obtained as a result of this operation is the envelope of decaying vibrations fig 4 to construct a smooth dependence of the vibration decrement on time we approximate the experimental values a j t j by the analytical function 1 a t a 1 e a 2 t a 3 e a 4 t the parameters a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 are determined by the nelder mead method lagarias et al 1998 from the condition of minimum of the function 2 f a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 j 1 n 1 a j a j 2 where a j are the values of a t found at time t j using expression 1 the logarithmic decrement of vibrations is calculated by the formula 3 δ ln t 1 ω t d ln a t d t 1 ω t a t d a t d t where ω t are the vibration frequency in hertz using expression 1 and 3 one can obtain the relation δ ln a in some cases for quantitative comparison of the results instead of expression 3 it is more convenient to use the expression 4 a t a 1 e δ t where δ is the decrement the unknown parameters a 1 and δ are determined in a similar way the variants of plate fixing considered in this work and its position are shown schematically in fig 5 the samples of the required dimensions were cut from a sheet of duralumin d16 at equivalent to 2024t in iso 209 2007 by the electroerosion method with a tolerance of 0 02 mm which ensured high accuracy of their manufacture and repeatability the geometric dimensions of the samples are shown in table 1 excluding the regions involved in their fixing their thickness was taken equal to an average value obtained from ten measurements at different points 3 selection of points for measurement and force application the most suitable points for measurements and application of the harmonic excitation forces the points of magnet location were selected based on the solution of the problem of natural vibrations obtained by the finite element method its statement and some aspects of the numerical implementation are described in articles bochkarev and lekomtsev 2016a bochkarev et al 2018 and bochkarev et al 2016 the obtained natural frequencies and vibration modes of a cantilever plate fig 5 case 1 are shown in fig 6 here the solid line corresponds to the undeformed state of the body and the dotted lines to the nodal lines knowing that the points lying on them do not move during vibrations we excluded them from the process of measurement the color scale corresponds to dimensionless normal displacements w i w i max w i except for ω 5 in which case the ratio of transverse displacements v 5 v 5 max v 5 is used parenthesized data indicate the vibration mode classification and the number of nodal lines in the transverse x c o n s t and longitudinal y c o n s t directions the dimensions of the sample are so selected that one can study bending torsional and membrane modes of vibration at relatively low frequencies the data presented demonstrate that the maximum displacements occur at the corners of the free edge of the plate therefore measurements will be taken at point c at a distance of 2 mm from the corner of the plate fig 5 case 1 during excitation of harmonic vibrations with an electromagnet it is essential that the point of force application be selected in such a way that all modes of interest can be realized such a choice can be made by solving the spectral problem using the following criterion 5 f x y i 1 8 w i x y max fig 7 a shows the normalized displacement of the plate along the line a b fig 5 for some of the examined natural vibration frequencies from the data shown it can be seen that at the free edge of the sample x 150 mm w i reaches a maximum in all examined cases the location of the additional mass magnet in this region will lead to a change in the frequency spectrum therefore in expression 5 we restrict the choice of coordinates to the condition x 0 5 a then the optimal values are x 67 5 mm and y 0 mm in the course of numerical experiments it was found that the interaction of the plates being studied with a fluid does not lead to qualitative changes in the shape of vibration modes but changes their order in the spectrum and cause a slight displacement of the nodal lines based on the analysis we glue a light neodymium magnet of mass of 0 1 g diameter 3 mm height 2 mm to the plate surface at a distance of 66 mm from the fixed edge of the plate and a distance of 3 mm from its long side the indent is made for ease of use its position is shown in fig 7 by a vertical dashed lines it is known that in the system with the added mass there is not only a decrease in its natural frequencies but also a change in the vibration modes for the sample under consideration this is manifested in a break of symmetry of the bending and torsional modes with respect to the o x axis this effect is demonstrated more clearly in fig 8 which presents the results of the numerical solution of the modal problem found by the finite element method the location of the magnet is indicated by the circle the relative difference between the natural vibration frequencies obtained with and without concentrated mass does not exceed 2 5 similar preliminary numerical studies were carried out for a plate rigidly clamped at both edges fig 5 case 2 the location of magnet was selected based on the analysis of the vibration modes shown in fig 7 b in this case it was located at a distance of 38 mm from the left edge of the plate and at a distance of 3 mm from the long side the effect of the added mass on the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the test sample is shown in fig 9 the comparison shows that the relative difference does not exceed 2 4 experimental results 4 1 natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of plate in air at the first stage of the study we determined the natural frequencies of plate vibrations in air the average values of natural frequencies for the sample with added mass magnet and without it are given in table 2 before each new measurement the plate was demounted and installed again the values of the mean square deviation s obtained from 30 measurements are given after plus minus symbol 6 s i n 1 30 ω i n ω i 2 n 1 i 1 8 where ω i are the arithmetic mean values classification of vibration modes b bending t torsional m membrane and the number of nodal lines in the transverse and longitudinal directions are indicated in the mode columns the δ columns show the relative difference between the frequencies of the plates with and without the magnet fig 10 shows a typical fourier transform of the signal obtained after the sample was disturbed with a short time rectangular pulse the study of decaying vibrations was carried out according to the method described in section 2 information on the spectrum of natural frequencies of the plates was used to provide their excitation with harmonic electromagnetic force under resonance conditions all experiments were carried out at the same distance from the coil to the magnet the results obtained for the cantilever plate case 1 are shown fig 11 for two variants in the first of them fig 11 a the amplitude of the harmonic excitation force was maintained constant throughout the experiment the data obtained demonstrate that in the steady state different vibration modes have different amplitudes of velocity and different decay times in view of the fact that the decrement of vibrations can depend on the amplitude we performed an additional study during which the initial amplitude of the velocity was kept constant for all modes under consideration due to an increase or decrease in the exciting force the results are shown in fig 11 b it can be seen that in this case too the decay times of harmonic vibrations at different modes differ significantly the approximation of envelopes using the analytical function 4 allows us to quantify the decrement of vibrations these results are presented in table 3 the mean square deviation is calculated by formula 6 where δ is substituted for ω and the number of measurements is equal to 10 the values of δ i 50 were obtained at the initial velocity amplitude of 50 mm s which was kept constant during one experimental measurement therefore they are given without averaging based on the analysis of the obtained data it was concluded that the decrement corresponding to one vibration mode bending or torsional mode increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines this tendency is well traced for the lined up bending modes b 0 0 b 1 0 b 2 0 b 3 0 and b 4 0 the corresponding decrements have the following values δ 1 0 3021 δ 2 1 9861 δ 4 2 4875 δ 6 4 5636 δ 8 6 5616 table 3 a similar pattern holds for torsion modes t 0 1 δ 3 0 8155 t 1 1 δ 7 1 4452 in order to determine decrement of the membrane form δ 5 the coil was shifted laterally with respect to the magnet in such a way that the resulting electromagnetic force could cause the plate vibrations in the plane see fig 8 ω 5 in this case a correct comparison of the results is possible only in the case of equality of initial velocity amplitudes see column δ i 50 since the equality of the exciting forces is not maintained similar studies were carried out for a plate fixed at both edges see table 3 case 2 in this case the decrement corresponding to a vibration mode of one type also increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines in particular for five bending modes being considered it increases from δ 1 1 3274 for b 0 0 to δ 7 4 6156 for b 4 0 and for three torsion modes from δ 3 1 1890 for t 0 1 to δ 8 2 6319 for t 2 1 the experimentally found decrement of vibrations is associated with all dissipation mechanisms inherent in the system the internal and structural damping determines its mechanical component and viscous and vortex aerodynamic paimushin et al 2014b with an increase in the amplitude of vibrations the vortex component will play a dominant role due to the formation and detachment of vortices from the edges of the plate for this reason decrements at small and large amplitudes will vary in the examples presented in fig 12 the logarithmic decrements of the first seven modes of vibration decrease with decreasing velocity amplitude but in most cases at w 10 mm s the variation in δ ln is insignificant the above dependencies allow us to assess qualitatively and get a general idea of the behavior of the studied quantities their quantitative estimation should be carried out for a specific case since the accuracy of the obtained values depends on the quality of approximation of the envelope and its derivative 4 2 natural frequencies and decrements of harmonic vibrations of plates located on the free surface of a fluid the natural frequencies of vibrations of plates during their interaction with the liquid significantly decrease from tables 3 and 4 it can be seen that the difference reaches 30 45 for the cantilever plate case 1 and 35 55 for the fixed plate case 2 the fluid has the most pronounced effect on wide plates with larger areas of hydroelastic interaction a significant decrease in the frequency spectrum for bending modes is also observed for other geometric dimensions of plates and kinematic boundary conditions this phenomenon is widely discussed in literature an exception is the frequency corresponding to the membrane vibration mode its relative change is 2 2 this can be explained by the fact that the main interaction and resistance to the movement during vibrations occur at the ends of the plate not along its lower surface as in bending mode in order to assess the effect of hydroelastic interaction on the frequency of the membrane vibration mode a series of finite element calculations were performed the ratio of the plate length a to its width b was used as a parameter characterizing the geometry of the plate the obtained results showed that during the interaction of the structure with the fluid in the range of changes in the a b ratio from 5 to 20 the natural frequency of the membrane mode decreases by no more than 2 maximum difference this value is dozens of times smaller than the change in the frequencies corresponding to bending and torsional modes thus the results of numerical modeling qualitatively substantiate the obtained experimental data a comparison between the obtained data and the results of finite element modeling see column ω i fem led us to conclude that in both cases the first torsional vibration mode demonstrates a shift towards a higher spectrum values in the case of fluid structure interaction it corresponds to a frequency ω 4 rather than ω 3 as it does before in addition for the cantilever plate the mode shapes m 0 0 and b 3 0 are interchanged with each other in order of appearance in the frequency spectrum along with the added mass effect the presence of fluid enhances the dissipative characteristics of the system which results in a much faster decay of vibrations this is evidenced not only by the increased decrements δ i see table 4 but also by the increased width of peaks in the fourier transform of the frequency spectrum figs 13 and 10 from a comparison of the spectra in figs 13 and 10 it is also seen that at the excitation forces of equal values the normal component of the velocity vector of the plate decreases by more than ten times in the case of its interaction with the liquid in the course of observations it was found that at the lowest frequency ω 1 the free surface of the fluid experiences considerable perturbations in the form of waves which are reflected from the walls of the tank and again run on the plate fig 14 a this leads to a significant distortion of the envelope of the decaying vibrations and complicates its approximation by the exponential one see fig 15 a with increasing excitation frequency the wave amplitude decreases at the frequency of 50 hz they become less noticeable and at 100 hz and higher their influence becomes negligible fig 14 b note that a detailed analysis of the effect of free surface waves on the spectrum of natural vibration frequencies of a circular plate lying on a liquid layer is presented in the analytical study by amabili 2001 here it was shown that the influence of these waves is rather high when the vibration frequencies of the plate together with the fluid are close to the first sloshing modes of the free surface it was also demonstrated that when a simply supported plate is shifted from a rigid wall by more than two radii the effect of surface waves is significantly reduced in the experiment reported in this article the distance to the rigid wall in each direction is more than two plate widths nevertheless the dimensions of the experimental setup were not large enough to reduce the effect of free surface sloshing on the vibrations of cantilevered plate for other clamping options fig 5 case 2 the system execute vibrations at higher frequencies see table 4 therefore the amplitude of the surface waves is much lower and their influence is insignificant the application of harmonic force near the edge of the plate leads to the excitation of both bending and torsional modes the vibration modes ω 3 and ω 4 have close frequencies and demonstrate different damping rates therefore when one mode decays there always appears another traceable mode see fig 15 a since the difference between the frequencies ω 3 and ω 4 is only 14 hz it is impossible to properly eliminate one of them using the fourier filter and correctly construct the envelopes in this regard table 4 shows the decrements of vibrations δ i only for the cases in which the curve was reliably described by the exponent 4 see fig 15 b in a study of damped harmonic vibrations of plates in air see section 4 1 it was demonstrated that the decrement corresponding to one type of vibrations increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines the results presented in table 4 demonstrate that for a plate clamped at two edges case 2 and interacting with the fluid this feature is not always observed in particular it is disturbed in bending vibration modes but is preserved in torsional ones it should be point out that there are some factors which exert a more significant effect on the decrement of harmonic vibrations than on the frequency thus in the case when only the lower surface of the plate is in contact with the fluid or when the plate is partially submerged in the liquid to a depth of h 4 h 2 or 3 h 4 the difference between the values of δ is as high as 10 the second factor is the surface tension due to this phenomenon the liquid does not stick to the vertical faces of the plate at right angles but forms a meniscus the decrement of oscillations will depend on its radius it is known that with an increase in the viscosity of a fluid the damping of hydroelastic vibrations increases to demonstrate this effect a series of experiments was conducted with a mixture of glycerol and water of different concentrations fig 16 shows the envelopes of harmonic vibrations of a cantilever plate obtained for solutions of different concentrations the volume fraction of glycerol is indicated in percent 0 corresponds to pure water the experiments showed that as the viscosity of the fluid increases the amplitude of the surface waves occurring at the lowest frequency decreases a step like shape of the envelope is gradually smoothed out and at a glycerol concentration of 50 the curve can be reliably described by the exponential dependence 4 fig 16 a 5 conclusion an experimental setup has been developed and used to study natural frequencies and the corresponding decrements of harmonic vibrations of plates interacting with air and located at the free surface of a quiescent fluid taking into account different schemes of plate clamping it has been shown that during the interaction of plates with a liquid medium the frequency of membrane mode decreases insignificantly whereas the relative change in the frequencies for bending and torsional modes is an order of magnitude greater the results of numerical modeling qualitatively substantiate this feature the decrements of harmonic vibrations of rectangular plates fixed on one and two sides corresponding to different vibration modes have been experimentally determined their dependence on time and amplitude has been obtained it was found that the damping coefficient corresponding to one mode of vibrations bending or torsional increases with an increase in the number of nodal lines however this peculiarity of the system behavior may be disturbed due to the interaction of the plate with the fluid credit authorship contribution statement s a bochkarev supervision writing review editing a o kamenskikh investigation s v lekomtsev investigation software

21863,this paper focuses on the optimization of self propelled modular transporter spmt load outs in common practice a series of independent sub systems are usually established based on the idea of multi tasking however the conventional strategy features weak capability of finding globally optimal ballast solution thus has inefficient performance in actual applications in this study we developed a new ballast strategy with a unified ballast system the strategy dynamically allocates ballast resources and compensates cargo loads as well as tide variation together by taking globally optimized ballast actions on the basis of the proposed strategy we established the approaches of ballast trials simulation operation duration prediction and feasibility assessment for load out plans then a simulation based optimization method was developed to lower the time cost and prevent loading failures in demonstration cases the proposed ballast strategy was tested and proved to be able to reduce the time consumption by up to three quarters the optimization method was applied in finding appropriate start time barge and pumping capacity for particular projects the above mentioned optimization solutions can enhance the existing analysis workflow and help engineers make informed decisions keywords self propelled modular transporter spmt load out ballast strategy simulation based optimization ballast simulation 1 introduction in ocean engineering industry gigantic offshore structures including jackets modules topsides etc are built in shipyards and then transported to offshore installation sites by barges or semi submersibles the transportation begins with the so called load out process which involves moving those heavy objects from land and onto a vessel dnvgl 2018 load outs can be carried out by means of lifting skidding floating on or using trailers gl noble denton 2016 ali 2014 self propelled modular transporter spmt is a special type of trailer designed for heavy duty site transportation fig 1 shows the simplified structure of an spmt modular unit the platform is supported by a large array of wheels which are linked together by a hydraulic suspension system those units can be combined head to tail or side by side by link pins and hydraulic tubes to extend the platform fig 2 the power pack units ppus are attached to the vehicle providing power and control for combined spmt units the hydraulic suspensions can be divided into 3 or 4 groups the suspensions within a group are connected by hydraulic pipelines or tubes the length of hydraulic cylinders can be adjusted automatically to maintain the level of the platform regardless of the curvature of the ground lu et al 2014 ham and roh 2018 spmt load out is an emerging technique in recent years zheng and wang 2016 the general process can be described as follows firstly the cargo will be jacked up by spmt secured with lashings and then transported to load out quay through planned route as shown in fig 3 the barge is usually moored with a perpendicular angle to the quay a set of ramps or link beams are used to bridge the gap during load out operation the spmt is moved forward slowly until the cargo reaches the specified position ballast actions are taken continuously through the process to keep the barge at a constant level and equilibrium state then the operators will lower the spmt platform lay the cargo onto prepared supporting structures and perform sea fastening finally the spmt will be driven off the barge the enormous weight and dimension of cargo increases the difficulty and time consumption of load out process therefore it is necessary to make a detailed operation plan in advance structure strength is the most concerned problem and finite element method fem is normally adopted to analyze the deflection and stress of cargo barge skid shoes skid beams etc in various load cases e g yang et al 2005 kaup et al 2016 sinha et al 2018 guan et al 2018 an allowable barge deflection envelope can be obtained to show the maximum misalignment between deck and quay that the carried structure can tolerate without overstressing piter et al 1989 sircar et al 1990 kenney et al 1994 as for the ballast plan the idea of multi tasking is usually applied which implies to allocate tanks and pumps to establish a series of independent ballast sub systems e g ferguson et al 1983 kenney et al 1994 andyang et al 2005 divided the tanks and pumps into four sub systems to compensate for cargo weight trimming moment heeling moment and tide variation respectively fig 4 shows an example of tanks arrangement in addition to those sub systems dearing et al 1985 also designated a few tanks for hog correction andpiter et al 1989 suggested using four large compartments near the bow and stern to adjust the variation in behavior that was different from prediction however there are some obvious disadvantages 1 a tide compensating sub system is deployed to make the rest of ballast operation tide independent due to the low precision in estimating the overall operation time the tide compensating sub system is usually required to be capable for a full tide cycle compensation which leads to the necessity of using large ships 2 although the most efficient ballast actions for each sub system will be taken the combined solution may not be optimal e g if the operation takes place in a rising tide condition the tide compensating sub system will ballast the tanks while the weight compensating sub system will suggest a de ballast action these contradictory behaviors will result in a waste of time and ballast resources 3 the pumps and tanks allocation is made statically based on worst case conditions the capacity of certain sub systems may not be fully utilized in normal scenarios to the authors knowledge there are a limited number of studies concerning the optimization of load out plan kurniawan and ma 2009 studied the method of minimizing deflection and curvature of barge as well as maximizing ballast efficiency by optimizing ballast plan however the proposed method considered neither the pumping speed nor the variation of tide making it hard to be applied in actual projects silvianita et al 2018 conducted a time and cost analysis of jacket structure load out however the time analysis was conducted from a macro perspective without detailed investigation on the ballast process besides the loading window of tide as fig 5 shows is another factor that can be optimized if it is chosen unwisely the tide variation may overload the ballast system or even lead to contingencies or failures however there are hardly any optimization approaches except for those based on rough calculation and experiences this study aimed at overcoming the shortages of conventional ballast strategy and developing a few optimization solutions for spmt load outs we proposed a new strategy with unified ballast system instead of multiple sub systems the proposed strategy dynamically allocates ballast resources according to actual load conditions and compensates cargo loads as well as tide variation together by taking globally optimized ballast solution with the minimum time consumption then we developed a simulation based optimization approach for reducing time consumption and failure risks the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methodology of the proposed solutions is explained in section2 then a series of case studies are presented in section3 to demonstrate the methods finally the findings are concluded in section4 2 methodology 2 1 mechanical models this paper cannot cover every aspect of the analysis a great deal of work should be done beforehand to make sure the following requirements are met 1 the strength of all involved components is analyzed in various load cases using fem 2 the configuration of spmt is studied and verified some important norms are a the load of cargo should be distributed evenly among suspension groups b the axle loads cannot exceed the bearing limit of the structure or the ground c the spmt has sufficient stability d the ppus will provide enough driving force zheng and wang 2016 3 the platform deflection due to cargo load should be insignificant apart from making appropriate spmt configuration and cargo arrangement cargo weight management wong et al 2011 and usage of out riggers naqvi et al 2014 are also considerable approaches to avoid serious deflection 4 sufficient securing means are applied the lashing forces and friction forces can balance the wind load and inertial forces relative movements between cargo and spmt are prevented 5 the barge is well restrained in horizontal directions the moorings and fenders can eliminate horizontal movements and balance wind load wave load and friction forces of the tires the model of the hydraulic system of spmt is shown in fig 6 according to pascal s principle the axles in a suspension group experience the same axle load thus the spmt and cargo are equivalently supported at the geometric center of each suspension group normally the platform is set level as the initial state when the trailer drives through an uneven surface the length of the hydraulic cylinders will be adjusted automatically to adapt to the bumps and hollows due to the incompressible nature and constant volume of the hydraulic fluid variation in suspension length of each group sums zero based on these constraint equations the inclination and height change of the platform can be calculated since there are no relative movements the cargo and spmt can be modeled as a combined structure fig 7 the stiffness of the structure is relatively high for three points supporting system the structure can be considered rigid the axle loads of each group can be calculated by solving force and moment balance equations for four points supporting system the stiffness characteristic of the structure is required for calculating skew loads dnvgl 2018 that information can be obtained by analyzing the reaction forces when a unitary displacement is compulsively applied on each suspension group sinha et al 2018 horizontal forces including wind load and inertia force will induce a dynamic moment on the structure the influence can be represented by shifting the original center of gravity cog to an equivalent position while the value of gravity remains the same however ballast plans are made based on static analysis those dynamic factors are out of scope for this study and thus ignored in the mechanical models fig 8 presents a rigid model of barge for ballast calculation the axle loads and ramp loads are replaced by concentrated loads which will be changed along with the moving of spmt deadweight ballast loads and buoyancy are modeled as distributed loads it is assumed that horizontal loads are balanced by reaction forces of the moorings and fenders ship hydrostatic theory is applied to obtain the floatation characteristics of the barge the ballast system of a specific vessel has its unique characteristics its performance depends on the arrangement of ballast pipelines quantity and performance curve of pumps the volume and shape of tanks etc to be more general this study assumes that 1 it is free to transfer water into or out of the barge as well as between any ballast tanks and 2 the water transferring speed of a pump is constant 2 2 proposed ballast strategy compared with conventional methods the proposed strategy uses a single unified ballast system to deal with cargo weight trimming moment heeling moment and tide variation at the same time thus the contradictory ballast actions of different sub systems can be avoided for any load case a ballast solution can be rendered based on the strategy and gives detailed instruction on how to ballast the barge to reach desired status producing such solutions includes four major steps firstly a basic solution can be easily developed which only considers weight compensating and trim adjusting the mathematical model is presented in section2 2 1 secondly the basic solution should be modified to eliminate heel angle of barge using the method described in section2 2 2 thirdly the limit of tank volume can be brought in by taking the procedures described in section2 2 3 finally a iteration algorithm is developed in section2 2 4 to match the progress of loading with different tidal levels so that cargo loads and tide variation can be compensated together 2 2 1 generating basic solution a coordinate system is established in fig 9 the tanks are divided into n rows and m columns x i and y j are the coordinates of the i th row and j th column measured in their centers δ i is the volume of water that will be pumped into the i th row if the barge requires a downward force f and anti trim moment m x to reach the desired status the follows equations will be established 1 i 1 n δ i ρ g f i 1 n δ i ρ g x i m x where ρ is the density of water and g is the gravity acceleration every combination of δ 1 δ 2 δ n that satisfies the above conditions represents a reasonable ballast action there are infinite solutions for this linear system if n 2 a ballast action includes two ways of water transfer external transfer refers to pumping water into or out of the barge internal transfer denotes transferring water between internal tanks for a given ballast action δ 1 δ 2 δ n δ e x t and δ i n t represent the volumes of external and internal transfer respectively they can be calculated by the following equations 2 δ e x t i 1 n δ i f ρ g δ i n t 1 2 i 1 n δ i i 1 n δ i 1 2 i 1 n δ i f 2 ρ g regardless of the execution sequence of pumping works the general progress of ballast will not be influenced as long as all pumps are fully utilized therefore the total time cost t of ballast action δ 1 δ 2 δ n can be calculated by 3 t δ e x t δ i n t s 1 2 s i 1 n δ i f 2 ρ g s where s is the overall water transferring speed if f 0 f and m x can be replaced by an equivalent force with the same magnitude acting at x m x f on condition that m x f x a x 1 x 2 x n we can find the simplest solution ofeq 1 where δ a f ρ g and t f ρ g s in this case only the a th row will be used in the ballast action fig 10 a other than that case at least two rows will be involved here we denote the index of involved rows by a and b where a b 1 2 n eq 1 will be simplified as 4 δ a δ b f ρ g δ a x a δ b x b m x ρ g with the solution of 5 δ a f x b m x ρ g x b x a δ b f x a m x ρ g x a x b then 6 t 1 2 s δ a δ b f 2 ρ g s f x a m x f x b m x 2 ρ g s x b x a f 2 ρ g s if f 0 then 7 t m x ρ g s x a x b m x ρ g s x n x 1 this implies that selecting the farthest two tank rows for ballasting is the least time consuming solution in this case fig 10 b if f 0 and m x f x 1 x n then x a m x f x b m x f 0 we can assume m x f x a x b let λ i x i m x f 0 which measures the distance from the i th row to the acting point of the equivalent force in x direction then 8 t f 2 ρ g s 1 2 λ b λ a 1 1 where 9 1 λ b λ a x n m x f x 1 m x f thus we will obtain a minimum t if the first and last tank rows are selected fig 10 c if f 0 m x f x 1 x 2 x n and m x f x 1 x n then 10 t f x a m x m x f x b 2 ρ g s x b x a f 2 ρ g s f ρ g s the left and right sides will be equal if and only if x a m x f x b m x f 0 since rows at stern and bow would always be selected in other cases they can be excluded in this case to avoid duplicated use therefore the two rows that are closest to x m x f will be used fig 10 d fig 10 depicts all the possibilities of load cases and the corresponding basic solutions 2 2 2 modification for heel adjusting the uneven distribution of cargo weight in lateral direction can be generally compensated by the suspension grouping system thus the heeling moment is assumed to be of small magnitude the principle of heel adjustment is similar to that of trim adjustment fig 10 b if the barge requires an anti heeling moment m y to reach the desired status the water of volume δ i n t m y ρ g s y m y 1 will need to be transferred among the tanks on the two sides fig 11 either the independent rows or the selected ones for draft and trim compensating can be used the ballast quotas should be added to the basic solution 2 2 3 modification for tank volume limit since the hold capacity of tanks was not considered the solution mentioned above are modified for the over capacity cases fig 12 shows the workflow of the modification with the following procedures 1 propose a basic solution i e δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n 2 virtually execute the solution for each tank until the tank is empty or full get the actual ballast action δ i δ 1 i δ 2 i δ n i for the first iteration i 1 3 update the load condition remove the empty or full tanks from usable tank list those tanks will not be engaged in the following ballasting activities 4 if the barge has not reached desired state let i i 1 and repeat the above steps 5 if the barge has reached desired state in the n th iteration accumulate ballast actions for each tank in all iterations to generate a modified solution δ i 1 n δ 1 i i 1 n δ 2 i i 1 n δ n i 2 2 4 modification for tide compensating the above mentioned solution works with a constant tide level however a changing tide case will invalidate the solution because the tide level varies and the barge will not be at desired state with ballast performed therefore the ballast system needs to consider not only the load condition at current moment but also the tide level when the ballast action is done if the estimated time consumption for an action is defined as t e and f b t e refers to the increased buoyancy due to tide variation after t e a solution can be proposed based on the modified balance equation set 11 i 1 n δ i ρ g f f b t e i 1 n δ i ρ g x i m x according toeq 3 the actual time cost t a can be calculated by 12 t a 1 2 s i 1 n δ i f f b t e 2 ρ g s where t a can be seen as a function of t e i e t a f t e ideally a given t s maps to a t a byeq 12 a possible curve t a f t e is shown in fig 13 if t a t e the ballast solution cannot be completed within estimated time for the case t a t e the solution can be executed if the ballast action is conducted slowly but it is not efficient the optimal solution appears at t a t e obviously in some special cases t a cannot be found within a reasonable time span which means the ballast system is unable to fulfill the task in the given situation then it is necessary to reconsider the load out plan and make some modifications in order to obtain the optimal solution the accuracy of the estimated time consumption needs to be improved iteration methods are employed in this study the most typical iteration algorithm which will set t a of current iteration as t e for next iteration is proved unstable the calculation may be divergent and result in infinite loops thus we use an iteration algorithm inspired by the half interval search method the general process is divided into two stages in the first stage we locate a small interval where the desired t e lies 1 set the value of t e for the first iteration t e 0 2 compute t a and e r r o r t a t e for the first iteration e r r o r 0 3 increase t e by ξ repeat the previous step until e r r o r 0 4 the internal t e ξ t e will be the wanted interval in the second stage we find t e using half interval search method 1 set t e to be the middle value of the interval 2 calculate t a and e r r o r 3 eliminate the half interval where e r r o r on both ends have the same sign 4 the search continues on the remaining half repeat previous steps stop searching when e r r o r on both ends are small enough 5 output t e which is the accurate time estimation with the estimated time consumption the ballast action generated based oneq 11 will be a feasible solution 2 3 optimization method the loading process can be seen as a series of discrete steps with different travel distances of spmt for each step the required ballast action and the time cost can be calculated easily once the start time of a load out operation is determined a ballast trail can be conducted by sequentially applying the proposed ballast strategy for each step if the ballast can be completed through the entire loading process a complete ballast sequence and the overall time consumption will be obtained otherwise the trail will be suspended when a ballast solution cannot be produced in a certain step due to the constraints of pumping capacity tank volume or ballast water reservation loadoutsimulator an in house program was developed to implement the simulation the algorithms of both conventional and proposed ballast strategies were integrated in the program then we established a simulation based optimization method which could evaluate the settings of a load out plan based on the results of virtual ballast trails e g the loading process with different start times can be simulated fig 14 reveals the relationship between the overall time consumption and the start times it can be seen that if the timing is wise the failure of loading can be avoided and the time cost will be low other load out settings can also be optimized e g the ballast trials can be conducted with different barges the performance of different barges can be evaluated by comparing the time consumption curves as shown in fig 15 using barge b will lead to the longest operation duration while using barge c may end up with failures therefore barge a is the right choice for this task more description can be found in the following section 3 case studies this section presents several analysis cases to demonstrate the proposed ballast strategy and the optimization method of load out plans the program loadoutsimulator was used to implement the simulations 3 1 basic information a cube shaped cargo was selected for all following demonstration cases its parameters are listed in table1 the center of gravity cog lies at the geometric center table2 presents the specifications of the spmt units based on the dimensions and mass of the cargo an spmt model is developed with twelve 6 axle line units eight 4 axle line units and four ppus the axles are divided into 3 groups to form 3 points support as shown in fig 16 we conducted a static analysis to verify the spmt configuration some critical results are listed in table3 the axle loads and ground pressure of the 3 groups are close to each other and do not exceed limit values thus the spmt configuration is qualified for further load out operation the information of available vessels is provided in table4 and the tide chart at the quay is shown in fig 17 the tide has 2 tidal periods in a day the curve rises and reaches higher high tide at around 6 00 in the morning then drops to lower low tide in noon the lower high tide and higher low tide are reached at about 18 00 and 24 00 in the night respectively the operation will take place under weather restricted condition thus wind load and hydrodynamic loads were ignored 3 2 ballast trials using conventional strategy barge a was selected for the ballast trials in order to make a reasonable allocation of tanks and pumps we investigated the load cases over the entire loading process fig 18 the static load and trimming moment are caused by the weight transfer of spmt and cargo the dynamic load and trimming moment are induced by the variation of static load and moment the axle loads are applied onto the barge discretely which results in the sudden changes of static loads figs 18 a 18 b as well as a series of spikes of dynamic loads figs 18 c 18 d tank volume and pumping speed are the bottlenecks for static and dynamic loads respectively in order to compensate for a full tide cycle a pump with the speed of 3480 m 3 h and tanks with the volume of 6589 m 3 are needed to eliminate the influence of the tide completely when making the tank arrangement only a half of the tank volume is available for allocation because the other half is reserved for the initial ballast the tanks at stern and bow are selected for trim adjustment and thus are used for moment calculation the final allocation is demonstrated in table5 and fig 19 as shown some tanks are assigned for multiple tasks heel adjustment cannot be neglected because it is a common scenario that the forces are not balanced in the lateral direction notice that this is an approximate calculation and the allocation may not be optimal based on the allocation plan we can simulate the loading process using conventional ballast strategy two start times were chosen for demonstration fig 20 presents the produced ballast sequence for the loading starting from 9 00 fig 21 shows the sequence for 15 00 distance in the figures measures how far spmt goes in load out direction distance of 0 0 m corresponds to the position where the first axle line reaches the quay side edge of the ramps time represents the estimated time consumption the number in each cell stands for the volume percentage of water in the tank row as can be seen the tide compensating sub system makes the whole operation tide independent however a large number of ballast resources are used for tide compensation and thus the total duration of about 307min is required in these two trials 3 3 ballast trials using proposed strategy by applying the proposed ballast strategy to simulate the operation with the same start times we can obtain the optimized ballast sequence as shown in figs 22 and 23 the overall time cost can be significantly decreased under certain tidal conditions for the operation starting at 9 00 the process will take about 132min as for the operation starting at 15 00 the time cost will be 73min 3 4 optimization of load out plan the time consumption curves of both ballast strategies are depicted in fig 24 the results of the previous 4 trials are marked in the diagram the tide level curve is also presented to reveal the relationship between tide level variation and loading duration as can be seen the operation can be accomplished at any time of the day using either ballast strategy if the conventional ballast strategy is employed the time cost will be relatively high 307 3min and irrelevant to tidal conditions using the proposed ballast strategy can reduce the time consumption significantly 71 8 174 2min but the results are decided by the start time to be more specific a rising tide is helpful for compensating the weight of cargo reducing the burden of the ballast system thus the operation duration will be short on the other hand if the loading process takes place with a dropping tide the time consumption will increase significantly the same analysis was conducted on all the available barges the comparison results can be seen in fig 25 barge a offers stable performance regardless of the tidal condition barge b has low pumping capacity and therefore costs more time than barge 1 in general the trial will fail if the operation experiences a low tide because the ballast water reservation will be exhausted for barge c the proper time window is relatively narrow in conclusion barge a is the best option for this task we can pick the start time in the span from 0 00 to 6 00 or from 10 00 to 18 00 to acquire a short operation duration of about 80min the influence of pumping capacity was studied time consumption curves of the three example barges with different pumping capacities are depicted in fig 26 as shown the overall time consumption is reduced when extra pumps are integrated the reduction will be obvious if the operation takes place under tide dropping periods besides the range of improper start time shifts towards the extremely low tide and shrinks a little in width fig 26 b the reason can be explained as follows if the extremely low tide occurs in the later period of load out when cargo weight is completely transferred onto the deck the limited volume of remained ballast water will be inadequate for tide compensation and thus the possibility of loading failure will increase therefore the range of improper start time usually appears ahead of the extremely low tide if the loading schedule is tighter that range will shrink and shift towards extremely low tide this analysis suggests that pumping capacity affects not only the time cost but also the failure odds of a load out operation therefore increasing or decreasing the capacity based on demands could be a solution of preventing loading failures for the operations start at improper timings 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the engineering background of spmt load out and summed up the conventional ballast strategy based on the literature we found out that the multi tasking strategy which was widely utilized features weak capability of finding globally optimal ballast solution thus has inefficient performance in actual applications we also noticed that there was a lack of research in the aspect of load out plan optimization then we proposed a new ballast strategy with a single centralized ballast system instead of a series of sub systems the core idea is to compensate the cargo weight trimming moment heeling moment and tide variation at the same time by taking globally optimized ballast actions the ballast resources will be allocated dynamically in accordance with the actual load conditions the mathematical model proves that ballast solutions rendered by this study require less time cost than conventional solutions on the basis of the proposed strategy ballast trials can be conducted to predict the time consumption and feasibility of load out plans we developed a simulation based optimization method which enables the engineers to evaluate load out settings based on virtual ballast trials to reduce time consumption and avoid loading failures in case studies the proposed ballast strategy was tested and proved able to reduce the time consumption by up to three quarters the simulation based optimization method was applied in selecting appropriate start time barge and pumping capacity for particular load out projects the proposed strategy and methods in this study can enhance the existing analysis workflow and help engineers make informed decisions however this study can be improved in several aspects in future studies firstly some other processes with regard to spmt load outs can be included such as detaching the cargo from spmt driving the spmt off the barge etc secondly dynamic loads and elastic characteristics can be integrated to gain more

21863,this paper focuses on the optimization of self propelled modular transporter spmt load outs in common practice a series of independent sub systems are usually established based on the idea of multi tasking however the conventional strategy features weak capability of finding globally optimal ballast solution thus has inefficient performance in actual applications in this study we developed a new ballast strategy with a unified ballast system the strategy dynamically allocates ballast resources and compensates cargo loads as well as tide variation together by taking globally optimized ballast actions on the basis of the proposed strategy we established the approaches of ballast trials simulation operation duration prediction and feasibility assessment for load out plans then a simulation based optimization method was developed to lower the time cost and prevent loading failures in demonstration cases the proposed ballast strategy was tested and proved to be able to reduce the time consumption by up to three quarters the optimization method was applied in finding appropriate start time barge and pumping capacity for particular projects the above mentioned optimization solutions can enhance the existing analysis workflow and help engineers make informed decisions keywords self propelled modular transporter spmt load out ballast strategy simulation based optimization ballast simulation 1 introduction in ocean engineering industry gigantic offshore structures including jackets modules topsides etc are built in shipyards and then transported to offshore installation sites by barges or semi submersibles the transportation begins with the so called load out process which involves moving those heavy objects from land and onto a vessel dnvgl 2018 load outs can be carried out by means of lifting skidding floating on or using trailers gl noble denton 2016 ali 2014 self propelled modular transporter spmt is a special type of trailer designed for heavy duty site transportation fig 1 shows the simplified structure of an spmt modular unit the platform is supported by a large array of wheels which are linked together by a hydraulic suspension system those units can be combined head to tail or side by side by link pins and hydraulic tubes to extend the platform fig 2 the power pack units ppus are attached to the vehicle providing power and control for combined spmt units the hydraulic suspensions can be divided into 3 or 4 groups the suspensions within a group are connected by hydraulic pipelines or tubes the length of hydraulic cylinders can be adjusted automatically to maintain the level of the platform regardless of the curvature of the ground lu et al 2014 ham and roh 2018 spmt load out is an emerging technique in recent years zheng and wang 2016 the general process can be described as follows firstly the cargo will be jacked up by spmt secured with lashings and then transported to load out quay through planned route as shown in fig 3 the barge is usually moored with a perpendicular angle to the quay a set of ramps or link beams are used to bridge the gap during load out operation the spmt is moved forward slowly until the cargo reaches the specified position ballast actions are taken continuously through the process to keep the barge at a constant level and equilibrium state then the operators will lower the spmt platform lay the cargo onto prepared supporting structures and perform sea fastening finally the spmt will be driven off the barge the enormous weight and dimension of cargo increases the difficulty and time consumption of load out process therefore it is necessary to make a detailed operation plan in advance structure strength is the most concerned problem and finite element method fem is normally adopted to analyze the deflection and stress of cargo barge skid shoes skid beams etc in various load cases e g yang et al 2005 kaup et al 2016 sinha et al 2018 guan et al 2018 an allowable barge deflection envelope can be obtained to show the maximum misalignment between deck and quay that the carried structure can tolerate without overstressing piter et al 1989 sircar et al 1990 kenney et al 1994 as for the ballast plan the idea of multi tasking is usually applied which implies to allocate tanks and pumps to establish a series of independent ballast sub systems e g ferguson et al 1983 kenney et al 1994 andyang et al 2005 divided the tanks and pumps into four sub systems to compensate for cargo weight trimming moment heeling moment and tide variation respectively fig 4 shows an example of tanks arrangement in addition to those sub systems dearing et al 1985 also designated a few tanks for hog correction andpiter et al 1989 suggested using four large compartments near the bow and stern to adjust the variation in behavior that was different from prediction however there are some obvious disadvantages 1 a tide compensating sub system is deployed to make the rest of ballast operation tide independent due to the low precision in estimating the overall operation time the tide compensating sub system is usually required to be capable for a full tide cycle compensation which leads to the necessity of using large ships 2 although the most efficient ballast actions for each sub system will be taken the combined solution may not be optimal e g if the operation takes place in a rising tide condition the tide compensating sub system will ballast the tanks while the weight compensating sub system will suggest a de ballast action these contradictory behaviors will result in a waste of time and ballast resources 3 the pumps and tanks allocation is made statically based on worst case conditions the capacity of certain sub systems may not be fully utilized in normal scenarios to the authors knowledge there are a limited number of studies concerning the optimization of load out plan kurniawan and ma 2009 studied the method of minimizing deflection and curvature of barge as well as maximizing ballast efficiency by optimizing ballast plan however the proposed method considered neither the pumping speed nor the variation of tide making it hard to be applied in actual projects silvianita et al 2018 conducted a time and cost analysis of jacket structure load out however the time analysis was conducted from a macro perspective without detailed investigation on the ballast process besides the loading window of tide as fig 5 shows is another factor that can be optimized if it is chosen unwisely the tide variation may overload the ballast system or even lead to contingencies or failures however there are hardly any optimization approaches except for those based on rough calculation and experiences this study aimed at overcoming the shortages of conventional ballast strategy and developing a few optimization solutions for spmt load outs we proposed a new strategy with unified ballast system instead of multiple sub systems the proposed strategy dynamically allocates ballast resources according to actual load conditions and compensates cargo loads as well as tide variation together by taking globally optimized ballast solution with the minimum time consumption then we developed a simulation based optimization approach for reducing time consumption and failure risks the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the methodology of the proposed solutions is explained in section2 then a series of case studies are presented in section3 to demonstrate the methods finally the findings are concluded in section4 2 methodology 2 1 mechanical models this paper cannot cover every aspect of the analysis a great deal of work should be done beforehand to make sure the following requirements are met 1 the strength of all involved components is analyzed in various load cases using fem 2 the configuration of spmt is studied and verified some important norms are a the load of cargo should be distributed evenly among suspension groups b the axle loads cannot exceed the bearing limit of the structure or the ground c the spmt has sufficient stability d the ppus will provide enough driving force zheng and wang 2016 3 the platform deflection due to cargo load should be insignificant apart from making appropriate spmt configuration and cargo arrangement cargo weight management wong et al 2011 and usage of out riggers naqvi et al 2014 are also considerable approaches to avoid serious deflection 4 sufficient securing means are applied the lashing forces and friction forces can balance the wind load and inertial forces relative movements between cargo and spmt are prevented 5 the barge is well restrained in horizontal directions the moorings and fenders can eliminate horizontal movements and balance wind load wave load and friction forces of the tires the model of the hydraulic system of spmt is shown in fig 6 according to pascal s principle the axles in a suspension group experience the same axle load thus the spmt and cargo are equivalently supported at the geometric center of each suspension group normally the platform is set level as the initial state when the trailer drives through an uneven surface the length of the hydraulic cylinders will be adjusted automatically to adapt to the bumps and hollows due to the incompressible nature and constant volume of the hydraulic fluid variation in suspension length of each group sums zero based on these constraint equations the inclination and height change of the platform can be calculated since there are no relative movements the cargo and spmt can be modeled as a combined structure fig 7 the stiffness of the structure is relatively high for three points supporting system the structure can be considered rigid the axle loads of each group can be calculated by solving force and moment balance equations for four points supporting system the stiffness characteristic of the structure is required for calculating skew loads dnvgl 2018 that information can be obtained by analyzing the reaction forces when a unitary displacement is compulsively applied on each suspension group sinha et al 2018 horizontal forces including wind load and inertia force will induce a dynamic moment on the structure the influence can be represented by shifting the original center of gravity cog to an equivalent position while the value of gravity remains the same however ballast plans are made based on static analysis those dynamic factors are out of scope for this study and thus ignored in the mechanical models fig 8 presents a rigid model of barge for ballast calculation the axle loads and ramp loads are replaced by concentrated loads which will be changed along with the moving of spmt deadweight ballast loads and buoyancy are modeled as distributed loads it is assumed that horizontal loads are balanced by reaction forces of the moorings and fenders ship hydrostatic theory is applied to obtain the floatation characteristics of the barge the ballast system of a specific vessel has its unique characteristics its performance depends on the arrangement of ballast pipelines quantity and performance curve of pumps the volume and shape of tanks etc to be more general this study assumes that 1 it is free to transfer water into or out of the barge as well as between any ballast tanks and 2 the water transferring speed of a pump is constant 2 2 proposed ballast strategy compared with conventional methods the proposed strategy uses a single unified ballast system to deal with cargo weight trimming moment heeling moment and tide variation at the same time thus the contradictory ballast actions of different sub systems can be avoided for any load case a ballast solution can be rendered based on the strategy and gives detailed instruction on how to ballast the barge to reach desired status producing such solutions includes four major steps firstly a basic solution can be easily developed which only considers weight compensating and trim adjusting the mathematical model is presented in section2 2 1 secondly the basic solution should be modified to eliminate heel angle of barge using the method described in section2 2 2 thirdly the limit of tank volume can be brought in by taking the procedures described in section2 2 3 finally a iteration algorithm is developed in section2 2 4 to match the progress of loading with different tidal levels so that cargo loads and tide variation can be compensated together 2 2 1 generating basic solution a coordinate system is established in fig 9 the tanks are divided into n rows and m columns x i and y j are the coordinates of the i th row and j th column measured in their centers δ i is the volume of water that will be pumped into the i th row if the barge requires a downward force f and anti trim moment m x to reach the desired status the follows equations will be established 1 i 1 n δ i ρ g f i 1 n δ i ρ g x i m x where ρ is the density of water and g is the gravity acceleration every combination of δ 1 δ 2 δ n that satisfies the above conditions represents a reasonable ballast action there are infinite solutions for this linear system if n 2 a ballast action includes two ways of water transfer external transfer refers to pumping water into or out of the barge internal transfer denotes transferring water between internal tanks for a given ballast action δ 1 δ 2 δ n δ e x t and δ i n t represent the volumes of external and internal transfer respectively they can be calculated by the following equations 2 δ e x t i 1 n δ i f ρ g δ i n t 1 2 i 1 n δ i i 1 n δ i 1 2 i 1 n δ i f 2 ρ g regardless of the execution sequence of pumping works the general progress of ballast will not be influenced as long as all pumps are fully utilized therefore the total time cost t of ballast action δ 1 δ 2 δ n can be calculated by 3 t δ e x t δ i n t s 1 2 s i 1 n δ i f 2 ρ g s where s is the overall water transferring speed if f 0 f and m x can be replaced by an equivalent force with the same magnitude acting at x m x f on condition that m x f x a x 1 x 2 x n we can find the simplest solution ofeq 1 where δ a f ρ g and t f ρ g s in this case only the a th row will be used in the ballast action fig 10 a other than that case at least two rows will be involved here we denote the index of involved rows by a and b where a b 1 2 n eq 1 will be simplified as 4 δ a δ b f ρ g δ a x a δ b x b m x ρ g with the solution of 5 δ a f x b m x ρ g x b x a δ b f x a m x ρ g x a x b then 6 t 1 2 s δ a δ b f 2 ρ g s f x a m x f x b m x 2 ρ g s x b x a f 2 ρ g s if f 0 then 7 t m x ρ g s x a x b m x ρ g s x n x 1 this implies that selecting the farthest two tank rows for ballasting is the least time consuming solution in this case fig 10 b if f 0 and m x f x 1 x n then x a m x f x b m x f 0 we can assume m x f x a x b let λ i x i m x f 0 which measures the distance from the i th row to the acting point of the equivalent force in x direction then 8 t f 2 ρ g s 1 2 λ b λ a 1 1 where 9 1 λ b λ a x n m x f x 1 m x f thus we will obtain a minimum t if the first and last tank rows are selected fig 10 c if f 0 m x f x 1 x 2 x n and m x f x 1 x n then 10 t f x a m x m x f x b 2 ρ g s x b x a f 2 ρ g s f ρ g s the left and right sides will be equal if and only if x a m x f x b m x f 0 since rows at stern and bow would always be selected in other cases they can be excluded in this case to avoid duplicated use therefore the two rows that are closest to x m x f will be used fig 10 d fig 10 depicts all the possibilities of load cases and the corresponding basic solutions 2 2 2 modification for heel adjusting the uneven distribution of cargo weight in lateral direction can be generally compensated by the suspension grouping system thus the heeling moment is assumed to be of small magnitude the principle of heel adjustment is similar to that of trim adjustment fig 10 b if the barge requires an anti heeling moment m y to reach the desired status the water of volume δ i n t m y ρ g s y m y 1 will need to be transferred among the tanks on the two sides fig 11 either the independent rows or the selected ones for draft and trim compensating can be used the ballast quotas should be added to the basic solution 2 2 3 modification for tank volume limit since the hold capacity of tanks was not considered the solution mentioned above are modified for the over capacity cases fig 12 shows the workflow of the modification with the following procedures 1 propose a basic solution i e δ δ 1 δ 2 δ n 2 virtually execute the solution for each tank until the tank is empty or full get the actual ballast action δ i δ 1 i δ 2 i δ n i for the first iteration i 1 3 update the load condition remove the empty or full tanks from usable tank list those tanks will not be engaged in the following ballasting activities 4 if the barge has not reached desired state let i i 1 and repeat the above steps 5 if the barge has reached desired state in the n th iteration accumulate ballast actions for each tank in all iterations to generate a modified solution δ i 1 n δ 1 i i 1 n δ 2 i i 1 n δ n i 2 2 4 modification for tide compensating the above mentioned solution works with a constant tide level however a changing tide case will invalidate the solution because the tide level varies and the barge will not be at desired state with ballast performed therefore the ballast system needs to consider not only the load condition at current moment but also the tide level when the ballast action is done if the estimated time consumption for an action is defined as t e and f b t e refers to the increased buoyancy due to tide variation after t e a solution can be proposed based on the modified balance equation set 11 i 1 n δ i ρ g f f b t e i 1 n δ i ρ g x i m x according toeq 3 the actual time cost t a can be calculated by 12 t a 1 2 s i 1 n δ i f f b t e 2 ρ g s where t a can be seen as a function of t e i e t a f t e ideally a given t s maps to a t a byeq 12 a possible curve t a f t e is shown in fig 13 if t a t e the ballast solution cannot be completed within estimated time for the case t a t e the solution can be executed if the ballast action is conducted slowly but it is not efficient the optimal solution appears at t a t e obviously in some special cases t a cannot be found within a reasonable time span which means the ballast system is unable to fulfill the task in the given situation then it is necessary to reconsider the load out plan and make some modifications in order to obtain the optimal solution the accuracy of the estimated time consumption needs to be improved iteration methods are employed in this study the most typical iteration algorithm which will set t a of current iteration as t e for next iteration is proved unstable the calculation may be divergent and result in infinite loops thus we use an iteration algorithm inspired by the half interval search method the general process is divided into two stages in the first stage we locate a small interval where the desired t e lies 1 set the value of t e for the first iteration t e 0 2 compute t a and e r r o r t a t e for the first iteration e r r o r 0 3 increase t e by ξ repeat the previous step until e r r o r 0 4 the internal t e ξ t e will be the wanted interval in the second stage we find t e using half interval search method 1 set t e to be the middle value of the interval 2 calculate t a and e r r o r 3 eliminate the half interval where e r r o r on both ends have the same sign 4 the search continues on the remaining half repeat previous steps stop searching when e r r o r on both ends are small enough 5 output t e which is the accurate time estimation with the estimated time consumption the ballast action generated based oneq 11 will be a feasible solution 2 3 optimization method the loading process can be seen as a series of discrete steps with different travel distances of spmt for each step the required ballast action and the time cost can be calculated easily once the start time of a load out operation is determined a ballast trail can be conducted by sequentially applying the proposed ballast strategy for each step if the ballast can be completed through the entire loading process a complete ballast sequence and the overall time consumption will be obtained otherwise the trail will be suspended when a ballast solution cannot be produced in a certain step due to the constraints of pumping capacity tank volume or ballast water reservation loadoutsimulator an in house program was developed to implement the simulation the algorithms of both conventional and proposed ballast strategies were integrated in the program then we established a simulation based optimization method which could evaluate the settings of a load out plan based on the results of virtual ballast trails e g the loading process with different start times can be simulated fig 14 reveals the relationship between the overall time consumption and the start times it can be seen that if the timing is wise the failure of loading can be avoided and the time cost will be low other load out settings can also be optimized e g the ballast trials can be conducted with different barges the performance of different barges can be evaluated by comparing the time consumption curves as shown in fig 15 using barge b will lead to the longest operation duration while using barge c may end up with failures therefore barge a is the right choice for this task more description can be found in the following section 3 case studies this section presents several analysis cases to demonstrate the proposed ballast strategy and the optimization method of load out plans the program loadoutsimulator was used to implement the simulations 3 1 basic information a cube shaped cargo was selected for all following demonstration cases its parameters are listed in table1 the center of gravity cog lies at the geometric center table2 presents the specifications of the spmt units based on the dimensions and mass of the cargo an spmt model is developed with twelve 6 axle line units eight 4 axle line units and four ppus the axles are divided into 3 groups to form 3 points support as shown in fig 16 we conducted a static analysis to verify the spmt configuration some critical results are listed in table3 the axle loads and ground pressure of the 3 groups are close to each other and do not exceed limit values thus the spmt configuration is qualified for further load out operation the information of available vessels is provided in table4 and the tide chart at the quay is shown in fig 17 the tide has 2 tidal periods in a day the curve rises and reaches higher high tide at around 6 00 in the morning then drops to lower low tide in noon the lower high tide and higher low tide are reached at about 18 00 and 24 00 in the night respectively the operation will take place under weather restricted condition thus wind load and hydrodynamic loads were ignored 3 2 ballast trials using conventional strategy barge a was selected for the ballast trials in order to make a reasonable allocation of tanks and pumps we investigated the load cases over the entire loading process fig 18 the static load and trimming moment are caused by the weight transfer of spmt and cargo the dynamic load and trimming moment are induced by the variation of static load and moment the axle loads are applied onto the barge discretely which results in the sudden changes of static loads figs 18 a 18 b as well as a series of spikes of dynamic loads figs 18 c 18 d tank volume and pumping speed are the bottlenecks for static and dynamic loads respectively in order to compensate for a full tide cycle a pump with the speed of 3480 m 3 h and tanks with the volume of 6589 m 3 are needed to eliminate the influence of the tide completely when making the tank arrangement only a half of the tank volume is available for allocation because the other half is reserved for the initial ballast the tanks at stern and bow are selected for trim adjustment and thus are used for moment calculation the final allocation is demonstrated in table5 and fig 19 as shown some tanks are assigned for multiple tasks heel adjustment cannot be neglected because it is a common scenario that the forces are not balanced in the lateral direction notice that this is an approximate calculation and the allocation may not be optimal based on the allocation plan we can simulate the loading process using conventional ballast strategy two start times were chosen for demonstration fig 20 presents the produced ballast sequence for the loading starting from 9 00 fig 21 shows the sequence for 15 00 distance in the figures measures how far spmt goes in load out direction distance of 0 0 m corresponds to the position where the first axle line reaches the quay side edge of the ramps time represents the estimated time consumption the number in each cell stands for the volume percentage of water in the tank row as can be seen the tide compensating sub system makes the whole operation tide independent however a large number of ballast resources are used for tide compensation and thus the total duration of about 307min is required in these two trials 3 3 ballast trials using proposed strategy by applying the proposed ballast strategy to simulate the operation with the same start times we can obtain the optimized ballast sequence as shown in figs 22 and 23 the overall time cost can be significantly decreased under certain tidal conditions for the operation starting at 9 00 the process will take about 132min as for the operation starting at 15 00 the time cost will be 73min 3 4 optimization of load out plan the time consumption curves of both ballast strategies are depicted in fig 24 the results of the previous 4 trials are marked in the diagram the tide level curve is also presented to reveal the relationship between tide level variation and loading duration as can be seen the operation can be accomplished at any time of the day using either ballast strategy if the conventional ballast strategy is employed the time cost will be relatively high 307 3min and irrelevant to tidal conditions using the proposed ballast strategy can reduce the time consumption significantly 71 8 174 2min but the results are decided by the start time to be more specific a rising tide is helpful for compensating the weight of cargo reducing the burden of the ballast system thus the operation duration will be short on the other hand if the loading process takes place with a dropping tide the time consumption will increase significantly the same analysis was conducted on all the available barges the comparison results can be seen in fig 25 barge a offers stable performance regardless of the tidal condition barge b has low pumping capacity and therefore costs more time than barge 1 in general the trial will fail if the operation experiences a low tide because the ballast water reservation will be exhausted for barge c the proper time window is relatively narrow in conclusion barge a is the best option for this task we can pick the start time in the span from 0 00 to 6 00 or from 10 00 to 18 00 to acquire a short operation duration of about 80min the influence of pumping capacity was studied time consumption curves of the three example barges with different pumping capacities are depicted in fig 26 as shown the overall time consumption is reduced when extra pumps are integrated the reduction will be obvious if the operation takes place under tide dropping periods besides the range of improper start time shifts towards the extremely low tide and shrinks a little in width fig 26 b the reason can be explained as follows if the extremely low tide occurs in the later period of load out when cargo weight is completely transferred onto the deck the limited volume of remained ballast water will be inadequate for tide compensation and thus the possibility of loading failure will increase therefore the range of improper start time usually appears ahead of the extremely low tide if the loading schedule is tighter that range will shrink and shift towards extremely low tide this analysis suggests that pumping capacity affects not only the time cost but also the failure odds of a load out operation therefore increasing or decreasing the capacity based on demands could be a solution of preventing loading failures for the operations start at improper timings 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the engineering background of spmt load out and summed up the conventional ballast strategy based on the literature we found out that the multi tasking strategy which was widely

quarters the simulation based optimization method was applied in selecting appropriate start time barge and pumping capacity for particular load out projects the proposed strategy and methods in this

regard to spmt load outs can be included such as detaching the cargo from spmt driving the spmt off the barge etc secondly dynamic loads and elastic characteristics can be integrated to gain more

since in navigation field by model based navigation fewer sensors are required which results in lower expenses in navigation dhanak and xiros 2016 jul 23 ansari rad et al 2019 karmozdi et al 2018 furthermore the identified model is applicable in designing the control system system identification methods can be commonly classified into two categories batch fauske et al 2007 xu et al 2013 and recursive techniques eng et al 2015 simon 2008 in batch methods a specific set of data are collected then the parameters of the system are derived valeriano medina et al 2013 martin and whitcomb 2013 while in the recursive methods for any new available data the procedure of identification is updated forrest et al 2018 eng et al 2015 recursive methods are suitable tool in online system identification adaptive controller design and fault diagnosis systems therefore the use of these methods has become more popular geng and zhao 2012 taubert et al 2014 sabet et al 2017 in practice raw sensors data are noisy and not employable for updating identification consequently filtering techniques are employed stochastic filtering methods consist of two steps prediction and measurement update kalman filter is a famous linear filtering technique which is the optimal filter for the linear systems simon 2008 auvs dynamics are nonlinear in each horizontal or vertical maneuver plane although simplification methods can be established to linearize the mentioned dynamics if unknown parameters are augmented to linear dynamics for identification the new augmented state space will be nonlinear in the following the researches in which the nonlinear versions of kalman filters ekf ukf etc are utilized in identification of auvs are reviewed for nonlinear systems ekf in which the system is linearized in every sampling time is utilized despite ekf deficiencies it has been utilized for parameter estimation of auv mousavian and koofigar 2017 pinheiro and de barros 2013 sajedi and bozorg 2019 because of the errors due to linearization in ekf usually other nonlinear kalman filters such as ckf or ukf are utilized julier et al 2000 julier and uhlmann mar 2004 in sabet et al 2014 it is shown that ukf has superior performance than ekf in parameter estimation of known auv parameters in the simulation when the order of system increases ckf and ukf suffer from non local sampling problems arasaratnam and haykin 2009 arasaratnam 2009 therefore for such cases tukf is proposed in chang et al 2012 in addition ukf requires some parameter tuning related to sigma points which is not necessary for ckf and tukf in sabet et al 2017 auv hydrodynamic parameters are estimated using 6dof model augmented state space technique and nonlinear kalman filters in simulation it is shown the accuracy of tukf is the best among ekf ckf and tukf all of the states of the dynamic model are available using outputs of navigation systems however in reality availability of all the states especially attitude which can be represented by euler angles is challenging and expensive moreover a spiral maneuver is utilized for identification which is not applicable for large body auvs as can be seen in most of the previous researches a lot of measurements are required for parameter estimation furthermore sometimes outputs of navigation system are utilized for identification which needs establishing a precise navigation system in advance moreover identification maneuvers have intricate motions which will result in so many problems in stabilizing and control of auvs especially in shallow waters also due to errors in sensors mounting their outputs should be modified before or simultaneously with identification in this paper by augmentation of cruise and steering dynamic model of an auv in a simple maneuver parameters are estimated using sr tukf to ensure the observability of estimated parameters experimental identification is conducted in three steps in this identification gyro output in one orientation and planar velocities of dvl without fusion by other sensors are utilized because of sensor outputs errors due to misalignment between imu dvl it is also estimated in validation step the outputs of the identified model are compared with the sensor outputs in different validation maneuvers furthermore misalignment is validated by investigation of navigation result the proposed method is also applicable in diving model of auv first the analytical diving model should be governed in addition gyro and dvl outputs related to diving plane should be measured the sr

dvl made by link quest inc model navquest 600 micro both mounted in the auv the gps receiver fgpmmopa6b has been placed on the water surface and is connected to the auv by a cable fig 2 the specifications of the sensors are seen in table 2 3 auv mathematical model in this paper parameters of auv planar dynamic are estimated hence the structure of the mathematical model included kinematic and dynamic equations are presented in the following section 3 1 kinematic model as an auv is a 6dof body to describe its position and orientation six independent coordinates are required here sname sname 1950 common coordinates are utilized in which coordinates can be categorized into two vectors as fauske et al 2007 1 η x y z ϕ θ ψ t where η contains position and orientation the vector for linear and angular velocities as 2 v u v w p q r t position of the body is denoted in the earth centered and earth fixed frame ecef linear and angular velocities in body frame fig 1 in a 6dof body

furthermore with another transformation the position of auv can be obtained based on longitude latitude and height from a datum 3 2 dynamic equations of motion auv dynamic equations are presented in various references fauske et al 2007 fossen 2002 hegrenaes et al 2007 although they are different in some terms they have the same structure in jun et al 2009 by considering negligible stream velocity in comparison to auv velocity which is applicable for experiments in lake internal sea the dynamic equation is derived as 6 m v f cc f dl f rest f thrust f fin where m includes inertial terms and added masses f cc is contained coriolis and centrifugal f dl hydrodynamical f rest restoring gravitational and buoyancy and f thrust thruster forces and torques f fin also includes lift and drag forces and torques exposed on auv fins jun et al 2009 usually this 6dof model is not experimentally practical fauske et al 2007 allotta et al 2018 in this paper we assumed that the auv is slender and symmetric therefore auv model can be divided into some separate sub models these sub models include cruise steering and diving which are discussed in fauske et al 2007 in this paper the auv planar model includes the cruise and steering sub models simultaneously the cruise dynamic model is 7 m x u u x u u x u u u u τ 1 n where m and x u are mass and added mass respectively x u is the linear damping coefficient x u u quadratic damping coefficient and n is the revolution of the propeller fauske et al 2007 the dynamic model of propeller is as 8 τ 1 t n n n n t n u n u where t n n and t n u are coefficients related to the propeller fauske et al 2007 another dynamic model for planar maneuvers is steering model in steering model it is assumed that auv has reached to its fixed linear surge velocity u 0 which happens in real auv maneuver steering model is presented by 9 v r a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 v r c c b 2 δ r where a i j are coefficients b i input rudder angle coefficients and δ r is rudder angle fauske et al 2007 here we establish both cruise and steering models together as a planar model by considering the declared assumptions the sub systems of the planar model are decoupled as much as possible 4 model parameters and misalignment estimation in this section the method of simultaneous planar model parameter identification and imu dvl misalignment estimation is elaborated in 4 1 state space augmentation method and in 4 2 steps of parameter estimation are discussed finally in 4 3 the applied nonlinear kalman filter algorithm is explained 4 1 estimation method by state space augmentation by adding model parameters as state variables to the state space if the nonlinear augmented state space is observable its variables including unknown parameters can be estimated due to nonlinear augmented state space a nonlinear kalman filter which can cancel noise effect and estimate the variables is utilized simon 2008 in other words augmented nonlinear state space is like 10 x a f a x ω u ω f x ω u ω 0 n p 1 x a x ω t y a h x ω σ where x is state variables of the dynamic model ω includes the n p number of estimating parameters u is the system input f and h are used for dynamic and measurement models and ω and σ are used for process and measurement noises respectively deterministic observability check of this nonlinear augmented state space can be performed which is discussed in hedrick and girard 2005 in this investigation l l f h l f 2 h l f n 1 h t is obtained using lie derivatives of system outputs up to order of n 1 to have an observable nonlinear system the jacobian matrix of l has to be full rank 4 2 parameter estimation steps as it is pointed parameters are estimated in three steps denoted by step 0 step 1 and step 2 in each step the augmented state space technique is established and the estimator is sr tukf therefore in this section the function the augmented state space and the measurement model for each step are explained furthermore a block diagram of identification procedure and the main purpose of each step is presented in fig 3 step 0 initial estimations of the model parameters are attained by the cfd analysis of the auv solid model obviously there are some differences between these obtained hydraulic coefficients and the real world coefficients of the manufactured auv therefore the mathematical model outputs are not equal to the sensor outputs dvl gyro in reality hence to initial modification of the model parameters the complete planar model and all of the measurements are utilized here cfd outputs are used as the initial conditions in this step the augmented state space based on 7 9 and defining p 1 x u m x u p 2 x u u m x u p 3 t n n m x u p 4 t n u m x u is as 11 u p 1 u p 2 u u p 3 n ω 1 n ω 1 p 4 n ω 1 u 12 v a 11 v a 12 r b 1 δ r ω 2 r a 21 v a 22 r b 2 δ r ω 2 13 ω 0 0 ω 0 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 b 1 b 2 ξ t where ω i are the noises related to control inputs due to model uncertainties and the error in the measured input by the encoders and the rotary encoder which measure the angle of the fins and the propeller revolution the imu frame is aligned with the body frame and ξ is the misalignment angle between imu and dvl which occurs due to misalignment in the heading direction here this misalignment was occurred due to mechanical construction and it has a great value however in more cases this misalignment happens inevitably due to mounting errors of sensors there are also some other errors due to the lever arm and misalignment angles in other orientations which can be neglected in comparison to the considered misalignment error in the planar maneuver of the auv angular and linear speeds are measured by gyro and dvl respectively the measurement model for this step with considering imu dvl misalignment fig 4 and white gaussian noise is as 14 u d v l u cos ξ v sin ξ σ 1 15 v d v l v cos ξ u sin ξ σ 2 16 r g y r o r σ 3 where σ i s are the noises of the measurements before utilizing sensor data for identification the spikes must be omitted and the data must be synchronized sensors do not have the same output frequency which should be synchronized by linear interpolation after this step by checking augmented nonlinear state space observability observable parameters are estimated in the following two steps step 1 in step one state space equations include 11 12 and 17 observability analysis is performed by preparing a code in matlab it is well known that the result of this analysis depends on how persistent is the control inputs related to the identification maneuver the results show that for cruise maneuver only the parameters in 17 are observable 17 ω 1 0 ω 1 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 ξ t in this identification step measurements and their models are 14 and 15 the estimated parameters from step zero are also used as initial estimations for this step step 2 in step two 12 and 18 are the state space equations and measurement model includes 16 and 19 here dvl output is corrected by the estimated misalignment in step one the rotation matrix which is made by the estimated misalignment is applied to the raw dvl outputs in 19 v c o r d v l indicates the corrected dvl output by the estimated misalignment in this step the estimated parameters are also observable and as initial values estimated parameters of step zero are utilized moreover the parameters which are not estimated in this step are assumed to be fixed obtained from step zero 18 ω 2 0 ω 2 a 11 a 12 a 21 t 19 v c o r d v l v σ 2 due to observability of parameters in the two final steps applying these steps increases the estimated parameters accuracy in other words the dynamic model using the final values of estimated parameters are more similar to the real model of the auv 4 3 nonlinear kalman filter algorithm square root version of transformed unscented kalman filter sr tukf is utilized in this paper in this filter instead of a covariance matrix its cholesky factor decomposition is used to decrease numerical problems and to avoid covariance matrix negative definiteness furthermore because of the discrete formulation of the filter models are discretized by rk 4 this filter is completely described in chang et al 2012 and ghanipoor et al 2020 here only its overview is delivered and its pseudo code is described in the appendix a discrete system with the order of n and measurement model is considered as 20 x k f x k 1 u k 1 ω k 1 y k h x k u k σ k where x k is state variable vector in k th sequence u is input ω and σ are gaussian noises of the process and the measurement with the covariance matrix of q k r k respectively this filter includes three parts of initialization prediction and measurement update the first part is performed only once and the other parts are run for every sample in the whole time span in the initialization part sigma points estimation of the state variables x ˆ 0 and error covariance matrix p 0 which in sr tukf algorithm is transformed to a lower triangular matrix s 0 are initialized in the prediction part estimation of state variables x ˆ k and the square root of the covariance matrix according to the process model are calculated then in the measurement update part according to the real value of measurement and its model the square root of the covariance matrix and state variables x ˆ k are modified 5 experimental results identification and validation tests have been conducted in the caspian sea around noor city iran during the tests the sea was almost not wavy and the weather temperature was regular identification maneuver includes a straight path and two major turns fig 5 the travel distance of identification maneuver was about 3 5 km which is performed in about 1950 s moreover to identify propeller parameters its revolution is changed from 720 to 340 rpm furthermore two maneuvers are carried out for validation in the first validation maneuver there are some changes in the propeller turn speed to validate the cruise model the path of the first validation maneuver is shown in fig 6 the travel distance of the first validation maneuver was about 1 1 km with a duration of 600 s to validate the steering mode of model some more heading changes comparing to identification maneuver are applied during the second validation maneuver fig 7 the travel distance of the sections of the path which include major changes in direction was about 1 2 km with a duration of 600 seconds in addition the operating depth of the whole maneuvers were 10 m 5 1 validation by applying identification procedures the auv planar model and misalignment between the heading angle of the imu and the dvl are estimated for the validation step the real control inputs are applied to the identified models and linear velocities u v angular velocity r are obtained by the numerical solution these outputs are compared with the gyro and the dvl outputs after applying the rotation matrix to the dvl outputs obtained from the misalignment estimation initial conditions of numerical solutions are evaluated from the sensor dvl and gyro outputs the comparison between the identified model results and real measurements for three maneuvers are illustrated in figs 8 10 in the implementation to cancel noises of the real signals a first order low pass filter lpf is applied which has led to some delay in the results surge velocity of the auv in validation maneuver 1 changes more than other maneuvers due to changes in propeller turn speed fig 8 in validation maneuver 2 due to more excitation in the steering sway and angular velocities are illustrated in figs 9 10 in fig 9 due to neglection in some hydro dynamical terms for the identification of sway dynamic there are some differences between sensor and model output since the surge dynamic is dominant with respect to sway dynamic this error can be ignored to compare experimental results quantitatively root mean square error rmse between the model and the sensor outputs are calculated which are presented in table 3 to separately validate the estimated misalignment the dvl output has been corrected by the amount of estimated misalignment angle 21 6 degrees then the modified dvl output has been applied to the ins dvl navigation for another maneuver based on the navigation results fig 11 the end point error to travel distance is 1 93 for the travel distance is 6557 meters this result is compared to the navigation result in which misalignment is not considered in this case the end point error to travel distance is 4 07 6 conclusion in this paper to identify an auv planar model and imu dvl misalignment a method based on nonlinear kalman filter is proposed by state space augmentation and sr tukf ten parameters of the model and misalignment angle between the imu and dvl are estimated in three steps using the experimental data of a simple identification maneuver the control inputs of two validation maneuvers are applied to the estimated model and the outputs are compared with the sensor gyro and dvl outputs based on experimental results the estimated model predicts the auv real behavior with acceptable performance furthermore the estimated misalignment is evaluated by applying to dvl outputs when it is used in ins dvl navigation which results in a noticeable improvement in the under water navigation accuracy the estimated model can be utilized in a model aided navigation system as future work the proposed method is presented for steering and surge dynamic but not confined to them it is applicable for identifying diving mode of auv it can be performed by considering diving model and augmenting its observable parameters in this procedure related orientations of linear and angular velocities to the diving model should be measured furthermore tuning the sr tukf parameters r q p 0 requires tuning which may be a drawback of this tool if some non linear hydrodynamic parameters are

diagram of identification procedure and the main purpose of each step is presented in fig 3 step 0 initial estimations of the model parameters are attained by the cfd analysis of the auv solid model obviously there are some differences between these obtained hydraulic coefficients and the real world coefficients of the manufactured auv therefore the mathematical model outputs are not equal to the sensor outputs dvl gyro in reality hence to initial modification of the model parameters the complete planar model and all of the measurements are utilized here cfd outputs are used as the initial conditions in this step the augmented state space based on 7 9 and defining p 1 x u m x u p 2 x u u m x u p 3 t n n m x u p 4 t n u m x u is as 11 u p 1 u p 2 u u p 3 n ω 1 n ω 1 p 4 n ω 1 u 12 v a 11

error in the measured input by the encoders and the rotary encoder which measure the angle of the fins and the propeller revolution the imu frame is aligned with the body frame and ξ is the misalignment angle between imu and dvl which occurs due to misalignment in the heading direction here this misalignment was occurred due to mechanical construction and it has a great value however in more cases this misalignment happens inevitably due to mounting errors of sensors there are also some other errors due to the lever arm and misalignment angles in other orientations which can be neglected in comparison to the considered misalignment error in the planar maneuver of the auv angular and linear speeds are measured by gyro and dvl respectively the measurement model for this step with considering imu dvl misalignment fig 4 and white gaussian noise is as 14 u d v l u cos ξ v sin ξ σ 1 15 v d v l v cos ξ u sin ξ σ 2 16 r g y r o r σ 3 where σ i s are the noises of the measurements before utilizing sensor data for identification the spikes must be omitted and the data must be synchronized sensors do not have the same output frequency which should be synchronized by linear interpolation after this step by checking augmented nonlinear state space observability observable parameters are estimated in the following two steps step 1 in step one state space equations include 11 12 and 17 observability analysis is performed by preparing a code in matlab it is well known that the result of this analysis depends on how persistent is the control inputs related to the identification maneuver the results show that for cruise maneuver only the parameters in 17 are observable 17 ω 1 0 ω 1 p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 ξ t in this identification step measurements and their models are 14 and 15 the estimated parameters from step zero are also used as initial estimations for this step step 2 in step two 12 and 18 are the state space equations and measurement model includes 16 and 19 here dvl output is corrected by the estimated misalignment in step one the rotation matrix which is made by the estimated misalignment is applied to the raw dvl outputs in 19 v c o r d v l indicates the corrected dvl output by the estimated misalignment in this step the estimated parameters are also observable and as initial values estimated parameters of step zero are utilized moreover the parameters which are not estimated in this step are assumed to be fixed obtained from step zero 18 ω 2 0 ω 2 a 11 a 12 a 21 t 19 v c o r d v l v σ 2 due to observability of parameters in the two final steps applying these steps increases the estimated parameters accuracy in other words the dynamic model using the final values of estimated parameters are more similar to the real model of the auv 4 3 nonlinear kalman filter algorithm square root version of transformed unscented kalman filter sr tukf is utilized in this paper in this filter instead of a covariance matrix its cholesky factor decomposition is used to decrease numerical problems and to avoid covariance matrix negative definiteness furthermore because of the discrete formulation of the filter models are discretized by rk 4 this filter is completely described in chang et al 2012 and ghanipoor et al 2020 here only its overview is delivered and its pseudo code is described in the appendix a discrete system with the order of n and measurement model is considered as 20 x k f x k 1 u k 1 ω k 1 y k h x k u k σ k where x k is state variable vector in k th sequence u is input ω and σ are gaussian noises of the process and the measurement with the covariance matrix of q k r k respectively this filter includes three parts of initialization prediction and measurement update the first part is performed only once and the other parts are run for every sample in the whole time span in the initialization part sigma points estimation of the state variables x ˆ 0 and error covariance matrix p 0 which in sr tukf algorithm is transformed to a lower triangular matrix s 0 are initialized in the prediction part estimation of state variables x ˆ k and the square root of the covariance matrix according to the process model are calculated then in the measurement update part according to the real value of measurement and its model the square root of the covariance matrix and state variables x ˆ k are modified 5 experimental results identification and validation tests have been conducted in the caspian sea around noor city iran during the tests the sea was almost not wavy and the weather temperature was regular identification maneuver includes a straight path and two major turns fig 5 the travel distance of identification maneuver was about 3 5 km which is performed in about 1950 s moreover to identify propeller parameters its revolution is changed from 720 to 340 rpm furthermore two maneuvers are carried out for validation in the first validation maneuver there are some changes in the propeller turn speed to validate the cruise model the path of the first validation maneuver is shown in fig 6 the travel distance of the first validation maneuver was about 1 1 km with a duration of 600 s to validate the steering mode of model some more heading changes comparing to identification maneuver are applied during the second validation maneuver fig 7 the travel distance of the sections of the path which include major changes in direction was about 1 2 km with a duration of 600 seconds in addition the operating depth of the whole maneuvers were 10 m 5 1 validation by applying identification procedures the auv planar model and misalignment between the heading angle of the imu and the dvl are estimated for the validation step the real control inputs are applied to the identified models and linear velocities u v angular velocity r are obtained by the numerical solution these outputs are compared with the gyro and the dvl outputs after applying the rotation matrix to the dvl outputs obtained from the misalignment estimation initial conditions of numerical solutions are evaluated from the sensor dvl and gyro outputs the comparison between the identified model results and real measurements for three maneuvers are illustrated in figs 8 10 in the implementation to cancel noises of the real signals a first order low pass filter lpf is applied which has led to some delay in the results surge velocity of the auv in validation maneuver 1 changes more than other maneuvers due to changes in propeller turn speed fig 8 in validation maneuver 2 due to more excitation in the steering sway and angular velocities are illustrated in figs 9 10 in fig 9 due to neglection in some hydro dynamical terms for the identification of sway dynamic there are some differences between sensor and model output since the surge dynamic is dominant with respect to sway dynamic this error can be ignored to compare experimental results quantitatively root mean square error rmse between the model and the sensor outputs are calculated which are presented in table 3 to separately validate the estimated misalignment the dvl output has been corrected by the amount of estimated misalignment angle 21 6 degrees then the modified dvl output has been applied to the ins dvl navigation for another maneuver based on the navigation results fig 11 the end point error to travel distance is 1 93 for the travel distance is 6557 meters this result is compared to the navigation result in which misalignment is not considered in this case the end point error to travel distance is 4 07 6 conclusion in this paper to identify an auv planar model and imu dvl misalignment a method based on nonlinear kalman filter is proposed by state space augmentation and sr tukf ten parameters of the model and misalignment angle between the imu and dvl are estimated in three steps using the experimental data of a simple identification maneuver the control inputs of two validation maneuvers are applied to the estimated model and the outputs are compared with the sensor gyro and dvl outputs based on experimental results the estimated model predicts the auv real behavior with acceptable performance furthermore the estimated misalignment is evaluated by applying to dvl outputs when it is used in ins dvl navigation which results in a noticeable improvement in the under water navigation accuracy the estimated model can be utilized in a model aided navigation system as future work the proposed method is presented for steering and surge dynamic but not confined to them it is applicable for identifying diving mode of auv it can be performed by considering diving model and augmenting its observable parameters in this procedure related orientations of linear and angular velocities to the diving model should be measured furthermore tuning the sr tukf parameters r q p 0 requires tuning which may be a drawback of this tool if some non linear hydrodynamic parameters are
