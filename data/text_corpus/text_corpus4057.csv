restriction plates keywords offshore wind turbines improved monopile lateral capacity centrifuge test finite element analysis restriction plates 1 introduction in recent years with rapid economic development energy consumption has grown exponentially sethuraman et al 2017 the international energy agency iea predicts that global energy demand will grow at an annual rate of 1 6 and that the total energy consumption will increase by 75 from 2008 to 2035 arslan 2010 however 80 of the current energy supply is derived from nonrenewable fossil fuels bórawski et al 2020 due to potential pollution from conventional energy sources the exploitation of renewable energy sources is growing rapidly nazir et al 2020 among current renewable sources wind based energy is considered an environmentally friendly option having the advantages of wide distribution abundant reserves and less impact on the environment wind energy is expected to meet more than 20 of the global electricity demand by 2050 tabassum et al 2014 in addition the ocean area accounts for approximately 2 3 of the surface area of the earth making the development of offshore resources inevitable in particular offshore wind energy is an area of great focus worldwide because of its contribution to sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development li and yu 2018 the cumulative global installed offshore wind capacity is expected to grow from 14 gw in 2016 to 41 gw in 2022 wendt et al 2017 in addition it is estimated that europe will invest approximately 20 billion euros in the wind energy market by 2030 60 of which will be spent on the establishment of offshore wind farms wu et al 2019 according to the offshore wind energy market report of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel the capacity of installed offshore wind turbines will reach 154 gw by 2030 musial et al 2019 in the construction of wind farms the cost of offshore wind turbine foundations including the costs of construction transportation and installation accounts for 30 50 of the capital cost bulatov and nozhnov 2010 byrne and houlsby 2006 offshore wind turbine foundations can be categorized into gravity foundations monopile foundations tripod foundations jacket foundations group pile foundations and floating foundations bhattacharya 2014 ng and ran 2016 o kelly and arshad 2016 the majority of installed offshore wind turbines use monopiles due to their cost effectiveness in manufacturing and installation damgaard et al 2014 by the end of 2019 monopile foundations accounted for 81 of the installed wind power market share in europe windeurope 2021 offshore wind farms are gradually moving toward deeper water to access better wind resources resulting in more severe working conditions therefore the traditional monopile foundation is showing its limitations archer et al 2017 gonzález et al 2018 prada gil et al 2016 as a result two common options are proposed to enhance the bearing capacity of the monopile increasing the pile diameter and increasing the pile embedment depth to the bedrock however these solutions significantly increase the material costs and installation difficulty byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b in europe the pile soil analysis pisa project was launched to study the behavior of large diameter monopiles for offshore wind turbines aiming to improve the design of monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines in a variety of soil conditions laboratory tests are associated with a large number of field investigations to develop new soil reaction curves using winkler type models directly for design purposes a unique database is formed by the analysis burd et al 2020 byrne et al 2019 2020 customized tugs new types of equipment labor construction of platforms and installation of turbines bring additional costs to offshore wind farms leading to a total investment approximately twice that of onshore wind farms musial and ram 2010 this situation requires innovative infrastructure to address current technical barriers in this paper an innovative monopile is proposed by adding restriction plates with different opening forms inside the pipe pile the design aims to intensify the soil plug effect to enhance the load bearing performance of the original monopile the bearing characteristics and the mechanism of the soil plug in monopile foundations have been studied in the literature de nicola and randolph 1993 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 the two most common forms are close ended and open ended piles they demonstrate different installation and load bearing mechanisms and behaviors carter et al 1980 lu 1985 randolph et al 1979 smith et al 1986 szechy 1959 according to the test results reported by szechy 1959 the number of hammer blows required to drive the open ended piles into sandy soil is smaller than the number required for close ended piles it is generally considered that open ended pipe piles are easier to install paik et al 2003 the soil plug will form inside the piles during the process of pile sinking and it is the key factor in determining the ultimate capacity of the pile paik and salgado 2003 paikowsky and whitman 1990 conducted an in depth study on the formation of soil plugs inside open ended pipe piles and the results showed that the end resistance of a completely blocked open ended pile behaved like that of a close ended pile paikowsky and whitman 1990 therefore the soil plug effect significantly enhances the bearing capacity of the pipe pile paikowsky and whitman 1990 randolph et al 1991 conducted a series of centrifuge tests combined with numerical analysis to verify a one dimensional analysis method to calculate the soil plug effect in offshore areas since then several methods for calculating the bearing capacity of pile foundations in terms of the plug effect including the api method rp2a wsd 2011 fhwa method paikowsky and whitman 1990 chinese method construction 2008 finnra method finnra 2000 and cpt based method xu et al 2008 have been proposed several studies have presented methods to improve the original monopile wang et al wang and li 2020 wang et al 2018b proposed a hybrid monopile foundation with an external plate added at the mud line the lateral capacity of the foundation significantly improved with the lateral ultimate load 679 kn of the solid wheel foundation being 4 4 times larger than that of the single pile foundation 153 kn and the lateral ultimate load 453 kn of the gravel wheel foundation is enhanced by 3 0 times the external plate provides an additional restoring moment to the monopile and the passive earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel functionally resists rotational failure the design chart is summarized by considering the configurations bienen et al 2012 demonstrated an innovative monopile by enlarging the pile cross section with wings near the pile head in the centrifuge at the same level the pile head deflection decreased by 50 in comparison to the deflection of the regular monopile for an improved monopile with internal restriction plates the vertical bearing behavior has been investigated through a set of model tests in our laboratory li et al 2019 2020 one hole and four hole restriction plates are designed and the variation in pile diameter is examined the addition of the restriction plates is effective in enhancing the vertical bearing capacity and the installation is easier than that of the close ended pile common methods used to enhance the pile capacity are increasing the pile diameter or enlarging the embedment depth resulting in more complicated installation procedures and initial costs byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b an innovative pile with a one hole restriction plate was successfully installed in ohio usa the ultimate vertical capacity increases to 140 of the original pipe pile while conventional installation equipment is used without encountering any difficulties white and morgano 2016 the innovative pile has proven to be applicable in practical projects however the lateral behavior of this innovative pile currently lacks attention the offshore wind turbine is mainly subjected to the lateral loads and overturning moments applied by wind waves and ice byrne and houlsby 2003 thus the design of the lateral capacity is critical to the application of this new foundation in this paper a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the lateral response of innovative monopile foundations with internal restriction plates the test results are used to verify the finite element model the centrifuge and numerical tests analyze several key factors pile diameter restriction plate type plate position eccentricity etc the distributions of soil pressure acting on the restriction plate and along the pile are characterized in order to understand the pile soil interactions the rotational center of the improved pile is used in our proposed calculation method for estimating the ultimate lateral capacity of the foundation 2 centrifuge test a series of centrifuge tests are conducted on a 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university a monopile foundation with an internal restriction plate is an innovative concept and field test data are not currently available the centrifuge test provides an efficient way to simulate the stress state of soil by testing small scale models under large gravitational loads this testing method enables relatively accurate data for proof of concept models and a relatively large number of parametric studies the maximum gravitational acceleration used in these tests is 50 g the data presented in this study are all from a scaled down prototype 2 1 test models a rigid container with internal dimensions of 27 6 m 12 m 8 9 m is fixed at one end of the rotation arm in the centrifuge and the data presented in the following sections are from a scaled prototype a monopile foundation with an innovative design containing restriction plates one hole four holes is tested and open ended and close ended monopiles are considered as companion test plans fig 3 the pile foundations are fabricated using steel with a density of 55 5 kn m³ the upper structure is made of aluminum with a density of 26 5 kn m³ the total weight of the upper structure which includes a wind tower and a simplified tower head is 71 kn the wind tower is fabricated from an aluminum rod with a diameter of 0 5 m and a length of 13 m and the tower head is a lumped mass with dimensions of 1 75 m 1 75 m 0 625 m the wind turbine models are designed according to a 3 mw offshore wind turbine installed in jiangsu china with a scale ratio of 1 centrifuge test at 50 g 6 in situ wind turbine zhang et al 2015 twelve pile models are considered in the centrifuge tests the piles have diameters of 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 9 m the piles share the same length of 8 65 m and a unique embedment depth of 4 m using these the influence of the pile diameter is studied the pile thickness is 0 045 m this pile dimension is determined based on the wind turbines used in the london array wind farm whose pile diameters are 7 m negro et al 2017 smaller and larger pile diameters are selected to enlarge the scope of adaptability of this study four types of opening shapes are considered for each diameter these include the open ended pile the close ended pile the monopile with a one hole restriction plate and the monopile with a four hole restriction plate the models are depicted in fig 1 the areas of the openings in the two restriction plates are identical the diameter of the opening in the one hole plate is ½ of the pile diameter while the diameters of the openings in the four hole plate are ¼ of the external pile diameter the plates are fixed at 50 of the embedded depth inside the pile 2 2 soil parameters silica sand has been widely used to study pile behavior so it is used in centrifuge tests which wang et al 2018a the particle size of silica sand is small minimizing the size effect of centrifuge tests according to the centrifuge scaling law nicola and randolph 1997 the soil initially has a depth of 7 5 mand a relative density of 70 so it is classified as dense sand the soil parameters are carefully measured in the laboratory and the results obtained from laboratory testing are listed in table 1 wang et al 2018a the pile models are installed at the center of the container and the distance to the pile tip of the container is set at 3 5 m to avoid the influence of boundary effects randolph et al 1992 previous studies demonstrate that if the width of the container exceeds 6 times the maximum pile diameter the boundary effect can be considered negligible wang et al 2017b the samples are carefully reprepared before each centrifuge test to maintain the same initial soil conditions 2 3 testing procedures the pile models are installed slowly by impact driving under a 1 g gravitational load the embedment depth is marked on the pile the soil plugs are observed after the installations of both the piles with restriction plates and the open ended piles a lateral load is applied after the centrifuge spins up to 50 g the linear lateral load which is applied slowly to avoid the accumulation of excess pore water pressure is increased monotonically from 0 to 1000 kn over 200 s the pore water pressure transducers recorded no significant change during the application of external loading this phenomenon is consistent with our previous tests wang et al 2017a the centrifuge tests are treated as if they are in the ideal fully drained condition and the following calculations are performed houlsby et al 2005 the centrifuge tests in this study are conducted under pseudostatic conditions fu et al 2017 kong et al 2021 li et al 2015 the piles are loaded to failure and the ultimate bearing capacity is determined the load is applied by an actuator with an eccentricity of 3 m and an lvdt is fixed at the same height to record the lateral deflection the schematic of the centrifuge test is depicted in fig 2 and the measurement system is presented in fig 3 3 centrifuge test results the relationship between the lateral load and the lateral displacement of twelve pile modes is presented in fig 4 piles with the same external diameter but different opening types are plotted together the piles generally follow a pattern that is similar to that of typical elastic plastic stages the rate of increase for the close ended pile at larger diameters is relatively larger than that of the other piles the close ended pile is a displacement pile the increase in of soil strength around the pile provided by 1 g of jacking installation is likely to be overcome under larger gravitational levels finally the lateral deflection of the pile continues to increase while the recorded lateral load becomes steady showing that the ultimate stage has been reached as shown in fig 4 the ultimate lateral capacities of the monopile with restriction plates are larger than those of the original open ended piles for the same pile diameter the four hole restriction plate creates a more noticeable enhancement than to the one hole restriction plate the total areas of the openings in the one hole plate and in the four hole plate are the same however the four hole shape more strongly compresses the soil inside the pile leading to a more noteworthy plug effect as a result the ultimate lateral capacity sees a greater improvement meanwhile the initial stiffnesses of the four opening type piles are similar the restriction plate does not significantly influence the small defalcation stages the improvements to the lateral capacity of piles with different diameters vary the improvements seen by the 0 95 m diameter pile is almost evenly distributed across different pile opening types but it increases dramatically for larger pile diameters of 1 27 m and 1 9 m the mechanism of adding the restriction plate intensifies the soil plug effect and the soil plug forms more easily with a small diameter therefore the addition of the restriction plate is more effective for large diameter piles inside which the soil plug is unlikely to form initially with the compression induced by the restriction plates the piles with restriction plates behave as if they are a close ended to demonstrate the influences of the type of opening in the pile and the pile diameter the ultimate lateral capacity of the piles is extracted from the load displacement curves table 2 several methods have been proposed to locate the final stage during pile failure including 1 finding the maximum value on the load displacement curve mcdowell 2002 2 finding the points with the most significant change on the load displacement curve byrne et al 2003 and 3 determining when the lateral displacement reaches 10 of the pile diameter byrne et al 2019 the curves recorded in this set of centrifuge tests slightly decrease after the peak values therefore the ultimate lateral capacity is determined as the maximum value i e the point at which the slope is approximately 0 to display the trends more clearly the ultimate lateral capacities are plotted against pile diameters in fig 5 a and the four pile opening types are plotted together the ultimate lateral capacity tends to increase with the pile diameter but with smaller increments however the effect of the pile diameter is not significant for the open ended monopile in addition the improved monopiles with internal restriction plates showed a larger lateral capacity than the open ended monopile these piles behave like close ended piles with diameters of 1 9 m and a similar capacity to clarify the influence of the methods used to determine the ultimate lateral capacity data satisfying the criterium of 10 d are plotted in fig 5b for comparison the general trends are consistent for these two methods so the difference is not considered a uniform criterion for the maximum values is used in the following calculations in addition the increment ratio is calculated by normalizing the ultimate lateral capacity of the corresponding open ended monopile as listed in table 2 the four hole restriction plate is more effective than the one hole restriction plate although the total areas of their openings are the same the area of a single hole in the four hole restraint plate is smaller leading to a more intense soil plug effect meanwhile the large diameter pile demonstrates a much larger increment ratio the soil plug effect is not pronounced for increased pile diameters since the constraint provided by the pile shaft is not enough to bond the soil therefore the restriction plate is more effective for monopiles with a large diameter in practical applications installing the internal restriction plate instead of continuously enlarging the pile diameter would be recommended this is a promising method for to reduction of construction and installation costs of offshore wind turbines 4 finite element modeling numerical analysis is performed using the finite element analysis software abaqus manual 2010 configurations for the finite element model of monopile foundations are determined based on the models used in the centrifuge tests four types of monopiles are built and the upper structure has the unique design matching the abovementioned test model as shown in fig 6 the soil body is built as a cylinder since the pile is a cylindrical structure to eliminate the influence of boundary effects the diameter of the soil body is determined to be 10 m and the thickness is set at 20 m the soil is modeled as an elastic plastic material using the mohr coulomb model the pile and the superstructure are simulated as elastic perfectly plastic materials the soil parameters in the numerical model are consistent with the centrifuge test data listed in table 1 the material properties of the models are summarized in table 3 this study does not simulate the installation process so monopiles are built wish in place with small strain finite element ssfe analyses zhang et al 2011 the mohr coulomb friction penalty function is used for the pile soil interface with a frictional coefficient of 0 3 the restraint plate and the steel pipe pile are welded for integrity the wind tower tower head and pile are held in place by binding restraints during the loading process of the fem analysis gravity is first applied to the soil and it is specified as being along the positive z axis the stress balance is used to establish the geostatic stresses and avoid soil deforming under its self weight afterward structural and foundational self weights are applied finally external loadings are applied at the position with an eccentricity of 3 m using the displacement control method the reliability of this loading method has been validated by several researchers lu and zhang 2020 luan et al 2006 the numerical simulation is carried through by using hexahedral eight node linear reduced integral cell c3d8r in the lateral direction the model is divided into four regions and all model components are divided by structural meshes the soil body and soil plug mesh are sparse at the boundary and become denser toward the center in the vertical direction the soil body is divided into two regions the total number of cells was between 130 000 and 140 000 fig 7 shows a typical c mesh from the fem model the improved monopiles with one hole and four hole restriction plates are plotted separately 5 validation to verify the reliability of the numerical model and to better understand pile soil interactions the load displacement curves from the fe analysis are plotted together with the centrifuge test results in fig 8 an improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate is typically used for validation overall the lateral behavior of the piles from the numerical analysis agrees with the centrifuge tests the general trends are similar and the ultimate lateral capacity that is estimated falls inside an acceptable range the load displacement curves of the centrifuge tests initially show greater stiffness than the numerical results and this is identical to the previous test results yang et al 2018 2019 for small lateral displacements it is difficult to precisely control the stiffness due to equipment limitations the servo device of the loading system has hysteretic effects during the transfer of the load and it is difficult to measure displacements at very small load levels the fe model defines the loading function based on a simple geometry for the cell area without considering the complex boundary conditions of the entire defined domain in addition the piles are installed by impact driving under 1 g while the installation method in the numerical model is wish in place the post installation soil state is not well captured by the fe model especially at 50 g the initial stress increase due to the driving process is likely to be overcome by the enhancement of the subsequent stress increase due to the self weight at larger gravitational loads de nicola and randolph 1997 the wish in place piles demonstrate the softest load displacement response and the estimated lateral capacity is generally conservative these phenomena agree well with previous studies fan et al 2019 in addition the young s modulus of the material is assumed to be a constant value in the fe model however the soil pile interaction is likely to change the soil properties during the initial stage of the centrifuge test similar effects are observed for poisson s ratio and the interface coefficient ma et al 2019 the main focus of this study is to investigate the lateral response of innovative piles under the ultimate limit state uls the ultimate lateral capacity is the key result in the following analysis this set of numerical models is useful for estimating the ultimate capacity which is applicable to the assessment of soil pile interactions 6 sensitivity study offshore wind turbines are installed under complex environmental conditions where the soil parameters are not well defined a large number of tests with variable soil conditions are not feasible hence a sensitivity analysis of soil properties is undertaken using numerical simulation an improved monopile with a diameter of 1 27 m and a four hole restriction plate is selected as the control model the soil parameters including young s modulus e internal friction angle φ dilation angle ψ and poisson s ratio μ are considered and the values are chosen according to literature to match the soil conditions in offshore applications randolph et al 1991 thieken et al 2015 in the analysis of the following parameters the elastic modulus of the soil e is taken to be in the range of 10 mpa 60 mpa the internal friction angle φ is in the range of 30 36 the dilation angle is in the range of 1 13 and poisson s ratio μ is selected to have the range 0 0 4 the sensitivity study results are demonstrated in fig 9 in general the lateral capacity of the improved pile increases with young s modulus but the change is not significant and tends to become small the soil encounters a large deformation during external loading and enters a fully plastic state the influence of e weakens gradually as demonstrated in fig 9b the lateral capacity increases with the friction angle in a constant manner the enhancement is more pronounced in contrast the influences of the dilation angle and poisson s ratio are not intense the friction angle reflects the frictional coefficient at the pile soil interface so the lateral earth pressure coefficient is affected in conclusion to ensure an accurate estimate of the lateral capacity the internal friction angle should be determined carefully during the analysis 7 parametric study 7 1 effects of pile diameter from the results of the centrifuge model test it can be seen that the pile diameter has significant effects on the characteristics of the monopiles a group of fe models is built with pile diameters of 1 10 times the minimum pile diameter of the centrifuge tests with the remaining parameters are set at default values as listed in tables 1 and 3 the load displacement curves of the two improved monopiles with variable diameters are plotted in fig 10 the ultimate lateral capacity and the initial stiffness increase significantly with the pile diameter and the improvement tends to become greater with increasing diameter the lateral capacity experiences a sizeable jump when the pile diameter exceeds 7 6 m and enters the category of as large diameter piles for offshore applications negro et al 2017 in addition at large pile diameters the load displacement curve reaches a peak and then decreases gradually the yielding point moves forward and fewer deformations are appearing when reaching failure a comparative analysis of fig 10a and b shows that the increase in the horizontal ultimate load of the monopile with a four hole restraint plate is slightly larger than that of the monopile with a one hole restraint plate the addition of the four hole plate makes the pile more sensitive to the change in diameter to more directly demonstrate the influence of the pile diameter on the piles with one hole and four hole restraint plates the ultimate lateral capacities of the piles with the two types of restriction plates are extracted and plotted against the pile diameter in fig 11 in addition to the increased enhancement the four hole restriction plate is more effective than the one hole plate but not significantly 7 2 effects of depth of restraint plate the position of the restriction plate is defined as 50 of the embedment depth of the monopile in the centrifuge tests in the numerical models the plate height is designed at 10 30 50 and 70 of the penetration depth for parametric study a monopile with a diameter of 1 27 m is selected as the control model since the restriction plate is more effective at large diameters as shown above both the one hole and four hole conditions are considered the relationship between lateral load and displacement is depicted in fig 12 the lateral capacity does not show differences when the plate position is changed the reason may be that the pile is buried at a small depth and the plate position is unlikely to affect the formation of the soil plug in this range 7 3 effect of load eccentricity the influence of the loading point namely the eccentricity is demonstrated in fig 13 to represent the combined effect of complex loading conditions the loadings are simplified as a point load in the tests and in the fe models the eccentricity is defined as the distance from the loading point to the mud line an improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate with a diameter of 1 27 m is selected as the control model the initial stiffness decreases with increasing load eccentricity similarly the lateral capacity experiences an obvious decline with increasing eccentricity the influence tends to be less intense at higher positions the difference between 1 m and 2 m is almost 3 times the difference between 4 m and 5 m the offshore wind structure is sensitive to tilt failure and hence the external loading characteristics should be carefully examined before the design process 8 analysis 8 1 pile soil interactions the fe model enables the analysis of soil pile interactions of different models and the effect of adding restraint plates fig 14 depicts the distribution of soil pressures with the addition of one hole and four hole restraint plates at different pile diameters d 0 95 m 1 27 m 1 9 m the soil pressure is larger beneath the upwind side of the restriction plate the piles tend to incline under lateral loadings making a larger extrusion between the restraint plates and the soil plug for the same pile diameter the maximum soil pressure acting on the one hole restriction plate is smaller than that on the four hole plate and the middle section of the four hole plate contributes some capacities simultaneously in more than one capacity it can be concluded that the addition of a four hole plate is more effective than the addition of a one hole plate therefore the lateral capacity of the improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate is increased and this agrees with the test results presented above for the same type of restriction plate the soil pressure acting on the restraint plate decreases gradually with increasing pile diameter the soil is not tightly squeezed at larger diameters in other words the plug effect weakens however the cross sectional area is much larger leading to a larger total lateral resistance than that of the original pipe pile to explore the bearing mechanism of the improved monopile the earth contact pressures between the pile and the surrounding soil are analyzed using the finite element model the final state is presented and shown in fig 15 the shapes of the earth pressure distribution with depth are quite similar for all pile models the main difference in the soil stress distribution appears beneath the position where the restriction plates are added the area of passive earth pressure is enhanced parallel to the loading direction while the difference is not obvious in the direction opposing the loading the soil pressure increases significantly due to the soil plug effect and improved piles behave as if they are close ended piles for a specific pile diameter the four hole pile bears larger earth pressure than the one hole pile leading to a larger total capacity additionally the difference in earth pressure becomes milder with increasing pile diameter the soil plug effect enables the pile to work together with the internal soil fig 16 depicts the soil pressure distributions of different piles along the pile cross section the values are extracted from the depth at which the maximum value of earth pressure is reached for the close ended pile a typical plot of the 1 9 m diameter pile is selected the lateral earth pressure is maximum at the center in the upwind direction and decreases to almost zero at the two edges following a cosine distribution this phenomenon agrees well with previously reported data and is applicable to all pile models and depths prasad and chari 1999 this inhomogeneous distribution of earth pressure should be taken into account in theoretical calculations of the foundation bearing capacity 8 2 center of rotation the final state lateral deflections along the pile for different pile diameters are depicted in fig 15 from the figure it can be seen that the deflection of the open ended monopile is larger than that of the improved piles especially in the case of the monopile with an added four hole restraint plate the final deflection is the same as that of the close ended monopile however the deflections demonstrate a similar trend at a large diameter of 1 27 m the addition of the restriction plate is not influential in this condition the overturning stability of the foundation is related to the position of its center of rotational center which is defined as the point where the deflection is 0 in the entire plastic deformation region inside the monopile foundation the intersections of the deflection curve with the longitudinal axis are enlarged in fig 17 it is demonstrated that the center of rotation center of the improved monopiles shift upward for small pile diameters while this change becomes less intense with increasing pile diameter the influences of the four hole restriction plate and the one hole restriction plate are similar the centers of rotation of the improved monopiles are located between 3 3 m and 3 5 m below the mud line which is approximately 80 of the pile embedment depth the vector field plots of the monopiles in the final state which depicts the variation of the center of rotation in the horizontal direction are plotted in figs 18 20 the centers of rotation of the open ended and close ended monopiles are located close to the central axis of the pile with a diameter of 0 95 m in contrast the centers of rotation of the improved monopiles are offset in the horizontal direction with increasing pile diameter the centers of rotation of the four different piles become located close to the central axis 8 3 modified calculation an improved monopile with a restriction plate is an innovative design for foundations of offshore wind turbines the ultimate bearing capacity under pure vertical loading conditions has been investigated and a simplified design method has been proposed li et al 2020 the lateral response is a key aspect of the design of an offshore wind turbine therefore a theoretical calculation is proposed in this section to give an initial estimation of the lateral capacity of this new foundation based on the results of centrifuge model tests and the fe model the earth pressure of the improved monopile is distributed in the same manner as the pressure of the original monopile the rotational center is assumed to be at 80 of the penetration depth and the offset along the horizontal direction is not considered at this stage the differences between the two restriction plates are not significant therefore the contact pressure along the pile s longitudinal section is assumed to be a polygonal line as shown in fig 21 a in addition the soil pressure is not uniformly distributed across the pile diameter as illustrated above the distribution is assumed to be a semiellipse as depicted in fig 21b the lateral capacity f of the improved monopile can be expressed as 1 f 0 l s p z d d z where f is the lateral capacity l is the penetration length pz is the soil pressure along the pile at any position below the soil surface and d is the pile diameter z represents position below the buried surface of the pile and s is the shape parameter describing the inhomogeneous distribution of soil pressure along the pile diameter the earth pressure is generally calculated using two methods coulomb s theory and rankine s theory which are expressed as 2 c o u l o m b s t h e o r y p z 1 2 γ l 2 k c 3 r a n k i n e s t h e o r y p z γ l k r 4 k c c o s 2 φ ε c o s 2 ε cos ε σ 1 sin φ σ sin φ β cos ε σ cos ε β 2 5 k r t a n 2 45 φ 2 where γ represents the effective density of the soil kc and kr represent the passive soil pressure coefficients of coulomb and rankine s theory respectively φ denotes the internal friction angle of the soil ε is the angle between the pile and the vertical axis δ represents the interface friction angle and β represents the soil s angle with respect to the horizontal plane rankine s theory assumes a pure smoothing for the pile surface ignoring pile soil interface friction the calculated soil pressure is often smaller and has a large discrepancy with the centrifuge tests described above coulomb s theory assumes that the soil is cohesionless which is consistent with the nature of the soil used in the centrifuge test and the calculated results are greater than results from rankin s theory therefore the ultimate lateral capacity is calculated using coulomb s theory 6 f 0 l s p z d d z 1 2 0 l s γ z 2 k c d d z 10 5 sd l 3 for different load eccentricities e the lateral capacity of the improved monopile can be estimated using the following equation 7 f e 0 l s p z d l e 1 d z 1 2 0 l s γ z 2 k c d l e 1 d z 10 5 sd l 4 e 1 the calculated results are compared with the centrifuge tests in table 4 the shape factors are calculated the shape factor decreases with the opening area the open ended pile shows the smallest shape factor while the close ended pile reaches the largest value especially at smaller diameters the soil around the pile is more effective in the close ended form in general the shape factor tends to decrease with increasing pile diameter the disturbance of soil is not as significant at smaller diameters the difference is obvious at the small diameter of 0 95 m for the one hole and four hole restriction plates the difference becomes much less noticeable at large diameters the lateral capacity of the improved monopile with an internal restriction plate is estimated to be in the range of 0 6 0 8 the shape factor reflects the nonuniform distribution of soil pressure along the pile cross section and it also demonstrates the effect of the restriction plate when the pile diameter is larger than 1 27 m the shape factors of the one hole plate and the four hole plate are assumed to be constant the plug effect is intense for this pile diameter regardless of the opening form of the restriction plate this calculation method is more applicable for a rigid pile in cohesionless

development energy consumption has grown exponentially sethuraman et al 2017 the international energy agency iea predicts that global energy demand will grow at an annual rate of 1 6 and that the total energy consumption will increase by 75 from 2008 to 2035 arslan 2010 however 80 of the current energy supply is derived from nonrenewable fossil fuels bórawski et al 2020 due to potential pollution from conventional energy sources the exploitation of renewable energy sources is growing rapidly nazir et al 2020 among current renewable sources wind based energy is considered an environmentally friendly option having the advantages of wide distribution abundant reserves and less impact on the environment wind energy is expected to meet more than 20 of the global electricity demand by 2050 tabassum et al 2014 in addition the ocean area accounts for approximately 2 3 of the surface area of the earth making the development of offshore resources inevitable in particular offshore wind energy is an area of great focus worldwide because of its contribution to sustainable socioeconomic and environmental development li and yu 2018 the cumulative global installed offshore wind capacity is expected to grow from 14 gw in 2016 to 41 gw in 2022 wendt et al 2017 in addition it is estimated that europe will invest approximately 20 billion euros in the wind energy market by 2030 60 of which will be spent on the establishment of offshore wind farms wu et al 2019 according to the offshore wind energy market report of the national renewable energy laboratory nrel the capacity of installed offshore wind turbines will reach 154 gw by 2030 musial et al 2019 in the construction of wind farms the cost of offshore wind turbine foundations including the costs of construction transportation and installation accounts for 30 50 of the capital cost bulatov and nozhnov 2010 byrne and houlsby 2006 offshore wind turbine foundations can be categorized into gravity foundations monopile foundations tripod foundations jacket foundations group pile foundations and floating foundations bhattacharya 2014 ng and ran 2016 o kelly and arshad 2016 the majority of installed offshore wind turbines use monopiles due to their cost effectiveness in manufacturing and installation damgaard et al 2014 by the end of 2019 monopile foundations accounted for 81 of the installed wind power market share in europe windeurope 2021 offshore wind farms are gradually moving toward deeper water to access better wind resources resulting in more severe working conditions therefore the traditional monopile foundation is showing its limitations archer et al 2017 gonzález et al 2018 prada gil et al 2016 as a result two common options are proposed to enhance the bearing capacity of the monopile increasing the pile diameter and increasing the pile embedment depth to the bedrock however these solutions significantly increase the material costs and installation difficulty byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b in europe the pile soil analysis pisa project was launched to study the behavior of large diameter monopiles for offshore wind turbines aiming to improve the design of monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines in a variety of soil conditions laboratory tests are associated with a large number of field investigations to develop new soil reaction curves using winkler type models directly for design purposes a unique database is formed by the analysis burd et al 2020 byrne et al 2019 2020 customized tugs new types of equipment labor construction of platforms and installation of turbines bring additional costs to offshore wind farms leading to a total investment approximately twice that of onshore wind farms musial and ram 2010 this situation requires innovative infrastructure to address current technical barriers in this paper an innovative monopile is proposed by adding restriction plates with different opening forms inside the pipe pile the design aims to intensify the soil plug effect to enhance the load bearing performance of the original monopile the bearing characteristics and the mechanism of the soil plug in monopile foundations have been studied in the literature de nicola and randolph 1993 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 the two most common forms are close ended and open ended piles they demonstrate different installation and load bearing mechanisms and behaviors carter et al 1980 lu 1985 randolph et al 1979 smith et al 1986 szechy 1959 according to the test results reported by szechy 1959 the number of hammer blows required to drive the open ended piles into sandy soil is smaller than the number required for close ended piles it is generally considered that open ended pipe piles are easier to install paik et al 2003 the soil plug will form inside the piles during the process of pile sinking and it is the key factor in determining the ultimate capacity of the pile paik and salgado 2003 paikowsky and whitman 1990 conducted an in depth study on the formation of soil plugs inside open ended pipe piles and the results showed that the end resistance of a completely blocked open ended pile behaved like that of a close ended pile paikowsky and whitman 1990 therefore the soil plug effect significantly enhances the bearing capacity of the pipe pile paikowsky and whitman 1990 randolph et al 1991 conducted a series of centrifuge tests combined with numerical analysis to verify a one dimensional analysis method to calculate the soil plug effect in offshore areas since then several methods for calculating the bearing capacity of pile foundations in terms of the plug effect including the api method rp2a wsd 2011 fhwa method paikowsky and whitman 1990 chinese method construction 2008 finnra method finnra 2000 and cpt based method xu et al 2008 have been proposed several studies have presented methods to improve the original monopile wang et al wang and li 2020 wang et al 2018b proposed a hybrid monopile foundation with an external plate added at the mud line the lateral capacity of the foundation significantly improved with the lateral ultimate load 679 kn of the solid wheel foundation being 4 4 times larger than that of the single pile foundation 153 kn and the lateral ultimate load 453 kn of the gravel wheel foundation is enhanced by 3 0 times the external plate provides an additional restoring moment to the monopile and the passive earth pressure acting on the embedded part of the wheel functionally resists rotational failure the design chart is summarized by considering the configurations bienen et al 2012 demonstrated an innovative monopile by enlarging the pile cross section with wings near the pile head in the centrifuge at the same level the pile head deflection decreased by 50 in comparison to the deflection of the regular monopile for an improved monopile with internal restriction plates the vertical bearing behavior has been investigated through a set of model tests in our laboratory li et al 2019 2020 one hole and four hole restriction plates are designed and the variation in pile diameter is examined the addition of the restriction plates is effective in enhancing the vertical bearing capacity and the installation is easier than that of the close ended pile common methods used to enhance the pile capacity are increasing the pile diameter or enlarging the embedment depth resulting in more complicated installation procedures and initial costs byrne et al 2015 doherty and gavin 2011 pérez collazo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b an innovative pile with a one hole restriction plate was successfully installed in ohio usa the ultimate vertical capacity increases to 140 of the original pipe pile while conventional installation equipment is used without encountering any difficulties white and morgano 2016 the innovative pile has proven to be applicable in practical projects however the lateral behavior of this innovative pile currently lacks attention the offshore wind turbine is mainly subjected to the lateral loads and overturning moments applied by wind waves and ice byrne and houlsby 2003 thus the design of the lateral capacity is critical to the application of this new foundation in this paper a series of centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the lateral response of innovative monopile foundations with internal restriction plates the test results are used to verify the finite element model the centrifuge and numerical tests analyze several key factors pile diameter restriction plate type plate position eccentricity etc the distributions of soil pressure acting on the restriction plate and along the pile are characterized in order to understand the pile soil interactions the rotational center of the improved pile is used in our proposed calculation method for estimating the ultimate lateral capacity of the foundation 2 centrifuge test a series of centrifuge tests are conducted on a 20 g ton geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university a monopile foundation with an internal restriction plate is an innovative concept and field test data are not currently available the centrifuge test provides an efficient way to simulate the stress state of soil by testing small scale models under large gravitational loads this testing method enables relatively accurate data for proof of concept models and a relatively large number of parametric studies the maximum gravitational acceleration used in these tests is 50 g the data presented in this study are all from a scaled down prototype 2 1 test models a rigid container with internal dimensions of 27 6 m 12 m 8 9 m is fixed at one end of the rotation arm in the centrifuge and the data presented in the following sections are from a scaled prototype a monopile foundation with an innovative design containing restriction plates one hole four holes is tested and open ended and close ended monopiles are considered as companion test plans fig 3 the pile foundations are fabricated using steel with a density of 55 5 kn m³ the upper structure is made of aluminum with a density of 26 5 kn m³ the total weight of the upper structure which includes a wind tower and a simplified tower head is 71 kn the wind tower is fabricated from an aluminum rod with a diameter of 0 5 m and a length of 13 m and the tower head is a lumped mass with dimensions of 1 75 m 1 75 m 0 625 m the wind turbine models are designed according to a 3 mw offshore wind turbine installed in jiangsu china with a scale ratio of 1 centrifuge test at 50 g 6 in situ wind turbine zhang et al 2015 twelve pile models are considered in the centrifuge tests the piles have diameters of 0 95 m 1 27 m and 1 9 m the piles share the same length of 8 65 m and a unique embedment depth of 4 m using these the influence of the pile diameter is studied the pile thickness is 0 045 m this pile dimension is determined based on the wind turbines used in the london array wind farm whose pile diameters are 7 m negro et al 2017 smaller and larger pile diameters are selected to enlarge the scope of adaptability of this study four types of opening shapes are considered for each diameter these include the open ended pile the close ended pile the monopile with a one hole restriction plate and the monopile with a four hole restriction plate the models are depicted in fig 1 the areas of the openings in the two restriction plates are identical the diameter of the opening in the one hole plate is ½ of the pile diameter while the diameters of the openings in the four hole plate are ¼ of the external pile diameter the plates are fixed at 50 of the embedded depth inside the pile 2 2 soil parameters silica sand has been widely used to study pile behavior so it is used in centrifuge tests which wang et al 2018a the particle size of silica sand is small minimizing the size effect of centrifuge tests according to the centrifuge scaling law nicola and randolph 1997 the soil initially has a depth of 7 5 mand a relative density of 70 so it is classified as dense sand the soil parameters are carefully measured in the laboratory and the results obtained from laboratory testing are listed in table 1 wang et al 2018a the pile models are installed at the center of the container and the distance to the pile tip of the container is set at 3 5 m to avoid the influence of boundary effects randolph et al 1992 previous studies demonstrate that if the width of the container exceeds 6 times the maximum pile diameter the boundary effect can be considered negligible wang et al 2017b the samples are carefully reprepared before each centrifuge test to maintain the same initial soil conditions 2 3 testing procedures the pile models are installed slowly by impact driving under a 1 g gravitational load the embedment depth is marked on the pile the soil plugs are observed after the installations of both the piles with restriction plates and the open ended piles a lateral load is applied after the centrifuge spins up to 50 g the linear lateral load which is applied slowly to avoid the accumulation of excess pore water pressure is increased monotonically from 0 to 1000 kn over 200 s the pore water pressure transducers recorded no significant change during the application of external loading this phenomenon is consistent with our previous tests wang et al 2017a the centrifuge tests are treated as if they are in the ideal fully drained condition and the following calculations are performed houlsby et al 2005 the centrifuge tests in this study are conducted under pseudostatic conditions fu et al 2017 kong et al 2021 li et al 2015 the piles are loaded to failure and the ultimate bearing capacity is determined the load is applied by an actuator with an eccentricity of 3 m and an lvdt is fixed at the same height to record the lateral deflection the schematic of the centrifuge test is depicted in fig 2 and the measurement system is presented in fig 3 3 centrifuge test results the relationship between the lateral load and the lateral displacement of twelve pile modes is presented in fig 4 piles with the same external diameter but different opening types are plotted together the piles generally follow a pattern that is similar to that of typical elastic plastic stages the rate of increase for the close ended pile at larger diameters is relatively larger than that of the other piles the close ended pile is a displacement pile the increase in of soil strength around the pile provided by 1 g of jacking installation is likely to be overcome under larger gravitational levels finally the lateral deflection of the pile continues to increase while the recorded lateral load becomes steady showing that the ultimate stage has been reached as shown in fig 4 the ultimate lateral capacities of the monopile with restriction plates are larger than those of the original open ended piles for the same pile diameter the four hole restriction plate creates a more noticeable enhancement than to the one hole restriction plate the total areas of the openings in the one hole plate and in the four hole plate are the same however the four hole shape more strongly compresses the soil inside the pile leading to a more noteworthy plug effect as a result the ultimate lateral capacity sees a greater improvement meanwhile the initial stiffnesses of the four opening type piles are similar the restriction plate does not significantly influence the small defalcation stages the improvements to the lateral capacity of piles with different diameters vary the improvements seen by the 0 95 m diameter pile is almost evenly distributed across different pile opening types but it increases dramatically for larger pile diameters of 1 27 m and 1 9 m the mechanism of adding the restriction plate intensifies the soil plug effect and the soil plug forms more easily with a small diameter therefore the addition of the restriction plate is more effective for large diameter piles inside which the soil plug is unlikely to form initially with the compression induced by the restriction plates the piles with restriction plates behave as if they are a close ended to demonstrate the influences of the type of opening in the pile and the pile diameter the ultimate lateral capacity of the piles is extracted from the load displacement curves table 2 several methods have been proposed to locate the final stage during pile failure including 1 finding the maximum value on the load displacement curve mcdowell 2002 2 finding the points with the most significant change on the load displacement curve byrne et al 2003 and 3 determining when the lateral displacement reaches 10 of the pile diameter byrne et al 2019 the curves recorded in this set of centrifuge tests slightly decrease after the peak values therefore the ultimate lateral capacity is determined as the maximum value i e the point at which the slope is approximately 0 to display the trends more clearly the ultimate lateral capacities are plotted against pile diameters in fig 5 a and the four pile opening types are plotted together the ultimate lateral capacity tends to increase with the pile diameter but with smaller increments however the effect of the pile diameter is not significant for the open ended monopile in addition the improved monopiles with internal restriction plates showed a larger lateral capacity than the open ended monopile these piles behave like close ended piles with diameters of 1 9 m and a similar capacity to clarify the influence of the methods used to determine the ultimate lateral capacity data satisfying the criterium of 10 d are plotted in fig 5b for comparison the general trends are consistent for these two methods so the difference is not considered a uniform criterion for the maximum values is used in the following calculations in addition the increment ratio is calculated by normalizing the ultimate lateral capacity of the corresponding open ended monopile as listed in table 2 the four hole restriction plate is more effective than the one hole restriction plate although the total areas of their openings are the same the area of a single hole in the four hole restraint plate is smaller leading to a more intense soil plug effect meanwhile the large diameter pile demonstrates a much larger increment ratio the soil plug effect is not pronounced for increased pile diameters since the constraint provided by the pile shaft is not enough to bond the soil therefore the restriction plate is more effective for monopiles with a large diameter in practical applications installing the internal restriction plate instead of continuously enlarging the pile diameter would be recommended this is a promising method for to reduction of construction and installation costs of offshore wind turbines 4 finite element modeling numerical analysis is performed using the finite element analysis software abaqus manual 2010 configurations for the finite element model of monopile foundations are determined based on the models used in the centrifuge tests four types of monopiles are built and the upper structure has the unique design matching the abovementioned test model as shown in fig 6 the soil body is built as a cylinder since the pile is a cylindrical structure to eliminate the influence of boundary effects the diameter of the soil body is determined to be 10 m and the thickness is set at 20 m the soil is modeled as an elastic plastic material using the mohr coulomb model the pile and the superstructure are simulated as elastic perfectly plastic materials the soil parameters in the numerical model are consistent with the centrifuge test data listed in table 1 the material properties of the models are summarized in table 3 this study does not simulate the installation process so monopiles are built wish in place with small strain finite element ssfe analyses zhang et al 2011 the mohr coulomb friction penalty function is used for the pile soil interface with a frictional coefficient of 0 3 the restraint plate and the steel pipe pile are welded for integrity the wind tower tower head and pile are held in place by binding restraints during the loading process of the fem analysis gravity is first applied to the soil and it is specified as being along the positive z axis the stress balance is used to establish the geostatic stresses and avoid soil deforming under its self weight afterward structural and foundational self weights are applied finally external loadings are applied at the position with an eccentricity of 3 m using the displacement control method the reliability of this loading method has been validated by several researchers lu and zhang 2020 luan et al 2006 the numerical simulation is carried through by using hexahedral eight node linear reduced integral cell c3d8r in the lateral direction the model is divided into four regions and all model components are divided by structural meshes the soil body and soil plug mesh are sparse at the boundary and become denser toward the center in the vertical direction the soil body is divided into two regions the total number of cells was between 130 000 and 140 000 fig 7 shows a typical c mesh from the fem model the improved monopiles with one hole and four hole restriction plates are plotted separately 5 validation to verify the reliability of the numerical model and to better understand pile soil interactions the load displacement curves from the fe analysis are plotted together with the centrifuge test results in fig 8 an improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate is typically used for validation overall the lateral behavior of the piles from the numerical analysis agrees with the centrifuge tests the general trends are similar and the ultimate lateral capacity that is estimated falls inside an acceptable range the load displacement curves of the centrifuge tests initially show greater stiffness than the numerical results and this is identical to the previous test results yang et al 2018 2019 for small lateral displacements it is difficult to precisely control the stiffness due to equipment limitations the servo device of the loading system has hysteretic effects during the transfer of the load and it is difficult to measure displacements at very small load levels the fe model defines the loading function based on a simple geometry for the cell area without considering the complex boundary conditions of the entire defined domain in addition the piles are installed by impact driving under 1 g while the installation method in the numerical model is wish in place the post installation soil state is not well captured by the fe model especially at 50 g the initial stress increase due to the driving process is likely to be overcome by the enhancement of the subsequent stress increase due to the self weight at larger gravitational loads de nicola and randolph 1997 the wish in place piles demonstrate the softest load displacement response and the estimated lateral capacity is generally conservative these phenomena agree well with previous studies fan et al 2019 in addition the young s modulus of the material is assumed to be a constant value in the fe model however the soil pile interaction is likely to change the soil properties during the initial stage of the centrifuge test similar effects are observed for poisson s ratio and the interface coefficient ma et al 2019 the main focus of this study is to investigate the lateral response of innovative piles under the ultimate limit state uls the ultimate lateral capacity is the key result in the following analysis this set of numerical models is useful for estimating the ultimate capacity which is applicable to the assessment of soil pile interactions 6 sensitivity study offshore wind turbines are installed under complex environmental conditions where the soil parameters are not well defined a large number of tests with variable soil conditions are not feasible hence a sensitivity analysis of soil properties is undertaken using numerical simulation an improved monopile with a diameter of 1 27 m and a four hole restriction plate is selected as the control model the soil parameters including young s modulus e internal friction angle φ dilation angle ψ and poisson s ratio μ are considered and the values are chosen according to literature to match the soil conditions in offshore applications randolph et al 1991 thieken et al 2015 in the analysis of the following parameters the elastic modulus of the soil e is taken to be in the range of 10 mpa 60 mpa the internal friction angle φ is in the range of 30 36 the dilation angle is in the range of 1 13 and poisson s ratio μ is selected to have the range 0 0 4 the sensitivity study results are demonstrated in fig 9 in general the lateral capacity of the improved pile increases with young s modulus but the change is not significant and tends to become small the soil encounters a large deformation during external loading and enters a fully plastic state the influence of e weakens gradually as demonstrated in fig 9b the lateral capacity increases with the friction angle in a constant manner the enhancement is more pronounced in contrast the influences of the dilation angle and poisson s ratio are not intense the friction angle reflects the frictional coefficient at the pile soil interface so the lateral earth pressure coefficient is affected in conclusion to ensure an accurate estimate of the lateral capacity the internal friction angle should be determined carefully during the analysis 7 parametric study 7 1 effects of pile diameter from the results of the centrifuge model test it can be seen that the pile diameter has significant effects on the characteristics of the monopiles a group of fe models is built with pile diameters of 1 10 times the minimum pile diameter of the centrifuge tests with the remaining parameters are set at default values as listed in tables 1 and 3 the load displacement curves of the two improved monopiles with variable diameters are plotted in fig 10 the ultimate lateral capacity and the initial stiffness increase significantly with the pile diameter and the improvement tends to become greater with increasing diameter the lateral capacity experiences a sizeable jump when the pile diameter exceeds 7 6 m and enters the category of as large diameter piles for offshore applications negro et al 2017 in addition at large pile diameters the load displacement curve reaches a peak and then decreases gradually the yielding point moves forward and fewer deformations are appearing when reaching failure a comparative analysis of fig 10a and b shows that the increase in the horizontal ultimate load of the monopile with a four hole restraint plate is slightly larger than that of the monopile with a one hole restraint plate the addition of the four hole plate makes the pile more sensitive to the change in diameter to more directly demonstrate the influence of the pile diameter on the piles with one hole and four hole restraint plates the ultimate lateral capacities of the piles with the two types of restriction plates are extracted and plotted against the pile diameter in fig 11 in addition to the increased enhancement the four hole restriction plate is more effective than the one hole plate but not significantly 7 2 effects of depth of restraint plate the position of the restriction plate is defined as 50 of the embedment depth of the monopile in the centrifuge tests in the numerical models the plate height is designed at 10 30 50 and 70 of the penetration depth for parametric study a monopile with a diameter of 1 27 m is selected as the control model since the restriction plate is more effective at large diameters as shown above both the one hole and four hole conditions are considered the relationship between lateral load and displacement is depicted in fig 12 the lateral capacity does not show differences when the plate position is changed the reason may be that the pile is buried at a small depth and the plate position is unlikely to affect the formation of the soil plug in this range 7 3 effect of load eccentricity the influence of the loading point namely the eccentricity is demonstrated in fig 13 to represent the combined effect of complex loading conditions the loadings are simplified as a point load in the tests and in the fe models the eccentricity is defined as the distance from the loading point to the mud line an improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate with a diameter of 1 27 m is selected as the control model the initial stiffness decreases with increasing load eccentricity similarly the lateral capacity experiences an obvious decline with increasing eccentricity the influence tends to be less intense at higher positions the difference between 1 m and 2 m is almost 3 times the difference between 4 m and 5 m the offshore wind structure is sensitive to tilt failure and hence the external loading characteristics should be carefully examined before the design process 8 analysis 8 1 pile soil interactions the fe model enables the analysis of soil pile interactions of different models and the effect of adding restraint plates fig 14 depicts the distribution of soil pressures with the addition of one hole and four hole restraint plates at different pile diameters d 0 95 m 1 27 m 1 9 m the soil pressure is larger beneath the upwind side of the restriction plate the piles tend to incline under lateral loadings making a larger extrusion between the restraint plates and the soil plug for the same pile diameter the maximum soil pressure acting on the one hole restriction plate is smaller than that on the four hole plate and the middle section of the four hole plate contributes some capacities simultaneously in more than one capacity it can be concluded that the addition of a four hole plate is more effective than the addition of a one hole plate therefore the lateral capacity of the improved monopile with a four hole restriction plate is increased and this agrees with the test results presented above for the same type of restriction plate the soil pressure acting on the restraint plate decreases gradually with increasing pile diameter the soil is not tightly squeezed at larger diameters in other words the plug effect weakens however the cross sectional area is much larger leading to a larger total lateral resistance than that of the original pipe pile to explore the bearing mechanism of the improved monopile the earth contact pressures between the pile and the surrounding soil are analyzed using the finite element model the final state is presented and shown in fig 15 the shapes of the earth pressure distribution with depth are quite similar for all pile models the main difference in the soil stress distribution appears beneath the position where the restriction plates are added the area of passive earth pressure is enhanced parallel to the loading direction while the difference is not obvious in the direction opposing the loading the soil pressure increases significantly due to the soil plug effect and improved piles behave as if they are close ended piles for a specific pile diameter the four hole pile bears larger earth pressure than the one hole pile leading to a larger total capacity additionally the difference in earth pressure becomes milder with increasing pile diameter the soil plug effect enables the pile to work together with the internal soil fig 16 depicts the soil pressure distributions of different piles along the pile cross section the values are extracted from the depth at which the maximum value of earth pressure is reached for the close ended pile a typical plot of the 1 9 m diameter pile is selected the lateral earth pressure is maximum at the center in the upwind direction and decreases to almost zero at the two edges following a cosine distribution this phenomenon agrees well with previously reported data and is applicable to all pile models and depths prasad and chari 1999 this inhomogeneous distribution of earth pressure should be taken into account in theoretical calculations of the foundation bearing capacity 8 2 center of rotation the final state lateral deflections along the pile for different pile diameters are depicted in fig 15 from the figure it can be seen that the deflection of the open ended monopile is larger than that of the improved piles especially in the case of the monopile with an added four hole restraint plate the final deflection is the same as that of the close ended monopile however the deflections demonstrate a similar trend at a large diameter of 1 27 m the addition of the restriction plate is not influential in this condition the overturning stability of the foundation is related to the position of its center of rotational center which is defined as the point where the deflection is 0 in the entire plastic deformation region inside the monopile foundation the intersections of the deflection curve with the longitudinal axis are enlarged in fig 17 it is demonstrated that the center of rotation center of the improved monopiles shift upward for small pile diameters while this change becomes less intense with increasing pile diameter the influences of the four hole restriction plate and the one hole restriction plate are similar the centers of rotation of the improved monopiles are located between 3 3 m and 3 5 m below the mud line which is approximately 80 of the pile embedment depth the vector field plots of the monopiles in the final state which depicts the variation of the center of rotation in the horizontal direction are plotted in figs 18 20 the centers of rotation of the open ended and close ended monopiles are located close to the central axis of the pile with a diameter of 0 95 m in contrast the centers of rotation of the improved monopiles are offset in the horizontal direction with increasing pile diameter the centers of rotation of the four different piles become located close to the central axis 8 3 modified calculation an improved monopile with a restriction plate is an innovative design for foundations of offshore wind turbines the ultimate bearing capacity under pure vertical loading conditions has been investigated and a simplified design method has been proposed li et al 2020 the lateral response is a key aspect of the design of an offshore wind turbine therefore a theoretical calculation is proposed in this section to give an initial estimation of the lateral capacity of this new foundation based on the results of centrifuge model tests and the fe model the earth pressure of the improved monopile is distributed in the same manner as the pressure of the original monopile the rotational center is assumed to be at 80 of the penetration depth and the offset along the horizontal direction is not considered at this stage the differences between the two restriction plates are not significant therefore the contact pressure along the pile s longitudinal section is assumed to be a polygonal line as shown in fig 21 a in addition the soil pressure is not uniformly distributed across the pile diameter as illustrated above the distribution is assumed to be a semiellipse as depicted in fig 21b the lateral capacity f of the improved monopile can be expressed as 1 f 0 l s p z d d z where f is the lateral capacity l is the penetration length pz is the soil pressure along the pile at any position below the soil surface and d is the pile diameter z represents position below the buried surface of the pile and s is the shape parameter describing the inhomogeneous distribution of soil pressure along the pile diameter the earth pressure is generally calculated using two methods coulomb s theory and rankine s theory which are expressed as 2 c o u l o m b s t h e o r y p z 1 2 γ l 2 k c 3 r a n k i n e s t h e o r y p z γ l k r 4 k c c o s 2 φ ε c o s 2 ε cos ε σ 1 sin φ σ sin φ β cos ε σ cos ε β 2 5 k r t a n 2 45 φ 2 where γ represents the effective density of the soil kc and kr represent the passive soil pressure coefficients of coulomb and rankine s theory respectively φ denotes the internal friction angle of the soil ε is the angle between the pile and the vertical axis δ represents the interface friction angle and β represents the soil s angle with respect to the horizontal plane rankine s theory assumes a pure smoothing for the pile surface ignoring pile soil interface friction the calculated soil pressure is often smaller and has a large discrepancy with the centrifuge tests described above coulomb s theory assumes that the soil is cohesionless which is consistent with the nature of the soil used in the centrifuge test and the calculated results are greater than results from rankin s theory therefore the ultimate lateral capacity is calculated using coulomb s theory 6 f 0 l s p z d d z 1 2 0 l s γ z 2 k c d d z 10 5 sd l 3 for different load eccentricities e the lateral capacity of the improved monopile can be

factors are calculated the shape factor decreases with the opening area the open ended pile shows the smallest shape factor while the close ended pile reaches the largest value especially at smaller diameters the soil around the pile is more effective in the close ended form in general the shape factor tends to decrease with increasing pile diameter the disturbance of soil is not as significant at smaller diameters the difference is obvious at the small diameter of 0 95 m for the one hole and four hole restriction plates the difference becomes much less noticeable at large diameters the lateral capacity of the improved monopile with an internal restriction plate is estimated to be in the range of 0 6 0 8 the shape factor reflects the nonuniform distribution of soil pressure along the pile cross section and it also demonstrates the effect of the restriction plate when the pile diameter is larger than 1 27 m the shape factors of the one hole plate and the four hole plate are assumed to be constant the plug effect is intense for this pile diameter regardless of the opening form of the restriction plate this calculation method is more applicable for a rigid pile in cohesionless soil 9 conclusions in this paper an innovative monopile foundation with an internal restriction plate for offshore wind turbines is investigated a series of centrifuge tests are performed to study the lateral bearing behavior and the bearing mechanism is investigated using numerical simulations a theoretical calculation is proposed based on soil pile interactions the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the addition of a restraintion plate is feasible for improving the lateral capacity of the monopile for offshore wind turbine applications the four hole restriction plate tends to be more effective than the one hole plate the improvement of the large diameter monopile is more significant due to the soil plug effect 2 the internal friction angle of the soil has the greatest influence on the lateral capacity of the improved monopile for offshore wind turbines more attention should be given to practical design 3 the lateral capacity increases with the diameter of the improved monopile and tends to become larger rapidly the capacity decreases with the eccentricity the influence of the restriction plate position is not significant 4 the earth pressure beneath the four hole plate is greater than the earth pressure beneath the one hole plate with increasing pile diameter the underlying soil pressure decreases the earth pressure distribution has a similar shape along the pile depth for the monopiles 5 the center of rotation is located at 80 of the pile embedment depth the offset in the horizontal direction is small and considered negligible 6 a theoretical calculation for estimating the lateral capacity of the improved monopile for offshore wind turbines is proposed it is recommended for a shape factor to take into account the effect of the restriction plate and the nonuniform distribution of earth pressure along the pile diameter credit authorship contribution statement jiale li conceptualization methodology writing original draft funding

20286,this study reports about the wave conditions encountered by the fleet of maersk line herein wave conditions refer to integral wave parameters in terms of significant wave height zero upcrossing period and wave direction equivalently relative wave heading but main focus is on the significant wave height the study includes data from 189 container ships where auto logged data has been collected over a three years period 2017 2020 during operations in the majority of the world s larger oceans in total the data corresponds to 1 million hours of operation the encountered wave heights are compared with the information from wave scatter diagrams given by the global wave statistics british maritime technology 1986 the study shows that weather routing and seamanship have an effect but the effect is not as pronounced as reported in a previous study olsen et al 2006 the study also presents findings in relation to the temporal and spatial variation in encountered wave height along ship routes at consecutive wave points spaced by the sailing distance in 30 120 min it is shown that the variation can be large and as such the concept of stationary conditions might be compromised sometimes in the analysis of wave ship interactions keywords encountered wave heights by ships era5 global wave statistics weather routing temporal and spatial variation along ship routes gumbel and t location scale distributions 1 introduction the safety and fuel efficiency of a ship sailing in open sea depend largely on the encountered wave conditions equivalently the sea state concerning structural safety this is recognised and explicitly accounted for by structural rules of ships while more general aspects of safety associated with critical situations deck wetness slamming high acceleration levels etc also are highly important the concern in relation to fuel efficiency associates to the added resistance experienced in waves and lower propeller efficiency in all cases low er sea states are beneficial to the sailing operations most shipping companies rely on weather routing in combination with good seamanship of the crew the effect is that ships statistically are expected to observe less severe wave conditions than stipulated by e g structural rules iacs rec 034 2001 iacs rec 106 2009 and as derived by global wave statistics from wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 this has been investigated by e g olsen et al 2006 the measuring of waves encountered by ships is difficult on the other hand numerical modelling with spectral wave models in combination with data assimilation has led to comprehensive reanalyses one of these is the era5 database copernicus climate change service information 2020 hersbach et al 2021 that provides hourly updates of wave spectra in grid points spaced by 0 5 in latitudes and longitudes for all parts of the world s oceans 1 1 scope and objective this study considers output from the era5 database in combination with in service data from about 200 ships of maersk line the ship data has been collected over a three years period 2017 2020 from operations in the majority of the larger oceans see fig 1 the focus is exclusively on encountered wave conditions and as such the necessary ship data is limited to gps and compass heading but vessel forward speed is also included in the analysis the study has similarities with olsen et al 2006 but is a large extension in the sense that the present study includes more than 1 million hourly observations in total compared to about 25 000 observations included in olsen et al 2006 moreover the ship data has been collected automatically from the single vessels using an onboard continuous monitoring system with sampled output every 10 min the study presents statistics of the encountered wave conditions which are compared with results from existing wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 besides the study investigates and discusses the variation in encountered wave height along the route paths of the ships in this sense the paper follows up on the study by nielsen 2021 above all the main objective is to give an account of the wave conditions that ships from the maersk line fleet encounter due to the large number of ships considered and the vast amount of data it is believed that the findings can be extrapolated to container ships in general although seamanship and the level and sophistication of company specific weather routing can be influential it should be emphasised that the study primarily deals with findings associated to significant wave height little attention is given to zero upcrossing period and relative wave direction but a few results are included to complement the analysis besides it is noteworthy that in general a ship s response to waves depends strongly also on the distribution of energy and not just on the amount of energy of the encountered wave system in particular it would therefore be relevant to study observations of the zero upcrossing period to the same detail as done herein for the significant wave height albeit this is left as a future exercise 1 2 composition of paper the next section presents the basic concepts and the methodology of the study a brief description of the studied ship data is given in section 3 the report on the encountered wave conditions is included in section 4 and associated discussions follow in section 5 finally concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 fundamentals and methodology 2 1 encountered wave conditions era5 the era5 hourly ocean wave data on single levels copernicus climate change service information 2020 hersbach et al 2021 as used in this study is available on a regular latitude longitude grid at 0 5 0 5 resolution with updates every 60 min in principle the 2d wave spectrum is available but this study considers the associated integral parameters only the following parameters are considered significant wave height h s zero upcrossing period t z and mean wave direction d m coming from all mathematically expressed in accordance with their standard definitions e g ecmwf 2017 2 2 spatial and temporal interpolation realising that a ship rarely is exactly at a position coinciding with one of the points on the era5 grid interpolation becomes necessary spatially the era5 data is interpolated to the exact position of a ship using bilinear interpolation nielsen 2021 interpolation in significant wave height h s and in zero upcrossing period t z can be made immediately on the other hand mean wave direction is circular which leads to the ambiguity that d m 0 and d m 360 are equivalent the interpolation in wave direction is therefore based on the cartesian vector components of the particular directions that enter the interpolation to account for any variation in significant wave height from grid point to grid point the interpolation is weighted by h s consequently interpolation in mean wave direction is based on a new set of parameters a b calculated for all the grid points i j with 1 a i j h s i j cos d m i j 2 b i j h s i j sin d m i j in this case interpolation at an arbitrary point off the grid can be made in both a and b the mean wave direction at the considered geographical point is subsequently calculated by 3 d m atan2 b a initially spatial interpolation is made so that the wave conditions at the ship positions are obtained exactly at the hourly updates of the era5 dataset subsequently to account for the variation in between the hourly updates at the particular hourly positions temporal linear interpolation is made so that the wave parameters h s t z d m are obtained with 10 min spacing between consecutive waypoints an example of such time series of encountered wave conditions from one ship is shown in fig 2 on the horizontal axis sample indices are used instead of absolute time which means that the spacing between two indices is 10 min the gaps in the time series correspond to periods where the ship has been out of service or data might have been removed for instance due to quay stays or maintenance cf section 3 it is realised that the data from the particular ship covers a period of about three years and two months 2 3 information from the global wave statistics the wave scatter diagrams provided by british maritime technology 1986 give the joint distribution of combinations of h s and t z for almost any area of the world s oceans the sub areas are shown on the map in fig 3 noticing that the individual rectangular regions also are referred to as marsden areas the actual information for a specific marsden area is given in terms of the number of times a particular combination of h s and t z is expected to occur out of 1 000 occurrences of given combinations prescribed by a range of zero upcrossing periods and a range of significant wave heights the marginal probability density function pdf of the significant wave height corresponding to a specific marsden area can therefore easily be derived 2 4 evaluation of the outcome essentially the outcome of the present study is the set of interpolated wave parameters as obtained for all considered vessels at their exact route paths as such computed statistics can be used to assess the final outcome the calculation of absolute statistics such as mean value and standard deviation is straightforward for h s and t z the circularity of wave direction implies that the mean value d m mean of a sequence of mean wave directions must be based on the cartesian vector components of the single mean wave directions forming the sequence this is equivalent to how interpolation in wave direction was made cf eqs 1 to 3 but without the h s based weighting in quantitative terms the formula reads 4 d m mean atan2 b a 5 a 1 k k 1 k cos d m k b 1 k k 1 k sin d m k where k 1 k refers to a sequence of wave directions the corresponding standard deviation σ is calculated in line with the mathematical definition of standard deviation specifically it is obtained by 6 σ 2 1 k k 1 k min a b s d m k d m mean 2 where the minimisation function min a b s is applied to ensure that it is always the minimum difference in absolute terms which is computed i e d m k d m mean 180 always thus addressing that wave direction is circular in addition to the mean value and standard deviation metrics representing the maximum value and the 95 percentile will also be calculated for h s and t z noting that the number p95 means that 95 of the observations have a value less than the number p95 the gumbel distribution also known as a generalised extreme value distribution type i is sometimes used to describe the probability distribution of significant wave height when addressing e g extreme value predictions jensen 2001 the gumbel distribution is characterised by the location and scale parameters α and β respectively through the cumulative distribution function 7 f x α β e e x α β β 0 2 5 era5 as ground truth this study relies fundamentally on the assumption that the era5 dataset represents the ground truth of the encountered wave conditions noticing that the dataset is the output of the wave model ecwam ecmwf 2017 assimilated with measurements of wind and waves it is beyond the scope herein to investigate the assumption but the literature contains many interesting studies in this direction for instance hersbach et al 2020 stefanakos 2019 hauteclocque et al 2020 takbash and young 2020 and timmermans et al 2020 to mention just a few more recent studies justifying the use of era5 obviously in reality the dataset is nothing more than an estimate and some reports have informed about the underestimation of the significant wave height by era5 e g naseef and kumar 2020 and belmadani et al 2021 stating that era5 h s data underestimates buoy observations at various locations including the northwestern atlantic another noteworthy comment is that in the present study no attempt is made to compare with the outcome from other wave models such as wavewatch iii tolman et al 2002 the wavewatch iii development group 2019 saying this just to add that although small differences in the results could appear it is believed that the overall findings would remain the same 3 data the fundamental and necessary ship data consists of measurements of the geographical position given by gps and the compass heading that can be used together with the mean wave direction d m for computing the relative wave heading rwh equivalent to the wave encounter angle with rwh 0 and rwh 180 being following sea and head sea respectively as will be seen later vessel forward speed is also included in the analysis to study its influence on the temporal variation in wave conditions as encountered by a ship an overview of the input to the analysis is given by table 1 noticing that the limiting values on the ranges are just indicative in total data from 189 ships has been included in the analysis and the time spans from january 2017 until february 2020 however there is a large variation in the number of measurement points from the different ships some ships contribute with less than a month of data while others contribute with many hundreds of days see e g fig 2 on average each ship brings data from about 380 days of operation into the analysis where operation refers to all parts of shipping operations that is ocean transiting quay stays anchoring manoeuvring maintenance dock stays etc in order to focus on sailing in seaways exclusively data is simply included only if the forward speed is above 5 knots this removes most of the non seaway related data including manoeuvring data in and around harbours and after additional removal of corrupted gps data it leaves the analysis with more than six million 10 min spaced observations defining an observation to be that of an interpolated integral wave parameter i e h s t z d m from the era5 dataset the route paths corresponding to the observations are seen in fig 1 obviously as realised by looking at the route paths and as described in the preceding the six plus million observations corresponding to 1 million hours of observation are not unique in time but they are in space time 3 1 era5 data as observed data it was previously explained that the era5 reanalysis data is considered as the ground truth see section 2 5 as a consequence of this assumption the encountered wave condition as obtained from the era5 dataset is referred to as observed data and or actual observation although in the strict sense it should be termed reanalysis data the use of the term observed or observation is a choice made to reflect that it is data which is applicable to the exact time and position of any ship like the data was measured or observed by a ship board sensor thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 nielsen 2017 with a 10 min spacing between the measurements 4 the encountered wave conditions 4 1 overview and descriptive statistics fig 4 presents how the encountered wave conditions are distributed when data from all ships is considered fig 4a shows the variation with marsden areas cf fig 3 while fig 4b shows the variation with speed the single plots are 2d histograms which means that it is possible to infer how many observations of a given wave parameter h s top t z middle and d m or rwh bottom that have a specific value it can be appreciated that ships sail very fast only in good weather it is also realised that the most significant speed range is 15 20 knots moreover it is evident that ships tend to either sail directly against or with the waves reflected by head sea rwh 180 and following sea rwh 0 respectively descriptive statistics of the encountered wave conditions are presented in table 2 the table includes results for different ocean regions the north atlantic n atl the south atlantic s atl the north pacific n pac the indian ocean ind o and all data world the particular regions are associated with sets of marsden areas as selected defined by the authors with reference to fig 3 the total number of observations n obs within each region is specified and then follows statistics for significant wave height zero upcrossing period and mean wave direction noting that the statistical metrics were defined in section 2 4 it is clear from the table that the observed sea states is significantly less severe than prescribed by the standard wave scatter diagrams suggested by british maritime technology 1986 4 2 encountered wave height distributions figs 5 and 6 show samples of the probability density function pdf for the significant wave height as encountered in some selected marsden areas the individual plot includes the empirical distribution based on the actual observations within the given marsden area the empirical distribution is fitted with a gumbel distribution it can be seen that the gumbel distribution generally fits the empirical distribution nicely the plots in figs 5 and 6 present also the empirical pdfs together with associated gumbel fits if obtainable of the scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 for the particular marsden areas visual assessment of pdfs obtained in all marsden areas from where observations exist is not practical on the other hand an evaluation can be made by comparing the location and scale parameters of the gumbel distribution cf eq 7 the relative deviations in the location and scale parameters have therefore been computed 8 δ ρ ρ obs ρ mrs ρ mrs 100 where ρ represents the location or scale parameter α and β respectively coming from observations obs or the scatter diagram mrs the numbers are printed in the plots in figs 5 and 6 and the meaning of the parameter names can easily be inferred α refers to the location of the peak on the horizontal axis h s value while β is a measure of the peak level or scale in the sense that the higher β the more narrow a distribution an overall assessment of the relative deviations for all marsden areas is shown in fig 7a noting however that results are only computed for the areas where more than 10 000 observations are available within the particular marsden area to ensure statistically reliable results like indicated from the visualisations of the pdfs fig 7a shows that there is a reasonable agreement in α with both positive and negative deviations that is the peak of the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations is located at both smaller and larger h s than prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams on the other hand the scale parameter β is consistently smaller for the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations which means that the observations generally represent a range of significant wave heights distributed in a more narrow interval the further consequence of this is that the extreme values of significant wave height as derived from the fitted pdfs for the observations is smaller than what the scatter diagrams predict this is easily confirmed by inspection of fig 7b that presents the deviation between the 95 percentile of h s computed from the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations relative to the fitted pdf of the scatter diagrams the relative deviation is calculated in accordance with eq 8 it is seen that the scatter diagrams generally lead to significantly larger 95 percentiles 4 3 variation in significant wave height at consecutive waypoints this subsection investigates what level of variation in significant wave height that occurs as a result of evolvement in both space and time considering a given ship advancing on its route specifically the wave height observed at a waypoint at time t k is compared with the wave height observed at a waypoint at a later time t k δ t emphasising that any variation results partly because of the evolvement δ t in time and partly because the ship moves a distance δ s u δ t dependent on the ship s speed u the formula of the relative difference 1 1 note that difference is used as this term is considered more appropriate than deviation therefore reads intentionally using diff to use another symbol than used with eq 8 9 diff h s k h s k m h s k h s k 100 where index k m represents a waypoint at a time later than the waypoint represented by index k the value of m is set in accordance with δ t in the following three situations are considered thus the consecutive waypoints are spaced by the sailing distance during δ t 30 min δ t 60 min and δ t 120 min it should be stressed that the deviation between waypoints as defined by eq 9 obviously is computed on a ship specific basis fig 8a shows how the relative difference all observations considered varies with the marsden areas noting that the single plots correspond to different δ t and that the plots are 2d histograms a more specific evaluation of the relative difference is shown in fig 8b which is presenting the standard deviation as computed for the observed differences in the given marsden areas that is the left side and right side plots in fig 8 correspond as pairs in general it can be appreciated from fig 8 that the relative difference in encountered significant wave heights can be substantial between consecutive waypoints even in just 30 min it could be anticipated that vessel advance speed will be quite influential on the variation in significant wave height between consecutive waypoints but fig 9 shows that the relative difference is not highly dependent on advance speed for the given data however an important point in this connection is that ships generally sail relatively faster in good weather and low sea states furthermore it is presumed that such conditions develop more gradual than those represented by medium weather and higher sea states consequently the most logical reasoning saying that high er speed naturally leads to large r relative differences in observed wave heights is not true since ships mostly only sail fast in a calm sea obviously this point cannot be generalised but will be specific to the particular shipping company depending on for instance company operational strategy type of weather routing seamanship of the ship master etc all points that could be further investigated in a future study despite the dependency with marsden areas and speed as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 an overall evaluation of the observed relative differences in encountered wave heights is presented in fig 10 with results calculated for the different spacings between waypoints as controlled by δ t the individual plots show the empirical pdf and a fitted pdf based on the t location scale distribution that has been found previously to give good results for modelling spatio temporal variation in sea states nielsen 2021 the t location scale distribution is useful for modelling data distributions with heavier tails than the normal distribution and the distribution is controlled by the probability density function e g matlab r2020b 2020 10 f t x μ σ ˆ ν γ ν 1 2 σ ν π γ ν 2 ν x μ σ 2 ν ν 1 2 where γ is the gamma function μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ν is the shape parameter it should be repeated that the results in this subsection and thus also the pdfs in fig 10 have been calculated by first evaluating eq 9 for each ship individually and then putting together all results as a whole as an interesting exercise left for future work it should be relevant to study detailed pdfs applicable to different ocean regions the statistics corresponding to fig 10 are given in table 3 where rmse is the root mean square error and p95 is the 95 percentile noting that both numbers are relative see eq 9 but the dimensional value is included in parentheses intentionally the maximum number i e max and derived as a single number from the entire population is not included since this number will not necessarily reflect the real physics of the variation in h s observed while sailing in ocean areas thus the number could be affected by arrivals departures from sheltered areas notwithstanding it can be mentioned that the maximum difference in dimensional form takes the values 2 1 m 30 min 2 2 m 60 min and 2 5 m 120 min for all considered data but without knowing if the numbers are from the same event it is interesting to note that although the present analysis does not differentiate between the various ocean regions the outcome is fairly consistent with the findings given by nielsen 2021 albeit the referred study was based on virtual shipping routes for specific ocean regions but with no account for weather routing this observation suggests that while weather routing clearly lead to the encountering of less severe wave conditions compared to existing scatter diagrams cf section 4 2 the variation in encountered sea state is not affected to the same degree by the use of weather routing systems 5 discussions 5 1 encountered wave conditions it seems relevant to ask the question whether the discrepancy between the actual encountered wave conditions and the conditions prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 is solely a consequence of weather routing and good seamanship in the strict sense this is an almost impossible question to answer as it probably will require much more data than studied herein nonetheless indications can be found by replicating the analysis made in section 4 but for fixed geographical positions in this case fig 11 presents the findings the plots in the figure reproduce the pdfs of the encountered wave height distribution as obtained for some selected marsden areas similar to the plots in figs 5 and 6 however it is emphasised that in this case fixed positions are considered specifically the single plots are the result of an analysis where five positions are considered within the given marsden area the five positions are taken to form a square with the four corners spaced by 2 degrees lon lat and one centre position at the intersection of the diagonals relevant information is outlined in table 4 and it is noted that the considered period used for this particular sub study is identical with the period from which the ship data has been collected that is 01 jan 2017 to 22 feb 2020 cf section 3 contrary to the former analysis with ship data the plots in fig 11 are made from hourly observations corresponding to the exact hourly updates in the era5 dataset for the considered period this gives 27 551 observations for each position resulting in totally 137 755 observations for all five positions in a given marsden area the plots in fig 11 leave no definitive answer to the question raised above it can be seen that there is a fairly good match between the wave height distribution from the observations era5 and the scatter diagram in marsden areas no 16 and 20 north atl and north pac although it could be argued that the observations in fact indicate an increase in any prediction of extreme values in a context of ship operations the relatively good match between the observations and the scatter diagram suggests that the discrepancy observed previously fig 5 is a result of weather routing and good seamanship however the findings from the other marsden areas no 41 and 85 in fig 11 are more blurred while the match between the empirical and fitted distribution of observed wave heights era5 and the distribution based on the wave scatter diagram is marginally better than previously seen the conclusion is that the scatter diagrams for the particular marsden areas lead to prediction of significantly larger extreme values in these cases it therefore cannot be concluded that weather routing and good seamanship alone is responsible for the encountering of lower sea states than prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams the above discussion calls for a much more comprehensive analysis and also calls for an even larger dataset before solid conclusions can be drawn this is beyond the scope of the present study which in the most basic sense merely aims to give an account of the wave conditions actually encountered by ships sailing in the larger oceans in the event of such a future work it would also be important to recognise that although the global wave statistics gws and the associated scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 are considered reliable for the northern oceans even with good fits in the tail the gws have not been well validated along shipping routes in the southern oceans and at low latitude as reported by leenaars et al 2000 it seems relevant to mention that albeit the present study shows that weather routing and seamanship lead to the encountering of less severe sea states for ships in the maersk line fleet the effect is smaller than what was reported by olsen et al 2006 where focus was on both tankers bulk carriers and container ships but limited to only 25 000 observations several reasons could potentially explain the discrepancy to mention some a in the present study much more data is included herein 1 million hourly observations b development in wave spectral models and the amount of assimilated measurements leading to improved reanalyses herein era5 c the use of auto logged gps data as in the present study giving more reliable information about the position of the ships at reported times 5 2 temporal variation in wave conditions the results in section 4 3 clearly indicate that the variation in sea state as encountered along consecutive waypoints of sailing ships can be relatively large the observed variation accounts for developments resulting because of the change in both time and position if the position instead is fixed the corresponding results are shown in fig 12 the plots present the relative difference cf eq 9 in significant wave height for the fixed locations specified in table 4 each plot contains the data from all five positions corresponding to a given marsden area and the title of the plot informs whether the temporal spacing is 1 h or 2 h it is noticed that the t location scale distribution again fits reasonably well in all cases the fitting parameters are printed in the single plots of fig 12 a comparison to the pdfs of the sailing ships cf fig 10 and table 3 reveals that the variation with little surprise is larger when it results because of a change in both position and time nonetheless the variation can be substantial also for fixed positions as a final remark it is interesting to note the positive skewness of the empirical pdfs shown in fig 12 the skewness implies a slight deviation relative to the t location scale distribution in all cases but is the most pronounced for the 2 h spacings this skewness is a result of the fact that waves and thus significant wave height grow faster than they decay during the coming and going of storms it should be realised that skewness is not visible in the pdfs of the difference in significant wave height when sailing ships are considered cf fig 10 this is likely explained as a consequence of weather routing and good seamanship meaning that ships tend to avoid being in the actual areas where storms are developing 6 final words and conclusions this paper has given a report about the wave conditions encountered by ships in the fleet of maersk line studying routes across the world the data of the study originated from 189 container vessels each one equipped with a continuous monitoring system based on measurements of gps longitude latitude heading and forward speed outcome from the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2021 was merged with the ship data as a result more than six million 10 min spaced observations reanalysis data of significant wave height zero upcrossing period and relative wave heading have been considered the study showed that weather routing and seamanship have the effect that the ships encounter less severe sea states than would be inferred from the global wave statistics british maritime technology 1986 although the effect has not been seen to be as significant as reported in a previous similar but much smaller study olsen et al 2006 with a focus on conditions specifically in the north atlantic to the credibility of the present study compared to former ones speaks not only the use of much more data but also the application of continuous monitoring ship data gps and speed together with reanalysis wave data era5 the paper also studied the temporal and spatial variation in encountered wave heights here referring to variation as the difference in wave height observed between consecutive waypoints spaced from 30 min to 120 min along the sailing route of a ship although it is difficult to exactly define when conditions in practical applications are no longer stationary the encountered variation in sea state is assessed to be at a level that sometimes might compromise the often imposed theoretical requirement that a stationary process is assumed when wave ship interactions are analysed above all this study has reported about what wave conditions container ships are expected to encounter during their daily operations in the

20286,this study reports about the wave conditions encountered by the fleet of maersk line herein wave conditions refer to integral wave parameters in terms of significant wave height zero upcrossing period and wave direction equivalently relative wave heading but main focus is on the significant wave height the study includes data from 189 container ships where auto logged data has been collected over a three years period 2017 2020 during operations in the majority of the world s larger oceans in total the data corresponds to 1 million hours of operation the encountered wave heights are compared with the information from wave scatter diagrams given by the global wave statistics british maritime technology 1986 the study shows that weather routing and seamanship have an effect but the effect is not as pronounced as reported in a previous study olsen et al 2006 the study also presents findings in relation to the temporal and spatial variation in encountered wave height along ship routes at consecutive wave points spaced by the sailing distance in 30 120 min it is shown that the variation can be large and as such the concept of stationary conditions might be compromised sometimes in the analysis of wave ship interactions keywords encountered wave heights by ships era5 global wave statistics weather routing temporal and spatial variation along ship routes gumbel and t location scale distributions 1 introduction the safety and fuel efficiency of a ship sailing in open sea depend largely on the encountered wave conditions equivalently the sea state concerning structural safety this is recognised and explicitly accounted for by structural rules of ships while more general aspects of safety associated with critical situations deck wetness slamming high acceleration levels etc also are highly important the concern in relation to fuel efficiency associates to the added resistance experienced in waves and lower propeller efficiency in all cases low er sea states are beneficial to the sailing operations most shipping companies rely on weather routing in combination with good seamanship of the crew the effect is that ships statistically are expected to observe less severe wave conditions than stipulated by e g structural rules iacs rec 034 2001 iacs rec 106 2009 and as derived by global wave statistics from wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 this has been investigated by e g olsen et al 2006 the measuring of waves encountered by ships is difficult on the other hand numerical modelling with spectral wave models in combination with data assimilation has led to comprehensive reanalyses one of these is the era5 database copernicus climate change service information 2020 hersbach et al 2021 that provides hourly updates of wave spectra in grid points spaced by 0 5 in latitudes and longitudes for all parts of the world s oceans 1 1 scope and objective this study considers output from the era5 database in combination with in service data from about 200 ships of maersk line the ship data has been collected over a three years period 2017 2020 from operations in the majority of the larger oceans see fig 1 the focus is exclusively on encountered wave conditions and as such the necessary ship data is limited to gps and compass heading but vessel forward speed is also included in the analysis the study has similarities with olsen et al 2006 but is a large extension in the sense that the present study includes more than 1 million hourly observations in total compared to about 25 000 observations included in olsen et al 2006 moreover the ship data has been collected automatically from the single vessels using an onboard continuous monitoring system with sampled output every 10 min the study presents statistics of the encountered wave conditions which are compared with results from existing wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 besides the study investigates and discusses the variation in encountered wave height along the route paths of the ships in this sense the paper follows up on the study by nielsen 2021 above all the main objective is to give an account of the wave conditions that ships from the maersk line fleet encounter due to the large number of ships considered and the vast amount of data it is believed that the findings can be extrapolated to container ships in general although seamanship and the level and sophistication of company specific weather routing can be influential it should be emphasised that the study primarily deals with findings associated to significant wave height little attention is given to zero upcrossing period and relative wave direction but a few results are included to complement the analysis besides it is noteworthy that in general a ship s response to waves depends strongly also on the distribution of energy and not just on the amount of energy of the encountered wave system in particular it would therefore be relevant to study observations of the zero upcrossing period to the same detail as done herein for the significant wave height albeit this is left as a future exercise 1 2 composition of paper the next section presents the basic concepts and the methodology of the study a brief description of the studied ship data is given in section 3 the report on the encountered wave conditions is included in section 4 and associated discussions follow in section 5 finally concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 fundamentals and methodology 2 1 encountered wave conditions era5 the era5 hourly ocean wave data on single levels copernicus climate change service information 2020 hersbach et al 2021 as used in this study is available on a regular latitude longitude grid at 0 5 0 5 resolution with updates every 60 min in principle the 2d wave spectrum is available but this study considers the associated integral parameters only the following parameters are considered significant wave height h s zero upcrossing period t z and mean wave direction d m coming from all mathematically expressed in accordance with their standard definitions e g ecmwf 2017 2 2 spatial and temporal interpolation realising that a ship rarely is exactly at a position coinciding with one of the points on the era5 grid interpolation becomes necessary spatially the era5 data is interpolated to the exact position of a ship using bilinear interpolation nielsen 2021 interpolation in significant wave height h s and in zero upcrossing period t z can be made immediately on the other hand mean wave direction is circular which leads to the ambiguity that d m 0 and d m 360 are equivalent the interpolation in wave direction is therefore based on the cartesian vector components of the particular directions that enter the interpolation to account for any variation in significant wave height from grid point to grid point the interpolation is weighted by h s consequently interpolation in mean wave direction is based on a new set of parameters a b calculated for all the grid points i j with 1 a i j h s i j cos d m i j 2 b i j h s i j sin d m i j in this case interpolation at an arbitrary point off the grid can be made in both a and b the mean wave direction at the considered geographical point is subsequently calculated by 3 d m atan2 b a initially spatial interpolation is made so that the wave conditions at the ship positions are obtained exactly at the hourly updates of the era5 dataset subsequently to account for the variation in between the hourly updates at the particular hourly positions temporal linear interpolation is made so that the wave parameters h s t z d m are obtained with 10 min spacing between consecutive waypoints an example of such time series of encountered wave conditions from one ship is shown in fig 2 on the horizontal axis sample indices are used instead of absolute time which means that the spacing between two indices is 10 min the gaps in the time series correspond to periods where the ship has been out of service or data might have been removed for instance due to quay stays or maintenance cf section 3 it is realised that the data from the particular ship covers a period of about three years and two months 2 3 information from the global wave statistics the wave scatter diagrams provided by british maritime technology 1986 give the joint distribution of combinations of h s and t z for almost any area of the world s oceans the sub areas are shown on the map in fig 3 noticing that the individual rectangular regions also are referred to as marsden areas the actual information for a specific marsden area is given in terms of the number of times a particular combination of h s and t z is expected to occur out of 1 000 occurrences of given combinations prescribed by a range of zero upcrossing periods and a range of significant wave heights the marginal probability density function pdf of the significant wave height corresponding to a specific marsden area can therefore easily be derived 2 4 evaluation of the outcome essentially the outcome of the present study is the set of interpolated wave parameters as obtained for all considered vessels at their exact route paths as such computed statistics can be used to assess the final outcome the calculation of absolute statistics such as mean value and standard deviation is straightforward for h s and t z the circularity of wave direction implies that the mean value d m mean of a sequence of mean wave directions must be based on the cartesian vector components of the single mean wave directions forming the sequence this is equivalent to how interpolation in wave direction was made cf eqs 1 to 3 but without the h s based weighting in quantitative terms the formula reads 4 d m mean atan2 b a 5 a 1 k k 1 k cos d m k b 1 k k 1 k sin d m k where k 1 k refers to a sequence of wave directions the corresponding standard deviation σ is calculated in line with the mathematical definition of standard deviation specifically it is obtained by 6 σ 2 1 k k 1 k min a b s d m k d m mean 2 where the minimisation function min a b s is applied to ensure that it is always the minimum difference in absolute terms which is computed i e d m k d m mean 180 always thus addressing that wave direction is circular in addition to the mean value and standard deviation metrics representing the maximum value and the 95 percentile will also be calculated for h s and t z noting that the number p95 means that 95 of the observations have a value less than the number p95 the gumbel distribution also known as a generalised extreme value distribution type i is sometimes used to describe the probability distribution of significant wave height when addressing e g extreme value predictions jensen 2001 the gumbel distribution is characterised by the location and scale parameters α and β respectively through the cumulative distribution function 7 f x α β e e x α β β 0 2 5 era5 as ground truth this study relies fundamentally on the assumption that the era5 dataset represents the ground truth of the encountered wave conditions noticing that the dataset is the output of the wave model ecwam ecmwf 2017 assimilated with measurements of wind and waves it is beyond the scope herein to investigate the assumption but the literature contains many interesting studies in this direction for instance hersbach et al 2020 stefanakos 2019 hauteclocque et al 2020 takbash and young 2020 and timmermans et al 2020 to mention just a few more recent studies justifying the use of era5 obviously in reality the dataset is nothing more than an estimate and some reports have informed about the underestimation of the significant wave height by era5 e g naseef and kumar 2020 and belmadani et al 2021 stating that era5 h s data underestimates buoy observations at various locations including the northwestern atlantic another noteworthy comment is that in the present study no attempt is made to compare with the outcome from other wave models such as wavewatch iii tolman et al 2002 the wavewatch iii development group 2019 saying this just to add that although small differences in the results could appear it is believed that the overall findings would remain the same 3 data the fundamental and necessary ship data consists of measurements of the geographical position given by gps and the compass heading that can be used together with the mean wave direction d m for computing the relative wave heading rwh equivalent to the wave encounter angle with rwh 0 and rwh 180 being following sea and head sea respectively as will be seen later vessel forward speed is also included in the analysis to study its influence on the temporal variation in wave conditions as encountered by a ship an overview of the input to the analysis is given by table 1 noticing that the limiting values on the ranges are just indicative in total data from 189 ships has been included in the analysis and the time spans from january 2017 until february 2020 however there is a large variation in the number of measurement points from the different ships some ships contribute with less than a month of data while others contribute with many hundreds of days see e g fig 2 on average each ship brings data from about 380 days of operation into the analysis where operation refers to all parts of shipping operations that is ocean transiting quay stays anchoring manoeuvring maintenance dock stays etc in order to focus on sailing in seaways exclusively data is simply included only if the forward speed is above 5 knots this removes most of the non seaway related data including manoeuvring data in and around harbours and after additional removal of corrupted gps data it leaves the analysis with more than six million 10 min spaced observations defining an observation to be that of an interpolated integral wave parameter i e h s t z d m from the era5 dataset the route paths corresponding to the observations are seen in fig 1 obviously as realised by looking at the route paths and as described in the preceding the six plus million observations corresponding to 1 million hours of observation are not unique in time but they are in space time 3 1 era5 data as observed data it was previously explained that the era5 reanalysis data is considered as the ground truth see section 2 5 as a consequence of this assumption the encountered wave condition as obtained from the era5 dataset is referred to as observed data and or actual observation although in the strict sense it should be termed reanalysis data the use of the term observed or observation is a choice made to reflect that it is data which is applicable to the exact time and position of any ship like the data was measured or observed by a ship board sensor thornhill and stredulinsky 2010 nielsen 2017 with a 10 min spacing between the measurements 4 the encountered wave conditions 4 1 overview and descriptive statistics fig 4 presents how the encountered wave conditions are distributed when data from all ships is considered fig 4a shows the variation with marsden areas cf fig 3 while fig 4b shows the variation with speed the single plots are 2d histograms which means that it is possible to infer how many observations of a given wave parameter h s top t z middle and d m or rwh bottom that have a specific value it can be appreciated that ships sail very fast only in good weather it is also realised that the most significant speed range is 15 20 knots moreover it is evident that ships tend to either sail directly against or with the waves reflected by head sea rwh 180 and following sea rwh 0 respectively descriptive statistics of the encountered wave conditions are presented in table 2 the table includes results for different ocean regions the north atlantic n atl the south atlantic s atl the north pacific n pac the indian ocean ind o and all data world the particular regions are associated with sets of marsden areas as selected defined by the authors with reference to fig 3 the total number of observations n obs within each region is specified and then follows statistics for significant wave height zero upcrossing period and mean wave direction noting that the statistical metrics were defined in section 2 4 it is clear from the table that the observed sea states is significantly less severe than prescribed by the standard wave scatter diagrams suggested by british maritime technology 1986 4 2 encountered wave height distributions figs 5 and 6 show samples of the probability density function pdf for the significant wave height as encountered in some selected marsden areas the individual plot includes the empirical distribution based on the actual observations within the given marsden area the empirical distribution is fitted with a gumbel distribution it can be seen that the gumbel distribution generally fits the empirical distribution nicely the plots in figs 5 and 6 present also the empirical pdfs together with associated gumbel fits if obtainable of the scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 for the particular marsden areas visual assessment of pdfs obtained in all marsden areas from where observations exist is not practical on the other hand an evaluation can be made by comparing the location and scale parameters of the gumbel distribution cf eq 7 the relative deviations in the location and scale parameters have therefore been computed 8 δ ρ ρ obs ρ mrs ρ mrs 100 where ρ represents the location or scale parameter α and β respectively coming from observations obs or the scatter diagram mrs the numbers are printed in the plots in figs 5 and 6 and the meaning of the parameter names can easily be inferred α refers to the location of the peak on the horizontal axis h s value while β is a measure of the peak level or scale in the sense that the higher β the more narrow a distribution an overall assessment of the relative deviations for all marsden areas is shown in fig 7a noting however that results are only computed for the areas where more than 10 000 observations are available within the particular marsden area to ensure statistically reliable results like indicated from the visualisations of the pdfs fig 7a shows that there is a reasonable agreement in α with both positive and negative deviations that is the peak of the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations is located at both smaller and larger h s than prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams on the other hand the scale parameter β is consistently smaller for the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations which means that the observations generally represent a range of significant wave heights distributed in a more narrow interval the further consequence of this is that the extreme values of significant wave height as derived from the fitted pdfs for the observations is smaller than what the scatter diagrams predict this is easily confirmed by inspection of fig 7b that presents the deviation between the 95 percentile of h s computed from the fitted gumbel pdf of the observations relative to the fitted pdf of the scatter diagrams the relative deviation is calculated in accordance with eq 8 it is seen that the scatter diagrams generally lead to significantly larger 95 percentiles 4 3 variation in significant wave height at consecutive waypoints this subsection investigates what level of variation in significant wave height that occurs as a result of evolvement in both space and time considering a given ship advancing on its route specifically the wave height observed at a waypoint at time t k is compared with the wave height observed at a waypoint at a later time t k δ t emphasising that any variation results partly because of the evolvement δ t in time and partly because the ship moves a distance δ s u δ t dependent on the ship s speed u the formula of the relative difference 1 1 note that difference is used as this term is considered more appropriate than deviation therefore reads intentionally using diff to use another symbol than used with eq 8 9 diff h s k h s k m h s k h s k 100 where index k m represents a waypoint at a time later than the waypoint represented by index k the value of m is set in accordance with δ t in the following three situations are considered thus the consecutive waypoints are spaced by the sailing distance during δ t 30 min δ t 60 min and δ t 120 min it should be stressed that the deviation between waypoints as defined by eq 9 obviously is computed on a ship specific basis fig 8a shows how the relative difference all observations considered varies with the marsden areas noting that the single plots correspond to different δ t and that the plots are 2d histograms a more specific evaluation of the relative difference is shown in fig 8b which is presenting the standard deviation as computed for the observed differences in the given marsden areas that is the left side and right side plots in fig 8 correspond as pairs in general it can be appreciated from fig 8 that the relative difference in encountered significant wave heights can be substantial between consecutive waypoints even in just 30 min it could be anticipated that vessel advance speed will be quite influential on the variation in significant wave height between consecutive waypoints but fig 9 shows that the relative difference is not highly dependent on advance speed for the given data however an important point in this connection is that ships generally sail relatively faster in good weather and low sea states furthermore it is presumed that such conditions develop more gradual than those represented by medium weather and higher sea states consequently the most logical reasoning saying that high er speed naturally leads to large r relative differences in observed wave heights is not true since ships mostly only sail fast in a calm sea obviously this point cannot be generalised but will be specific to the particular shipping company depending on for instance company operational strategy type of weather routing seamanship of the ship master etc all points that could be further investigated in a future study despite the dependency with marsden areas and speed as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 an overall evaluation of the observed relative differences in encountered wave heights is presented in fig 10 with results calculated for the different spacings between waypoints as controlled by δ t the individual plots show the empirical pdf and a fitted pdf based on the t location scale distribution that has been found previously to give good results for modelling spatio temporal variation in sea states nielsen 2021 the t location scale distribution is useful for modelling data distributions with heavier tails than the normal distribution and the distribution is controlled by the probability density function e g matlab r2020b 2020 10 f t x μ σ ˆ ν γ ν 1 2 σ ν π γ ν 2 ν x μ σ 2 ν ν 1 2 where γ is the gamma function μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ν is the shape parameter it should be repeated that the results in this subsection and thus also the pdfs in fig 10 have been calculated by first evaluating eq 9 for each ship individually and then putting together all results as a whole as an interesting exercise left for future work it should be relevant to study detailed pdfs applicable to different ocean regions the statistics corresponding to fig 10 are given in table 3 where rmse is the root mean square error and p95 is the 95 percentile noting that both numbers are relative see eq 9 but the dimensional value is included in parentheses intentionally the maximum number i e max and derived as a single number from the entire population is not included since this number will not necessarily reflect the real physics of the variation in h s observed while sailing in ocean areas thus the number could be affected by arrivals departures from sheltered areas notwithstanding it can be mentioned that the maximum difference in dimensional form takes the values 2 1 m 30 min 2 2 m 60 min and 2 5 m 120 min for all considered data but without knowing if the numbers are from the same event it is interesting to note that although the present analysis does not differentiate between the various ocean regions the outcome is fairly consistent with the findings given by nielsen 2021 albeit the referred study was based on virtual shipping routes for specific ocean regions but with no account for weather routing this observation suggests that while weather routing clearly lead to the encountering of less severe wave conditions compared to existing scatter diagrams cf section 4 2 the variation in encountered sea state is not affected to the same degree by the use of weather routing systems 5 discussions 5 1 encountered wave conditions it seems relevant to ask the question whether the discrepancy between the actual encountered wave conditions and the conditions prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 is solely a consequence of weather routing and good seamanship in the strict sense this is an almost impossible question to answer as it probably will require much more data than studied herein nonetheless indications can be found by replicating the analysis made in section 4 but for fixed geographical positions in this case fig 11 presents the findings the plots in the figure reproduce the pdfs of the encountered wave height distribution as obtained for some selected marsden areas similar to the plots in figs 5 and 6 however it is emphasised that in this case fixed positions are considered specifically the single plots are the result of an analysis where five positions are considered within the given marsden area the five positions are taken to form a square with the four corners spaced by 2 degrees lon lat and one centre position at the intersection of the diagonals relevant information is outlined in table 4 and it is noted that the considered period used for this particular sub study is identical with the period from which the ship data has been collected that is 01 jan 2017 to 22 feb 2020 cf section 3 contrary to the former analysis with ship data the plots in fig 11 are made from hourly observations corresponding to the exact hourly updates in the era5 dataset for the considered period this gives 27 551 observations for each position resulting in totally 137 755 observations for all five positions in a given marsden area the plots in fig 11 leave no definitive answer to the question raised above it can be seen that there is a fairly good match between the wave height distribution from the observations era5 and the scatter diagram in marsden areas no 16 and 20 north atl and north pac although it could be argued that the observations in fact indicate an increase in any prediction of extreme values in a context of ship operations the relatively good match between the observations and the scatter diagram suggests that the discrepancy observed previously fig 5 is a result of weather routing and good seamanship however the findings from the other marsden areas no 41 and 85 in fig 11 are more blurred while the match between the empirical and fitted distribution of observed wave heights era5 and the distribution based on the wave scatter diagram is marginally better than previously seen the conclusion is that the scatter diagrams for the particular marsden areas lead to prediction of significantly larger extreme values in these cases it therefore cannot be concluded that weather routing and good seamanship alone is responsible for the encountering of lower sea states than prescribed by the wave scatter diagrams the above discussion calls for a much more comprehensive analysis and also calls for an even larger dataset before solid conclusions can be drawn this is beyond the scope of the present study which in the most basic sense merely aims to give an account of the wave conditions actually encountered by ships sailing in the larger oceans in the event of such a future work it would also be important to recognise that although the global wave statistics gws and the associated scatter diagrams british maritime technology 1986 are considered reliable for the northern oceans even with good fits in the tail the gws have not been well validated along shipping routes in the southern oceans and at low latitude as reported by leenaars et al 2000 it seems relevant to mention that albeit the present study shows that weather routing and seamanship lead to the encountering of less severe sea states for ships in the maersk line fleet the effect is smaller than what was reported by olsen et al 2006 where focus was on both tankers bulk carriers and container ships but limited to only 25 000 observations several reasons could potentially explain the discrepancy to mention some a in the present study much more data is included herein 1 million hourly observations b development in wave spectral models and the amount of assimilated measurements leading to improved reanalyses herein era5 c the use of auto logged gps data as in the present study giving more reliable information about the position of the ships at reported times 5 2 temporal variation in wave conditions the results in section 4 3 clearly indicate that the variation in sea state as encountered along consecutive waypoints of sailing ships can be relatively large the observed variation accounts for developments resulting because of the change in both time and position if the position instead is fixed the corresponding results are shown in fig 12 the plots present the relative difference cf eq 9 in significant wave height for the fixed locations specified in table 4 each plot contains the data from all five positions corresponding to a given marsden area and the title of the plot informs whether the temporal spacing is 1 h or 2 h it is noticed that the t location scale distribution again fits reasonably well in all cases the fitting parameters are printed in the single plots of fig 12 a comparison to the pdfs of the sailing ships cf fig 10 and table 3 reveals that the variation with little surprise is larger when it results because of a change in both position and time nonetheless the variation can be substantial also for fixed positions as a final remark it is interesting to note the positive skewness of the empirical pdfs shown in fig 12 the skewness implies a slight deviation relative to the t location scale distribution in all cases but is the most pronounced for the 2 h spacings this skewness is a result of the fact that waves and thus significant wave height grow faster than they decay during the coming and going of storms it should be realised that skewness is not visible in the pdfs of the difference in significant wave height when sailing ships are considered cf fig 10 this is likely explained as a consequence of weather routing and good seamanship meaning that ships tend to avoid being in the actual areas where storms are developing 6 final words and conclusions this paper has given a report about the wave conditions encountered by ships in the fleet of maersk line studying routes across the world the data of the study originated from 189 container vessels each one equipped with a continuous monitoring system based on measurements of gps longitude latitude heading and forward speed outcome from the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2021 was merged with the ship data as a result more than six million 10 min spaced observations reanalysis data of significant wave height zero upcrossing period and relative wave heading have been considered the study showed that weather routing and seamanship have the effect that the ships encounter less severe sea states than would be inferred from the global wave statistics british maritime technology 1986 although the effect has not been seen to be as significant as reported in a previous similar but much smaller study olsen et al 2006 with a focus on conditions specifically in the north atlantic to the credibility of the present study compared to former ones speaks not only the use of much more data but also the application of continuous monitoring ship data gps and speed together with reanalysis wave data era5 the paper also studied the temporal and spatial variation in encountered wave heights here referring to variation as the difference in wave height observed between consecutive waypoints spaced from 30 min to 120 min along the sailing route of a ship although it is difficult to exactly define when conditions in practical applications are no longer stationary the encountered variation in sea state is assessed to be at a level that sometimes might compromise the often imposed theoretical requirement that a stationary process is assumed when wave ship interactions are analysed above all this study has reported about what wave conditions container ships are expected to encounter during their daily operations in the

an active fault tolerant consensus control aftcc of a leaderless multi auv system subject to actuator ploe faults and a heterogeneous directed communication topology graph it is generally known that the digraph s laplacian matrix is asymmetric so the lyapunov function in q wang and wang 2018 is no longer applicable however the lyapunov functions for multi agent systems without faults under the directed graph in z k li et al 2015 c wang et al 2016 can not be used in a multi agent system with actuator faults because the laplacian matrix would be coupled with the actuator efficiency factors for the lyapunov function derivative which makes the consensus error s convergence is difficult to analyze it is a truly challenging problem the formation of submarines mainly depends on underwater acoustic communication because of the acoustic communication characteristics and the limitation of communication equipment carried by submarines it is difficult to guarantee a complete effective and stable communication chain in practical projects using different heterogeneous communication topologies can reduce the amount of data in a single packet and solve the problem of communication bandwidth limitation compared to using only a single layer communication network using multilayer heterogeneous communication topology can enhance the communication capability of the system and greatly improve stability to overcome these problems we transform the original auv model into an equivalent linear model by linearization method and adopt second order multi auv systems to analyze the ftcc problem firstly then we put forward a distributed ftcc controller protocol which relies on the relative states of neighbors of auv by utilizing the actuator faults characteristics an improved lyapunov function is designed to probe the proposed ftcc strategy s validity the capital contributions of this paper are as follows 1 we study the ftcc strategy for leaderless multi auv systems over the heterogeneous directed communication topology which is more general as compared with q wang and wang 2018 zuo et al 2015 2 we propose the leaderless multi auv system fault tolerant consensus protocol which applies the relative state of the topology graph instead of the global information 3 here the loss of actuator effectiveness faults are more general and complex than cui et al 2017 and the actuator efficiency factors in each auv can not be identical 4 furthermore under the proposed fault tolerant strategy in this paper the auv s consensus error asymptotically converges to zero the

u k o ℝ 5 is the output of the ith auv s actuator respectively we consider that the auv s actuator is not fully functional the ith auv s actuator fault model at a time t k modeled as 10 u i o t k ρ i

14 therefore this is a stable error multi auv system 13 the multi auv ftcc system could become consensus based on theorem 1 remark 2 it is noticed that the proposed ftcc strategy 11 is a fully distributed consensus protocol because the controller only uses the local relative states between itself and its neighbor it does not use the communication topology network s global information remark 3 the distributed fault tolerant protocol 11 is applicable for the condition that communication topology among each auv is a heterogeneous digraph in contrast the fully distributed controller in q wang and wang 2018 is designed under the undirected graph remark 4 compared with cui et al 2017 we consider many input multi auv systems because of the efficiency factors of different actuators in each auv so in the protocol 11 the coupling weights are designed variously remark 5 combined with the description u e t that shows the relationship between the actual output and the ideal output in formula 11 we can see that u e t is mainly affected by the defined parameters ρ i when ρ i max 1 2 α β β α 2 α β and other conditions in theorem1 the method of this paper can achieve consistency 4 numerical example in this section the proposed ftcc protocol of multi auv systems will be illustrated its effectiveness consider a position and velocity communication topology relationship of five auvs g 1 and g 2 shown in fig 3 and fig 4 auvs initial locations random distribution space is 0 50 0 50 3 0 0 auvs pitch angles θ are started in the interval π 3 π 3 the heading angle ψ is randomly distributed all the velocities of auvs are zero at the beginning to achieve the ftcc the fault tolerant consensus protocol gains k 1 0 1157 k 2 0 8245 and κ 1 here discussed two cases actuators are healthy the other is the actuators of auv 1 3 5 have partial broken down according to theorem 1 simulation results are shown in figs 5 14 all the picture in the left is the case of auv s actuator is health and the right simulation results indicate the case of auv s ploe actuator the factor of ploe actuator of auv 1 3 5 is 30 20 30 respectively figs 5 7 shows the multi auv position in longitudinal transverse and vertical coordinates using the simulation s ftcc protocol figs 8 and 9 stand for the attitude states of all auvs θ and ψ could converge to the same value figs 10 14 show the velocity states of the auv where each auv s input makes the velocity states converge fig 15 is the three dimensional trajectories of multi auv systems which actuator is health compared with that the case that the actuator has partial broke down shows in fig 16 based on the simulation results even though the actuator occurs ploe all the state could converge to the same by using the protocol 11 which means its effectiveness in addition more complex communication topology networks in practical engineering experiments are often used to improve the algebraic connectivity of the topological relationships of multi auv systems thus better ensuring the system stability and the convergence speed of consistency here we consider adding simulation with more complex topologies the initialization condition is the same as the simulation described above but the communication topology is more complex than the former the proposed ftcc protocol of multi auv systems will be illustrated its effectiveness consider a position and velocity communication topology relationship of five auvs g 3 and g 4 shown in fig 17 and fig 18 simulation outcomes are shown in figs 19 30 to the same with the first results all the picture in the left is the case of auv s actuator is health and the right simulation results indicate the case of auv s ploe actuator the factor of ploe actuator of auv 1 3 5 is 30 20 30 respectively in this case figs 19 21 shows the multi auv position in longitudinal transverse and vertical coordinates using the simulation s ftcc protocol figs 22 and 23 stands for the attitude states of all auvs θ and ψ could converge to the same value figs 24 28 show the velocity states of the auv where each auv s input makes the velocity states converge fig 29 is the three dimensional trajectories of multi auv systems which actuator is health and the case that the actuator has partial broke down shows in fig 30 based on the simulation results even though the actuator occurs ploe all the state could converge to 0 and it proves the effectiveness of the protocol 11 from these simulation results we could see that the more complex communication topology can increase the connectivity of topological relations and enhance the convergence rate of multi auv systems 5 conclusions this passage proposes a distributed ftcc strategy for the leaderless second order multiple autonomous underwater vehicle systems the multi auv s partial actuator faults the robust connection heterogeneous communication topology the auv s dynamic is linearized utilizing the linear feedback method assuming this kind of effectiveness of the actuator can be obtained by a physical device or analysis algorithm the ftcc protocol is proposed the stability and consistency of the ftcc system is completed by lyapunov functional at last the numerical example shows all the auvs can converge to the same state no matter which cases occur which is the health or actuator of ploe the active fault tolerant control parameters can be changed in real time according to the fault detection algorithm which is less conservative it is shown that the proposed fault tolerant consensus strategy could address this problem efficiently and the more complex communication topology can increase the connectivity of topological relations and enhance the convergence rate of multi auv systems in the future we will improve the

reveals the effectiveness of the ftcc protocol method keywords the leaderless multi auv systems actuator breakdown heterogeneous digraph fault tolerant consensus 1 introduction with the progress of science and technology human beings have extended the field of development and exploration to the ocean s depth autonomous underwater vehicle auv formation has the advantages of strong load capacity high mission efficiency and good system redundancy cao et al 2018 chen et al 2020 meng et al 2021 w zhang zeng yan wei and tian 2021 w zhang et al 2019 accordingly multi auv systems which are equipped with numerous actuators sensors and other electronic components are at risk of breaking down in general under the traditional cooperative coordination controllers the faulty multi auv system can not realize the aim of control consequently the fault tolerant consensus control ftcc strategy of multi auv is of great significance this paper will discuss the ftcc problem of multi auv systems whose actuators have partial loss of effectiveness ploe fault in recent years the research on fault tolerant control of multi agent systems is pervasive ftc s purpose is that the system could still maintain the current performance and control objectives during any agent has troubles for a kind of lipschitz nonlinear multi agent systems q wang and wang 2018 zuo et al 2015 considers the problem of fault

lti multi agent systems over switching topology x wang and yang 2020 considers a linear leader follower network and there is more than one type of fault containing ploe fault and bias fault of the actuator the controller of cooperative fault tolerant is given k zhang jiang and shi 2017 proposes an adjustable distributed fault estimation observer for multi agent systems under digraphs z k li wen duan and ren 2015 address the distributed consensus controller design which addressed a problem of multi agent systems with normal linear systems whose adaptive protocol is independent of the topology graph s global information and it is totally distributed the problem of active fault tolerance consistency which is a series of lipschitz nonlinear multi agent systems is studied in x li and wang 2020 g zhang qin zheng and kang 2018 considers a class of multi agent systems of the consensus coordination control whose actuator for each agent has ploe fault considering a series of multi input systems which is nonlinear multi agent systems on digraph the study on cui et al 2017 addresses the adaptive collaborative consistency tracking problem every agent is modeled as a standard nonlinear system under unknown actuator failures and disturbances in j n li liu ru and xu 2020 j n li and ren 2021 these papers investigate a fault tolerant consensus problem of multi agent with actuator failures reacher j n li et al 2020 design an adaptive disturbance rejection law for partial failures in j n li and ren 2021 not only consider fault tolerant consensus for multiagent systems but focusing on the communication delays a study on c wang wang and ji 2016 deals with a kind of leader following consensus problem as well in which multi agent systems are nonlinear dynamics and the lead agent s control input is presumed to all followers based on relative states of neighbors the reachers on q wang and wang 2018 designed an ftcc strategy which is independent of the bounds of actuator faults one limitation of this result is that it applies only to the undirected communication graph jin et al 2018 qin et al 2019 study a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with actuator faults of partial loss of effectiveness fault and biased fault in qin et al 2019 to handle the control difficulty caused by the nonaffine dynamics a neural network adaptive consensus protocol is proposed jin et al 2018 investigates the controller is further physically implemented using the circuit theory few kinds of literature consider the ftcc of multi auv systems over heterogeneous communication topology y li ma and tong 2018 y li and tong 2017 liu et al 2017 saboori and khorasani 2015 focused on the passive fault tolerant control which means the controller s parameter and structure are fixed the controller is robust only to specific faults and there is no need to detect the fault online it has much conservative compared with active fault tolerant control motivated by the above works we intend to study an active fault tolerant consensus control aftcc of a leaderless multi auv system subject to actuator ploe faults and a heterogeneous directed communication topology graph it is generally known that the digraph s laplacian matrix is asymmetric so the lyapunov function in q wang and wang 2018 is no longer applicable however the lyapunov functions for multi agent systems without faults under the directed graph in z k li et al 2015 c wang et al 2016 can not be used in a multi agent system with actuator faults because the laplacian matrix would be coupled with the actuator efficiency factors for the lyapunov function derivative which makes the consensus error s convergence is difficult to analyze it is a truly challenging problem the formation of submarines mainly depends on underwater acoustic communication because of the acoustic communication characteristics and the limitation of communication equipment carried by submarines it is difficult to guarantee a complete effective and stable communication chain in practical projects using different heterogeneous communication topologies can reduce the amount of data in a single packet and solve the problem of communication bandwidth limitation compared to using only a single layer communication network using multilayer heterogeneous communication topology can enhance the communication capability of the system and greatly improve stability to overcome these problems we transform the original auv model into an equivalent linear model by linearization method and adopt second order multi auv systems to analyze the ftcc problem firstly then we put forward a distributed ftcc controller protocol which relies on the relative states of neighbors of auv by utilizing the actuator faults characteristics an improved lyapunov function is designed to probe the proposed ftcc strategy s validity the capital contributions of this paper are as follows 1 we study the ftcc strategy for leaderless multi auv systems over the heterogeneous directed communication topology which is more general as compared with q wang and wang 2018 zuo et al 2015 2 we propose the leaderless multi auv system fault tolerant consensus protocol which applies the relative state of the topology graph instead of the global information 3 here the loss of actuator effectiveness faults are more general and complex than cui et al 2017 and the actuator efficiency factors in each auv can not be identical 4 furthermore under the proposed fault tolerant strategy in this paper the auv s consensus error asymptotically converges to zero the remainder of this article s structure is as follows section 2 shows some proper preliminaries and the formulation of the problem the main result of the fault tolerant consensus strategy of leaderless

set of auv and the system s information exchange we can define a communication flow digraph directed graph a digraph g p is a pair v p ε p and v p v p 1 v p 2 v p 3 is a nonempty finite set of agents and the edges set is ε p v p v p the edge ε m n v m v n in the edge set of the digraph stands for that the node v n can get the message from the node v m and we called the node v n that is the neighbor of the node v m the neighbor set of auv i is shown by n i g t j v v j v i ε a directed path from a node v 1 to node v k could be described as an ordered sequence v 1 v 2 v k where all nodes

14 therefore this is a stable error multi auv system 13 the multi auv ftcc system could become consensus based on theorem 1 remark 2 it is noticed that the proposed ftcc strategy 11 is a fully distributed consensus protocol because the controller only uses the local relative states between itself and its neighbor it does not use the communication topology network s global information remark 3 the distributed fault tolerant protocol 11 is applicable for the condition that communication topology among each auv is a heterogeneous digraph in contrast the fully distributed controller in q wang and wang 2018 is designed under the undirected graph remark 4 compared with cui et al 2017 we consider many input multi auv systems because of the efficiency factors of different actuators in each auv so in the protocol 11 the coupling weights are designed variously remark 5 combined with the description u e t that shows the relationship between the actual output and the ideal output in formula 11 we can see that u e t is mainly affected by the defined parameters ρ i when ρ i max 1 2 α β β α 2 α β and other conditions in theorem1 the method of this paper can achieve consistency 4 numerical example in this section the proposed ftcc protocol of multi auv systems will be illustrated its effectiveness consider a position and velocity communication topology relationship of five auvs g 1 and g 2 shown in fig 3 and fig 4 auvs initial locations random distribution space is 0 50 0 50 3 0 0 auvs pitch angles θ are started in the interval π 3 π 3 the heading angle ψ is randomly distributed all the velocities of auvs are zero at the beginning to achieve the ftcc the fault tolerant consensus protocol gains k 1 0 1157 k 2 0 8245 and κ 1 here discussed two cases actuators are healthy the other is the actuators of auv 1 3 5 have partial broken down according to theorem 1 simulation results are shown in figs 5 14 all the picture in the left is the case of auv s actuator is health and the right simulation results indicate the case of auv s ploe actuator the factor of ploe actuator of auv 1 3 5 is 30 20 30 respectively figs 5 7 shows the multi auv position in longitudinal transverse and vertical coordinates using the simulation s ftcc protocol figs 8 and 9 stand for the attitude states of all auvs θ and ψ could converge to the same value figs 10 14 show the velocity states of the auv where each auv s input makes the velocity states converge fig 15 is the three dimensional trajectories of multi auv systems which actuator is health compared with that the case that the actuator has partial broke down shows in fig 16 based on the simulation results even though the actuator occurs ploe all the state could converge to the same by using the protocol 11 which means its effectiveness in addition more complex communication topology networks in practical engineering experiments are often used to improve the algebraic connectivity of the topological relationships of multi auv systems thus better ensuring the system stability and the convergence speed of consistency here we consider adding simulation with more complex topologies the initialization condition is the same as the simulation described above but the communication topology is more complex than the former the proposed ftcc protocol of multi auv systems will be illustrated its effectiveness consider a position and velocity communication topology relationship of five auvs g 3 and g 4 shown in fig 17 and fig 18 simulation outcomes are shown in figs 19 30 to the same with the first results all the picture in the left is the case of auv s actuator is health and the right simulation results indicate the case of auv s ploe actuator the factor of ploe actuator of auv 1 3 5 is 30 20 30 respectively in this case figs 19 21 shows the multi auv position in longitudinal transverse and vertical coordinates using the simulation s ftcc protocol figs 22 and 23 stands for the attitude states of all auvs θ and ψ could converge to the same value figs 24 28 show the velocity states of the auv where each auv s input makes the velocity states converge fig 29 is the three dimensional trajectories of multi auv systems which actuator is health and the case that the actuator has partial broke down shows in fig 30 based on the simulation results even though the actuator occurs ploe all the state could converge to 0 and it proves the effectiveness of the protocol 11 from these simulation results we could see that the more complex communication topology can increase the connectivity of topological relations and enhance the convergence rate of multi auv systems 5 conclusions this passage proposes a distributed ftcc strategy for the leaderless second order multiple autonomous underwater vehicle systems the multi auv s partial actuator faults the robust connection heterogeneous communication topology the auv s dynamic is linearized utilizing the linear feedback method assuming this kind of effectiveness of the actuator can be obtained by a physical device or analysis algorithm the ftcc protocol is proposed the stability and consistency of the ftcc system is completed by lyapunov functional at last the numerical example shows all the auvs can converge to the same state no matter which cases occur which is the health or actuator of ploe the active fault tolerant control parameters can be changed in real time according to the fault detection algorithm which is less conservative it is shown that the proposed fault tolerant consensus strategy could address this problem efficiently and the more complex communication topology can increase the connectivity of topological relations and enhance the convergence rate of multi auv systems in the future we will improve the

20288,it is significant to clarify the tunnel flow mechanism and its effect in a wide speed range for the design of a planing trimaran with large loading capacity and long cruising radius a numerical investigation of bare hull hydrodynamics of a planing trimaran designed for waterjet propulsion is conducted at 0 68 fr 6 16 the discussion is divided into two conditions of low hump speed and planing speed as tunnel effect varies with speed at fr 1 03 air cushion partly occurs in tunnel and it is considerable to improve the deceleration and distortion of tunnel flow for resistance reduction the added wetted area of concave tunnel and the strong wave interaction on tunnel accounts for the earlier hump speed and large hump resistance apart from tunnel lift generated by itself its promotion effect on lift of main hull plays a major role in the rapid hull lifting and moderate resistance growth at 2 74 fr 5 34 although the tunnel aerodynamic lift remains small no more than 3 of total displacement it helps to decrease resistance by providing bow lifting moment to keep hull trim unchanged and thus reduce main hull wetted length at 5 34 fr 6 16 keywords planing trimaran model test computational fluid dynamics tunnel flow hull lift resistance 1 introduction planing crafts have been the research hotspot for the studies on high speed and high performance ships over decades in general planing monohull is the most common hull type of planing crafts in addition to the optimization of hull shape parameters researchers often reduce hull resistance by adding transverse step and spray rails at the hull bottom for planing monohulls aiming to decrease the hull wetted area lotfi et al 2015 molchanov et al 2019 stepped planing crafts often equipped with screw propeller such as outboards surface piercing propeller and sterndrive it is worth noting that both transverse step and spray rail will lead to air ingestion at the hull bottom if the crafts are propelled by waterjet propulsion the air at the hull bottom might be sucked into the waterjet affecting its propulsion performance planing trimaran is a kind of hull with combined characters of the planing monohull the channel type planing craft and the high speed multi hull su et al 2014 the tunnels of planing trimaran create both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic force at high speed which further lift the hull and reduce the wetted area mainly accounting for the significant resistance reduction particularly although both side tunnels can provide a certain amount of aerodynamic lift the planing trimaran is still mainly supported by the hydrodynamic lift of main hull at planing states in detail under the same loading condition the planing trimaran often has better resistance performance and motion stability than planing monohull at high speed the smaller resistance lift ratio and weight power ratio result in the possibility on increasing the maximum running speed and sailing endurance ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2013 proposed a method for parametric design of planing tunnel vessel hull form which is based on the creation of four longitudinal guidelines and the quadruplet key points using the developed methed ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2014 designed two hulls with four tunnels pantamaran and two tunnels trimaran separately and then a numerical algorithm was put forward by them for hydrodynamic analyses for high speed vessels su et al 2014 introduced a channel type planing trimaran which has rigid skirts as long as the main hull and their planing trimaran experienced a significant resistance reduction with the forward speed across the high speed resistance peak as for the trimaran introduced in the above studies the rigid skirts are all the same length as the main hull moreover the channels of their hulls both have a pretty large inlet at the bow and a relatively small outlet at the stern the design speed of most long channel planing trimaran is mainly at fr 5 0 in practical engineering the rigid skirt of another type of planing trimarans starts from the longitudinal middle of main hull and then extends to the stern whose design speed is relatively higher ma et al 2013 conducted a detailed experimental research on the resistance performance of planing trimaran for various schemes of transverse step and spray rail they concluded that effects of spray rails on hull resistance of their trimaran appeared not distinct but it can improve its navigation ability at planing state yousefi et al 2014 put forward a type of planing trimaran where two tunnels were introduced at the bottom section of the original cougar planing hull monohull their results showed there was a 14 reduction in total resistance for the planing trimaran at the speed of 60 knot while the resistance of planing trimaran at low speed was larger than the original monohull the above researches mainly analyzed the hydrodynamic parameters such as hull resistance and running attitude for their planing trimaran but did not make a detailed analysis of the tunnel flow and its effects aiming at a two stepped planing trimaran jiang et al 2016 2017 conducted a detailed study to explore the hydro aerodynamics of the tunnel and transverse steps in the speed of 3 16 fr 5 87 they reported that for the speeds higher than fr 4 52 the aerodynamic forces provide major tunnel lift which mainly act on the straight section of the tunnel moreover the results showed that their planing trimaran has poor resistance performance at the hump region while it operates well in the planing state jiang 2018 also proposed that there was a coupling effect between the step and the tunnel which influences the resistance performance and motion stability of planing trimaran sun et al 2020 analyzed the flow evolution in the tunnel region of a one stepped planing trimaran they concluded that the total resistance of the planing trimaran was slightly larger than the planing monohull main hull of trimaran in the speed range of 3 43 fr 5 73 and then the resistance reduction of trimaran occurred at higher speeds the above researches mainly discussed the tunnel flow in the speed of fr 3 0 without paying attention to the conditions at low speed besides planing trimarans mentioned above are both relatively slender and propelled by surface piercing propeller mainly the hull type of planing trimaran is also suitable for waterjet propulsion however most of the planing trimaran mentioned in previous researches has slender hulls with large length beam ratio which is challenging to install the waterjet units and engine the main hull of several schemes has transverse steps and spray rails at hull bottom which may lead to the air ingestion at the hull bottom and are not suitable for waterjet propelled planing crafts if a high speed planing trimaran needs to be equipped with multi waterjet propulsion system the main hull should be relatively wide and the stern deadrise angle of main hull should be comparatively small moreover there should be no transverse steps at the hull bottom and spray rails should be avoided to be installed in front of the suction area of waterjet ingested flow in addition waterjet propulsion is more and more widely used in the crafts requiring large loading capacity and long cruising radius such as unmanned vehicle platform the above requirements on hull design will lead to the different characteristics of tunnel flow and resistance performance therefore it is necessary and meaningful to conduct a detailed analysis on the tunnel flow and its effects on the hydrodynamics of the planing trimaran designed for waterjet propulsion jiang and ding 2021 discussed the hull waterjet interaction of a dual waterjet propelled planing trimaran in the wide speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 this research mainly focused on the propulsion performance and mechanism of hull waterjet interaction without detailed analysis of the tunnel flow and its effects on the planing trimaran the experimental test and empirical theory have always been the classical approaches for the research of planing craft savitsky 1964 put forward a classical semi empirical method for predicting the hydrodynamics of planing hulls his method is based on the experimental results of prismatic planing mono hulls liu and wang 1979 verified that the semi empirical method proposed by savitsky can also be applied to multihulls based on the 2d t theory bilandi et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamics of a planing hull with two swept steps providing a fast and accurate simulation for performance prediction of planing crafts najafi et al 2019 2020 evaluated the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls by a series of towing tests under various froude numbers empirical theory and experimental methods mainly predict the main hydrodynamics of planing hull but it is challenging and expensive to capture the detailed flow field for deeper analysis of hydrodynamic mechanism in recent years computational fluid dynamics cfd has developed as a reliable and efficient technical approach to study the hydrodynamics of planing trimaran in detail due to the planing crafts experience large variation of running attitudes at different speed ranges the technique of overset grid has been widely used in the numerical simulations of planing hulls de luca et al 2016 sukas et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 besides dashtimanesh et al 2018 adopted the morphing mesh approach to simulate the hydrodynamics of a two stepped planing hull where the numerical results of resistance lift trim angle and wetted surface matched well with the experimental data in various velocities moreover the numerical ventilation problem at hull bottom also attracted attentions based on experimental and numerical study avci and barlas 2018 indicated that ventilation problem in numerical simulations of planing crafts may lead to an erroneous resistance reduction of 27 which referred to the abnormal water air distribution at the hull bottom it is also recommended to use the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme to solve the vof transport equation ding et al 2019 khazaee et al 2019 the numerical studies on planing trimaran are also increasing ma et al 2013 roshan et al 2020 su et al 2020 in total cfd technology has become a conventional means in the research of hydrodynamic performances of planing crafts the high speed planing trimaran studied in this paper is suitable for the installation of a dual waterjet propulsion system as for the design goal of large loading capacity long cruising radius and excellent ability to cross hump resistance for waterjet propelled craft the trimaran should give consideration to both low hump resistance and design speed resistance the special tunnel flow is the key to the resistance performance of planing trimaran at various speeds thus it is important and meaningful to deeply understand the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic mechanism of tunnel flow in a wide speed range for guiding the hull design and performance prediction of waterjet propelled planing trimaran at heavy load based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the sst k ω turbulence model this paper conducted a detailed study on the tunnel flow mechanism and its effect on the hull lift and resistance at low hump speed and planing speed separately as the tunnel effect varies in different sailing states 2 hull geometry the high speed planing trimaran used in this research is shown in fig 1 which is at the model scale and l o a 1 3 4 85 the main hull of the planing trimaran has two longitudinal steps moreover the main hull and rigid skirts form entrapment tunnels at both sides the scale ratio of this model ship is 2 8 and the hull parameters of the planing trimaran is presented in table 1 in order to explore the influences of tunnel flow and stern wave on each part of the hull the planing trimaran is divided into 4 parts including main hull mh tunnel rigid skirt ts transom tm and deck dk where the word hull includes all the above 4 parts and the word tunnel includes the tunnel and rigid skirt in the following discussions 3 computational methodology 3 1 numerical setup the simulations are conducted with the code star ccm 14 04 the finite volume method fvm is used to simulate the fluid field around the hull body and the governing equations are described by the reynold averaged navier stokes rans continuity equations an implicit unsteady time stepping method is used to calculate the solution the volume of fluid vof method is used to trace the free surface and the high resolution interface capturing hric format is applied to discretize the convective terms in the equation muzaferija and perić 1999 the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied the second order upwind scheme is used to discrete the governing equations to reduce the transaction errors all y wall treatments of wall functions are selected where intelligently the viscous sublayer was directly resolved if y 1 while wall functions are used to obtain the boundary conditions for the continuum equations if y 30 siemens 2019 otherwise a blending function is then used if 1 y 30 3 2 mesh generation only half geometry and domain of flow field is adopted in consideration of the symmetry of the hull apart from the symmetry plane the boundaries of upstream tank bottom tank top and tank side far field boundary are set as velocity inlet while the boundary of outlet is set as pressure outlet the motion of hull is simulated based on the method of overset mesh and the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model in the code was activated to have 2 degrees of freedom dof for the hull where the planing trimaran is free to pitch and heave in the meanwhile the background region was stationary the length of overset domain is 1 3 time of the hull length while the width is 0 85 time of the hull beam fig 2 shows the whole field domain of the simulations of planing trimaran three sectors within the range of the stern kelvin wedge are used for the mesh refinement of free surface as shown in fig 2 the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh because each grid of polyhedral mesh has more adjacent elements which can calculate the velocity and pressure gradient more accurately and simulate the air water distribution at hull bottom better especially at high planing states as shown in fig 3 mesh refinement has also been done in the tunnel region to better simulate the flow details moreover the velocity gradient in the hull boundary layer is large and the turbulence is strong especially at planing speeds thus more precise mesh generation is used in the hull boundary layer to simulate the turbulent flow near hull as shown in fig 4 in the meanwhile trimmed mesh is used in the background domain because the trimmed mesh is easier to control the total number of meshes and the flow change in the far field domain is not as strong as the flow around the hull 3 3 mesh verification a grid refinement study was carried out at the speed of fr 6 01 to obtain a suitable scheme of mesh generation for the bare hull simulations of planing trimaran see jiang and ding 2021 where the numerical results were also compared with the experimental data the seven mesh schemes for bare hull simulations have been shown in table 2 the mesh verification of numerical simulation for planing trimaran has been conducted based on the least squares root method eça and hoekstra 2014 as shown in fig 5 mesh no 4 can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours the numerical uncertainty of mesh no 4 is 1 19 and it is selected for the simulations the total grid number of the final mesh scheme is 2 84 million in detail the hull boundary layer growth rate is set to 1 25 and fourteen layers of prism layer meshes are used for the simulations the time step meeting dependence at the speed of fr 6 01 in numerical simulation is 1 10 4 s 4 model tests and comparison with a monohull the model towing tests of bare hull were conducted in towing tank of high speed hydrodynamic research center hubei china the length breadth and the water depth of the towing tank are 510 m 6 5 m and 5 m respectively the numerical and experimental results of the bare hull resistance trim and sinkage are shown in fig 6 it can be found that with growth of speed the deviation between numerical and experimental results of hull resistance becomes larger while the values of trim and sinkage match well savitsky et al 2007 proposed that spray resistance can constitute over 15 of the total resistance at planing speeds as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 there is obvious water spray around hull at planing speeds in fact the conventional numerical approach and vof method cannot accurately capture the water spray well which mainly accounts for the deviation between numerical and experimental resistance recently the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method has been reported as a better approach to simulate the water spray of planing hull at very high speed tagliafierro et al 2021 when evaluating the resistance characteristic of planing trimaran it is necessary to compare it with a monohull which used in similar working conditions the length to beam ratio of the main hull of this trimaran is too large which is not a typical hull design for heavy load planing monohull therefore in order to make a comparison with trimaran a conventional planing monohull is introduced in this section whose l o a 1 3 5 10 fig 9 and fig 10 show the model geometry of the planing monohull and its wave and spray in towing test at fr 5 63 the overall length of this monohull model is 2 78 m beam is 0 98 m and the displacement is 160 75 kg the longitudinal position of gravity center is at l cg l oa 0 34 from transom the towing test of this planing monohull was also conducted in high speed hydrodynamic research center hubei china it should be noted that this planing monohull is introduced only for the comparison with resistance performance of the planing trimaran and thus the hydrodynamics of planing monohull is not analyzed in detail in this paper the experimental resistances of planing trimaran and planing monohull in a wide speed range is shown in fig 11 where the relative positions of gravity center of the two crafts are similar firstly the resistance of planing trimaran is much larger than that of monohull in the low and hump speed and the resistance peak of trimaran occurs at earlier speed than monohull on the other hand there is an obvious resistance straight section of planing trimaran at fr 5 3 the growth rate of resistance of trimaran is relatively mild at planing speeds while that of monohull is more steep indicating that heavy load planing trimaran has a much better resistance performance than the monohull at fr 4 0 5 analysis of tunnel effects 5 1 overall analysis fig 12 shows the corresponding resistance of each part of trimaran it can be found that both main hull and tunnel reach a large resistance at hump speed with growth of sailing speed the resistance of main hull increases constantly at planing state while the resistance of tunnel experiences a steadily drop the different trends of the above two resistance components are the reason accounting for that total resistance of planing trimaran appears the gentle section at planing speed the following discussion is divided into two parts according to the speed range including low hump speed and planing speed to explore the mechanism of tunnel effect on the lift and resistance of planing trimaran a monohull which is just the main hull of trimaran and is transformed by cutting off the tunnels is introduced in the flowing discussion as shown in fig 13 this monohull has a large length to beam ratio of 5 1 which is only used for the comparison study with the original planing trimaran and cannot be directly applied to practical engineering moreover the running attitudes of monohull in numerical simulations are all the same as that of the trimaran at the same speed and the monohulls are all fixed at whole speed range the word pm refers to the monohull transformed from the main hull of trimaran while pt refers to trimaran in the following discussion 5 2 low hump speed 5 2 1 tunnel flow different from planing monohull the bow wave and water spray generated by the main hull of planing trimaran are partly absorbed by the tunnel and blocked by the rigid skirt which varies with the hull speeds the tunnel can provide lift to support the hull and the magnitude of this lift varies and the types of forces available are also different with growth of sailing speed at low speeds fr 1 03 the lift provided by tunnel is mainly static buoyancy apart from static buoyancy the hydrodynamic lift begins to provide elevating force for the tunnel at semi planing states about 1 0 fr 3 0 which is similar as that of main hull under the above two sailing states the lift of tunnel is still mainly provided by water fig 14 shows the various waves of trimaran and monohull at different sailing states the flow in the tunnel region is interfered with the waves generated by main hull and rigid skirts at the same time especially at hump speed at low speeds the hull of planing trimaran is immersed in water and the tunnel roof is almost wetted as shown in fig 14 the bow wave of main hull is still small at low speeds however in the speed range of displacement states the transverse velocity of wave making is relatively considerable compared with hull sailing speed apart from the wave generated by rigid skirt part of bow waves and flows of main hull are also obviously affected by the rigid skirt moreover the existence of wall boundary layer also partly accounts for the velocity reduction in the tunnel region as shown in fig 15 it can be found that the velocity in both x direction and y direction of water flow through the tunnel is significantly lower than that in the same position of planing monohull and even some of the streamlines are not very smooth the above deceleration and distortion of flow in the tunnel increase the energy loss of water flow and cause the relative increment of hull resistance as mentioned above the tunnel of this planing trimaran is nearly filled with water at displacement states and semi planing states and thus in most cases there is less tunnel air flows at these speeds however it should be noted that as there is wave interference in the tunnel at low medium speed some cavities appear below the tunnel roof which often occurs around wave trough of tunnel flow part of air flows into these cavities from some vents of the plugging wave at tunnel entrance and then a relatively closed air cushion will be formed in tunnel fig 16 shows the air cushion in the tunnel at the speed of fr 0 68 moreover fig 17 reflects that the pressure acted on the tunnel dry area contacting with the air cushion increases obviously comparing with other air contacted area of the tunnel the air cushion can provide lift forces to support the hull helping to reduce the wetted area of hull at a certain extent in fact with the same displacement the wetted area of planing trimaran at low speeds is often larger than that of planing monohull due to the construction of tunnel the larger wetted area mainly accounting for the poor resistance performance of planing trimaran when sailing at displacement states fr 1 03 in recent years for high speed and high performance ships such as planing crafts their low speed resistance performance has also been raised more attention as many work boats cruise and detect at low speed and thus the low speed resistance will affect the working endurance such as long voyage unmanned platforms in general it is difficult to improve the resistance performance by reducing the wetted area of planing trimaran at low speeds therefore improving the flow condition in the tunnel is one of the feasible ways to reduce the low speed resistance of planing trimaran at hump speeds semi planing states the tunnel is still filled with water mainly because of the large stern trim while the hydrodynamic lift of main hull is not enough to lift most of the hull out of the water at the same time similar as the phenomenon at low speeds there is also flow deceleration in the tunnel region but less flow distortion occurs fig 18 shows the smooth streamlines in the tunnel region at the speed of fr 1 37 on the other hand fig 14 b and c show there is more obvious interference effect between the bow wave of main hull and the wave of rigid skirt at semi planing states in this speed range the bow wave crest of main hull just interacts with the front of the tunnel strongly and then part of the breaker increases the wetted area of hull 5 2 2 effects on resistance due to the existence of tunnel the resistance performance of trimaran is often worse than that of monohull at low and hump speed as shown in fig 19 the resistance to lift ratio of tunnel is much larger than other parts of the hull reflecting that the tunnel has a negative effect on the resistance performance at this speed range in detail the capacity of the concave tunnel to provide buoyancy is obviously weaker than the convex hull structure the wetted area of planing trimaran is often larger than that of the monohull with the same displacement at low speed due to the particularity of concave structure of tunnel as show in fig 20 the wetted area of the tunnel is nearly as large as that of the main hull of this planing trimaran at low speed specially due to the wave interaction in tunnel region the tunnel wetted area has a small peak in the speed of 1 03 fr 2 05 where has the largest resistance to lift ratio of tunnel rigid skirt as shown in fig 21 the proportion of tunnel resistance is obviously higher than that of tunnel lift which accounts for the pretty large resistance to lift ratio of tunnel at the low and hump speed compared with other parts of planing trimaran in total the existence of the tunnel has negative effect on hull resistance in this speed range at hump speed the wave of main hull slams the front section of tunnel strongly which increases the bow lifting moment and makes the hull trim angle reaches the maximum value at an earlier speed causing the hump speed of planing trimaran earlier than that of monohull in the meanwhile the larger wetted area of trimaran also results in a larger hump resistance if the hull was propelled by waterjet it is in the condition of high pump rotation speed and low inflow velocity for waterjet at hump speed where the waterjet blade is prone to cavitation in order to ensure the anti cavitation performance of waterjet the larger hump resistance of planing trimaran corresponds to the larger size of waterjet which is adverse to the lightweight requirements of waterjet unit therefore apart from ensuring the high speed resistance performance how to reduce the hump resistance is also the key issue that the waterjet propelled planing craft needs to focus on moreover due to the requirement of endurance it is also necessary to improve the disordered flow in the tunnel region at low speed to reduce the resistance the research on resistance reduction of planing trimaran at low and hump speed will be carried out in the next 5 3 planing speed 5 3 1 tunnel flow at planing states waves and sprays are mainly produced in the bow of main hull and the crest of bow wave often appears at the longitudinal positions of mid ship around or even at stern where is exactly the working region of tunnel the bow wave and spray of main hull are captured by the tunnel entrance along with the air flow the energy of the air water mixed flow is absorbed and utilized by the tunnel and then the dynamic lift is generated which makes the hull get extra lift apart from the hydrodynamic lift a certain proportion of aerodynamic lift is also generated in the tunnel at planing state fr 3 0 which is quietly different from the conventional planing monohull 5 3 1 1 wave patterns in tunnel due to the blockage effect of tunnel and rigid skirt the pattern and flow of bow wave of planing trimaran changes obviously in comparison with those of monohull at planing states the wave pattern in the tunnel also varies with the increase of sailing speed fig 22 shows the various tunnel wave patterns at different planing speeds the results shows that at the speed of fr 3 42 the bow wave of main hull slams in the front of the tunnel at the same time the stem of rigid skirt separates from the water surface but the middle and aft part of it still makes waves at the initial planing stage the interference effect between the bow wave of main hull and the wave of rigid skirt obviously weakens at this speed as shown in figs 14 and 22 then with the growth of speed the hull draft continues to decrease then the stagnation point of the incoming flow at the main hull bottom moves to middle hull and the crest of bow wave moves to stern all constantly and quickly causing that the bow wave of main hull slams the more rear of tunnel at higher speed in the meanwhile it can be found that the rigid skirt is basically separated from the water surface and its wave making is small especially at very high speed in order to have a more detailed analysis of wave patterns and air water distributions in the whole tunnel region at different speeds eight cross sections have been built in tunnel fig 23 shows the detailed positions of eight cross sections the air water distribution and wave cut at each cross section in the speed range of 3 42 fr 6 16 are presented in fig 24 which also reflects the wave evolution in tunnel region at planing states it can be found that in the early planing speed although the front part of tunnel has been filled with amount of air the tunnel region is still nearly airtight because the outlet of the tunnel is immersed in water totally at fr 3 42 then as speed increases the wave making in the front part of tunnel reduces more quickly as the results shown in fig 24 there is no obvious wave at the tunnel entrance section no 1 at the speed higher than fr 4 79 on the other hand beginning from the speed of fr 4 79 ventilation phenomenon has been found on the side of tunnel near the main hull moreover fig 25 shows that the increasing speed of air volume becomes faster from the speed of fr 4 79 which is more obvious at the tunnel latter part in fact the tunnel width and height the transverse deadrise angle of hull bottom and the corner angle of longitudinal step all have effects on the flow in the tunnel which needs careful study in the next stage for the hull design of planing trimaran on the other hand although the rigid skirt dose not directly generate hull lift it blocks the outward propagation of wave making generated by main hull so that the tunnel can absorb the internal wave energy to provide additional hull lift mainly at planing speed at the same time the shielding effect of rigid skirt can also effectively prevent the air flow from escaping to the outside which is very significant for increasing the aerodynamic lift in the tunnel at high speed 5 3 1 2 air flow in tunnel at the initial stage of planing state the wave making in the front part of tunnel reduces obviously and the air begins to flow into the tunnel region fig 26 shows the streamlines of air flow entering into the tunnel region at fr 4 11 it can be found that although there are some ventilated orifices in the tunnel wave only a small amount of air flows out from the tunnel outlet at transom most of the air is trapped in the narrow space between the tunnel wave and the main hull while another part of them overflows beneath the rigid skirt therefore the air flow in the tunnel is relatively disordered and there is no obvious ventilation phenomenon at the early planing state at the speed higher than fr 4 79 the tunnel ventilation phenomenon has been getting more obvious fig 27 shows the streamlines of air flow in the tunnel region at fr 6 16 most of the air flows out from the tunnel side near the main hull and another small part flows out from the ventilated orifice near the rigid skirt particularly there is still an amount of air escaped beneath the front part of rigid skirt when once entering the tunnel as shown in fig 27 on the other hand the flow of some air is spiral while most of the air flows are nearly straight from entering the tunnel to leaving as shown in fig 28 as for this planing trimaran the rotating vector of air flow in the tunnel is not very obvious at most cross sections in general the air flow characteristics in the tunnel should be closely related to the tunnel structure and the wave patterns at different speeds also have a significant impact on the air flow in tunnel as this is a type of heavy load planing trimaran the tunnel roof is not completely separated from the wave until the maximum speed of fr 6 16 in total as for this planing trimaran there is tunnel ventilation phenomenon at planing speeds however there is no speed condition where the tunnel or even the tunnel roof is completely out of the water in the speed range of fr 6 16 5 3 1 3 components of tunnel lift the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift of tunnel at various speeds is shown in fig 29 the results indicate that the hydro lift of tunnel is dominant at most speeds with the increase of speed the intersection points of tunnel wave and tunnel roof moves astern rapidly causing the significant decrease of wetted surface of tunnel it is the smaller wetted surface that accounting for the reduction of tunnel lift in the speed range of fr 3 42 the magnitude of the aerodynamic lift remains relatively constant at 4 11 fr 6 16 due to the tunnel construction and wave patterns at high speeds there is obvious ram pressure effect of air flow in the tunnel region in detail as shown in fig 24 there is only small wave at the tunnel entrance at planing states while the latter part of tunnel still has plugging breakers at the same time which forms a channel with large inlet and small outlet for air flow once the air flows through the tunnel aerodynamic force is generated and then acts on the wall of tunnel moreover with the growth of sailing speed although the higher air flow speed can strengthen the ram pressure effect the larger vent at tunnel outlet weakens this effect oppositely causing the air lift of tunnel keeps dynamic balance at the speed of 4 11 fr 6 16 in general the aerodynamic lift generated by the tunnel of this planing trimaran only accounts for around 2 5 of the overall weight of hull at very high speed as shown in fig 29 5 3 2 effects on resistance the tunnel effect is the most important reason for the excellent resistance performance of planing trimaran at planing speeds which is helpful to provide added force to lift the hull out of the water and the righting moment for the force balance of hull as the result shown in fig 19 the resistance to lift ratio of tunnel is larger in comparison with other parts of trimaran in fact as the tunnel has ram pressure effect on the air flow there is also considerable aerodynamic resistance when the tunnel produces aerodynamic lift at the same time the air flow in the tunnel is different from that in the open environment for example the air resistance to lift ratio of the deck is still small therefore the total resistance of trimaran is not straightly reduced by a small resistance to lift ratio of the tunnel as which does not exist the resistance reduction of trimaran at planing speed is achieved by changing the running attitude including sinkage and trim through the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift generated by the tunnel effect in detail trimaran is mainly affected by tunnel lift main hull lift and hull gravity in the vertical direction the lifts of deck and transom are small and are classified as the lift of main hull thus it is of great significance to understand the resistance reduction mechanism of trimaran by clarifying the tunnel effect on the main hull lift and the specific distribution of tunnel lift 5 3 2 1 lift distribution on tunnel the distribution of tunnel lift directly affects the running attitude of trimaran which plays an important role in overall resistance performance in order to explore the influence of tunnel flow variation on the distribution of tunnel aerodynamic lift and hydrodynamic lift the tunnel is divided into 20 segments along the longitudinal direction as shown in fig 30 fig 31 shows the lift distribution on the tunnel at various speeds as shown in results the maximum lift on the tunnel section decreases with the increase of the speed and the position of the maximum lift section moves to the stern in the meanwhile the variation of tunnel lift distribution is closely related to the slamming of the bow wave of the main hull on the tunnel roof as shown in fig 22 the wetted length of tunnel reduces quickly as the speed is higher on the other hand the crest height of bow wave of main hull decreases with higher speed and the attack angle of the wave slamming on the tunnel roof also reduces at the same time causing the peak lift of tunnel section experiences a constantly reduction as the tunnel has not been fully ventilated in the speed range of fr 6 16 the hydrodynamic lift has always been dominant for tunnel lift at planing state the distribution of tunnel lift straightly influences the moment provided by tunnel fig 32 shows the moment provided by tunnel lift and the corresponding lift center of main hull and tunnel at various speeds the tunnel moment has experienced a process of first increasing and then decreasing which is dominated by the tunnel hydrodynamic lift in detail as the wave slamming point on tunnel moves backward with higher speed the hydrodynamic lift center of tunnel also continues to move aft at first the trimming moment generated by the tunnel increases with the larger hydrodynamic lift arm but later with the rapid decrease of the tunnel lift the tunnel moment also presents a downward trend in addition with the decrease of the hydrodynamic lift in the rear section of tunnel the aerodynamic lift on the front middle section of tunnel also becomes another main source of the total tunnel lift although the aerodynamic lift itself does not increase obviously at this time the center of the overall tunnel lift moves to the bow direction that is the arm of the overall tunnel lift becomes shorter at fr 5 47 on the other hand although the total moment of tunnel plays the role of stern lifting the tunnel aerodynamic lift is a bow lifting moment though it is very small this is due to the fact for the modeling of this trimaran the tunnel area includes not only the shelter region by rigid skirt but also the arch structure at the bow which mainly cause the bow lifting moment of air at the early planing speed as shown in fig 33 a when sailing at higher speed the tunnel aerodynamic lift is mainly concentrated in the front and middle section of the tunnel as shown in fig 33 b when the air flows into the narrow tunnel from the open area the air flow speed slows down at the tunnel entrance thus forming a high pressure zone at the front region of tunnel apart from the high pressure zone at tunnel entrance the air flow also forms another high pressure zone in front of the wave slamming point on the tunnel as the slamming of waves also hindered the flow of high speed air to the tunnel outlet on the whole because the trimaran centroid is relatively backward l cg l oa 0 35 from transom the aerodynamic lift of the tunnel still provides the bow lifting moment for the overall hull of trimaran at higher planing speed in fact the lift distribution of tunnel is more related to both tunnel configuration and loading condition in total as the overall tunnel moment is a stern lifting moment it is beneficial for decrease the trim angle of trimaran at planing state which is helpful on the resistance reduction moreover the tunnel moment can also balance the moment of main hull to delay the emergence of porpoising at a higher speed 5 3 2 2 tunnel effect on main hull lift fig 34 shows the lift of each parts of planing trimaran at the speed of 0 68 fr 6 16 it can be found that for this planing trimaran the main hull provides the majority of lift to balance the hull gravity in the whole speed range the tunnel contributes the maximum lift about 24 ship weight at initial planing speed and then its lift constantly decreases at high speed the lift of main hull of trimaran still plays a leading role in lifting the ship at planing state as mentioned above the tunnel can reduce the pressure loss in the process of wave propagation generated by main hull particularly the tunnel also has positive effect on promoting the lift of main hull as the running attitude of the monohull pm is the same as that of the planing trimaran the only difference between two hulls is whether there is a tunnel as shown in fig 35 the main hull lift of trimaran is mainly larger than that of monohull especially in the speed of 1 37 fr 5 79 in this corresponding speed range the wave slams on the tunnel roof and rigid skirt and this interaction prevents the energy dissipation of the wave propagating to the far field fig 36 shows that there is significant distinction between pressure distribution of the hull around flow field of trimaran and monohull at fr 3 42 where the position of cross section is at x l oa 0 3 correspondingly the pressure on the main hull also changed obviously as shown in fig 37 the wetted length of tunnel is still long at fr 3 42 the area of pressure increase on the main hull is relatively larger with the speed growth the wetted length of tunnel decreases obviously and the effect of tunnel flow on the increase of the main hull pressure reduces obviously fig 38 shows there is only a small area of trimaran which has higher pressure than monohull thus at fr 5 79 the difference of main hull lift between the two hulls is small 5 3 2 3 effect on running attitude the resistance reduction of trimaran at planing speed is achieved by changing the running attitude including sinkage and trim through the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift extra generated by the tunnel effect in detail trimaran is mainly affected by tunnel lift main hull lift and hull gravity in the vertical direction at the speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 apart from the considerable lift provided by tunnel itself the tunnel also has significant effect on promoting the lift of main hull which results in a sharp decrease of hull draft as shown in fig 20 the wetted area of main hull experiences a rapid reduction in this speed range especially at 3 42 fr 5 34 at this time the tunnel wetted area also decreases due to the fast backward of bow wave crest therefore the promotion effect of tunnel on overall hull lift leads to the more moderate resistance growth for this trimaran in the planing speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 causing the resistance reduction in comparison with conventional planing monohull at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 the attack angle between the tunnel wall and the flow generated by bow wave is relatively small at this speed range the force of the bow wave acted on the tunnel has entered a fast descent stage according to the characteristics of sine function as shown in figs 12 and 21 both the tunnel resistance and lift experience a sharp decrease at this speed range as the tunnel lift itself and its promoting effect on the main hull lift decreases simultaneously the proportion of the lift provided by the main hull increases obviously at this speed range in fact at this speed the resistance to lift ratio of the main hull is smaller than that of the tunnel which means the main hull produces relatively smaller resistance while making up for the same lift of tunnel therefore the overall resistance of trimaran remains nearly unchanged with the higher speed at 5 34 fr 6 16 particularly it is not to say that the tunnel plays a negative effect on resistance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 as for planing monohull when the speed becomes higher the hull draft becomes shallower and it needs to reduce the trim angle to decrease the dynamic pressure at the stern so as to keep the force balance on the hull this process will increase the wetted length of the monohull at a higher planing state therefore when the speed of planing monohull reaches a certain speed the downward trend of its wetted area will stop or even turn to increase as for the planing trimaran the trim angle keeps almost stable at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 while the draft of hull decreases constantly when the planing speed is higher at this time the lift center of main hull moves astern and its bow lifting moment also reduces as shown in fig 32 on the other hand the stern lifting moment provided by the tunnel hydrodynamic lift decreases and the tunnel aerodynamic lift makes up part of the bow lifting moment for the main hull the dynamic balance of the above three forces and three moment makes the trim angle of trimaran basically unchanged while its draft continuously reduces at higher planing speed 5 34 fr 6 16 thus the main hull of trimaran also experiences a small reduction of wetted area at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 where the wetted area of the tunnel also decreases rapidly in a command the tunnel effect still decreases the resistance by reducing the overall wetted area of trimaran at higher planing speed specially different from the previous speed range of 2 74 fr 5 34 the aerodynamic lift of tunnel plays a more important role in the remarkable resistance performance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 in addition trimaran has three kinds of forces namely the tunnel hydrodynamic lift the tunnel aerodynamic lift and the main hull lift to balance the hull gravity the balance of multiple forces makes the trimaran have a better motion stability and course stability in high planing speed compared with the conventional planing monohull fig 39 shows the dual waterjet propelled planing trimaran in full size the excellent motion stability has also been verified in the full size ship test of this trimaran 6 conclusion 1 in comparison with conventional planing monohull at similar values of l o a 1 3 and l cg l oa the concave tunnel has a negative effect on the resistance of planing trimaran at low hump speed while the excellent resistance performance of trimaran is mainly reflected in planing speed it is considerable to improve the deceleration and distortion of tunnel flow for resistance reduction at low speed of fr 1 03 as the low speed resistance significantly influences the cruising radius and working endurance of trimaran 2 the heavy load planing trimaran has an earlier hump speed and a larger hump resistance at hump speed the bow wave slams the front section of tunnel which increases the bow lifting moment and makes the hump speed of planing trimaran earlier than that of monohull in the meanwhile the larger wetted area of trimaran also results in a larger hump resistance the larger hump resistance of trimaran corresponds to the larger size of waterjet which is not conducive to the lightweight requirements of waterjet unit 3 the tunnel can absorb the internal wave energy to provide additional hull lift where the hydrodynamic lift is still dominant in the tunnel lift for this trimaran the maximum tunnel aerodynamic lift takes up no more than 3 of total displacement apart from the considerable lift provided by tunnel itself the tunnel also has significant promoting effect on the lift of main hull at the speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 which results in a sharp decrease of hull draft and causes a rapid reduction of the wetted area of main hull in this speed range 4 the tunnel lift itself and its promoting effect on the main hull lift decreases simultaneously at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 the tunnel aerodynamic lift makes up part of the bow lifting moment for the main hull in this speed range and the dynamic balance makes the trim angle of trimaran basically unchanged while its draft continuously reduced at higher planing speed the aerodynamic lift of tunnel plays a more important role in the remarkable resistance performance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 credit authorship contribution statement jiangming ding conceptualization methodology validation

20288,it is significant to clarify the tunnel flow mechanism and its effect in a wide speed range for the design of a planing trimaran with large loading capacity and long cruising radius a numerical investigation of bare hull hydrodynamics of a planing trimaran designed for waterjet propulsion is conducted at 0 68 fr 6 16 the discussion is divided into two conditions of low hump speed and planing speed as tunnel effect varies with speed at fr 1 03 air cushion partly occurs in tunnel and it is considerable to improve the deceleration and distortion of tunnel flow for resistance reduction the added wetted area of concave tunnel and the strong wave interaction on tunnel accounts for the earlier hump speed and large hump resistance apart from tunnel lift generated by itself its promotion effect on lift of main hull plays a major role in the rapid hull lifting and moderate resistance growth at 2 74 fr 5 34 although the tunnel aerodynamic lift remains small no more than 3 of total displacement it helps to decrease resistance by providing bow lifting moment to keep hull trim unchanged and thus reduce main hull wetted length at 5 34 fr 6 16 keywords planing trimaran model test computational fluid dynamics tunnel flow hull lift resistance 1 introduction planing crafts have been the research hotspot for the studies on high speed and high performance ships over decades in general planing monohull is the most common hull type of planing crafts in addition to the optimization of hull shape parameters researchers often reduce hull resistance by adding transverse step and spray rails at the hull bottom for planing monohulls aiming to decrease the hull wetted area lotfi et al 2015 molchanov et al 2019 stepped planing crafts often equipped with screw propeller such as outboards surface piercing propeller and sterndrive it is worth noting that both transverse step and spray rail will lead to air ingestion at the hull bottom if the crafts are propelled by waterjet propulsion the air at the hull bottom might be sucked into the waterjet affecting its propulsion performance planing trimaran is a kind of hull with combined characters of the planing monohull the channel type planing craft and the high speed multi hull su et al 2014 the tunnels of planing trimaran create both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic force at high speed which further lift the hull and reduce the wetted area mainly accounting for the significant resistance reduction particularly although both side tunnels can provide a certain amount of aerodynamic lift the planing trimaran is still mainly supported by the hydrodynamic lift of main hull at planing states in detail under the same loading condition the planing trimaran often has better resistance performance and motion stability than planing monohull at high speed the smaller resistance lift ratio and weight power ratio result in the possibility on increasing the maximum running speed and sailing endurance ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2013 proposed a method for parametric design of planing tunnel vessel hull form which is based on the creation of four longitudinal guidelines and the quadruplet key points using the developed methed ghassabzadeh and ghassemi 2014 designed two hulls with four tunnels pantamaran and two tunnels trimaran separately and then a numerical algorithm was put forward by them for hydrodynamic analyses for high speed vessels su et al 2014 introduced a channel type planing trimaran which has rigid skirts as long as the main hull and their planing trimaran experienced a significant resistance reduction with the forward speed across the high speed resistance peak as for the trimaran introduced in the above studies the rigid skirts are all the same length as the main hull moreover the channels of their hulls both have a pretty large inlet at the bow and a relatively small outlet at the stern the design speed of most long channel planing trimaran is mainly at fr 5 0 in practical engineering the rigid skirt of another type of planing trimarans starts from the longitudinal middle of main hull and then extends to the stern whose design speed is relatively higher ma et al 2013 conducted a detailed experimental research on the resistance performance of planing trimaran for various schemes of transverse step and spray rail they concluded that effects of spray rails on hull resistance of their trimaran appeared not distinct but it can improve its navigation ability at planing state yousefi et al 2014 put forward a type of planing trimaran where two tunnels were introduced at the bottom section of the original cougar planing hull monohull their results showed there was a 14 reduction in total resistance for the planing trimaran at the speed of 60 knot while the resistance of planing trimaran at low speed was larger than the original monohull the above researches mainly analyzed the hydrodynamic parameters such as hull resistance and running attitude for their planing trimaran but did not make a detailed analysis of the tunnel flow and its effects aiming at a two stepped planing trimaran jiang et al 2016 2017 conducted a detailed study to explore the hydro aerodynamics of the tunnel and transverse steps in the speed of 3 16 fr 5 87 they reported that for the speeds higher than fr 4 52 the aerodynamic forces provide major tunnel lift which mainly act on the straight section of the tunnel moreover the results showed that their planing trimaran has poor resistance performance at the hump region while it operates well in the planing state jiang 2018 also proposed that there was a coupling effect between the step and the tunnel which influences the resistance performance and motion stability of planing trimaran sun et al 2020 analyzed the flow evolution in the tunnel region of a one stepped planing trimaran they concluded that the total resistance of the planing trimaran was slightly larger than the planing monohull main hull of trimaran in the speed range of 3 43 fr 5 73 and then the resistance reduction of trimaran occurred at higher speeds the above researches mainly discussed the tunnel flow in the speed of fr 3 0 without paying attention to the conditions at low speed besides planing trimarans mentioned above are both relatively slender and propelled by surface piercing propeller mainly the hull type of planing trimaran is also suitable for waterjet propulsion however most of the planing trimaran mentioned in previous researches has slender hulls with large length beam ratio which is challenging to install the waterjet units and engine the main hull of several schemes has transverse steps and spray rails at hull bottom which may lead to the air ingestion at the hull bottom and are not suitable for waterjet propelled planing crafts if a high speed planing trimaran needs to be equipped with multi waterjet propulsion system the main hull should be relatively wide and the stern deadrise angle of main hull should be comparatively small moreover there should be no transverse steps at the hull bottom and spray rails should be avoided to be installed in front of the suction area of waterjet ingested flow in addition waterjet propulsion is more and more widely used in the crafts requiring large loading capacity and long cruising radius such as unmanned vehicle platform the above requirements on hull design will lead to the different characteristics of tunnel flow and resistance performance therefore it is necessary and meaningful to conduct a detailed analysis on the tunnel flow and its effects on the hydrodynamics of the planing trimaran designed for waterjet propulsion jiang and ding 2021 discussed the hull waterjet interaction of a dual waterjet propelled planing trimaran in the wide speed range of 0 68 fr 6 16 this research mainly focused on the propulsion performance and mechanism of hull waterjet interaction without detailed analysis of the tunnel flow and its effects on the planing trimaran the experimental test and empirical theory have always been the classical approaches for the research of planing craft savitsky 1964 put forward a classical semi empirical method for predicting the hydrodynamics of planing hulls his method is based on the experimental results of prismatic planing mono hulls liu and wang 1979 verified that the semi empirical method proposed by savitsky can also be applied to multihulls based on the 2d t theory bilandi et al 2020 investigated the hydrodynamics of a planing hull with two swept steps providing a fast and accurate simulation for performance prediction of planing crafts najafi et al 2019 2020 evaluated the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls by a series of towing tests under various froude numbers empirical theory and experimental methods mainly predict the main hydrodynamics of planing hull but it is challenging and expensive to capture the detailed flow field for deeper analysis of hydrodynamic mechanism in recent years computational fluid dynamics cfd has developed as a reliable and efficient technical approach to study the hydrodynamics of planing trimaran in detail due to the planing crafts experience large variation of running attitudes at different speed ranges the technique of overset grid has been widely used in the numerical simulations of planing hulls de luca et al 2016 sukas et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 besides dashtimanesh et al 2018 adopted the morphing mesh approach to simulate the hydrodynamics of a two stepped planing hull where the numerical results of resistance lift trim angle and wetted surface matched well with the experimental data in various velocities moreover the numerical ventilation problem at hull bottom also attracted attentions based on experimental and numerical study avci and barlas 2018 indicated that ventilation problem in numerical simulations of planing crafts may lead to an erroneous resistance reduction of 27 which referred to the abnormal water air distribution at the hull bottom it is also recommended to use the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme to solve the vof transport equation ding et al 2019 khazaee et al 2019 the numerical studies on planing trimaran are also increasing ma et al 2013 roshan et al 2020 su et al 2020 in total cfd technology has become a conventional means in the research of hydrodynamic performances of planing crafts the high speed planing trimaran studied in this paper is suitable for the installation of a dual waterjet propulsion system as for the design goal of large loading capacity long cruising radius and excellent ability to cross hump resistance for waterjet propelled craft the trimaran should give consideration to both low hump resistance and design speed resistance the special tunnel flow is the key to the resistance performance of planing trimaran at various speeds thus it is important and meaningful to deeply understand the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic mechanism of tunnel flow in a wide speed range for guiding the hull design and performance prediction of waterjet propelled planing trimaran at heavy load based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation with the sst k ω turbulence model this paper conducted a detailed study on the tunnel flow mechanism and its effect on the hull lift and resistance at low hump speed and planing speed separately as the tunnel effect varies in different sailing states 2 hull geometry the high speed planing trimaran used in this research is shown in fig 1 which is at the model scale and l o a 1 3 4 85 the main hull of the planing trimaran has two longitudinal steps moreover the main hull and rigid skirts form entrapment tunnels at both sides the scale ratio of this model ship is 2 8 and the hull parameters of the planing trimaran is presented in table 1 in order to explore the influences of tunnel flow and stern wave on each part of the hull the planing trimaran is divided into 4 parts including main hull mh tunnel rigid skirt ts transom tm and deck dk where the word hull includes all the above 4 parts and the word tunnel includes the tunnel and rigid skirt in the following discussions 3 computational methodology 3 1 numerical setup the simulations are conducted with the code star ccm 14 04 the finite volume method fvm is used to simulate the fluid field around the hull body and the governing equations are described by the reynold averaged navier stokes rans continuity equations an implicit unsteady time stepping method is used to calculate the solution the volume of fluid vof method is used to trace the free surface and the high resolution interface capturing hric format is applied to discretize the convective terms in the equation muzaferija and perić 1999 the s s t k ω turbulence model with wall functions is applied the second order upwind scheme is used to discrete the governing equations to reduce the transaction errors all y wall treatments of wall functions are selected where intelligently the viscous sublayer was directly resolved if y 1 while wall functions are used to obtain the boundary conditions for the continuum equations if y 30 siemens 2019 otherwise a blending function is then used if 1 y 30 3 2 mesh generation only half geometry and domain of flow field is adopted in consideration of the symmetry of the hull apart from the symmetry plane the boundaries of upstream tank bottom tank top and tank side far field boundary are set as velocity inlet while the boundary of outlet is set as pressure outlet the motion of hull is simulated based on the method of overset mesh and the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi model in the code was activated to have 2 degrees of freedom dof for the hull where the planing trimaran is free to pitch and heave in the meanwhile the background region was stationary the length of overset domain is 1 3 time of the hull length while the width is 0 85 time of the hull beam fig 2 shows the whole field domain of the simulations of planing trimaran three sectors within the range of the stern kelvin wedge are used for the mesh refinement of free surface as shown in fig 2 the overset domain around the hull uses the polyhedral mesh because each grid of polyhedral mesh has more adjacent elements which can calculate the velocity and pressure gradient more accurately and simulate the air water distribution at hull bottom better especially at high planing states as shown in fig 3 mesh refinement has also been done in the tunnel region to better simulate the flow details moreover the velocity gradient in the hull boundary layer is large and the turbulence is strong especially at planing speeds thus more precise mesh generation is used in the hull boundary layer to simulate the turbulent flow near hull as shown in fig 4 in the meanwhile trimmed mesh is used in the background domain because the trimmed mesh is easier to control the total number of meshes and the flow change in the far field domain is not as strong as the flow around the hull 3 3 mesh verification a grid refinement study was carried out at the speed of fr 6 01 to obtain a suitable scheme of mesh generation for the bare hull simulations of planing trimaran see jiang and ding 2021 where the numerical results were also compared with the experimental data the seven mesh schemes for bare hull simulations have been shown in table 2 the mesh verification of numerical simulation for planing trimaran has been conducted based on the least squares root method eça and hoekstra 2014 as shown in fig 5 mesh no 4 can obtain good numerical accuracy and may also cost reasonable cpu hours the numerical uncertainty of mesh no 4 is 1 19 and it is selected for the simulations the total grid number of the final mesh scheme is 2 84 million in detail the hull boundary layer growth rate is set to 1 25 and fourteen layers of prism layer meshes are used for the simulations the time step meeting dependence at the speed of fr 6 01 in numerical simulation is 1 10 4 s 4 model tests and comparison with a monohull the model towing tests of bare hull were conducted in towing tank of high speed hydrodynamic research center hubei china the length breadth and the water depth of the towing tank are 510 m 6 5 m and 5 m respectively the numerical and experimental results of the bare hull resistance trim and sinkage are shown in fig 6 it can be found that with growth of speed the deviation between numerical and experimental results of hull resistance becomes larger while the values of trim and sinkage match well savitsky et al 2007 proposed that spray resistance can constitute over 15 of the total resistance at planing speeds as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 there is obvious water spray around hull at planing speeds in fact the conventional numerical approach and vof method cannot accurately capture the water spray well which mainly accounts for the deviation between numerical and experimental resistance recently the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method has been reported as a better approach to simulate the water spray of planing hull at very high speed tagliafierro et al 2021 when evaluating the resistance characteristic of planing trimaran it is necessary to compare it with a monohull which used in similar working conditions the length to beam ratio of the main hull of this trimaran is too large which is not a typical hull design for heavy load planing monohull therefore in order to make a comparison with trimaran a conventional planing monohull is introduced in this section whose l o a 1 3 5 10 fig 9 and fig 10 show the model geometry of the planing monohull and its wave and spray in towing test at fr 5 63 the overall length of this monohull model is 2 78 m beam is 0 98 m and the displacement is 160 75 kg the longitudinal position of gravity center is at l cg l oa 0 34 from transom the towing test of this planing monohull was also conducted in high speed hydrodynamic research center hubei china it should be noted that this planing monohull is introduced only for the comparison with resistance performance of the planing trimaran and thus the hydrodynamics of planing monohull is not analyzed in detail in this paper the experimental resistances of planing trimaran and planing monohull in a wide speed range is shown in fig 11 where the relative positions of gravity center of the two crafts are similar firstly the resistance of planing trimaran is much larger than that of monohull in the low and hump speed and the resistance peak of trimaran occurs at earlier speed than monohull on the other hand there is an obvious resistance straight section of planing trimaran at fr 5 3 the growth rate of resistance of trimaran is relatively mild at planing speeds while that of monohull is more steep indicating that heavy load planing trimaran has a much better resistance performance than the monohull at fr 4 0 5 analysis of tunnel effects 5 1 overall analysis fig 12 shows the corresponding resistance of each part of trimaran it can be found that both main hull and tunnel reach a large resistance at hump speed with growth of sailing speed the resistance of main hull increases constantly at planing state while the resistance of tunnel experiences a steadily drop the different trends of the above two resistance components are the reason accounting for that total resistance of planing trimaran appears the gentle section at planing speed the following discussion is divided into two parts according to the speed range including low hump speed and planing speed to explore the mechanism of tunnel effect on the lift and resistance of planing trimaran a monohull which is just the main hull of trimaran and is transformed by cutting off the tunnels is introduced in the flowing discussion as shown in fig 13 this monohull has a large length to beam ratio of 5 1 which is only used for the comparison study with the original planing trimaran and cannot be directly applied to practical engineering moreover the running attitudes of monohull in numerical simulations are all the same as that of the trimaran at the same speed and the monohulls are all fixed at whole speed range the word pm refers to the monohull transformed from the main hull of trimaran while pt refers to trimaran in the following discussion 5 2 low hump speed 5 2 1 tunnel flow different from planing monohull the bow wave and water spray generated by the main hull of planing trimaran are partly absorbed by the tunnel and blocked by the rigid skirt which varies with the hull speeds the tunnel can provide lift to support the hull and the magnitude of this lift varies and the types of forces available are also different with growth of sailing speed at low speeds fr 1 03 the lift provided by tunnel is mainly static buoyancy apart from static buoyancy the hydrodynamic lift begins to provide elevating force for the tunnel at semi planing states about 1 0 fr 3 0 which is similar as that of main hull under the above two sailing states the lift of tunnel is still mainly provided by water fig 14 shows the various waves of trimaran and monohull at different sailing states the flow in the tunnel region is interfered with the waves generated by main hull and rigid skirts at the same time especially at hump speed at low speeds the hull of planing trimaran is immersed in water and the tunnel roof is almost wetted as shown in fig 14 the bow wave of main hull is still small at low speeds however in the speed range of displacement states the transverse velocity of wave making is relatively considerable compared with hull sailing speed apart from the wave generated by rigid skirt part of bow waves and flows of main hull are also obviously affected by the rigid skirt moreover the existence of wall boundary layer also partly accounts for the velocity reduction in the tunnel region as shown in fig 15 it can be found that the velocity in both x direction and y direction of water flow through the tunnel is significantly lower than that in the same position of planing monohull and even some of the streamlines are not very smooth the above deceleration and distortion of flow in the tunnel increase the energy loss of water flow and cause the relative increment of hull resistance as mentioned above the tunnel of this planing trimaran is nearly filled with water at displacement states and semi planing states and thus in most cases there is less tunnel air flows at these speeds however it should be noted that as there is wave interference in the tunnel at low medium speed some cavities appear below the tunnel roof which often occurs around wave trough of tunnel flow part of air flows into these cavities from some vents of the plugging wave at tunnel entrance and then a relatively closed air cushion will be formed in tunnel fig 16 shows the air cushion in the tunnel at the speed of fr 0 68 moreover fig 17 reflects that the pressure acted on the tunnel dry area contacting with the air cushion increases obviously comparing with other air contacted area of the tunnel the air cushion can provide lift forces to support the hull helping to reduce the wetted area of hull at a certain extent in fact with the same displacement the wetted area of planing trimaran at low speeds is often larger than that of planing monohull due to the construction of tunnel the larger wetted area mainly accounting for the poor resistance performance of planing trimaran when sailing at displacement states fr 1 03 in recent years for high speed and high performance ships such as planing crafts their low speed resistance performance has also been raised more attention as many work boats cruise and detect at low speed and thus the low speed resistance will affect the working endurance such as long voyage unmanned platforms in general it is difficult to improve the resistance performance by reducing the wetted area of planing trimaran at low speeds therefore improving the flow condition in the tunnel is one of the feasible ways to reduce the low speed resistance of planing trimaran at hump speeds semi planing states the tunnel is still filled with water mainly because of the large stern trim while the hydrodynamic lift of main hull is not enough to lift most of the hull out of the water at the same time similar as the phenomenon at low speeds there is also flow deceleration in the tunnel region but less flow distortion occurs fig 18 shows the smooth streamlines in the tunnel region at the speed of fr 1 37 on the other hand fig 14 b and c show there is more obvious interference effect between the bow wave of main hull and the wave of rigid skirt at semi planing states in this speed range the bow wave crest of main hull just interacts with the front of the tunnel strongly and then part of the breaker increases the wetted area of hull 5 2 2 effects on resistance due to the existence of tunnel the resistance performance of trimaran is often worse than that of monohull at low and hump speed as shown in fig 19 the resistance to lift ratio of tunnel is much larger than other parts of the hull reflecting that the tunnel has a negative effect on the resistance performance at this speed range in detail the capacity of the concave tunnel to provide buoyancy is obviously weaker than the convex hull structure the wetted area of planing trimaran is often larger than that of the monohull with the same displacement at low speed due to the particularity of concave structure of tunnel as show in fig 20 the wetted area of the tunnel is nearly as large as that of the main hull of this planing trimaran at low speed specially due to the wave interaction in tunnel region the tunnel wetted area has a small peak in the speed of 1 03 fr 2 05 where has the largest resistance to lift ratio of tunnel rigid skirt as shown in fig 21 the proportion of tunnel resistance is obviously higher than that of tunnel lift which accounts for the pretty large resistance to lift ratio of tunnel at the low and hump speed compared with other parts of planing trimaran in total the existence of the tunnel has negative effect on hull resistance in this speed range at hump speed the wave of main hull slams the front section of tunnel strongly which increases the bow lifting moment and makes the hull trim angle reaches the maximum value at an earlier speed causing the hump speed of planing trimaran earlier than that of monohull in the meanwhile the larger wetted area of trimaran also results in a larger hump resistance if the hull was propelled by waterjet it is in the condition of high pump rotation speed and low inflow velocity for waterjet at hump speed where the waterjet blade is prone to cavitation in order to ensure the anti cavitation performance of waterjet the larger hump resistance of planing trimaran corresponds to the larger size of waterjet which is adverse to the lightweight requirements of waterjet unit therefore apart from ensuring the high speed resistance performance how to reduce the hump resistance is also the key issue that the waterjet propelled planing craft needs to focus on moreover due to the requirement of endurance it is also necessary to improve the disordered flow in the tunnel region at low speed to reduce the resistance the research on resistance reduction of planing trimaran at low and hump speed will be carried out in the next 5 3 planing speed 5 3 1 tunnel flow at planing states waves and sprays are mainly produced in the bow of main hull and the crest of bow wave often appears at the longitudinal positions of mid ship around or even at stern where is exactly the working region of tunnel the bow wave and spray of main hull are captured by the tunnel entrance along with the air flow the energy of the air water mixed flow is absorbed and utilized by the tunnel and then the dynamic lift is generated which makes the hull get extra lift apart from the hydrodynamic lift a certain proportion of aerodynamic lift is also generated in the tunnel at planing state fr 3 0 which is quietly different from the conventional planing monohull 5 3 1 1 wave patterns in tunnel due to the blockage effect of tunnel and rigid skirt the pattern and flow of bow wave of planing trimaran changes obviously in comparison with those of monohull at planing states the wave pattern in the tunnel also varies with the increase of sailing speed fig 22 shows the various tunnel wave patterns at different planing speeds the results shows that at the speed of fr 3 42 the bow wave of main hull slams in the front of the tunnel at the same time the stem of rigid skirt separates from the water surface but the middle and aft part of it still makes waves at the initial planing stage the interference effect between the bow wave of main hull and the wave of rigid skirt obviously weakens at this speed as shown in figs 14 and 22 then with the growth of speed the hull draft continues to decrease then the stagnation point of the incoming flow at the main hull bottom moves to middle hull and the crest of bow wave moves to stern all constantly and quickly causing that the bow wave of main hull slams the more rear of tunnel at higher speed in the meanwhile it can be found that the rigid skirt is basically separated from the water surface and its wave making is small especially at very high speed in order to have a more detailed analysis of wave patterns and air water distributions in the whole tunnel region at different speeds eight cross sections have been built in tunnel fig 23 shows the detailed positions of eight cross sections the air water distribution and wave cut at each cross section in the speed range of 3 42 fr 6 16 are presented in fig 24 which also reflects the wave evolution in tunnel region at planing states it can be found that in the early planing speed although the front part of tunnel has been filled with amount of air the tunnel region is still nearly airtight because the outlet of the tunnel is immersed in water totally at fr 3 42 then as speed increases the wave making in the front part of tunnel reduces more quickly as the results shown in fig 24 there is no obvious wave at the tunnel entrance section no 1 at the speed higher than fr 4 79 on the other hand beginning from the speed of fr 4 79 ventilation phenomenon has been found on the side of tunnel near the main hull moreover fig 25 shows that the increasing speed of air volume becomes faster from the speed of fr 4 79 which is more obvious at the tunnel latter part in fact the tunnel width and height the transverse deadrise angle of hull bottom and the corner angle of longitudinal step all have effects on the flow in the tunnel which needs careful study in the next stage for the hull design of planing trimaran on the other hand although the rigid skirt dose not directly generate hull lift it blocks the outward propagation of wave making generated by main hull so that the tunnel can absorb the internal wave energy to provide additional hull lift mainly at planing speed at the same time the shielding effect of rigid skirt can also effectively prevent the air flow from escaping to the outside which is very significant for increasing the aerodynamic lift in the tunnel at high speed 5 3 1 2 air flow in tunnel at the initial stage of planing state the wave making in the front part of tunnel reduces obviously and the air begins to flow into the tunnel region fig 26 shows the streamlines of air flow entering into the tunnel region at fr 4 11 it can be found that although there are some ventilated orifices in the tunnel wave only a small amount of air flows out from the tunnel outlet at transom most of the air is trapped in the narrow space between the tunnel wave and the main hull while another part of them overflows beneath the rigid skirt therefore the air flow in the tunnel is relatively disordered and there is no obvious ventilation phenomenon at the early planing state at the speed higher than fr 4 79 the tunnel ventilation phenomenon has been getting more obvious fig 27 shows the streamlines of air flow in the tunnel region at fr 6 16 most of the air flows out from the tunnel side near the main hull and another small part flows out from the ventilated orifice near the rigid skirt particularly there is still an amount of air escaped beneath the front part of rigid skirt when once entering the tunnel as shown in fig 27 on the other hand the flow of some air is spiral while most of the air flows are nearly straight from entering the tunnel to leaving as shown in fig 28 as for this planing trimaran the rotating vector of air flow in the tunnel is not very obvious at most cross sections in general the air flow characteristics in the tunnel should be closely related to the tunnel structure and the wave patterns at different speeds also have a significant impact on the air flow in tunnel as this is a type of heavy load planing trimaran the tunnel roof is not completely separated from the wave until the maximum speed of fr 6 16 in total as for this planing trimaran there is tunnel ventilation phenomenon at planing speeds however there is no speed condition where the tunnel or even the tunnel roof is completely out of the water in the speed range of fr 6 16 5 3 1 3 components of tunnel lift the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift of tunnel at various speeds is shown in fig 29 the results indicate that the hydro lift of tunnel is dominant at most speeds with the increase of speed the intersection points of tunnel wave and tunnel roof moves astern rapidly causing the significant decrease of wetted surface of tunnel it is the smaller wetted surface that accounting for the reduction of tunnel lift in the speed range of fr 3 42 the magnitude of the aerodynamic lift remains relatively constant at 4 11 fr 6 16 due to the tunnel construction and wave patterns at high speeds there is obvious ram pressure effect of air flow in the tunnel region in detail as shown in fig 24 there is only small wave at the tunnel entrance at planing states while the latter part of tunnel still has plugging breakers at the same time which forms a channel with large inlet and small outlet for air flow once the air flows through the tunnel aerodynamic force is generated and then acts on the wall of tunnel moreover with the growth of sailing speed although the higher air flow speed can strengthen the ram pressure effect the larger vent at tunnel outlet weakens this effect oppositely causing the air lift of tunnel keeps dynamic balance at the speed of 4 11 fr 6 16 in general the aerodynamic lift generated by the tunnel of this planing trimaran only accounts for around 2 5 of the overall weight of hull at very high speed as shown in fig 29 5 3 2 effects on resistance the tunnel effect is the most important reason for the excellent resistance performance of planing trimaran at planing speeds which is helpful to provide added force to lift the hull out of the water and the righting moment for the force balance of hull as the result shown in fig 19 the resistance to lift ratio of tunnel is larger in comparison with other parts of trimaran in fact as the tunnel has ram pressure effect on the air flow there is also considerable aerodynamic resistance when the tunnel produces aerodynamic lift at the same time the air flow in the tunnel is different from that in the open environment for example the air resistance to lift ratio of the deck is still small therefore the total resistance of trimaran is not straightly reduced by a small resistance to lift ratio of the tunnel as which does not exist the resistance reduction of trimaran at planing speed is achieved by changing the running attitude including sinkage and trim through the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift generated by the tunnel effect in detail trimaran is mainly affected by tunnel lift main hull lift and hull gravity in the vertical direction the lifts of deck and transom are small and are classified as the lift of main hull thus it is of great significance to understand the resistance reduction mechanism of trimaran by clarifying the tunnel effect on the main hull lift and the specific distribution of tunnel lift 5 3 2 1 lift distribution on tunnel the distribution of tunnel lift directly affects the running attitude of trimaran which plays an important role in overall resistance performance in order to explore the influence of tunnel flow variation on the distribution of tunnel aerodynamic lift and hydrodynamic lift the tunnel is divided into 20 segments along the longitudinal direction as shown in fig 30 fig 31 shows the lift distribution on the tunnel at various speeds as shown in results the maximum lift on the tunnel section decreases with the increase of the speed and the position of the maximum lift section moves to the stern in the meanwhile the variation of tunnel lift distribution is closely related to the slamming of the bow wave of the main hull on the tunnel roof as shown in fig 22 the wetted length of tunnel reduces quickly as the speed is higher on the other hand the crest height of bow wave of main hull decreases with higher speed and the attack angle of the wave slamming on the tunnel roof also reduces at the same time causing the peak lift of tunnel section experiences a constantly reduction as the tunnel has not been fully ventilated in the speed range of fr 6 16 the hydrodynamic lift has always been dominant for tunnel lift at planing state the distribution of tunnel lift straightly influences the moment provided by tunnel fig 32 shows the moment provided by tunnel lift and the corresponding lift center of main hull and tunnel at various speeds the tunnel moment has experienced a process of first increasing and then decreasing which is dominated by the tunnel hydrodynamic lift in detail as the wave slamming point on tunnel moves backward with higher speed the hydrodynamic lift center of tunnel also continues to move aft at first the trimming moment generated by the tunnel increases with the larger hydrodynamic lift arm but later with the rapid decrease of the tunnel lift the tunnel moment also presents a downward trend in addition with the decrease of the hydrodynamic lift in the rear section of tunnel the aerodynamic lift on the front middle section of tunnel also becomes another main source of the total tunnel lift although the aerodynamic lift itself does not increase obviously at this time the center of the overall tunnel lift moves to the bow direction that is the arm of the overall tunnel lift becomes shorter at fr 5 47 on the other hand although the total moment of tunnel plays the role of stern lifting the tunnel aerodynamic lift is a bow lifting moment though it is very small this is due to the fact for the modeling of this trimaran the tunnel area includes not only the shelter region by rigid skirt but also the arch structure at the bow which mainly cause the bow lifting moment of air at the early planing speed as shown in fig 33 a when sailing at higher speed the tunnel aerodynamic lift is mainly concentrated in the front and middle section of the tunnel as shown in fig 33 b when the air flows into the narrow tunnel from the open area the air flow speed slows down at the tunnel entrance thus forming a high pressure zone at the front region of tunnel apart from the high pressure zone at tunnel entrance the air flow also forms another high pressure zone in front of the wave slamming point on the tunnel as the slamming of waves also hindered the flow of high speed air to the tunnel outlet on the whole because the trimaran centroid is relatively backward l cg l oa 0 35 from transom the aerodynamic lift of the tunnel still provides the bow lifting moment for the overall hull of trimaran at higher planing speed in fact the lift distribution of tunnel is more related to both tunnel configuration and loading condition in total as the overall tunnel moment is a stern lifting moment it is beneficial for decrease the trim angle of trimaran at planing state which is helpful on the resistance reduction moreover the tunnel moment can also balance the moment of main hull to delay the emergence of porpoising at a higher speed 5 3 2 2 tunnel effect on main hull lift fig 34 shows the lift of each parts of planing trimaran at the speed of 0 68 fr 6 16 it can be found that for this planing trimaran the main hull provides the majority of lift to balance the hull gravity in the whole speed range the tunnel contributes the maximum lift about 24 ship weight at initial planing speed and then its lift constantly decreases at high speed the lift of main hull of trimaran still plays a leading role in lifting the ship at planing state as mentioned above the tunnel can reduce the pressure loss in the process of wave propagation generated by main hull particularly the tunnel also has positive effect on promoting the lift of main hull as the running attitude of the monohull pm is the same as that of the planing trimaran the only difference between two hulls is whether there is a tunnel as shown in fig 35 the main hull lift of trimaran is mainly larger than that of monohull especially in the speed of 1 37 fr 5 79 in this corresponding speed range the wave slams on the tunnel roof and rigid skirt and this interaction prevents the energy dissipation of the wave propagating to the far field fig 36 shows that there is significant distinction between pressure distribution of the hull around flow field of trimaran and monohull at fr 3 42 where the position of cross section is at x l oa 0 3 correspondingly the pressure on the main hull also changed obviously as shown in fig 37 the wetted length of tunnel is still long at fr 3 42 the area of pressure increase on the main hull is relatively larger with the speed growth the wetted length of tunnel decreases obviously and the effect of tunnel flow on the increase of the main hull pressure reduces obviously fig 38 shows there is only a small area of trimaran which has higher pressure than monohull thus at fr 5 79 the difference of main hull lift between the two hulls is small 5 3 2 3 effect on running attitude the resistance reduction of trimaran at planing speed is achieved by changing the running attitude including sinkage and trim through the hydrodynamic lift and aerodynamic lift extra generated by the tunnel effect in detail trimaran is mainly affected by tunnel lift main hull lift and hull gravity in the vertical direction at the speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 apart from the considerable lift provided by tunnel itself the tunnel also has significant effect on promoting the lift of main hull which results in a sharp decrease of hull draft as shown in fig 20 the wetted area of main hull experiences a rapid reduction in this speed range especially at 3 42 fr 5 34 at this time the tunnel wetted area also decreases due to the fast backward of bow wave crest therefore the promotion effect of tunnel on overall hull lift leads to the more moderate resistance growth for this trimaran in the planing speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 causing the resistance reduction in comparison with conventional planing monohull at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 the attack angle between the tunnel wall and the flow generated by bow wave is relatively small at this speed range the force of the bow wave acted on the tunnel has entered a fast descent stage according to the characteristics of sine function as shown in figs 12 and 21 both the tunnel resistance and lift experience a sharp decrease at this speed range as the tunnel lift itself and its promoting effect on the main hull lift decreases simultaneously the proportion of the lift provided by the main hull increases obviously at this speed range in fact at this speed the resistance to lift ratio of the main hull is smaller than that of the tunnel which means the main hull produces relatively smaller resistance while making up for the same lift of tunnel therefore the overall resistance of trimaran remains nearly unchanged with the higher speed at 5 34 fr 6 16 particularly it is not to say that the tunnel plays a negative effect on resistance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 as for planing monohull when the speed becomes higher the hull draft becomes shallower and it needs to reduce the trim angle to decrease the dynamic pressure at the stern so as to keep the force balance on the hull this process will increase the wetted length of the monohull at a higher planing state therefore when the speed of planing monohull reaches a certain speed the downward trend of its wetted area will stop or even turn to increase as for the planing trimaran the trim angle keeps almost stable at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 while the draft of hull decreases constantly when the planing speed is higher at this time the lift center of main hull moves astern and its bow lifting moment also reduces as shown in fig 32 on the other hand the stern lifting moment provided by the tunnel hydrodynamic lift decreases and the tunnel aerodynamic lift makes up part of the bow lifting moment for the main hull the dynamic balance of the above three forces and three moment makes the trim angle of trimaran basically unchanged while its draft continuously reduces at higher planing speed 5 34 fr 6 16 thus the main hull of trimaran also experiences a small reduction of wetted area at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 where the wetted area of the tunnel also decreases rapidly in a command the tunnel effect still decreases the resistance by reducing the overall wetted area of trimaran at higher planing speed specially different from the previous speed range of 2 74 fr 5 34 the aerodynamic lift of tunnel plays a more important role in the remarkable resistance performance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 in addition trimaran has three kinds of forces namely the tunnel hydrodynamic lift the tunnel aerodynamic lift and the main hull lift to balance the hull gravity the balance of multiple forces makes the trimaran have a better motion stability and course stability in high planing speed compared with the conventional planing monohull fig 39 shows the dual waterjet propelled planing trimaran in full size the excellent motion stability has also been verified in the full size ship test of this trimaran 6 conclusion 1 in comparison with conventional planing monohull at similar values of l o a 1 3 and l cg l oa the concave tunnel has a negative effect on the resistance of planing trimaran at low hump speed while the excellent resistance performance of trimaran is mainly reflected in planing speed it is considerable to improve the deceleration and distortion of tunnel flow for resistance reduction at low speed of fr 1 03 as the low speed resistance significantly influences the cruising radius and working endurance of trimaran 2 the heavy load planing trimaran has an earlier hump speed and a larger hump resistance at hump speed the bow wave slams the front section of tunnel which increases the bow lifting moment and makes the hump speed of planing trimaran earlier than that of monohull in the meanwhile the larger wetted area of trimaran also results in a larger hump resistance the larger hump resistance of trimaran corresponds to the larger size of waterjet which is not conducive to the lightweight requirements of waterjet unit 3 the tunnel can absorb the internal wave energy to provide additional hull lift where the hydrodynamic lift is still dominant in the tunnel lift for this trimaran the maximum tunnel aerodynamic lift takes up no more than 3 of total displacement apart from the considerable lift provided by tunnel itself the tunnel also has significant promoting effect on the lift of main hull at the speed of 2 74 fr 5 34 which results in a sharp decrease of hull draft and causes a rapid reduction of the wetted area of main hull in this speed range 4 the tunnel lift itself and its promoting effect on the main hull lift decreases simultaneously at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 the tunnel aerodynamic lift makes up part of the bow lifting moment for the main hull in this speed range and the dynamic balance makes the trim angle of trimaran basically unchanged while its draft continuously reduced at higher planing speed the aerodynamic lift of tunnel plays a more important role in the remarkable resistance performance of trimaran at the speed of 5 34 fr 6 16 credit authorship contribution statement jiangming ding conceptualization methodology validation

20289,present study deliberates on the numerical analysis of a new bean shaped multi body floating wave energy converter bfwec using an open source time domain modeling tool called wec sim wave energy converter simulator the proposed device is a directionally insensitive floating point absorber with a set of bean shaped floats attached circumferentially around a central cylinder or buoy cb or cs extracting the wave energy under heave degree due to the relative motion of the floats with cb the shape and arrangement of the floats around the cb make the bfwec different from other existing

writing original draft 1 introduction wave energy conversion is not yet a feasible technology compared to other alternative energy resources such as solar and wind but is slowly attracting large scale investors as the location and ocean climate influence a wave energy converter wec design cannot be developed globally sheng and lewis 2012 though the energy density of waves is higher than the other clean energy resources the complexities in operating and capital involved make it challenging to progress from a lab scale model to a full scale device clément et al 2002 wave potential along indian coasts ranges from 5 to 25 kw m far lesser than european australian and american coastal lines mnre 2020 esso 2019 ciril 2014 amrutha and sanil kumar 2020 small scale wave devices are better suitable for countries with lower energy potentials like india researchers need to take the maximum advantage available in geographical hot spots in such small scale resource areas choosing such locations in the low power resource countries would benefit economically in wec design installation and power rating additionally moving towards an offshore location compared to nearshore would be beneficial since the wave power would be higher there as demonstrated by the ceto wec developed by carnegie carnegie clean energy 2019 floating wecs also have advantages over fixed wecs in deeper waters especially concerning mooring pinto et al 2019 out of all wec technologies oscillating devices like point absorbers which are typically smaller than the incident wavelengths are advantageous under a multi directional sea state due to their design point absorbers are highly suitable for array layouts the multiple body interaction is optimized to achieve constructive interference or low shadow effects by the appropriate position or orientation of the floats child and venugopal 2010 they can power the petrochemical plants or desalination plants and other floating factories away from the shore further wave loads direct impact on existing marine or coastal structures can be reduced by incorporating these energy absorbing devices pastor and liu 2014 chandrasekaran et al 2014 the performance of oscillating devices in regular waves results in a higher power capturing capability the device will be tuned to only one dominant frequency of the approaching wave sherman and mei 1980 falnes 1999 tucker and pitt 2001 zang et al 2018 however their performance under irregular waves is highly complex due to the requirement of future wave force to tune the incoming waves period with the natural period as the technical details of various wec technologies are not in the public domain one needs strenuous efforts to understand its qualitative features advancements and power producing capabilities however babarit et al in 2012 have significantly contributed to showcasing the performance levels using time domain models of different wec concepts the hydrodynamic parameters of any wec directly affect wave wec interactions which was proven in the research conducted on arrays of vertical cylinders and various other floats shapes over the years erselcan and kukner 2017 yilmaz 2018 in addition to this assertion the number of bodies involved in the floating devices also influences the design parameters and performance characteristics including the pto system remarkably from the studies conducted on various wecs it is understood that the variation of hydrodynamic parameters greatly influenced by buoy s geometrical parameters like inertia stiffness shape draft and diameter will alter the overall dynamics and improve the power capture capability of the device brown et al 2018 flocard and finnigan 2015 behzad and panahi 2017 al shami et al 2018 ruezga and canedo 2019 choosing an optimal damping coefficient is also equally important for maximizing the absorbed power sheng and lewis 2016 preliminary numerical and experimental investigation on a 1 10 scale bfwec with four floats bfwec 4 was performed using the spectral domain model the floats wave power and response are represented in power spectral densities to estimate the energy content a hydrodynamic conversion ratio of 25 obtained from the study shows the device s feasibility to wave conditions and insensitive directional features chandrasekaran and sricharan 2019 detailed numerical studies were carried out on five different float shapes with bfwec design in frequency domain chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e the effect of shape size and still water depth on the power absorption was studied a novel bean float was found to have promising hydrodynamic characteristics than the other considered float shapes chandrasekaran and sricharan 2019 a customized hydraulic pto system was modeled and analyzed under the extreme conditions of the scaled indian sea states using wec sim to estimate the absorbed power and cwr of bfwec in regular waves sricharan and chandrasekaran 2021 the present study adopts the recommended bean shape float wec layout it is parametrized with varying float numbers around the cb four six and eight represented by bfwec 4 bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 the change in performance of the bfwec is assessed as the number of floats is changed further these three layouts performance is evaluated under the influence of the external damping force generated from the ideal pto to maximize the average power output to quantify the interaction effects in between the floats to that of the isolated float and the corresponding response of each layout a term called q factor or often known as interference factor is considered which was originally introduced in the literature for array interactions child and venugopal 2010 it is defined as the ratio between the algebraic sum of average power absorbed by all the floats in a wec layout with interactions and the average power of all the same wec floats in isolation an array is said to have constructive interference positive interference effect when q 1 and q 1 for destructive interference thus a better muli body wec or an array design should possess a higher q value and be parametrized for maximizing the constructive interferences for any given layout further the economic assessment of novel wecs in indian sea states is seldom the present paper addresses parameters such as aep and lcoe are the indicators required to be compared with other marine energy technology worldwide for performance comparisons although there are no dedicated policies for marine energy technology in terms of discounts subsidies and other techno economic benefits the estimation of lcoe is carried out considering the standard assumption discount rates etc from the established literature in the other parts of the world usa europe and australia the time domain modeling and simulations for the proposed study are executed using an open source numerical tool called wec sim developed by the national renewable energy limited nrel and sandia national laboratories snl wec sim 2020 wec sim can solve two types of computational modeling methods that can be implemented for any given wec one is the linear potential method and another is the weakly nonlinear time domain method the former method works on small buoy oscillations assumptions with approximately the same wetted surface at the mean sea level whereas the latter approach which is often referred to as the blended time domain method integrates the nonlinear dynamic pressure over the buoy s instantaneous wetted surface in calculating nonlinear buoyancy and excitation forces are out of the scope of the present study the entire working principle and flowchart of different wec models in wec sim with standard pto systems are discussed in the literature using matlab simulink block interface yu et al 2014 lawson et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the study s flow is as follows section 2 describes the 1 10 scale novel bean concept and three layouts the numerical formulation is described in time domain briefly with wec sim modeling besides inferences and the detailed insights are drawn from the hydrodynamic coefficients in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to results and discussions where the power absorption and cwr are estimated under the linear power take off influence for various wave parameters besides the multi body interference effects are assessed by comparing the response with the isolated float further lcoe and annual energy production aep estimates are calculated for the arabian sea and bay of bengal sea states 2 concept of bfwec the overall design of bfwec consists of a central buoy cb and a set of floats a reaction subsystem in the form of taut mooring tethers connecting arms and a pto system providing additional damping to the device cb is a hollow cylindrical positive buoyant floating member integrating all the device components while the floats are bean shaped smoothly finished rounded hollow neutrally buoyant floating members the device s proposed layouts with 4 6 8 floats are shown in figs 1 3 and are referred to as a3 b4 and c5 respectively the number succeeding the terms a b c is not related to the number of floats in the respective layout please refer to section 4 for the terminology details in all the layouts the energy is extracted from the individual floats relative rotation about cb the equivalent vertical displacement heave of each float relative to the cb z r e l a t i v e due to the rotation at the hinges is referred to as net heave throughout the analysis all the bodies are surface piercing with floats having a draft to radius ratio equal to unity at static equilibrium condition the number of floats per layout varies by maintaining the total gap between the floats in all three layouts constant at 30 the geometric properties of all three layouts are in table 1 the floats circumferential arrangement adds stability to the device while making it directional insensitive and enabling power harvest under all wave incident angles bfwec is a self floating system that remains afloat even under the tether plug out condition which will limit it only to undergo functional failure similarly the advantage of having multiple floats also complements the fact that the mechanical failure of one float would not stop the functioning of the complete device the center of gravity of the device is maintained well below the center of buoyancy to ensure dynamic stability by adding sufficient ballast at the bottom of the cb the floating feature makes the device convenient to tow it similar to semi submersibles from one place to another depending on seasonal variations and extreme sea events the ballasting and de ballasting techniques that are in existence with tension leg platform tlp installations can be used as a reference in deploying floating or preferably compliant wecs similar to tlp mechanics the cb possesses a hybrid characteristic with relaxed and stiff degrees of freedom at the same time in other words the horizontal plane degrees surge sway and yaw have slightly relaxing periods when compared to vertical plane degrees heave roll and pitch which have higher resistance offered from the tethers resulting in shorter natural periods see table 1 unlike bottom fixed wecs the floating devices won t be designed on their strength basis instead they are designed on a displacement basis generally known as form dominant devices chandrasekaran 2017 chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2020 in the case of the present system floats will absorb energy by oscillating since it is free to move relatively and cb is made position restrained by using taut mooring making it stiff thereby offering dynamic stability to the whole structure which is referred as a re centering capability in offshore engineering it is desired that cb s response must be minimized for active and maximum rotation of the floats around it the cb can generally be any floating structure anywhere in the sea coupled dynamically with the floats for example the floating and fixed wind farms can be integrated with the floats around the upper portion of substructures such as monopile or tripod which can accommodate floats and pto similar to cb about msl the sea bed is considered to be smooth and flat without any bathymetry effects the 0 waves travel from x to x direction and the floats are numbered and positioned counter clockwise starting from f 1 in x to f i where i is float number for the layout the wave directionality will change positively from the x axis to y axis in the anti clock direction as shown in fig 1 b as the model is symmetric about the z axis one quadrant of variable wave directions is sufficient to highlight the device s directional features it is noteworthy to mention that the designs of wavebob and wavestar may look close in terms of multi body oscillations and relative rotation with primary fixed floating frame to the present proposal but are entirely different in terms of geometry and working principle wavebob is a two body wec with a torus member and a buoy moving in a vertical direction to generate power tarrant and meskell 2016 wavestar is a fixed nearshore wec a hemispherical buoy heaving around the fixed base structure kramer et al 2011 wavestar 2019 authors have streamlined the present research which resulted in a product to patent approach i e performance before proprietorship where the proposed model is first modeled analyzed and tested for its real world application the product bfwec and its mechanism with various combinations of its embodiments is registered under intellectual property rights india patent chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a d 3 numerical modeling in wec sim wec sim is an open source numerical modeling tool for simulating wec devices built on the matlab simulink simscape fluids platform wec sim 2020 matlab 2021 wec sim is capable of solving the multi body dynamics of wec systems with ptos and mooring the present bfwec is modeled by using various in built tools of wec sim the geometric data and frequency dependent parameters such as hydrodynamic coefficients for the proposed layouts are computed from bem formulation in aqwa further the mooring and pto mechanism parameters have been appropriately chosen and specified in the pre processing initialization stage in wec sim contributing to the additional forces generated due to their coupling with the primary wec system the time domain equation of motion eom for the whole structure in all six degrees of freedom dof is then solved using 4th order variable time step runge kutta method ode45 3 1 bfwec dynamics the rigid body motions of the bfwec require a standard coordinate system to represent them conveniently the global coordinate system x y and z is defined at the msl as shown in fig 1a and b and a local or body fixed coordinate system x y and z which is defined for each body present in the system for example each float is positioned to oscillate about the y y axis whose position and orientation are transformed using the cartesian and rotation matrix method respectively it is accomplished by defining the desired motion revolute joint or hinge for floats to cb as reference in wec sim internal mechanics as the floats pitch about the hinges ry θ a net relative heave about cb is developed as shown in fig 1a therefore only one of the two is sufficient to represent the device s active dynamics of wave power extraction due to the presence of taut mooring the surge and pitch coupling of cb are kept minimal the individual rotation ry θ of the floats about cb is externally damped by a linear pto viscous rotational damper to extract wave energy θ is the pitch rotation of floats at the hinges the coupled equation of motion for a j t h float j is any particular float of interest and cb can be written as in the heave degree float i 1 t o n 1a m f j z f j t a 33 f j c z c t i 1 n a 33 f j f i z f i t 0 t i 1 n k r 33 f j f i τ z f i t τ d τ 0 t k r 33 f j c τ z c t τ d τ k h 33 f j z f j t c l p t o z f j t z c t η τ k e 33 f j t τ d τ cb 1b m c a 33 c c z c t i 1 n a 33 c f i z f i t 0 t k r

float number m f and m c are the dry mass of float and cb respectively eq 1a and eq 1b are based on cummins eom formulation cummins 1962 since in a given layout all the floats are identical their mass is the same simply m f k h is linear hydrostatic stiffness accounting for the effect of buoyancy and k m is mooring stiffness term k e is the excitation impulse response function and c l p t o is the linear damping coefficient z c and z f are the heave amplitudes of cb and floats respectively the subscripts c and f represent cb and float respectively while z and z represent velocity and acceleration amplitudes in heave degree in heave the total wave force due to external pressure on the body is decomposed of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces hydrodynamic force constitutes excitation force and radiation forces the two constituents of excitation force viz froude krylov f k and diffraction force are together accommodated in the right hand side of eq 1a and eq 1b for floats and cb respectively the f k component is calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure of incident waves over the body s mean wetted surface area assuming that it does not change the incident wave field as the name indicates diffraction force arises due to the incident wavefield s scattering by the body s presence the presence of multiple bodies will significantly affect the overall performance compared to the isolated single float and cb combination due to the increase in the net force acting on the individual float discussed in detail in section 4 the number of floats participating in the extraction and gap between them for each layout and the wave directionality significantly influences the overall hydrodynamics and the performance in terms of absorbed power and cwr currently available bem based tools which are based on linear potential theory can address the interactions of such multiple body layouts the oscillation of bfwec in a calm wave induces forces that constitute additional inertial effects and hydrodynamic damping since the viscous effects are neglected only radiation contributes to hydrodynamic damping the former is due to a change in the momentum of surrounding water particles represented as infinite frequency added mass a or limiting value of added mass a simply later represents the energy dissipation due to radiation c the component a in total radiation force of bfwec in heave degree arises from the following a due to the motion of cb alone represented as a p q c c b the influence of cb on floats and vice versa represented by a p q f j c and a p q c f j respectively c the influence of the motion of one float on another float is represented by i 1 n a p q f j f i including self influence i j the floats interaction at every time step results in so called memory effects that die down over time this effect can be represented with radiation impulse response function rirf k r and is non causal viz the present oscillation of the float also depends on its past oscillation memory in contrast to the excitation irf which is causal viz depending on the future wave journee and massie 2001 the disturbed water particles and floats or cb position history will affect the present motion for some time interval the radiation component k r of total radiation force is defined by a nonlinear response and the net effect of the component k r of bfwec can arise from the following d the radiation from cb motion alone represented as c p q c c e the influence of radiation of cb on floats and vice versa represented by c p q f j c and c p q c f j respectively f the influence of radiation of one float on another float irrespective of layout represented by i 1 n c p q f j f i including self influence i j it is important to note that p q is the row and column index of the complete 6x6 matrix and represented as subscripts of each element p q 1 to 6 represent surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw modes respectively while the term pq represents the influence of q t h mode on p t h mode the radiation force for a particular body is obtained by the convolution of k r or c i r f with the floats and cb velocity z f a n d z c for the desired dof respectively the time dependent excitation force is obtained by the convolution of k e or f i r f with the wave elevation the frequency range and the time frame along with the time step have to be chosen appropriately for the convolutions integrals to tend to die down within a specific time folley 2016 as the dynamics of the device are expressed based on the cummins equation k r and k e can be accounted for directly in wec sim without violating the conditions of the linear time domain method the detailed insights of each of the hydrodynamic coefficients will be discussed in section 4 3 2 wec sim all the layouts were modeled in wec sim by physically connecting all the subsystems bodies with the help of simulink blocks under an object oriented framework mimicking the working principle of bfwec fig 4 represents the complete circuit system of the bfwec 8 layout constituting different subsystems in fig 4 blue block subsystem body block 1 marked in blue color and other body blocks marked yellow represent cb and four bean shaped floats of bfwec layouts maroon blocks are the rotational damper ptos representing the connection between cb and float blocks as a hinge mechanism providing adjustable linear pto damping onto the floats all the rotational blocks are oriented according to the float s position such that the floats rotate about the local y axis y y the dynamic response of cb in bfwec is coupled with mooring blocks each red color block represents a tether all mooring blocks are dragged and dropped from the wec sim library and defined in the wec sim input as a mooring matrix a function of tether stiffness and pre tension in each cable refer table 1 the cb must have 6 dof blocks orange color to model all degrees of freedom in the decay tests floats and the cb are given an initial displacement at zero pto damping to obtain the device s natural periods refer to section 4 the input parameters such as time step simulation time wave conditions geometric and material properties of each body are also defined in the matlab wec sim input file each block is represented internally with an eom coupled with other blocks containing their respective dynamic equations 3 3 wave characteristics and bfwec power two indian seas the arabian sea and bay of bengal are the locations of interest whose typical annual mean wave periods t m vary from 4s to 10 s with a significant wave height h s of 0 1m 4m shallow to ultra deep waters esso 2019 while the wave basin at iit madras has a maximum capability of generating h 0 3m and t 3s in regular wave and h s 0 25m and peak period t p of 2 4s in irregular waves in the literature the research on wave energy conversion technologies related to the indian sea states is scarce and there is a need to bridge this gap therefore the wec model scale was chosen to be 1 10 to represent the scaled wave characteristics of shallow intermediate waters of the bay of bengal whose average t m 5s and h s 2m the scaled values estimated are under the operational conditions in line with the capacity of the wave basin at iitm where future studies can be conducted bearing h s and t m of 0 2m and 1 58s the wave power matrix for chosen wave heights and wave periods is given in fig 5 where each pixel represents the wave power in w m supported by the intensity bar since regular waves are the focus of the present study the scaled wave parameters would be a wave height h 0 2m and wave period t 1 58s the wave power is estimated using the deepwater approximation while estimating the wave length whose equations are standard and not explicitly included in the present study the power absorbed p l d w e c by the relative motion of floats and the cb with linear damping can be represented as p l d w e c f l p t o

float and the projected width of the respective float 4 results and discussions the three layouts of bfwec described in the above section consist of 4 6 and 8 respectively which have considered complete float sets and are represented as a3 b4 and c5 since all the layouts undergo multi body interactions it is important to study the number of floats in each layout from one layout to another the float s size is reduced to accommodate more number of floats however in each layout how the float influences the overall performance compared to one or more floats against a3 b4 and c5 is also essential to study thus additional cases are established in each layout and their illustration is given in fig 6 a combination of the terms f a b c will be used as a nomenclature to represent specific float sets in the coming discussions for example f3 a3 represents the float f 3 float of the a3 set referring to fig 6 it is necessary to note that the float f 3 remains as the front float for bfwec 4 f4 for bfwec 6 and f5 for bfwec 8 respectively in the case of bfwec 4 under 0 wave heading one of the two floats f2 or f4 is chosen to represent due to the symmetry about xy plane a nomenclature f24 or f2 4 is used to represent it similarly for the layouts bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 one float in each set f2 or f6 f3 or f5 and f2 or f8 f4 or f6 are chosen respectively 4 1 frequency domain analysis the cad model of the entire system is established in the ansys aqwa design module subsequently using the boundary element method bem and under the linear potential wave theory assumptions the entire system s frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are estimated in the aqwa diffraction radiation module the hydrodynamic interactions of all the bodies present in the system are taken into account as one body s motion will affect the other as mentioned above 4 1 1 hydrodynamic coefficients frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients estimated in frequency domain using bem are the building blocks for the time domain model of corresponding bfwec layouts or their respective cases the appropriately scaled hydrodynamic characteristics of bfwec and the effect of the number of floats around cb are illustrated in figs 7 9 excitation force variation over the chosen frequency band for all the cases and layouts are given in fig 7 none of the cases have exact variation and there seems to be a significant heave heave coupling between the floats the effect increases with more floats viz from bfwec 4 to bfwec 8 and in their cases viz isolated single float a1 b1 c1 to all floats a3 b4 c5 the excitation force is the function of size shape orientation and position chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e due to their highest exposure front facing floats have maximum variation across the band followed by the other floats f 3 f 3 5 f 5 of the three layouts have maximum values in the resonant frequency band of 4 rad s to 6 rad s further as the layouts are symmetric if the wave direction is changed to 90 f 4 f5 6 and f 7 of bfwec 4 6 and 8 act as front facing floats respectively and have maximum excitation force due to the change in the orientation and floats exposure regarding the change in the incident wave direction the excitation force variation is reducing with the reduction of float size as shown in fig 7 the variation in isolated float in all layouts is much lower than the front float in other cases increasing the floats number layout for example in bfwec 8 f5 c5 has a higher excitation force than f5 c1 2 3 and 4 further the oscillations across the frequency band are higher with the increase in the float s number it can be observed clearly from fig 7 inferring the dependency of excitation force on the multi body interactions interference effects the highest peak and subsequent peaks mostly occur in the range of 4 rad s 6 rad s which is the resonant band of bfwec due to the increase in the number of floats the net excitation force of bfwec is improved which is directly related to the absorbed power since it is directly proportional to the square of excitation force therefore the total absorbed power can be higher in the case of bfwec 8 however it also depends on the other two hydrodynamic coefficients such as frequency dependent radiation damping and added mass the scaled radiation resistance is shown in fig 8 for all three layouts and their cases the radiation resistance and added mass are not dependent on the orientation position and incident wave direction unlike the excitation force but solely on the floats geometry therefore one float can represent the whole layout fig 8 shows the front float of cases in each layout the radiation resistance or the damping variation significantly higher than the isolated float a1 b1 c1 and partial float cases a2 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3 with a maximum in the resonance band 4 rad s 6rad s in bfwec 4 the peaks extend to lower and higher frequencies for bfwec 8 and bfwec 6 respectively the isolated float variation is comparatively smooth indicating no cross float coupling and the response only depends on its motion besides cb while for complete float cases a3 b4 and c5 there is a strong coupling between the floats viz the strength of i 1 n c f j f i i j would be significant than besides its own c f i f i source which the next sections can confirm through the corresponding impulse response function computation the multi body interactions generate the so called sloshing or pumping phenomena predominant near the resonance and fade away extreme and lower frequencies the oscillations are higher in bfwec 8 than others and the total resistance is minimum in bfwec 8 and highest in bfwec 6 from the frequency domain analysis the optimum value of pto damping c o p t t is obtained theoretically by equating frequency dependent average power absorption as a function of pto damping to zero cargo et al 2011 6 c o p t t c r ω 2 ω m a m ω ρ g a w ω 2 where m is the dry mass and a w is the mean waterplane area of floats a m c r are frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping coefficient of floats respectively obtained from aqwa bem similarly the added mass variation is dependent on the geometry as seen in fig 9 the oscillations and coupling of floats in heave motion a f j f i increase with an increase in floats number in the resonance band the added inertia due to the acceleration of fluid particles in the vicinity of floats is higher and can be observed in oscillations across the frequency band neglecting the effect of the body to body interaction while computing the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients will not capture the possible coupling modes as seen in a1 b1 and c1 where the response is smooth with minimum to negligible oscillation with influence only from cb 4 1 2 q f factor the average absorbed power of all layouts is estimated for isolated and all floats cases the interaction factor based on the eom in frequency domain q f factor is computed for all three layouts and the values are given in the table 2 the generic representation of the float interaction factor irrespective of modeling domain is q q f is the frequency domain representation and q t is the time domain representation and is given by 7 q p n n p i 8 p n o r p i 1 t 0 t p l d w e c d t 1 2 ω 2 c r p t o z ω 2 where n 4 6 and 8 for bfwec 4 6 and 8 is the total number of isolated floats per layout ω is the wave frequency and z ω is the complex amplitude in heave whose detailed formulation is given in chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e a study on the same model the numerator of the q factor considers the interaction effects while the p i in the denominator represents the isolated average power of a single float for wave incident direction β 0 in a bfwec layout p n is the total average absorbed power estimated either in the frequency or time domain for layouts accounting for multi body interactions q 1 usually indicates shadowing effects dependent on the layout and the number of floats interacting the average q f value from table 2 indicates that out of all layouts bfwec 6 has a value of 1 06 greater than one compared to the other two which are 0 93 and 0 83 for bfwec 4 and 8 respectively it indicates better power absorption in six float layouts followed by bfwec 4 with the least absorption or highest shadowing effect in bfwec 8 larger gaps between the floats in all layouts may improve the interaction factor however the number of floats will be compromised resulting in reduced total power absorption for q f 1 though p n is less than that of total isolated absorbed power due to the inevitable interactions the total absorbed power increases for a higher number of floats frigaard et al 2016 however in the present study though the number of floats increases from bfwec 4 to bfwec 8 the float s size varies the number of floats in the layout and the price of floats manufacturing are always the trade off parameters which need to be considered from the practical perspective in general the literature suggests that the higher number of floats may be more economical than fewer floats due to mass production which is not proven in the present study frigaard et al 2016 the variation of q f for all layouts against the wave period is illustrated in fig 10 along with the q t estimated based on the time domain as observed in the frequency domain formulation section the absorbed power is independent of the wave height and only depends on the wave period fig 10 clearly shows the variation with the change in the wave period the factor also depends on the incident wave direction but the layouts are symmetric and therefore directionally insensitive so the wave direction importance is ignored in the present study q f shows the maximum value at 1 7s for bfwec 4 and at 1 9s for bfwec 6 and 8 with a secondary peak at 1 3s the overall variation in bfwec 6 is dominant across the wave periods than the other two layouts the average optimal linear c a o p t pto damping coefficient per float in the frequency domain which results in the maximum absorbed power is given in table 2 along with the isolated float s average optimal damping coefficient c a o p t i the optimal pto damping is directly proportional in the present study with the float s size and reduced with the float s size the isolated float s value also shows a similar trend but slightly less than the interacting float s value showing the influence of multi body interactions on pto damping however the factor needs to be plotted by time domain simulations for much accuracy computed in the next section 4 2 time domain analysis the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in the frequency domain of aqwa using bem are converted into time domain variables based on the cummins equation first the stability characteristics besides the hydrodynamic coefficients are transferred to wec sim from aqwa in lis and ah1 file former file stores output using structured query report sqr in a programming language and the later file stores the entire system s hydrodynamic database in ascii format together combined and complied by the boundary element input output bemio function of wec sim pre processing the aqwa data estimates impulse response functions and saves the resultant outcome in hierarchical data format 5 hdf5 or simply h5 as the study mainly deals with the multi body interactions the convolution integral computation is challenging and the method to compute them needs to be carefully chosen the wec sim blocks shown in fig 4 run in the simulink framework by communicating with the matlab wec sim input commands 4 3 impulse response function free decay response and rao while solving the motion response of the bfwec accounting for incident waves induced excitation forces and bodies induced radiation forces using cummins equation convolution terms representing excitation and radiation forces are present they are complicated to solve especially for the radiation force besides other external forces such as pto and mooring systems exist the radiation forces are termed and referred to as a memory effect de andrés et al 2013 as defined in eq 1a and eq 1b there are three popular methods to compute the convolution integral standard irf method state space ss representation and prony s method armesto et al 2015 the present study computed the convolution terms using the irf method and compared them with the ss method where the time domain raos computed using these are assessed fig 11 shows the radiation convolution integral of the floats in bfwec 4 6 8 computed using irf the fluctuations in fig 11 are due to the multi body oscillations increasing the number of floats in each layout for example in bfwec 4 a1 which has a single float tends to die down quickly it is represented in blue in contrast to a2 and a3 where the float number has increased from unity the a1 oscillations are negligible after 10s whereas a2 and a3 die down in the band of 15 20s with the highest and longer oscillations encountered in a3 similarly for the other two layouts it is attributed to fluid sloshing between the adjacent floats lewandowski 2008 armesto et al 2015 in other words they are lightly damped and the effect of memory of initial conditions is still there for more than 30s of all layouts bfwec 6 has a stronger influence due to its six floats interaction and thus the irf is to be computed till the response dies down and every time step of the simulations therefore it is time consuming compared to the alternative approach where the convolution integral is computed by representing the bfwec using the state space model the 2nd order differential equation of motion of bfwec is converted to 2 linear algebraic equations duarte et al 2013 fig 12 illustrates the comparison of radiation convolution integral computed using irf and ss of three layouts with all floats in action it is clear from fig 12 that the initial response is higher in the case of ss and the memory effect is dying down quickly compared to irf in bfwec 4 and 8 however in bfwec 6 the response is quite similar to the maximum initial response with irf it infers that the irfs are representing the convolution term accurately despite computationally expensive complementing this the heave degree raos illustrated in fig 13 show that the eom solved using the ss radiation method overestimates the response of most of the floats irrespective of the layout certainly at the resonance period and its vicinity where the peaks in the response are observed for longer periods the rao is closely matched irrespective of the radiation force computation method the representation of radiation damping with a constant coefficient at a certain frequency as in the case of frequency domain instead of convolution integral is way too inefficient in the presence of multi float interactions and is out of the contest in the present study the memory time or the convolution time is set to 30s in bfwec 4 8 in comparison 35s for bfwec 6 and irf method is implemented for better representation of multi body memory effects since the natural periods of floats in all the layouts are designed more or less the same the peaks are observed near 1 3s precisely at 1 5s in the rao of three layouts besides due to the interactions of multiple floats other periods are also provoked such as 1 3s and 1 9s for different floats which varied for different floats in each layout depending on its position around cb irrespective of the layout the maximum rao is observed in the front float for example at 0 side floats f 2 and f 4 are perpendicular to the wavefront in the case of bfwec 4 they seem to have performed poorly in shorter waves as the wavelength of the passing wave is less than the length of these floats there will always be a crest beneath the perpendicularly orientated with the f2 and f4 floats therefore they will not oscillate in heave mode as the float size reduces with the increase in the float number from bfwec 4 to 8 floats f 3 and f 7 in bfwec 8 despite being perpendicular to the incident wavefront performed reasonably well unlike these two layouts in bfwec 6 there is no perpendicular float as the floats number increase the wavy pattern in the oscillations seems to increase with a maximum rao of 2 45 m m f 3 2 2 m m f 3 5 and 2 6 m m f 5 in bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively further in fig 14 the rao of isolated single float layouts and front float of complete float set layouts are compared it can be observed that front floats of all floats cases of bfwec 4 6 and 8 are dominant for most of the wave periods including the heave resonance period over their counterparts viz isolated front floats thus multiple floats presence shows a better response in terms of maximum peak rao and peak activation at multiple wave periods compared to the single float where the peak is only seen at 1 5s the excitation force is also a convolution term given in eq 1a and eq 1b which is solved before the simulation subject to the availability of the future wave data in the numerical simulations the computation of excitation convolution integral in all six degrees in the time domain is executed over a given simulation time lemmer et al 2016 the incident wave s spectral data is utilized to introduce random phase or single frequency wave characteristics for regular waves lemmer et al 2016 the non causal excitation irf of the floats for three layouts is illustrated in fig 15 it can be observed that the impulse response depends on the float position or their orientation thus the front float is first exerted by the effect generated by the future incident wave which will hit the centroid in a few moments followed by the other floats hence in all layouts the front float s response is highest the response of floats depends on the number of floats present in the entire system for example in bfwec 4 the front float response for a1 a2 a3 is varied and the oscillations die down on the positive time frame quickly with lesser floats however there is a significant disturbance observed in the negative time frame for front float isolated f3 a1refereing to the significant arrival of force on it before the wave elevation compared to the other cases and layouts the maximum value of the impulse response is highest in four float layouts and reduces with the float s size since the wetted area hence the wetted volume is reduced before the simulations the free decay test is conducted for the layouts and the response is illustrated in fig 16 the response is compared with the isolated float in all the layouts the isolated floats decay quickly from the floats in the complete float set a3 b4 and c5 it is directly related to the memory effect response these both have exhibited a pure heave heave coupling between the floats such that the memory effect is strong influences floats response to a longer time frame the response of isolated floats with the total float set case matches about 5s in the first two layouts and 2s in the last layout the response a3 b4 and c5 has multiple decays not commonly observed from a standard decay test with complete exponential decay as one float is displaced by an external force initially free oscillation it oscillates and generates the waves radiating thereby losing its momentum as indicated till 6 s however the oscillation and associated radiated wave during 0 6 s have subsequently affected the adjacent waves and cb activating their motion the adjacent floats gain some momentum and transfer some amount back to the initially displaced float as a result the second decay phase has begun will increase in the amplitude compared to the previous time instant and less compared to the initial displacement over time even this gets dissipated however this has taken a long time compared to the first decay phase the natural period in heave is estimated to be 1 3s for all the floats in all layouts 4 3 1 optimal pto damping and q t factor in the present section the optimal damping is estimated and the variations of absorbed power under all wave conditions are assessed for the linear time domain model in regular waves wave height wave period and float number are four critical variables besides c r p t o which influences the absorbed power and capture width ratio of wec for every incident wave characteristic the optimal pto damping required to maximize the absorbed power or cwr must be estimated to understand the device s maximum performance however its evaluation is tricky since there are the variables mentioned above wave conditions wave height period and direction and c r p t o will influence the cwr and absorbed power trends in different ways for different combinations initially each float s absorbed power for all wave conditions is estimated for the wide range of damping coefficients the optimal pto damping for each float is obtained for which the absorbed power is estimated to have maximum the influence of c r p t o on absorbed power can be understood from fig 17 a and b where the variation of absorbed power for all wave periods in bfwec 8 for a wave height of 0 2 m is illustrated the values absorbed power are increasing with the increase in the c r p t o for all wave periods across all layouts they reach a maximum value at a specific damping coefficient and reduce after that the corresponding damping at which a maximum absorbed power is referred to as optimal pto damping c o p t further the variation of absorbed power is sensitive to wave periods and for each wave period the value of c o p t is different and its value is shifting towards higher damping coefficients in other words longer wave periods require higher optimal damping values irrespective of the layout for f 1 the absorbed power is maximum at 1 7s and 1 9s moderate for longer periods and minimum for shorter periods while set f 2 8 f 3 7 and f 4 6 show a similar trend throughout the damping range for f 2 8 the absorbed power is lowest or relatively negligible for shorter periods below 1 7s and higher for above 1 5s and the difference is maximum with a maximum value at 1 9s set f 3 7 absorb effectively for longer wave periods as shown in fig 17a and b lowest at 1 3s and moderate for intermediate wave periods similarly set f 4 6 absorbs well for periods above 1 7s and comparatively reasonable for f 2 8 however there are some discrepancies in the maximum value of some of these sets nevertheless the trends are the same similarly the absorbed power variations with the pto damping were estimated for other wave heights as well and the optimal damping values were found the absorbed power also a function of wave height as shown in fig 18 from the absorbed power variation of f 3 in bfwec 4 for all wave heights it can be observed that the absorbed power increases with the increase in wave height nevertheless the optimal damping value and the variation concerning the wave period remain unchanged f 3 has the maximum absorption ability near the resonance period t 1 5s and lower for periods above it fig 19 illustrates optimum damping for individual floats for various wave periods for three layouts in the form of matrices each pixel represents the pto damping coefficient with a bar on the side showing the intensity magnitude in colors it can be observed that c o p t dependent wave periods clearly but not with the wave height as expected and discussed in the frequency domain the optimal damping required by the floats in bfwec 8 lower than bfwec 4 for both bfwec 4 and 8 the c o p t is increasing with the wave period as observed in fig 19 variations for all the floats however this trend seems true for bfwec 6 as well as expect at 1 1s precisely the farther floats require higher damping to absorb effectively in this case as the wave direction is 0 the farther floats are f 1 f 2 and f 6 the requirement of the damping however relaxed for later periods the average c o p t across the waves periods range from 3300 to 4000 n s m r a d 3200 3500 n s m r a d and 2500 2900 n s m r a d for the floats in bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively these values are certainly higher compared to the frequency domain estimated values where it has underestimated the corresponding cwr matrix for individual floats against wave periods is shown in fig 20 for all layouts bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 have a maximum cwr of 132 with the same lower limit at 5 at the same time bfwec 6 has a maximum of 100 and a minimum limit of 5 similar to the other two cwr of each float across the layouts is sensitive to wave periods and there is seems to have fluctuations across the band high intensity pixels are observed for the front facing floats in the layouts and the number of such pixels tends to spread from 1 1s to 1 5s also the cwr of all the floats has its peak within 1 1s 1 7s which reduces subsequently though the cwr limits shown by the color bars of bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 are the same the number of pixels with a cwr value above 40 is higher in bfwec 8 due to a higher number of floats participation an important factor representing interference effects in the time domain q t factor is computed from the estimated absorbed power of all the floats in their respective layouts against the isolated single float cases at the optimal pto damping values table 3 gives the average absorbed power and optimal pto damping coefficients for isolated cases of three layouts q t is maximum for bfwec 6 and minimum for bfwec 4 see fig 10 the variations have peaks of 1 3s and 1 9s however the bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 exhibit shadow effects till 1 7s with positive interference at 1 9s and reduces after that while bfwec 6 has a maximum shadowing effect at 1 5s at the resonance similar to the other layouts and the values computed in frequency domain dashed lines for most of the wave periods the variation of q t is higher than q f thus time domain simulations better represent both the shadow and peak positive interference effects while frequency domain seems to underestimate them the average q t the three layouts are estimated as 0 879 1 and 0 947 respectively close to the values estimated in the frequency domain both q t and q t found common ground for bfwec 6 while varying in the other two layouts 4 3 2 response time history total average absorbed power and total cwr the absorbed power and cwr of each float at the c o p t identified for all the layouts is estimated and their total summation accounting all floats per layout is given in terms of total average absorbed power p t a and cwr matrices see fig 21 and fig 22 as observed p t a is highly dependent on wave heights and periods with maximum value h 0 2m and t 2 3s in all layouts bfwec 4 bfwec 6 absorb a maximum of 185w 219w and 246w and bfwec 8 respectively while the bar indicator shows the lowest value of 60w 45w and 66w for the three layouts the variation of p t a bfwec 4 and 8 show their first peak values at 1 5s while bfwec 6 at 1 3s increases with the wave period until a certain value reduces after that and increases for longer periods also pixels across the wave heights above 1 7s in bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 have intensities above 150w or closer unlike bfwec 4 where high intensity pixels are limited to a few the floats irrespective of layouts absorb effectively for moderate to long periods fig 22 illustrates the total cwr matrices and it is clear that it is insensitive to the wave heights as represented by the same color band while varying with the wave periods in all layouts the variation of total cwr unlike p t a is minimum of longer periods while maximum at resonant periods the total conversion of wave energy is maximum in bfwec 8 with a value of 262 followed by bfwec 4 with a value of 168 and least in bfwec 6 with a value of 150 unlike p t a variation for bfwec 4 the conversion ratio is higher in shorter periods till 1 5s and lowest or nearly the same at 80 thereafter the lower limit of the total cwr is 80 119 and 146 for bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively bfwec 8 has higher power absorption and cwr than others across the wave heights and periods despite lower interaction as the number of the float increases the number of pixels variation increases which is an aspect for any wec to perform effectively for more than one wave period or natural period the response time history of all the floats in all three layouts is illustrated in fig 23 along with the absorbed power history at t 1 5s and h 0 2m the time history is plotted for an c o p t of 4 k n m s r a d 3 k n m s r a d and 2 5 k n m s r a d for the three layouts respectively a3 b4 and c5 the average damping coefficients across all the floats and the wave periods for bfwec 4 and bfwec 6 the front float s heave f3 and f 5 is close to the wave elevation at 1 5s resulting from fig 22 cwr is maximum at 1 5s is the absorbed power time history in all the cases cb s response is suppressed due to the presence of taut mooring there is a greater phase difference between the floats and cb than the floats mutual difference which is desirable if both floats and cb have zero phase difference the net heave response is suppressed while in the present scenario pre tension tethers make the heave pitch and roll degrees stiff ensuring the lower response it is clear from the power time history that the front floats have the lion s share in the total power absorption in all the cases the contribution thus reduces as we move towards the rare end of the bfwec though the cwr is calculated using undisturbed incident wave power due to the floats circumferential arrangement the waves transmitting through the front end floats will get disturbed and the wave power should ideally be estimated at the center of gravity of that particular floats it might further improve the cwr of the rear floats since the wave power is instantaneous and would be lower than that of the undisturbed incident wave before hitting the device 4 4 bfwec s footprint on the wave force regime in this section the authors have mapped the trace of various bfwec layouts on wave force regimes to extract possible technical insights that might help choose the number of floats during the design and modeling stage bfwec model with floats varying from 3 to 10 in steps of one including the above discussed layouts are considered to estimate the scattering parameter π l e f f l and a keulegan carpenter or kc number h l e f f the natural period of floats in each layout 3 10 in heave is maintained to be more or less around 1 3 s by choosing and adjusting appropriate mass and hydrostatic stiffness it will not only ensure model similarity but also allows hydrodynamic comparisons to plot these wecs on force regimes low to extreme amplitudes and moderate to larger wave periods sets have been chosen h t 0 2 m 1 8 s 0 4 m 2 2 s 0 6 m 2 4 s 0 8 m 2 6 s the wave force regime adopted from chakrabarti 1979 shows the contributions of inertia drag and diffraction forces on a body in water with two governing parameters known as scattering ratio and kc number for the considered wave sets these two parameters are estimated for all layouts and summarized in table 4 to evaluate the dominance of various regimes by counting the footprints of each wec for example bfwec 4 6 8 and 10 patterns have been traced in fig 24 as the number of floats increases the pattern is shifting toward regime iii which has a slight influence of drag which is quantified in table 3 it is important to note that when we estimate and trace the wecs for shorter wave periods the entire cluster of wec traces shifts towards regime iii though an increase in float number increases the average power output it increases drag forces influence theoretically it can be much more significant in practice due to the discrepancies in fabrication and actual wave interactions it might reduce the average power output difference between the bfwec 4 which is fairly out of drag regime higher layouts bfwec 6 and 8 which seemed better than the former though this gives a first hand insight into the influence of the number of floats interacting in each bfwec layout incorporating nonlinearities and actual power take off will give a complete understanding of this problem future work includes a detailed study of varying floats in random waves and weakly nonlinear time domain analysis 4 5 bfwec s economic assessment the economic performance of the proposed bfwec with its layouts is discussed by incorporating the estimates of capital expenditure capex operational expenditure opex an indicator such as levelized cost of electricity lcoe capex is the total initial capital invested in the project including design development wec structure power take off pto mooring material pre assembly transport control safety and installation at the site in comparison opex deals with the operations maintenance costs of the wec throughout its lifetime lcoe represents the minimal price paid for the generated power from the device to finance the project cost it is a widely used indicator in the power generation industry allowing various marine energy convertors performance according to de andres et al 2015 lcoe is defined as the ratio of total annualized costs comprising of capex and opex to the total energy generated by the wec annual energy production aep borgarino et al 2012 babarit 2015 chen et al 2018 to

rate r is accounted for over the lifetime of the device n t is any year of interest in the lifetime a annual energy production aep aep is calculated by multiplying the probability of occurrence in terms of annual availability of the sea state with the bfwec s power matrix since the device is designed and developed based on indian sea states a total of eleven sea states ss in the arabian sea as and eight sea states of bay of bengal bob of indian cost are considered for lcoe calculations along with the probability of its occurrence the wave data is taken from the popular data bank on wave energy resource assessment for the indian shelf seas contributed by kumar and anoop the annual average wave power is relatively higher in as 12 kw m than that of bob with the lowest at the southeast coast tip of india due to the presence of sri lanka the data is segregated into tables 5 a 5c representing the percentage of time the wave power is available annually at various sea states considered in as for three categories of wave power 5 kw m 5 10 kw m and 10 kw m respectively the assumption is made by considering the same annual availability values for the scaled wave parameters 1 10 while tables 6 a 6c represent the percentage of time the wave power is available annually at various sea states considered in bob for three categories of wave power 5 kw m 5 10 kw m and 10 kw m respectively tap is the total absorbed power of bfwec as represented by fig 21 for three layouts η 1 accounts for the conversion of mechanical to electricity electric efficiency while η 2 and η 3 represent losses due to device availability considered to be 95 and transmission efficiency 98 respectively η 1 is considered from work on bfwec with hydraulic pto conducted by sricharan and chandrasekaran 2021 η 1 of 77 75 5 and 75 125 are considered for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively which are the average electric efficiencies the aep of all bfwec layouts estimated in kwy h is shown in fig 25 for as and fig 26 for bob the bar diagrams in figs 25 and 26 indicate that aep values are proportional to the tap shown in fig 21 with an increase in the performance with the increase in the number of floats aep also increases with the increase in the wave power with superior performance and poor performance for wave power greater than 10 kw m and less than 5 kw m respectively aep is consistent across all the sea states in fig 25 for wave power greater than 10 kw m in contrast for bob fig 26 the trend for all the layouts is inconsistent with lower estimates till ss 4 in calculating lcoe certain inevitable assumptions are considered by referring to the literature de andres et al 2016 i all the calculations are made for a single scaled model 1 10 not a wave farm ii opex is calculated as a percentage of the capex 8 iii a discount rate of 8 has been chosen for the study iv a growth rate in opex of 2 is considered v the same level of availability of 95 has been taken for all the locations sea states both as and bob included vi a lifetime of bfwec is considered to be 20 years and vii same capex 4729 usd or opex 378 usd or per year are considered for all the three layouts further the price estimates are considered from the experiments conducted at iit madras the cost is represented in usd with an india rupee to us dollar conversion ratio of 74 1usd 74 indian rupees a sample calculation of all the parameters is given in table 7 the lcoe for as and bob is shown in fig 27 for all the bfwec layouts in the lcoe calculations aep of three levels of wave power 5 5 10 and 10 kw m are combined algebraic summation net aep for each sea state of as and bob though the sample calculations are shown for eight years in table 7 the final estimates indicated in table 7 and the section results are for the complete lifetime of the bfwec 20 y fig 27 shows the lcoe trends of bfwec 4 6 8 across the arabian sea and bay of bengal overall lcoe is relatively lower for all the layouts in the sea states of the arabian sea due to higher wave power densities compared to the sea states of the bay of bengal further an increase in the number of floats in bfwec significantly influenced lcoe the lcoe estimates are higher for bfwec 4 which reduces as we move towards the tip of the western shelf arabian sea from ss1 to ss11 however the lcoe trend for bfwec 6 8 in the arabian sea remains more or less the same with the values significantly less 2 kwh than that of bfwec 4 average lcoe estimates across all the sea states of as are 8 70 kwh 1 36 kwh and 1 23 kwh for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively while in the bay of bengal the eastern shelf of india coast lcoe estimates shoot up with a maximum value crossing 22 kwh for bfwec 4 lcoe trend similar to as remains more or less the same for bob average lcoe estimates across all the sea states of bobare 6 17 kwh 4 33 kwh and 3 81 kwh for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively though the maximum lcoe of bfwec 4 in bob is significantly higher almost double than as the average lcoe across all the sea states in bob is less than as with a significant drop in lcoe beyond ss1 of bob in comparison the lcoe trend of bfwec 4 in as is zig zag till ss8 and reduces after that the lcoe values calculated are higher than the normal trend observed in the literature de andres et al 2015 which usually lie somewhere around 0 25 2 3 kwh one reason is that the present study is conducted on a single bfwec device irrespective of the number of floats present whereas the literature estimates generally consider the calculations for the wec arrays which have proven economical further the present bfwec model does not consider any active control systems to improve the capture ratio and the overall power absorption of the device which also contributes to the higher lcoe values for the indian sea states therefore either bfwec 6 or 8 can be considered ideal for indian sea states with more significant benefit for the deployments in all the sea states of the arabian sea and sea states beyond four ss4 in the case of the bay of bengal 5 conclusions using wec sim a novel floating wave energy converter is developed and analyzed based on the linear time domain principle three bfwec layouts are proposed in the study with 4 6 and 8 bean shaped floats that extract energy by moving relative to the cb the hydrodynamic data from the aqwa bem software is a basic building block for formulating and modeling the device in wec sim all the components are logically interconnected to enable the multi body interactions in the matlab simscapefluids toolbox the device is assessed to influence a range of damping coefficients using a linear damper to absorb maximum energy the optimum pto damping reinforcing the optimum amplitude of the floats in each layout is applied across the bfwec s operating bandwidth of frequencies the wave float interference effects were then evaluated using the q factor the present study is observed to have the following advantages the presence of multiple bodies has led to more power due to the increased net excitation force the interactions between these bodies have activated the device to respond with multiple resonating frequencies capturing power in a wide range of sea states multiple floats multi body around the cb have improved overall performance and reduced the chance of complete shutdown of the energy production even with any particular float malfunctioning the proposed bean shaped floats and their arrangement around the cb make the device novel it also enabled the device to extract a larger excitation force which better radiating capabilities the radiation convolution integral is computed using both irf and ss the multi body interactions are accurately captured by irf which can be observed in convolution response and the rao also the memory effect is significant in the complete floats sets compared to the isolated floats across the layouts the theoretically obtained optimum linear damping values slightly under estimates the numerically obtained optimum pto damping values the optimal damping is sensitive only with the wave period and float position and reduces the float s size the trends of q t and q f computed are similar to maximum positive interference in bfwec 6 however the maximum shadow effect is exhibited by bfwec 4 in the time domain and bfwec 8 in the frequency domain the study showed a better interpretation of the total average power absorption and total average cwr for many floats around the cb the object oriented wec sim tool makes wec devices much smoother to customize the open source code simulation processing time and cost with sufficient and acceptable accuracy hence it is an ideal tool to model and assess oscillating wec concepts like the current device the device s overall performance can be further improved by choosing a pto and tuning it to the dominant frequency range for indian sea states bfwec s economic assessment has been carried out with aep and lcoe estimates for all three layouts in both the arabian sea and the bay of bengal lower lcoe trends are observed with the increase in the number of floats with the lowest lcoe observed to be 0 88 kwh in the arabian sea all the sea states in the arabian sea are recommended for the deployment of bfwec 6 8 in comparison sea states from ss5 to ss8 in the bay of bengal are recommended declaration of

20289,present study deliberates on the numerical analysis of a new bean shaped multi body floating wave energy converter bfwec using an open source time domain modeling tool called wec sim wave energy converter simulator the proposed device is a directionally insensitive floating point absorber with a set of bean shaped floats attached circumferentially around a central cylinder or buoy cb or cs extracting the wave energy under heave degree due to the relative motion of the floats with cb the shape and arrangement of the floats around the cb make the bfwec different from other existing devices authors propose three different layouts of bfwec with multiple floats namely 4 6 and 8 to study the influence of float s number on the device s overall performance all layouts are incorporated with a linear damping power take off pto system to estimate absorbed power where the influence of damping on the performance is studied the frequency dependent parameters required to initiate time domain analysis are obtained from the boundary element method bem the influence of multi float interactions on performance is assessed over an isolated single float arrangement the levelized cost of

writing original draft 1 introduction wave energy conversion is not yet a feasible technology compared to other alternative energy resources such as solar and wind but is slowly attracting large scale investors as the location and ocean climate influence a wave energy converter wec design cannot be developed globally sheng and lewis 2012 though the energy density of waves is higher than the other clean energy resources the complexities in operating and capital involved make it challenging to progress from a lab scale model to a full scale device clément et al 2002 wave potential along indian coasts ranges from 5 to 25 kw m far lesser than european australian and american coastal lines mnre 2020 esso 2019 ciril 2014 amrutha and sanil kumar 2020 small scale wave devices are better suitable for countries with lower energy potentials like india researchers need to take the maximum advantage available in geographical hot spots in such small scale resource areas choosing such locations in the low power resource countries would benefit economically in wec design installation and power rating additionally moving towards an offshore location compared to nearshore would be beneficial since the wave power would be higher there as demonstrated by the ceto wec developed by carnegie carnegie clean energy 2019 floating wecs also have advantages over fixed wecs in deeper waters especially concerning mooring pinto et al 2019 out of all wec technologies oscillating devices like point absorbers which are typically smaller than the incident wavelengths are advantageous under a multi directional sea state due to their design point absorbers are highly suitable for array layouts the multiple body interaction is optimized to achieve constructive interference or low shadow effects by the appropriate position or orientation of the floats child and venugopal 2010 they can power the petrochemical plants or desalination plants and other floating factories away from the shore further wave loads direct impact on existing marine or coastal structures can be reduced by incorporating these energy absorbing devices pastor and liu 2014 chandrasekaran et al 2014 the performance of oscillating devices in regular waves results in a higher power capturing capability the device will be tuned to only one dominant frequency of the approaching wave sherman and mei 1980 falnes 1999 tucker and pitt 2001 zang et al 2018 however their performance under irregular waves is highly complex due to the requirement of future wave force to tune the incoming waves period with the natural period as the technical details of various wec technologies are not in the public domain one needs strenuous efforts to understand its qualitative features advancements and power producing capabilities however babarit et al in 2012 have significantly contributed to showcasing the performance levels using time domain models of different wec concepts the hydrodynamic parameters of any wec directly affect wave wec interactions which was proven in the research conducted on arrays of vertical cylinders and various other floats shapes over the years erselcan and kukner 2017 yilmaz 2018 in addition to this assertion the number of bodies involved in the floating devices also influences the design parameters and performance characteristics including the pto system remarkably from the studies conducted on various wecs it is understood that the variation of hydrodynamic parameters greatly influenced by buoy s geometrical parameters like inertia stiffness shape draft and diameter will alter the overall dynamics and improve the power capture capability of the device brown et al 2018 flocard and finnigan 2015 behzad and panahi 2017 al shami et al 2018 ruezga and canedo 2019 choosing an optimal damping coefficient is also equally important for maximizing the absorbed power sheng and lewis 2016 preliminary numerical and experimental investigation on a 1 10 scale bfwec with four floats bfwec 4 was performed using the spectral domain model the floats wave power and response are represented in power spectral densities to estimate the energy content a hydrodynamic conversion ratio of 25 obtained from the study shows the device s feasibility to wave conditions and insensitive directional features chandrasekaran and sricharan 2019 detailed numerical studies were carried out on five different float shapes with bfwec design in frequency domain chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e the effect of shape size and still water depth on the power absorption was studied a novel bean float was found to have promising hydrodynamic characteristics than the other considered float shapes chandrasekaran and sricharan 2019 a customized hydraulic pto system was modeled and analyzed under the extreme conditions of the scaled indian sea states using wec sim to estimate the absorbed power and cwr of bfwec in regular waves sricharan and chandrasekaran 2021 the present study adopts the recommended bean shape float wec layout it is parametrized with varying float numbers around the cb four six and eight represented by bfwec 4 bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 the change in performance of the bfwec is assessed as the number of floats is changed further these three layouts performance is evaluated under the influence of the external damping force generated from the ideal pto to maximize the average power output to quantify the interaction effects in between the floats to that of the isolated float and the corresponding response of each layout a term called q factor or often known as interference factor is considered which was originally introduced in the literature for array interactions child and venugopal 2010 it is defined as the ratio between the algebraic sum of average power absorbed by all the floats in a wec layout with interactions and the average power of all the same wec floats in isolation an array is said to have constructive interference positive interference effect when q 1 and q 1 for destructive interference thus a better muli body wec or an array design should possess a higher q value and be parametrized for maximizing the constructive interferences for any given layout further the economic assessment of novel wecs in indian sea states is seldom the present paper addresses parameters such as aep and lcoe are the indicators required to be compared with other marine energy technology worldwide for performance comparisons although there are no dedicated policies for marine energy technology in terms of discounts subsidies and other techno economic benefits the estimation of lcoe is carried out considering the standard assumption discount rates etc from the established literature in the other parts of the world usa europe and australia the time domain modeling and simulations for the proposed study are executed using an open source numerical tool called wec sim developed by the national renewable energy limited nrel and sandia national laboratories snl wec sim 2020 wec sim can solve two types of computational modeling methods that can be implemented for any given wec one is the linear potential method and another is the weakly nonlinear time domain method the former method works on small buoy oscillations assumptions with approximately the same wetted surface at the mean sea level whereas the latter approach which is often referred to as the blended time domain method integrates the nonlinear dynamic pressure over the buoy s instantaneous wetted surface in calculating nonlinear buoyancy and excitation forces are out of the scope of the present study the entire working principle and flowchart of different wec models in wec sim with standard pto systems are discussed in the literature using matlab simulink block interface yu et al 2014 lawson et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the study s flow is as follows section 2 describes the 1 10 scale novel bean concept and three layouts the numerical formulation is described in time domain briefly with wec sim modeling besides inferences and the detailed insights are drawn from the hydrodynamic coefficients in section 3 section 4 is dedicated to results and discussions where the power absorption and cwr are estimated under the linear power take off influence for various wave parameters besides the multi body interference effects are assessed by comparing the response with the isolated float further lcoe and annual energy production aep estimates are calculated for the arabian sea and bay of bengal sea states 2 concept of bfwec the overall design of bfwec consists of a central buoy cb and a set of floats a reaction subsystem in the form of taut mooring tethers connecting arms and a pto system providing additional damping to the device cb is a hollow cylindrical positive buoyant floating member integrating all the device components while the floats are bean shaped smoothly finished rounded hollow neutrally buoyant floating members the device s proposed layouts with 4 6 8 floats are shown in figs 1 3 and are referred to as a3 b4 and c5 respectively the number succeeding the terms a b c is not related to the number of floats in the respective layout please refer to section 4 for the terminology details in all the layouts the energy is extracted from the individual floats relative rotation about cb the equivalent vertical displacement heave of each float relative to the cb z r e l a t i v e due to the rotation at the hinges is referred to as net heave throughout the analysis all the bodies are surface piercing with floats having a draft to radius ratio equal to unity at static equilibrium condition the number of floats per layout varies by maintaining the total gap between the floats in all three layouts constant at 30 the geometric properties of all three layouts are in table 1 the floats circumferential arrangement adds stability to the device while making it directional insensitive and enabling power harvest under all wave incident angles bfwec is a self floating system that remains afloat even under the tether plug out condition which will limit it only to undergo functional failure similarly the advantage of having multiple floats also complements the fact that the mechanical failure of one float would not stop the functioning of the complete device the center of gravity of the device is maintained well below the center of buoyancy to ensure dynamic stability by adding sufficient ballast at the bottom of the cb the floating feature makes the device convenient to tow it similar to semi submersibles from one place to another depending on seasonal variations and extreme sea events the ballasting and de ballasting techniques that are in existence with tension leg platform tlp installations can be used as a reference in deploying floating or preferably compliant wecs similar to tlp mechanics the cb possesses a hybrid characteristic with relaxed and stiff degrees of freedom at the same time in other words the horizontal plane degrees surge sway and yaw have slightly relaxing periods when compared to vertical plane degrees heave roll and pitch which have higher resistance offered from the tethers resulting in shorter natural periods see table 1 unlike bottom fixed wecs the floating devices won t be designed on their strength basis instead they are designed on a displacement basis generally known as form dominant devices chandrasekaran 2017 chandrasekaran and nagavinothini 2020 in the case of the present system floats will absorb energy by oscillating since it is free to move relatively and cb is made position restrained by using taut mooring making it stiff thereby offering dynamic stability to the whole structure which is referred as a re centering capability in offshore engineering it is desired that cb s response must be minimized for active and maximum rotation of the floats around it the cb can generally be any floating structure anywhere in the sea coupled dynamically with the floats for example the floating and fixed wind farms can be integrated with the floats around the upper portion of substructures such as monopile or tripod which can accommodate floats and pto similar to cb about msl the sea bed is considered to be smooth and flat without any bathymetry effects the 0 waves travel from x to x direction and the floats are numbered and positioned counter clockwise starting from f 1 in x to f i where i is float number for the layout the wave directionality will change positively from the x axis to y axis in the anti clock direction as shown in fig 1 b as the model is symmetric about the z axis one quadrant of variable wave directions is sufficient to highlight the device s directional features it is noteworthy to mention that the designs of wavebob and wavestar may look close in terms of multi body oscillations and relative rotation with primary fixed floating frame to the present proposal but are entirely different in terms of geometry and working principle wavebob is a two body wec with a torus member and a buoy moving in a vertical direction to generate power tarrant and meskell 2016 wavestar is a fixed nearshore wec a hemispherical buoy heaving around the fixed base structure kramer et al 2011 wavestar 2019 authors have streamlined the present research which resulted in a product to patent approach i e performance before proprietorship where the proposed model is first modeled analyzed and tested for its real world application the product bfwec and its mechanism with various combinations of its embodiments is registered under intellectual property rights india patent chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a d 3 numerical modeling in wec sim wec sim is an open source numerical modeling tool for simulating wec devices built on the matlab simulink simscape fluids platform wec sim 2020 matlab 2021 wec sim is capable of solving the multi body dynamics of wec systems with ptos and mooring the present bfwec is modeled by using various in built tools of wec sim the geometric data and frequency dependent parameters such as hydrodynamic coefficients for the proposed layouts are computed from bem formulation in aqwa further the mooring and pto mechanism parameters have been appropriately chosen and specified in the pre processing initialization stage in wec sim contributing to the additional forces generated due to their coupling with the primary wec system the time domain equation of motion eom for the whole structure in all six degrees of freedom dof is then solved using 4th order variable time step runge kutta method ode45 3 1 bfwec dynamics the rigid body motions of the bfwec require a standard coordinate system to represent them conveniently the global coordinate system x y and z is defined at the msl as shown in fig 1a and b and a local or body fixed coordinate system x y and z which is defined for each body present in the system for example each float is positioned to oscillate about the y y axis whose position and orientation are transformed using the cartesian and rotation matrix method respectively it is accomplished by defining the desired motion revolute joint or hinge for floats to cb as reference in wec sim internal mechanics as the floats pitch about the hinges ry θ a net relative heave about cb is developed as shown in fig 1a therefore only one of the two is sufficient to represent the device s active dynamics of wave power extraction due to the presence of taut mooring the surge and pitch coupling of cb are kept minimal the individual rotation ry θ of the floats about cb is externally damped by a linear pto viscous rotational damper to extract wave energy θ is the pitch rotation of floats at the hinges the coupled equation of motion for a j t h float j is any particular float of interest and cb can be written as in the heave degree float i 1 t o n 1a m f j z f j t a 33 f j c z c t i 1 n a 33 f j f i z f i t 0 t i 1 n k r 33 f j f i τ z f i t τ d τ 0 t k r 33 f j c τ z c t τ d τ k h 33 f j z f j t c l p t o z f j t z c t η τ k e 33 f j t τ d τ cb 1b m c a 33 c c z c t i 1 n a 33 c f i z f i t 0 t k r

float number m f and m c are the dry mass of float and cb respectively eq 1a and eq 1b are based on cummins eom formulation cummins 1962 since in a given layout all the floats are identical their mass is the same simply m f k h is linear hydrostatic stiffness accounting for the effect of buoyancy and k m is mooring stiffness term k e is the excitation impulse response function and c l p t o is the linear damping coefficient z c and z f are the heave amplitudes of cb and floats respectively the subscripts c and f represent cb and float respectively while z and z represent velocity and acceleration amplitudes in heave degree in heave the total wave force due to external pressure on the body is decomposed of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces hydrodynamic force constitutes excitation force and radiation forces the two constituents of excitation force viz froude krylov f k and diffraction force are together accommodated in the right hand side of eq 1a and eq 1b for floats and cb respectively the f k component is calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure of incident waves over the body s mean wetted surface area assuming that it does not change the incident wave field as the name indicates diffraction force arises due to the incident wavefield s scattering by the body s presence the presence of multiple bodies will significantly affect the overall performance compared to the isolated single float and cb combination due to the increase in the net force acting on the individual float discussed in detail in section 4 the number of floats participating in the extraction and gap between them for each layout and the wave directionality significantly influences the overall hydrodynamics and the performance in terms of absorbed power and cwr currently available bem based tools which are based on linear potential theory can address the interactions of such multiple body layouts the oscillation of bfwec in a calm wave induces forces that constitute additional inertial effects and hydrodynamic damping since the viscous effects are neglected only radiation contributes to hydrodynamic damping the former is due to a change in the momentum of surrounding water particles represented as infinite frequency added mass a or limiting value of added mass a simply later represents the energy dissipation due to radiation c the component a in total radiation force of bfwec in heave degree arises from the following a due to the motion of cb alone represented as a p q c c b the influence of cb on floats and vice versa represented by a p q f j c and a p q c f j respectively c the influence of the motion of one float on another float is represented by i 1 n a p q f j f i including self influence i j the floats interaction at every time step results in so called memory effects that die down over time this effect can be represented with radiation impulse response function rirf k r and is non causal viz the present oscillation of the float also depends on its past oscillation memory in contrast to the excitation irf which is causal viz depending on the future wave journee and massie 2001 the disturbed water particles and floats or cb position history will affect the present motion for some time interval the radiation component k r of total radiation force is defined by a nonlinear response and the net effect of the component k r of bfwec can arise from the following d the radiation from cb motion alone represented as c p q c c e the influence of radiation of cb on floats and vice versa represented by c p q f j c and c p q c f j respectively f the influence of radiation of one float on another float irrespective of layout represented by i 1 n c p q f j f i including self influence i j it is important to note that p q is the row and column index of the complete 6x6 matrix and represented as subscripts of each element p q 1 to 6 represent surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw modes respectively while the term pq represents the influence of q t h mode on p t h mode the radiation force for a particular body is obtained by the convolution of k r or c i r f with the floats and cb velocity z f a n d z c for the desired dof respectively the time dependent excitation force is obtained by the convolution of k e or f i r f with the wave elevation the frequency range and the time frame along with the time step have to be chosen appropriately for the convolutions integrals to tend to die down within a specific time folley 2016 as the dynamics of the device are expressed based on the cummins equation k r and k e can be accounted for directly in wec sim without violating the conditions of the linear time domain method the detailed insights of each of the hydrodynamic coefficients will be discussed in section 4 3 2 wec sim all the layouts were modeled in wec sim by physically connecting all the subsystems bodies with the help of simulink blocks under an object oriented framework mimicking the working principle of bfwec fig 4 represents the complete circuit system of the bfwec 8 layout constituting different subsystems in fig 4 blue block subsystem body block 1 marked in blue color and other body blocks marked yellow represent cb and four bean shaped floats of bfwec layouts maroon blocks are the rotational damper ptos representing the connection between cb and float blocks as a hinge mechanism providing adjustable linear pto damping onto the floats all the rotational blocks are oriented according to the float s position such that the floats rotate about the local y axis y y the dynamic response of cb in bfwec is coupled with mooring blocks each red color block represents a tether all mooring blocks are dragged and dropped from the wec sim library and defined in the wec sim input as a mooring matrix a function of tether stiffness and pre tension in each cable refer table 1 the cb must have 6 dof blocks orange color to model all degrees of freedom in the decay tests floats and the cb are given an initial displacement at zero pto damping to obtain the device s natural periods refer to section 4 the input parameters such as time step simulation time wave conditions geometric and material properties of each body are also defined in the matlab wec sim input file each block is represented internally with an eom coupled with other blocks containing their respective dynamic equations 3 3 wave characteristics and bfwec power two indian seas the arabian sea and bay of bengal are the locations of interest whose typical annual mean wave periods t m vary from 4s to 10 s with a significant wave height h s of 0 1m 4m shallow to ultra deep waters esso 2019 while the wave basin at iit madras has a maximum capability of generating h 0 3m and t 3s in regular wave and h s 0 25m and peak period t p of 2 4s in irregular waves in the literature the research on wave energy conversion technologies related to the indian sea states is scarce and there is a need to bridge this gap therefore the wec model scale was chosen to be 1 10 to represent the scaled wave characteristics of shallow intermediate waters of the bay of bengal whose average t m 5s and h s 2m the scaled values estimated are under the operational conditions in line with the capacity of the wave basin at iitm where future studies can be conducted bearing h s and t m of 0 2m and 1 58s the wave power matrix for chosen wave heights and wave periods is given in fig 5 where each pixel represents the wave power in w m supported by the intensity bar since regular waves are the focus of the present study the scaled wave parameters would be a wave height h 0 2m and wave period t 1 58s the wave power is estimated using the deepwater approximation while estimating the wave length whose equations are standard and not explicitly included in the present study the power absorbed p l d w e c by the relative motion of floats and the cb with linear damping can be represented as p l d w e c f l p t o z n z i c l p t o z n z i 2 c r p t o ω n ω i 2 2a where c r p t o is the rotational damping coefficient n m s r a d z n z i is relative heave motion net heave and ω n ω i is the relative angular velocity relative pitch motion between floats and cb therefore the linear damping coefficient c l p t o n s m o r k g s can be represented in terms of rotational damping applied at the hinge as 2b c l p t o c r p t o ω n ω i 2 z n z i 2 the corresponding time average power per float p a is 2c p l d w e c p a 1 t 0 t p l d w e c d t the performance of the device is indicated by the capture width ratio cwr and is give as follows 3 c w r l b l e f f the absorption length l b 4 l b p l d w e c p r w the theoretical maximum absorption length in heave is l 2 π where l is the incident wave length from the literature babarit 2015 the effective length l e f f for dominant heave devices is given by 5 l e f f 4 a h π where a h is the maximum cross sectional area viz the product of diameter of the float and the projected width of the respective float 4 results and discussions the three layouts of bfwec described in the above section consist of 4 6 and 8 respectively which have considered complete float sets and are represented as a3 b4 and c5 since all the layouts undergo multi body interactions it is important to study the number of floats in each layout from one layout to another the float s size is reduced to accommodate more number of floats however in each layout how the float influences the overall performance compared to one or more floats against a3 b4 and c5 is also essential to study thus additional cases are established in each layout and their illustration is given in fig 6 a combination of the terms f a b c will be used as a nomenclature to represent specific float sets in the coming discussions for example f3 a3 represents the float f 3 float of the a3 set referring to fig 6 it is necessary to note that the float f 3 remains as the front float for bfwec 4 f4 for bfwec 6 and f5 for bfwec 8 respectively in the case of bfwec 4 under 0 wave heading one of the two floats f2 or f4 is chosen to represent due to the symmetry about xy plane a nomenclature f24 or f2 4 is used to represent it similarly for the layouts bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 one float in each set f2 or f6 f3 or f5 and f2 or f8 f4 or f6 are chosen respectively 4 1 frequency domain analysis the cad model of the entire system is established in the ansys aqwa design module subsequently using the boundary element method bem and under the linear potential wave theory assumptions the entire system s frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients are estimated in the aqwa diffraction radiation module the hydrodynamic interactions of all the bodies present in the system are taken into account as one body s motion will affect the other as mentioned above 4 1 1 hydrodynamic coefficients frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients estimated in frequency domain using bem are the building blocks for the time domain model of corresponding bfwec layouts or their respective cases the appropriately scaled hydrodynamic characteristics of bfwec and the effect of the number of floats around cb are illustrated in figs 7 9 excitation force variation over the chosen frequency band for all the cases and layouts are given in fig 7 none of the cases have exact variation and there seems to be a significant heave heave coupling between the floats the effect increases with more floats viz from bfwec 4 to bfwec 8 and in their cases viz isolated single float a1 b1 c1 to all floats a3 b4 c5 the excitation force is the function of size shape orientation and position chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e due to their highest exposure front facing floats have maximum variation across the band followed by the other floats f 3 f 3 5 f 5 of the three layouts have maximum values in the resonant frequency band of 4 rad s to 6 rad s further as the layouts are symmetric if the wave direction is changed to 90 f 4 f5 6 and f 7 of bfwec 4 6 and 8 act as front facing floats respectively and have maximum excitation force due to the change in the orientation and floats exposure regarding the change in the incident wave direction the excitation force variation is reducing with the reduction of float size as shown in fig 7 the variation in isolated float in all layouts is much lower than the front float in other cases increasing the floats number layout for example in bfwec 8 f5 c5 has a higher excitation force than f5 c1 2 3 and 4 further the oscillations across the frequency band are higher with the increase in the float s number it can be observed clearly from fig 7 inferring the dependency of excitation force on the multi body interactions interference effects the highest peak and subsequent peaks mostly occur in the range of 4 rad s 6 rad s which is the resonant band of bfwec due to the increase in the number of floats the net excitation force of bfwec is improved which is directly related to the absorbed power since it is directly proportional to the square of excitation force therefore the total absorbed power can be higher in the case of bfwec 8 however it also depends on the other two hydrodynamic coefficients such as frequency dependent radiation damping and added mass the scaled radiation resistance is shown in fig 8 for all three layouts and their cases the radiation resistance and added mass are not dependent on the orientation position and incident wave direction unlike the excitation force but solely on the floats geometry therefore one float can represent the whole layout fig 8 shows the front float of cases in each layout the radiation resistance or the damping variation significantly higher than the isolated float a1 b1 c1 and partial float cases a2 b2 b3 c1 c2 c3 with a maximum in the resonance band 4 rad s 6rad s in bfwec 4 the peaks extend to lower and higher frequencies for bfwec 8 and bfwec 6 respectively the isolated float variation is comparatively smooth indicating no cross float coupling and the response only depends on its motion besides cb while for complete float cases a3 b4 and c5 there is a strong coupling between the floats viz the strength of i 1 n c f j f i i j would be significant than besides its own c f i f i source which the next sections can confirm through the corresponding impulse response function computation the multi body interactions generate the so called sloshing or pumping phenomena predominant near the resonance and fade away extreme and lower frequencies the oscillations are higher in bfwec 8 than others and the total resistance is minimum in bfwec 8 and highest in bfwec 6 from the frequency domain analysis the optimum value of pto damping c o p t t is obtained theoretically by equating frequency dependent average power absorption as a function of pto damping to zero cargo et al 2011 6 c o p t t c r ω 2 ω m a m ω ρ g a w ω 2 where m is the dry mass and a w is the mean waterplane area of floats a m c r are frequency dependent added mass and radiation damping coefficient of floats respectively obtained from aqwa bem similarly the added mass variation is dependent on the geometry as seen in fig 9 the oscillations and coupling of floats in heave motion a f j f i increase with an increase in floats number in the resonance band the added inertia due to the acceleration of fluid particles in the vicinity of floats is higher and can be observed in oscillations across the frequency band neglecting the effect of the body to body interaction while computing the frequency dependent hydrodynamic coefficients will not capture the possible coupling modes as seen in a1 b1 and c1 where the response is smooth with minimum to negligible oscillation with influence only from cb 4 1 2 q f factor the average absorbed power of all layouts is estimated for isolated and all floats cases the interaction factor based on the eom in frequency domain q f factor is computed for all three layouts and the values are given in the table 2 the generic representation of the float interaction factor irrespective of modeling domain is q q f is the frequency domain representation and q t is the time domain representation and is given by 7 q p n n p i 8 p n o r p i 1 t 0 t p l d w e c d t 1 2 ω 2 c r p t o z ω 2 where n 4 6 and 8 for bfwec 4 6 and 8 is the total number of isolated floats per layout ω is the wave frequency and z ω is the complex amplitude in heave whose detailed formulation is given in chandrasekaran and sricharan 2020a b c d e a study on the same model the numerator of the q factor considers the interaction effects while the p i in the denominator represents the isolated average power of a single float for wave incident direction β 0 in a bfwec layout p n is the total average absorbed power estimated either in the frequency or time domain for layouts accounting for multi body interactions q 1 usually indicates shadowing effects dependent on the layout and the number of floats interacting the average q f value from table 2 indicates that out of all layouts bfwec 6 has a value of 1 06 greater than one compared to the other two which are 0 93 and 0 83 for bfwec 4 and 8 respectively it indicates better power absorption in six float layouts followed by bfwec 4 with the least absorption or highest shadowing effect in bfwec 8 larger gaps between the floats in all layouts may improve the interaction factor however the number of floats will be compromised resulting in reduced total power absorption for q f 1 though p n is less than that of total isolated absorbed power due to the inevitable interactions the total absorbed power increases for a higher number of floats frigaard et al 2016 however in the present study though the number of floats increases from bfwec 4 to bfwec 8 the float s size varies the number of floats in the layout and the price of floats manufacturing are always the trade off parameters which need to be considered from the practical perspective in general the literature suggests that the higher number of floats may be more economical than fewer floats due to mass production which is not proven in the present study frigaard et al 2016 the variation of q f for all layouts against the wave period is illustrated in fig 10 along with the q t estimated based on the time domain as observed in the frequency domain formulation section the absorbed power is independent of the wave height and only depends on the wave period fig 10 clearly shows the variation with the change in the wave period the factor also depends on the incident wave direction but the layouts are symmetric and therefore directionally insensitive so the wave direction importance is ignored in the present study q f shows the maximum value at 1 7s for bfwec 4 and at 1 9s for bfwec 6 and 8 with a secondary peak at 1 3s the overall variation in bfwec 6 is dominant across the wave periods than the other two layouts the average optimal linear c a o p t pto damping coefficient per float in the frequency domain which results in the maximum absorbed power is given in table 2 along with the isolated float s average optimal damping coefficient c a o p t i the optimal pto damping is directly proportional in the present study with the float s size and reduced with the float s size the isolated float s value also shows a similar trend but slightly less than the interacting float s value showing the influence of multi body interactions on pto damping however the factor needs to be plotted by time domain simulations for much accuracy computed in the next section 4 2 time domain analysis the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients in the frequency domain of aqwa using bem are converted into time domain variables based on the cummins equation first the stability characteristics besides the hydrodynamic coefficients are transferred to wec sim from aqwa in lis and ah1 file former file stores output using structured query report sqr in a programming language and the later file stores the entire system s hydrodynamic database in ascii format together combined and complied by the boundary element input output bemio function of wec sim pre processing the aqwa data estimates impulse response functions and saves the resultant outcome in hierarchical data format 5 hdf5 or simply h5 as the study mainly deals with the multi body interactions the convolution integral computation is challenging and the method to compute them needs to be carefully chosen the wec sim blocks shown in fig 4 run in the simulink framework by communicating with the matlab wec sim input commands 4 3 impulse response function free decay response and rao while solving the motion response of the bfwec accounting for incident waves induced excitation forces and bodies induced radiation forces using cummins equation convolution terms representing excitation and radiation forces are present they are complicated to solve especially for the radiation force besides other external forces such as pto and mooring systems exist the radiation forces are termed and referred to as a memory effect de andrés et al 2013 as defined in eq 1a and eq 1b there are three popular methods to compute the convolution integral standard irf method state space ss representation and prony s method armesto et al 2015 the present study computed the convolution terms using the irf method and compared them with the ss method where the time domain raos computed using these are assessed fig 11 shows the radiation convolution integral of the floats in bfwec 4 6 8 computed using irf the fluctuations in fig 11 are due to the multi body oscillations increasing the number of floats in each layout for example in bfwec 4 a1 which has a single float tends to die down quickly it is represented in blue in contrast to a2 and a3 where the float number has increased from unity the a1 oscillations are negligible after 10s whereas a2 and a3 die down in the band of 15 20s with the highest and longer oscillations encountered in a3 similarly for the other two layouts it is attributed to fluid sloshing between the adjacent floats lewandowski 2008 armesto et al 2015 in other words they are lightly damped and the effect of memory of initial conditions is still there for more than 30s of all layouts bfwec 6 has a stronger influence due to its six floats interaction and thus the irf is to be computed till the response dies down and every time step of the simulations therefore it is time consuming compared to the alternative approach where the convolution integral is computed by representing the bfwec using the state space model the 2nd order differential equation of motion of bfwec is converted to 2 linear algebraic equations duarte et al 2013 fig 12 illustrates the comparison of radiation convolution integral computed using irf and ss of three layouts with all floats in action it is clear from fig 12 that the initial response is higher in the case of ss and the memory effect is dying down quickly compared to irf in bfwec 4 and 8 however in bfwec 6 the response is quite similar to the maximum initial response with irf it infers that the irfs are representing the convolution term accurately despite computationally expensive complementing this the heave degree raos illustrated in fig 13 show that the eom solved using the ss radiation method overestimates the response of most of the floats irrespective of the layout certainly at the resonance period and its vicinity where the peaks in the response are observed for longer periods the rao is closely matched irrespective of the radiation force computation method the representation of radiation damping with a constant coefficient at a certain frequency as in the case of frequency domain instead of convolution integral is way too inefficient in the presence of multi float interactions and is out of the contest in the present study the memory time or the convolution time is set to 30s in bfwec 4 8 in comparison 35s for bfwec 6 and irf method is implemented for better representation of multi body memory effects since the natural periods of floats in all the layouts are designed more or less the same the peaks are observed near 1 3s precisely at 1 5s in the rao of three layouts besides due to the interactions of multiple floats other periods are also provoked such as 1 3s and 1 9s for different floats which varied for different floats in each layout depending on its position around cb irrespective of the layout the maximum rao is observed in the front float for example at 0 side floats f 2 and f 4 are perpendicular to the wavefront in the case of bfwec 4 they seem to have performed poorly in shorter waves as the wavelength of the passing wave is less than the length of these floats there will always be a crest beneath the perpendicularly orientated with the f2 and f4 floats therefore they will not oscillate in heave mode as the float size reduces with the increase in the float number from bfwec 4 to 8 floats f 3 and f 7 in bfwec 8 despite being perpendicular to the incident wavefront performed reasonably well unlike these two layouts in bfwec 6 there is no perpendicular float as the floats number increase the wavy pattern in the oscillations seems to increase with a maximum rao of 2 45 m m f 3 2 2 m m f 3 5 and 2 6 m m f 5 in bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively further in fig 14 the rao of isolated single float layouts and front float of complete float set layouts are compared it can be observed that front floats of all floats cases of bfwec 4 6 and 8 are dominant for most of the wave periods including the heave resonance period over their counterparts viz isolated front floats thus multiple floats presence shows a better response in terms of maximum peak rao and peak activation at multiple wave periods compared to the single float where the peak is only seen at 1 5s the excitation force is also a convolution term given in eq 1a and eq 1b which is solved before the simulation subject to the availability of the future wave data in the numerical simulations the computation of excitation convolution integral in all six degrees in the time domain is executed over a given simulation time lemmer et al 2016 the incident wave s spectral data is utilized to introduce random phase or single frequency wave characteristics for regular waves lemmer et al 2016 the non causal excitation irf of the floats for three layouts is illustrated in fig 15 it can be observed that the impulse response depends on the float position or their orientation thus the front float is first exerted by the effect generated by the future incident wave which will hit the centroid in a few moments followed by the other floats hence in all layouts the front float s response is highest the response of floats depends on the number of floats present in the entire system for example in bfwec 4 the front float response for a1 a2 a3 is varied and the oscillations die down on the positive time frame quickly with lesser floats however there is a significant disturbance observed in the negative time frame for front float isolated f3 a1refereing to the significant arrival of force on it before the wave elevation compared to the other cases and layouts the maximum value of the impulse response is highest in four float layouts and reduces with the float s size since the wetted area hence the wetted volume is reduced before the simulations the free decay test is conducted for the layouts and the response is illustrated in fig 16 the response is compared with the isolated float in all the layouts the isolated floats decay quickly from the floats in the complete float set a3 b4 and c5 it is directly related to the memory effect response these both have exhibited a pure heave heave coupling between the floats such that the memory effect is strong influences floats response to a longer time frame the response of isolated floats with the total float set case matches about 5s in the first two layouts and 2s in the last layout the response a3 b4 and c5 has multiple decays not commonly observed from a standard decay test with complete exponential decay as one float is displaced by an external force initially free oscillation it oscillates and generates the waves radiating thereby losing its momentum as indicated till 6 s however the oscillation and associated radiated wave during 0 6 s have subsequently affected the adjacent waves and cb activating their motion the adjacent floats gain some momentum and transfer some amount back to the initially displaced float as a result the second decay phase has begun will increase in the amplitude compared to the previous time instant and less compared to the initial displacement over time even this gets dissipated however this has taken a long time compared to the first decay phase the natural period in heave is estimated to be 1 3s for all the floats in all layouts 4 3 1 optimal pto damping and q t factor in the present section the optimal damping is estimated and the variations of absorbed power under all wave conditions are assessed for the linear time domain model in regular waves wave height wave period and float number are four critical variables besides c r p t o which influences the absorbed power and capture width ratio of wec for every incident wave characteristic the optimal pto damping required to maximize the absorbed power or cwr must be estimated to understand the device s maximum performance however its evaluation is tricky since there are the variables mentioned above wave conditions wave height period and direction and c r p t o will influence the cwr and absorbed power trends in different ways for different combinations initially each float s absorbed power for all wave conditions is estimated for the wide range of damping coefficients the optimal pto damping for each float is obtained for which the absorbed power is estimated to have maximum the influence of c r p t o on absorbed power can be understood from fig 17 a and b where the variation of absorbed power for all wave periods in bfwec 8 for a wave height of 0 2 m is illustrated the values absorbed power are increasing with the increase in the c r p t o for all wave periods across all layouts they reach a maximum value at a specific damping coefficient and reduce after that the corresponding damping at which a maximum absorbed power is referred to as optimal pto damping c o p t further the variation of absorbed power is sensitive to wave periods and for each wave period the value of c o p t is different and its value is shifting towards higher damping coefficients in other words longer wave periods require higher optimal damping values irrespective of the layout for f 1 the absorbed power is maximum at 1 7s and 1 9s moderate for longer periods and minimum for shorter periods while set f 2 8 f 3 7 and f 4 6 show a similar trend throughout the damping range for f 2 8 the absorbed power is lowest or relatively negligible for shorter periods below 1 7s and higher for above 1 5s and the difference is maximum with a maximum value at 1 9s set f 3 7 absorb effectively for longer wave periods as shown in fig 17a and b lowest at 1 3s and moderate for intermediate wave periods similarly set f 4 6 absorbs well for periods above 1 7s and comparatively reasonable for f 2 8 however there are some discrepancies in the maximum value of some of these sets nevertheless the trends are the same similarly the absorbed power variations with the pto damping were estimated for other wave heights as well and the optimal damping values were found the absorbed power also a function of wave height as shown in fig 18 from the absorbed power variation of f 3 in bfwec 4 for all wave heights it can be observed that the absorbed power increases with the increase in wave height nevertheless the optimal damping value and the variation concerning the wave period remain unchanged f 3 has the maximum absorption ability near the resonance period t 1 5s and lower for periods above it fig 19 illustrates optimum damping for individual floats for various wave periods for three layouts in the form of matrices each pixel represents the pto damping coefficient with a bar on the side showing the intensity magnitude in colors it can be observed that c o p t dependent wave periods clearly but not with the wave height as expected and discussed in the frequency domain the optimal damping required by the floats in bfwec 8 lower than bfwec 4 for both bfwec 4 and 8 the c o p t is increasing with the wave period as observed in fig 19 variations for all the floats however this trend seems true for bfwec 6 as well as expect at 1 1s precisely the farther floats require higher damping to absorb effectively in this case as the wave direction is 0 the farther floats are f 1 f 2 and f 6 the requirement of the damping however relaxed for later periods the average c o p t across the waves periods range from 3300 to 4000 n s m r a d 3200 3500 n s m r a d and 2500 2900 n s m r a d for the floats in bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively these values are certainly higher compared to the frequency domain estimated values where it has underestimated the corresponding cwr matrix for individual floats against wave periods is shown in fig 20 for all layouts bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 have a maximum cwr of 132 with the same lower limit at 5 at the same time bfwec 6 has a maximum of 100 and a minimum limit of 5 similar to the other two cwr of each float across the layouts is sensitive to wave periods and there is seems to have fluctuations across the band high intensity pixels are observed for the front facing floats in the layouts and the number of such pixels tends to spread from 1 1s to 1 5s also the cwr of all the floats has its peak within 1 1s 1 7s which reduces subsequently though the cwr limits shown by the color bars of bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 are the same the number of pixels with a cwr value above 40 is higher in bfwec 8 due to a higher number of floats participation an important factor representing interference effects in the time domain q t factor is computed from the estimated absorbed power of all the floats in their respective layouts against the isolated single float cases at the optimal pto damping values table 3 gives the average absorbed power and optimal pto damping coefficients for isolated cases of three layouts q t is maximum for bfwec 6 and minimum for bfwec 4 see fig 10 the variations have peaks of 1 3s and 1 9s however the bfwec 4 and bfwec 8 exhibit shadow effects till 1 7s with positive interference at 1 9s and reduces after that while bfwec 6 has a maximum shadowing effect at 1 5s at the resonance similar to the other layouts and the values computed in frequency domain dashed lines for most of the wave periods the variation of q t is higher than q f thus time domain simulations better represent both the shadow and peak positive interference effects while frequency domain seems to underestimate them the average q t the three layouts are estimated as 0 879 1 and 0 947 respectively close to the values estimated in the frequency domain both q t and q t found common ground for bfwec 6 while varying in the other two layouts 4 3 2 response time history total average absorbed power and total cwr the absorbed power and cwr of each float at the c o p t identified for all the layouts is estimated and their total summation accounting all floats per layout is given in terms of total average absorbed power p t a and cwr matrices see fig 21 and fig 22 as observed p t a is highly dependent on wave heights and periods with maximum value h 0 2m and t 2 3s in all layouts bfwec 4 bfwec 6 absorb a maximum of 185w 219w and 246w and bfwec 8 respectively while the bar indicator shows the lowest value of 60w 45w and 66w for the three layouts the variation of p t a bfwec 4 and 8 show their first peak values at 1 5s while bfwec 6 at 1 3s increases with the wave period until a certain value reduces after that and increases for longer periods also pixels across the wave heights above 1 7s in bfwec 6 and bfwec 8 have intensities above 150w or closer unlike bfwec 4 where high intensity pixels are limited to a few the floats irrespective of layouts absorb effectively for moderate to long periods fig 22 illustrates the total cwr matrices and it is clear that it is insensitive to the wave heights as represented by the same color band while varying with the wave periods in all layouts the variation of total cwr unlike p t a is minimum of longer periods while maximum at resonant periods the total conversion of wave energy is maximum in bfwec 8 with a value of 262 followed by bfwec 4 with a value of 168 and least in bfwec 6 with a value of 150 unlike p t a variation for bfwec 4 the conversion ratio is higher in shorter periods till 1 5s and lowest or nearly the same at 80 thereafter the lower limit of the total cwr is 80 119 and 146 for bfwec 4 6 and 8 respectively bfwec 8 has higher power absorption and cwr than others across the wave heights and periods despite lower interaction as the number of the float increases the number of pixels variation increases which is an aspect for any wec to perform effectively for more than one wave period or natural period the response time history of all the floats in all three layouts is illustrated in fig 23 along with the absorbed power history at t 1 5s and h 0 2m the time history is plotted for an c o p t of 4 k n m s r a d 3 k n m s r a d and 2 5 k n m s r a d for the three layouts respectively a3 b4 and c5 the average damping coefficients across all the floats and the wave periods for bfwec 4 and bfwec 6 the front float s heave f3 and f 5 is close to the wave elevation at 1 5s resulting from fig 22 cwr is maximum at 1 5s is the absorbed power time history in all the cases cb s response is suppressed due to the presence of taut mooring there is a greater phase difference between the floats and cb than the floats mutual difference which is desirable if both floats and cb have zero phase difference the net heave response is suppressed while in the present scenario pre tension tethers make the heave pitch and roll degrees stiff ensuring the lower response it is clear from the power time history that the front floats have the lion s share in the total power absorption in all the cases the contribution thus reduces as we move towards the rare end of the bfwec though the cwr is calculated using undisturbed incident wave power due to the floats circumferential arrangement the waves transmitting through the front end floats will get disturbed and the wave power should ideally be estimated at the center of gravity of that particular floats it might further improve the cwr of the rear floats since the wave power is instantaneous and would be lower than that of the undisturbed incident wave before hitting the device 4 4 bfwec s footprint on the wave force regime in this section the authors have mapped the trace of various bfwec layouts on wave force regimes to extract possible technical insights that might help choose the number of floats during the design and modeling stage bfwec model with floats varying from 3 to 10 in steps of one including the above discussed layouts are considered to estimate the scattering parameter π l e f f l and a keulegan carpenter or kc number h l e f f the natural period of floats in each layout 3 10 in heave is maintained to be more or less around 1 3 s by choosing and adjusting appropriate mass and hydrostatic stiffness it will not only ensure model similarity but also allows hydrodynamic comparisons to plot these wecs on force regimes low to extreme amplitudes and moderate to larger wave periods sets have been chosen h t 0 2 m 1 8 s 0 4 m 2 2 s 0 6 m 2 4 s 0 8 m 2 6 s the wave force regime adopted from chakrabarti 1979 shows the contributions of inertia drag and diffraction forces on a body in water with two governing parameters known as scattering ratio and kc number for the considered wave sets these two parameters are estimated for all layouts and summarized in table 4 to evaluate the dominance of various regimes by counting the footprints of each wec for example bfwec 4 6 8 and 10 patterns have been traced in fig 24 as the number of floats increases the pattern is shifting toward regime iii which has a slight influence of drag which is quantified in table 3 it is important to note that when we estimate and trace the wecs for shorter wave periods the entire cluster of wec traces shifts towards regime iii though an increase in float number increases the average power output it increases drag forces influence theoretically it can be much more significant in practice due to the discrepancies in fabrication and actual wave interactions it might reduce the average power output difference between the bfwec 4 which is fairly out of drag regime higher layouts bfwec 6 and 8 which seemed better than the former though this gives a first hand insight into the influence of the number of floats interacting in each bfwec layout incorporating nonlinearities and actual power take off will give a complete understanding of this problem future work includes a detailed study of varying floats in random waves and weakly nonlinear time domain analysis 4 5 bfwec s economic assessment the economic performance of the proposed bfwec with its layouts is discussed by incorporating the estimates of capital expenditure capex operational expenditure opex an indicator such as levelized cost of electricity lcoe capex is the total initial capital invested in the project including design development wec structure power take off pto mooring material pre assembly transport control safety and installation at the site in comparison opex deals with the operations maintenance costs of the wec throughout its lifetime lcoe represents the minimal price paid for the generated power from the device to finance the project cost it is a widely used indicator in the power generation industry allowing various marine energy convertors performance according to de andres et al 2015 lcoe is defined as the ratio of total annualized costs comprising of capex and opex to the total energy generated by the wec annual energy production aep borgarino et al 2012 babarit 2015 chen et al 2018 to the grid throughout its operational life mathematically lcoe is represented as de andres et al 2016 9 l c o e c a p e x t 1 n o p e x t 1 r t t 1 n a e p t 1 r t while calculating lcoe the discount rate r is accounted for over the lifetime of the device n t is any year of interest in the lifetime a annual energy production aep aep is calculated by multiplying the probability of occurrence in terms of annual availability of the sea state with the bfwec s power matrix since the device is designed and developed based on indian sea states a total of eleven sea states ss in the arabian sea as and eight sea states of bay of bengal bob of indian cost are considered for lcoe calculations along with the probability of its occurrence the wave data is taken from the popular data bank on wave energy resource assessment for the indian shelf seas contributed by kumar and anoop the annual average wave power is relatively higher in as 12 kw m than that of bob with the lowest at the southeast coast tip of india due to the presence of sri lanka the data is segregated into tables 5 a 5c representing the percentage of time the wave power is available annually at various sea states considered in as for three categories of wave power 5 kw m 5 10 kw m and 10 kw m respectively the assumption is made by considering the same annual availability values for the scaled wave parameters 1 10 while tables 6 a 6c represent the percentage of time the wave power is available annually at various sea states considered in bob for three categories of wave power 5 kw m 5 10 kw m and 10 kw m respectively tap is the total absorbed power of bfwec as represented by fig 21 for three layouts η 1 accounts for the conversion of mechanical to electricity electric efficiency while η 2 and η 3 represent losses due to device availability considered to be 95 and transmission efficiency 98 respectively η 1 is considered from work on bfwec with hydraulic pto conducted by sricharan and chandrasekaran 2021 η 1 of 77 75 5 and 75 125 are considered for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively which are the average electric efficiencies the aep of all bfwec layouts estimated in kwy h is shown in fig 25 for as and fig 26 for bob the bar diagrams in figs 25 and 26 indicate that aep values are proportional to the tap shown in fig 21 with an increase in the performance with the increase in the number of floats aep also increases with the increase in the wave power with superior performance and poor performance for wave power greater than 10 kw m and less than 5 kw m respectively aep is consistent across all the sea states in fig 25 for wave power greater than 10 kw m in contrast for bob fig 26 the trend for all the layouts is inconsistent with lower estimates till ss 4 in calculating lcoe certain inevitable assumptions are considered by referring to the literature de andres et al 2016 i all the calculations are made for a single scaled model 1 10 not a wave farm ii opex is calculated as a percentage of the capex 8 iii a discount rate of 8 has been chosen for the study iv a growth rate in opex of 2 is considered v the same level of availability of 95 has been taken for all the locations sea states both as and bob included vi a lifetime of bfwec is considered to be 20 years and vii same capex 4729 usd or opex 378 usd or per year are considered for all the three layouts further the price estimates are considered from the experiments conducted at iit madras the cost is represented in usd with an india rupee to us dollar conversion ratio of 74 1usd 74 indian rupees a sample calculation of all the parameters is given in table 7 the lcoe for as and bob is shown in fig 27 for all the bfwec layouts in the lcoe calculations aep of three levels of wave power 5 5 10 and 10 kw m are combined algebraic summation net aep for each sea state of as and bob though the sample calculations are shown for eight years in table 7 the final estimates indicated in table 7 and the section results are for the complete lifetime of the bfwec 20 y fig 27 shows the lcoe trends of bfwec 4 6 8 across the arabian sea and bay of bengal overall lcoe is relatively lower for all the layouts in the sea states of the arabian sea due to higher wave power densities compared to the sea states of the bay of bengal further an increase in the number of floats in bfwec significantly influenced lcoe the lcoe estimates are higher for bfwec 4 which reduces as we move towards the tip of the western shelf arabian sea from ss1 to ss11 however the lcoe trend for bfwec 6 8 in the arabian sea remains more or less the same with the values significantly less 2 kwh than that of bfwec 4 average lcoe estimates across all the sea states of as are 8 70 kwh 1 36 kwh and 1 23 kwh for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively while in the bay of bengal the eastern shelf of india coast lcoe estimates shoot up with a maximum value crossing 22 kwh for bfwec 4 lcoe trend similar to as remains more or less the same for bob average lcoe estimates across all the sea states of bobare 6 17 kwh 4 33 kwh and 3 81 kwh for bfwec 4 6 8 respectively though the maximum lcoe of bfwec 4 in bob is significantly higher almost double than as the average lcoe across all the sea states in bob is less than as with a significant drop in lcoe beyond ss1 of bob in comparison the lcoe trend of bfwec 4 in as is zig zag till ss8 and reduces after that the lcoe values calculated are higher than the normal trend observed in the literature de andres et al 2015 which usually lie somewhere around 0 25 2 3 kwh one reason is that the present study is conducted on a single bfwec device irrespective of the number of floats present whereas the literature estimates generally consider the calculations for the wec arrays which have proven economical further the present bfwec model does not consider any active control systems to improve the capture ratio and the overall power absorption of the device which also contributes to the higher lcoe values for the indian sea states therefore either bfwec 6 or 8 can be considered ideal for indian sea states with more significant benefit for the deployments in all the sea states of the arabian sea and sea states beyond four ss4 in the case of the bay of bengal 5 conclusions using wec sim a novel floating wave energy converter is developed and analyzed based on the linear time domain principle three bfwec layouts are proposed in the study with 4 6 and 8 bean shaped floats that extract energy by moving relative to the cb the hydrodynamic data from the aqwa bem software is a basic building block for formulating and modeling the device in wec sim all the components are logically interconnected to enable the multi body interactions in the matlab simscapefluids toolbox the device is assessed to influence a range of damping coefficients using a linear damper to absorb maximum energy the optimum pto damping reinforcing the optimum amplitude of the floats in each layout is applied across the bfwec s operating bandwidth of frequencies the wave float interference effects were then evaluated using the q factor the present study is observed to have the following advantages the presence of multiple bodies has led to more power due to the increased net excitation force the interactions between these bodies have activated the device to respond with multiple resonating frequencies capturing power in a wide range of sea states multiple floats multi body around the cb have improved overall performance and reduced the chance of complete shutdown of the energy production even with any particular float malfunctioning the proposed bean shaped floats and their arrangement around the cb make the device novel it also enabled the device to extract a larger excitation force which better radiating capabilities the radiation convolution integral is computed using both irf and ss the multi body interactions are accurately captured by irf which can be observed in convolution response and the rao also the memory effect is significant in the complete floats sets compared to the isolated floats across the layouts the theoretically obtained optimum linear damping values slightly under estimates the numerically obtained optimum pto damping values the optimal damping is sensitive only with the wave period and float position and reduces the float s size the trends of q t and q f computed are similar to maximum positive interference in bfwec 6 however the maximum shadow effect is exhibited by bfwec 4 in the time domain and bfwec 8 in the frequency domain the study showed a better interpretation of the total average power absorption and total average cwr for many floats around the cb the object oriented wec sim tool makes wec devices much smoother to customize the open source code simulation processing time and cost with sufficient and acceptable accuracy hence it is an ideal tool to model and assess oscillating wec concepts like the current device the device s overall performance can be further improved by choosing a pto and tuning it to the dominant frequency range for indian sea states bfwec s economic assessment has been carried out with aep and lcoe estimates for all three layouts in both the arabian sea and the bay of bengal lower lcoe trends are observed with the increase in the number of floats with the lowest lcoe observed to be 0 88 kwh in the arabian sea all the sea states in the arabian sea are recommended for the deployment of bfwec 6 8 in comparison sea states from ss5 to ss8 in the bay of bengal are recommended declaration of
