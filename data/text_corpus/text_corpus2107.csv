10535,the utilization of water resources and water security in central asia are critical to the stability of the region this paper assesses the water security of the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan by using the projection pursuit model based on particle swarm optimization pso pee the results show that the average annual water consumption in central asia is about 1255 57 108 m3 and the proportion of agricultural water consumption decreased due in large part to the changes of crop planting structure for the ecological security kazakhstan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have improved their status but turkmenistan is getting worse for the quantity security of water resources tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are relatively safe whereas uzbekistan is at risk for the socio economic conditions kazakhstan scored the highest while tajikistan and uzbekistan scored the lowest water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp across all five countries is relatively high but shows a significant decreasing trend for the water supply and demand security the status of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are better than that of turkmenistan and uzbekistan kazakhstan has achieved a relatively safe level level ⅱ and the degree of water security is high kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan are only in the basically safe level level iii uzbekistan is under significant pressure with regard to water security level iv which indicates that the country needs to strictly control population growth and strengthen the comprehensive management of water resources keywords water resources water security pso pee model central asia 1 introduction water security refers to the acceptable level of water related risks that can meet the living environment and economic development needs of human society while supporting national security human health and ecosystem services bakker 2012 with the growing shortage of global water resources increasing frequency of extreme climate disasters and major issues around water pollution the utilization and protection of water resources and water security have become urgent and serious challenges for human garfin et al 2016 grey and sadoff 2007 vörösmarty et al 2010 the united nations security council sees water as one of the most important security issues in the world and suggests that water security is a necessary condition for achieving social well being and economic development in the past water security studies have mainly focused on the north america south southeast asia east asia and oceania while less attention has been paid to the africa middle east and central asia gerlak et al 2018 following the collapse of the soviet union central asia has become a region of great concern because of its special geopolitical environment and numerous transboundary rivers water issues as well as water security and ecological issues related to water in central asia have now become the focus of attention in the world central asia is located in the center of the eurasian continent and belongs to an arid and semi arid region the management of water resources and the utilization of transboundary rivers are currently in constant dispute in upstream kyrgyzstan kgz tajikistan tjk and downstream kazakhstan kaz turkmenistan tkm and uzbekistan uzb o hara 2000 in fact the water problems arising from transboundary rivers have risen to the level of interregional water politics with the central asian region now facing severe challenges from the water security crisis karthe et al 2015 chen et al 2018 in view of these problems numerous scholars are carrying out studies and mainly focus on the response of water resources to climate change the water resources management of transboundary rivers and the watershed water environment akhtar et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 bekturganov et al 2016 for example chen et al 2017 2018 analyzed the impacts of climate change and human activities on the hydrological process and water resources of transboundary rivers in central asia proposing that global warming aggravates the frequency of extreme hydrological events and mismatched spatial distributions of water and land resources along with excessive human activities have all led to the water crisis in the region kai et al 2015 analyzed the current water security measures and future water security management challenges of the syr darya basin in central asia from the perspective of water supply and demand suggesting that public administration is the weakest link in water security management maja et al 2013 evaluated the vulnerability of wetland ecosystem in amu darya basin and tested the selection scheme of environmental flow under different climate scenarios in the future suggesting that the environmental flow should be incorporated into the water management system in addition water food energy security were also investigated in this region jalilov 2013 evaluated the development and distribution potential of water resources in various countries of the amu darya basin under different water supply modes in the future and assessed the economic benefits duan et al 2019 predicted the future agricultural water requirements and deficits crop yield and water productivity of turkmenistan under three different scenarios despite the wealth of data that emerged from these studies and the potential applications of their findings a comprehensive evaluation of water security in the five central asian countries has yet to be done in the present study the pso pee model integrates the theory of biological population evolution into the projection pursuit model particles make an efficient and intelligent global optimization in the process of establishing the assessment indicators system of water security and analyzing the four sub objectives that affect water security in this way a comprehensive assessment of water security in central asia is carried out the findings provide a scientific basis for a deeper understanding of water resources utilization and water security in central asia such an understanding will contribute both to regional sustainable development and the further construction of the one belt and one road 2 material and methods 2 1 data sources in this study data on water resources and regional socio

with the supply and demand system of water resources and be combined with the utilization characteristics of water in central asia the stochastic process of the water resources and changes in interannual water volume should also be considered ma et al 2009 therefore this study utilizes statistical mean data from 2010 to 2016 to find the appropriate assessment indicators system and classification standard data set for water security in the five central asian countries the system selects four criteria layers ecological security quantity security of water resources socio economic conditions and water supply and demand security as well as 16 indicator layers including 10 positive indicators and 6 negative indicators see tables 1 and 2 2 3 projection pursuit model based on particle swarm optimization pso pee projection pursuit model pee is an emerging mathematical method for turning high dimensional nonlinear problems into one dimensional ones via projection pursuit in the present work particle swarm optimization pso is used to find the best projection direction of the assessment indicators system in the model the optimal projection value is then found by the linear projection between the best projection direction and the evaluation indicators shi and eberhart 1998 friedman 2016 2 3 1 normalization of assessment indicators system to eliminate the dimension of assessment indicator value and unify the variation range for every indicator it is necessary to normalize each positive and negative indicator 1 f o r p o s i t i v e i n d i c a t o r s x i j x i j x m a x j 2 f o r n e g a t i v e i n d i c a t o r s x i j x m i n j x i j where x i j are the normalized sequence of assessment indicators x i j is the i th assessment indicator value of the i th sample and x min j with xmax j are the minimum and maximum values of the i th indicator fu et al 2002 2 3 2 establishment of projection indicator function the projection pursuit model integrates m dimensional data x i j j 1 2 m into one dimensional projection values let a be the unit projection direction vector of m dimension with components of a 1 a 2 am the one dimensional projection eigenvalue zi of xij is thus 3 z i j 1 m a j x i j i 1 n when integrating projection indicator values the inter class distance s z and intra class density d z of zi must be scattered in one dimensional space in order to obtain the maximum value simultaneously hence the expression of the objective function q a is 4 q a s z d z 5 s z i 1 n z i z 0 2 n 1 1 2 6 d z i 1 n k 1 n r r i j u r r i j where z 0 is the mean value of the projected eigenvalue zi the larger the value of s z the wider the sample dispersion r is the window radius of the local density and generally has a value of 0 1 s z r i j is the distance between samples and u t is the unit step function such that t r r i j when t 0 u t 1 and when t 0 u t 0 liu et al 2018 2 3 3 optimization of projection indicator function based on the particle swarm the optimal projection direction is determined by solving the maximization problem of the projection indicator function as shown below 7 maximization objective function q a s z d z 8 c o n s t r a i n t s j 1 p a 2 j 1 where the position of the i th i 1 2 n particle can be expressed as xi the speed is vi and the adaptation value is fi the best position the particle individual has experienced is denoted as pbesti t the best position the particle swarm has experienced is denoted as gbest t and two optimal values are determined at time of t 1 here the particles update their position and speed according to the following formulas 9 v t 1 wvi t c 1 b 1 t pbesti t si t c 2 b 2 t gbest t si t 10 si t 1 si t vi t 1 where w is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are constants called the learning factors and b 1 t and b 2 t are the uniformly distributed random functions between 0 1 the updating formulas for individual extremum of each particle and global extremum of all particles are as follows 11 p b e s t i t 1 x i t 1 f i t 1 f p b e s t i t p b e s t i t f i t 1 f p b e s t i t 12 gbest t 1 smax t 1 where fi t 1 is the best fitness value of particle i at time t 1 f pbesti t is the best fitness value for the history of particle i and smax t 1 is the particle position corresponding to the largest fpbesti t of all particles at t 1 time zhao et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the fitness value fi of each particle is determined by the actual optimization problem thus the optimization of the projection direction is as follows 1 the current particle position si t 1 is substituted into formula 3 to calculate the one dimensional projection value z i 2 s z and d z are then calculated according to formulas 5 and 6 and 3 the projection indicator function q a is calculated according to formula 4 which is the fitness value of particles fi t 1 note that when the difference between the fitness values of the optimal particle at t 1 time and t time is less than the set threshold or reaches the predetermined number of iterations gmax the operation of the algorithm ends at this point the global extreme value found by the particle swarm is the best projection direction a and the fitness value corresponding to the global extreme value is the optimal projection indicator function q a in this study the parameters of data set in modeling are set as follows the learning factor is c 1 c 2 1 4962 the inertia weight is w 0 99 the maximum number of iterations is 300 and the population size is n 200 fig 1 shows the optimizing processes of objective functions which reflect the relationship between the optimal maximum value of objective function and the number of iterations the faster the convergence speed of the model is the more accurate the results are as can be seen from fig 1 a the optimal objective function value of classification standard data 1 2055 is obtained after about 20 iterations indicating that the model has a fast convergence speed the best projection direction of the objective function is a 0 2621 0 2446 0 2524 0 2464 0 2551 0 2439 0 2543 0 2422 0 2460 0 2457 0 2465 0 2621 0 2537 0 2518 0 2475 0 2446 and the optimal projection values are q 3 9988 2 3659 0 9923 0 therefore the optimal projection value of the boundary point between water security levels ⅰ ii of the five central asian countries is q 1 3 9988 the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels ii iii is q 2 2 3659 the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels iii iv is q 3 0 9923 and the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels iv v is q 4 0 the optimizing process of the objective function of the assessment indicators data set is shown in fig 1 b it becomes stable after about 170 iterations the best projection direction of the objective function is a 0 19338 0 0021 0 3778 0 2006 0 0013 0 1705 0 0062 0 3485 0 3689 0 3643 0 2388 0 3290 0 3693 0 0007 0 17258 0 16991 and the maximum objective function value is 0 7310 the optimal projection values for the assessment indicators data set of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan are q 3 0575 1 9258 1 1106 1 1111 0 3714 respectively working on the precept that the higher the projection value the better the water security situation of the country 3 results the water security levels for all five central asian countries were obtained based on the projection values of assessment indicators data set and classification standard data set furthermore the optimal projection values comprehensive scores and ranking of the four sub target levels ecological security quantity security of water resources socio economic conditions and water supply and demand security were calculated using the same method the comprehensive assessment results are shown in table 3 3 1 assessment of ecological security central asia is vast and sparsely populated and more than 50 of the region is desert or semi desert fig 2 the results of the ecological security assessment of the five central asian countries are shown in table 3 as can be seen the comprehensive score for kazakhstan is the highest and that country s ecological security status is the best this is because kazakhstan has the highest grassland coverage 67 89 and grassland being one of the main land use types in central asia in recent years however the problem of shrub encroachment has become increasingly prominent grassland areas have decreased by 25 90 over the past three decades with about 8 of the grassland being converted into shrubs between 2000 and 2013 turkmenistan and uzbekistan show the most significant increase in shrub encroachment li et al 2015 the increase in shrubs usually changes the structure and function of ecosystems reducing biodiversity and accelerating land desertification the country with the highest ecological water use ratio is kazakhstan 64 35 followed by kyrgyzstan 43 18 and tajikistan 35 07 while turkmenistan and uzbekistan have the lowest ecological water use ratios of 21 08 and 19 35 respectively the percentage of forest coverage in central asia is generally low with the highest percentage 8 78 in turkmenistan and the lowest 1 23 in kazakhstan for the soil salinization area ratio the upstream countries tajikistan 3 13 and kyrgyzstan 5 00 are lower while the downstream agricultural countries uzbekistan 68 00 and turkmenistan 65 90 have higher soil salinization area ratios inefficient and outmoded agricultural irrigation methods combined with over use of pesticides and fertilizers are the main causes of soil salinization in central asia zhang et al 2018 3 2 assessment of the quantity security of water resources water is the most critical natural factor affecting economic development ecological security and social stability in the arid areas of central asia to date total water resources in the region have been relatively abundant about 1 944 90 108 m3 table 4 surface water resources are 1 739 60 108 m3 and account for 89 44 of the total while groundwater resources are only 627 50 108 m3 by considering the amount of entry and exit for each country we can see the amount of available water resources in central asia are 2 275 70 108 m3 however the spatial distribution of water resources is extremely uneven the total amount of water resources in kazakhstan is the largest 643 50 108 m3 accounting for 33 09 of all water resources in central asia followed by the upstream mountain countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan which account for 32 63 and 25 19 respectively these two countries are rich in water resources from glaciers and snow and are major water producers in central asia however the two downstream countries of uzbekistan and turkmenistan produce much less water and are situated far from any water sources mainly relying on inbound water resources to satisfy their economic demands according to the assessment results tajikistan has the highest comprehensive score 1 81 for the quantity security of water resources whereas uzbekistan has the lowest 0 14 the water yield modulus refers to the average amount of water resources produced per unit land area shi et al 2013 among the five central asian countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have the highest water yield modulus at 44 56 104 m3 km2 and 24 47 104 m3 km2 respectively which are much higher than the downstream countries the water yield modulus of turkmenistan is the lowest at only 0 29 104 m3 km2 turkmenistan is located in southwest central asia and features a relatively dry climate the karakum desert accounts for more than 80 of the territory and the available water resources of turkmenistan mainly come from transboundary rivers such as the amu darya river the murgabu river and the tedjen river water resources per capita are one of the most important indicators reflecting the shortage of water resources and the state of regional water security according to the internationally recognized water shortage standard per capita water resources of less than 3000 m3 are a sign of mild water shortage those less than 2000 m3 denote moderate water shortage those less than 1000 m3 indicate severe water shortage and those less than 500 m3 indicate extreme water shortage of the five central asian countries uzbekistan has the lowest water resources per capita 1870 m3 which categorizes it as having a moderate water shortage the other four countries rank higher in the water shortage standard with the water resources per capita in tajikistan being the highest at 13 500 m3 thus it can be seen that the contradiction of water resources in central asia is not a problem of water shortage but a problem of water resources allocation and utilization chen et al 2018 based on water resources per unit area tajikistan has the highest 15 50 104 m3 km2 followed by kyrgyzstan 11 81 104 m3 km2 although kazakhstan has the most abundant water resources in central asia it also has a vast land area and relatively small water resources per unit area 3 98 104 m3 km2 the utilization rate of water resource is also one of the key indicators reflecting the scarcity of water resources in general the higher the degree of development and utilization of water resources the greater the pressure on the water system and natural ecosystem qadir et al 2009 the internationally recognized safety threshold for water resources development is 40 among the central asian countries kazakhstan 19 74 and kyrgyzstan 31 05 all have low utilization rates while uzbekistan and turkmenistan have relatively high rates of up to 112 84 and 112 83 respectively of the five countries uzbekistan and turkmenistan consume the most water which is mainly used for irrigation of crops such as cotton rice and wheat moreover because the irrigation facilities in these countries are so old and the routes are so long about 50 of the water resources are evaporated and or leaked during transportation cai et al 2003 this means there is a considerable difference between water withdrawal and actual crop water consumption kai et al 2015 central asia s average annual water consumption is approximately 1 255 57 108 m3 of the five countries uzbekistan s water consumption 560 13 108 m3 is much higher than that of other countries turkmenistan has the second highest average annual water consumption 266 82 108 m3 while the upstream countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have the lowest water consumption averaging 116 10 108 m3 and 82 95 108 m3 respectively meanwhile the total water consumption in central asia decreased slightly from 1 358 37 108 m3 in 1997 to 1 233 12 108 m3 in 2016 giving a reduction of 125 25 108 m3 fig 3 a shows that the agricultural sector consumes the most water accounting for an average of 89 39 of the total water consumption this is actually higher than the world s average consumption level 71 lee and jung 2018 on the other hand water consumption in central asian countries for industry and municipal sectors is far less than that for agriculture accounting for 7 22 and 3 92 of the total water consumption respectively however the proportion of agricultural water consumption has gradually decreased from 91 89 in 1997 to 87 61 in 2014 and the proportion of industrial and municipal water consumption gradually increased at the same time the re use rate of industrial water resources remained low and a large number of drinking water resources were directly used in industry therefore fresh water re use and recycling facilities should be vigorously developed to improve the utilization efficiency of industrial water consumption fig 3 b shows kazakhstan has the lowest proportion of agricultural water consumption 71 33 while the proportion of the other four countries is higher than 90 however the proportion of industrial water consumption is very low across all five countries 3 3 assessment of socio economic conditions population dynamics and economic situations are the potential drivers of water demand cashman 2014 jalilov et al 2016 according to the assessment results kazakhstan has the highest score 1 83 while tajikistan and uzbekistan both have the lowest 0 12 the population density of uzbekistan is the highest 67 64 km2 while kazakhstan has only 6 26 km2 for the gdp of per capita kazakhstan is the highest 11 144 96 dollars and tajikistan is the lowest 912 40 dollars indicating that the gap between rich and poor countries is significant water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is an important indicator for evaluating water utilization efficiency zhang et al 2006 in central asia water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is generally high which indicates low water utilization efficiency specifically the average annual water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is higher in tajikistan 15 845 97 m3 and kyrgyzstan 12 551 10 m3 and the lowest in kazakhstan 1 214 88 m3 from the temporal changes we can see that water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp in central asia shows a significant declining trend from 1997 to 2016 fig 4 for example tajikistan decreased 11 22 104 m3 during that time frame and turkmenistan decreased 8 93 104 m3 although the socio economic development in central asia is heavily dependent on water resources and water consumption is relatively high the efficiency of water utilization in the region has gradually increased in recent decades technological progress and a decline in the proportion of agricultural water consumption have contributed to the reduction in water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp surface water is the main source of irrigation in central asian countries and the irrigated area covers 994 98 104 hectares but groundwater irrigation only accounts for 4 90 50 86 104 hectares of the total at present advanced technologies such as drip irrigation sprinkling irrigation and micro irrigation have not yet proved popular in the region so the primary sources of irrigation water remain those which have been traditionally used drawing directly from transboundary rivers the amu darya and syr darya are two major rivers flowing through central asia feeding 73 of the population goldewijk et al 2010 the water from the rivers is mainly used for agricultural irrigation for the middle and downstream countries while the upstream countries use the part of water for hydroelectric power as can be seen in fig 5 a the annual average water withdrawal from the amu darya river during the growing season is 342 49 108 m3 which is about 2 38 times that taken during the non growing season 143 90 108 m3 from 1997 to 2016 the overall changes of water withdrawal from the river during the growing season are not significant during the non growing season water withdrawal reached the highest in 2005 and the changes relatively stable in other years fig 5 b shows the total water withdrawal for the syr darya river as can be seen the withdrawal amounts are lower in the syr darya than the amu darya river moreover similar to the amu darya river water withdrawal from the syr darya river during the growing season is much higher than during the non growing season average annual water withdrawal during the growing season is 206 39 108 m3 or about 2 14 times that of the non growing season 96 41 108 m3 since 1997 water withdrawal from the syr darya river has shown a downward trend specifically water withdrawal during the growing season decreased from 198 19 108 m3 in 1997 to 176 30 108 m3 in 2016 while during the non growing season water withdrawal decreased from 101 63 108 m3 in 1997 to 60 49 108 m3 in 2016 3 4 assessment of water supply and demand security studies have shown that global warming leads to earlier seasonal runoff peaks in central asia which shift from summer to spring hagg et al 2013 li et al 2020a b this change has resulted in a significant decrease of runoff in july and august making it difficult for crops to obtain their irrigation requirements in the most critical season of water demand at the same time climate change has led to an increase in extreme hydrological events which is further aggravating the current shortage of water resources and will likely have a negative impact on the supply and demand of water resources in the future chen et al 2018 our assessment results show that in terms of water supply and demand security kyrgyzstan had the highest comprehensive score 1 38 while uzbekistan had the lowest 0 54 regarding the water supply and demand ratio kazakhstan was shown to be the safest scoring 1 84 followed by kyrgyzstan 1 69 and tajikistan 1 20 whereas turkmenistan and uzbekistan were the least safe the water supply module refers to the ratio of regional water supply to land area among the five countries uzbekistan has the highest water supply module 13 03 104 m3 km2 and kazakhstan has the lowest 0 82 104 m3 km2 the available water supply per capita of the five central asian countries is relatively abundant with the highest being in kyrgyzstan 8 826 m3 and tajikistan 7 629 m3 and the lowest being in uzbekistan 1 646 m3 the groundwater supply ratio was highest in tajikistan 19 04 while the proportion of groundwater supply in other countries was less than 10 excessive groundwater withdrawal will lead to a decrease in total water storage and a sharp decline in groundwater level which will eventually result in the degradation of ecosystem chen et al 2016 the relative risk categories of transboundary river basins are calculated based on the transboundary freshwater database fig 6 which are the ratios of the total annual water withdrawal to the annual water supply of various basins we set five relative risk categories very low 0 1 low 0 1 0 2 moderate 0 2 0 4 high 0 4 0 8 very high 0 8 according to the threshold values determined by the database in the upper reaches of the aral sea basin kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and the ural river basin kazakhstan the total storage of water resources is relatively rich despite the large water withdrawal so the relative risk categories of water resources in these basins are moderate however in the vast oasis irrigation districts e g the middle and lower reaches of the aral sea basin the southern basins of turkmenistan and the ili river basin a large portion of surface water resources is blocked and then introduced into irrigation through canals furthermore because most of the irrigation districts are situated far away from the water sources and the strong evaporation due to dry land surface the water supply is generally insufficient and the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is prominent micklin 2007 the result is that the relative risk categories of water resources in these basins are either high or very high 3 5 comprehensive assessment of water security the water security levels in central asia vary according to country table 3 as can be seen the water security level in kazakhstan is highest at the relatively safe level of ii with the projection value of 3 0575 indicating that the water security situation has improved among the five countries kazakhstan has the most sufficient water resources and the lowest population density meanwhile its utilization rate of water resources is only 19 74 overall the degree of water security in kazakhstan is relatively high the water security levels of kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and tajikistan are not as high all sitting at level ⅲ which is considered a basically safe level the projection values are ranked as follows kyrgyzstan 1 9258 turkmenistan 1 1111 tajikistan 1 1106 the upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan produce more water and the total amount of water resources is generally abundant the downstream country turkmenistan however has little water production and thus relies almost completely on transboundary rivers for its domestic usage and economic development currently the utilization rate of water resources and the degree of irrigation in turkmenistan are both high meanwhile uzbekistan has the worst water security situation showing a relatively unsafe level of ⅳ uzbekistan also shows the lowest projection value of the five countries 0 3714 and has the highest population density and least water resources per capita moreover the country s utilization rate of water resources has risen to 112 83 making the water security situation in uzbekistan severe going forward kazakhstan should increase the rational development and utilization of water resources kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan should promote the transformation of their economic structures from water consumption to water saving finally uzbekistan should coordinate its relationship between economic development and sustainable use of water resources on the basis of strict control of population growth 4 discussion 4 1 optimizing crop planting structure and improving the security of agricultural water in central asia the agricultural sector has the highest water consumption water intensive crops such as cotton and rice account for a large proportion in the planting structure of crops and need a large amount of water to meet growth requirements however after the collapse of the soviet union the agricultural policies of various countries including those in central asia drastically changed resulting in a downward trend in cotton planting area as illustrated in fig 7 the planting area of major crops in central asia increased by 351 104 hectares from 1997 2016 while the planting area of cotton decreased by 33 86 104 hectares and the area of wheat gradually increased among the main agricultural region of the central asia the northeast aral sea basin except namangan province saw a significant decrease in the cotton planting area from 2000 to 2018 fig 8 the decreasing rate was most obvious in the tashkent region of uzbekistan with an average decrease of 3 246 ha year followed by andijan province of uzbekistan which decreased by an average of 1 512 ha per year the main reason for the decreases is that since independence uzbekistan has implemented a policy of food self sufficiency reducing the cultivation of cotton and turning to large scale cultivation of wheat and other food crops kai et al 2015 cotton cultivation in other major irrigation districts of the aral sea basin such as south kazakhstan kyzylorda and fergana provinces also showed a downward trend in a recent study international crisis group icg asia report pointed out that a hectare of cotton needs 8 000 10 000 m3 of irrigation water while wheat needs less than half that zhupankhan et al 2017 therefore in recent years the decline of agricultural water consumption in central asia is related to the decrease in cotton cultivation fang et al 2018 kai et al 2015 also found that since the adoption of the food security policy in fergana province cotton cultivation decreased and wheat cultivation increased by 31 between 1994 and 2010 however farmers planted second crops between sowing and harvesting of winter wheat which greatly reduced the potential of agricultural water saving therefore as the largest user of water the agricultural sector needs to further optimize the planting structure increase the potential of water saving and ensure the security of agricultural water 4 2 suggestions for water security management in central asia there are many deficiencies of the water resource allocation systems in central asia so the optimization of water resource utilization and allocation is one of key important measures to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and the water security management and we hope to achieve the optimization from the following aspects firstly the water supply in central asia largely depends on surface water and the average groundwater supply ratio in the five countries is only 8 15 based on our calculations however the strong seasonality and spatial variation of surface water restrict the availability of utilization therefore it is necessary to unify the management of groundwater and surface water in a reasonable way secondly the existing water resource allocation mechanisms should be improved to coordinate the water consumption between the upstream and downstream countries economic development and ecological protection and agriculture and other sectors in addition optimizing the water conservancy and irrigation infrastructure to reduce water loss during transportation rahaman 2012 yang et al 2015 b moreover the construction of automated water management technologies should be strengthened and researchers are encouraged to develop more powerful and practical optimization models to guide the allocation of water resources in various regions davijani et al 2016 xu 2017 the right to water is also an important factor affecting water security in central asia during the soviet period this right mainly depended on the supply of water resources and gave priority to the water withdrawal for cotton planting after the collapse of the soviet union however the distribution of water resources became completely dependent on the situation of transboundary river basins and irrigation systems and there was no longer an effective distribution mechanism unger shayesteh et al 2013 the conflict of water rights mainly occurs in the shared transboundary river basins that less developed less democratic and less politically stable these countries rely on weak international water resources management institutions so the inter regional conflicts often occur due to confusion over ownership of water resources bernauer and siegfried 2012 since the 1990s central asian countries have successively created the water users association wua to allocate water resources and water management infrastructure but due to lack of funds and technical support and other reasons the operation of this organization is greatly limited abdullaev and mollinga 2010 in response to these challenges the fergana irrigation district created the informal water users groups wug for grassroots water management unlike the top down wua each wug member has a voice in the management system overall this change has proved to be an effective mechanism for water management in the region abdullaev et al 2010 all the central asian countries should therefore actively adopt a bottom up water resources management strategy which will give farmers relative autonomy in the operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure if this occurs more stakeholders will participate in the process of water management and water equity can thus be better guaranteed previously central asian countries tried to improve their water security by formulating a single water resources policy but the effort was ineffective it would be better for these countries to coordinate national water policies and seek new water agreements from a global political and economic perspective for example the european union water initiative euwi established in 2002 has created transnational water resources cooperation among 10 countries including eastern europe the caucasus and central asia the euwi has also promoted the development of water management at the basin level in central asia fritsch et al 2017 in addition central asia should pay more attention to ecological and environmental issues tries to improve fragile ecosystems and reduces the impact of ecological disasters halvorson and hamilton 2007 li et al 2019 providing effective water protection legislation and enhancing citizens awareness of water resources protection would be a good starting point to achieve those aims 5 conclusions based on the pso pee model we assessed the four main water security sub objectives and the comprehensive level of water security in all five central asian countries the conclusions are as follows the total annual water consumption in central asia is 1 255 57 108 m3 of which uzbekistan has the most water consumption 560 13 108 m3 while kyrgyzstan and tajikistan consumed the least amount of water in the past 20 years 1997 2016 water consumption in central asia decreased by 125 25 108 m3 with the proportion of agricultural water consumption showing a downward trend due to the changes in crop planting structure while the proportion of industrial and municipal water consumption both saw steady but gradual rises in terms of ecological security kazakhstan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have improved their status but turkmenistan is getting worse shrub encroachment and land salinization are prominent threats to turkmenistan s ecological security for the quantity security of water resources tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have higher comprehensive scores while uzbekistan has the lowest other than uzbekistan which has a moderate water shortage the other four countries have relatively safe conditions with water resources exceed the shortage standard however the utilization rates of water resources in uzbekistan and turkmenistan are far beyond the safe threshold for the socio economic conditions kazakhstan scored the highest while tajikistan and uzbekistan scored the lowest meanwhile water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp in all central asian countries is high but shows a significant decreasing trend for the water supply and demand security kyrgyzstan scored the highest and uzbekistan the lowest any increases in extreme hydrological events caused by climate change will further aggravate the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources kazakhstan is positioned at a relatively safe level of water resources level ⅱ and boasts the highest degree of water security in the five central asian countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan are all in the basically safe level level iii of water security while uzbekistan has the worst water security status and is positioned in the relatively unsafe level level iv optimizing the utilization and allocation of water resources adopting bottom up water resources management strategies and formulating regional water resources agreements from a global perspective are effective suggestions for central asia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10535,the utilization of water resources and water security in central asia are critical to the stability of the region this paper assesses the water security of the five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan by using the projection pursuit model based on particle swarm optimization pso pee the results show that the average annual water consumption in central asia is about 1255 57 108 m3 and the proportion of agricultural water consumption decreased due in large part to the changes of crop planting structure for the ecological security kazakhstan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have improved their status but turkmenistan is getting worse for the quantity security of water resources tajikistan and kyrgyzstan are relatively safe whereas uzbekistan is at risk for the socio economic conditions kazakhstan scored the highest while tajikistan and uzbekistan scored the lowest water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp across all five countries is relatively high but shows a significant decreasing trend for the water supply and demand security the status of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan are better than that of turkmenistan and uzbekistan kazakhstan has achieved a relatively safe level level ⅱ and the degree of water security is high kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan are only in the basically safe level level iii uzbekistan is under significant pressure with regard to water security level iv which indicates that the country needs to strictly control population growth and strengthen the comprehensive management of water resources keywords water resources water security pso pee model central asia 1 introduction water security refers to the acceptable level of water related risks that can meet the living environment and economic development needs of human society while supporting national security human health and ecosystem services bakker 2012 with the growing shortage of global water resources increasing frequency of extreme climate disasters and major issues around water pollution the utilization and protection of water resources and water security have become urgent and serious challenges for human garfin et al 2016 grey and sadoff 2007 vörösmarty et al 2010 the united nations security council sees water as one of the most important security issues in the world and suggests that water security is a necessary condition for achieving social well being and economic development in the past water security studies have mainly focused on the north america south southeast asia east asia and oceania while less attention has been paid to the africa middle east and central asia gerlak et al 2018 following the collapse of the soviet union central asia has become a region of great concern because of its special geopolitical environment and numerous transboundary rivers water issues as well as water security and ecological issues related to water in central asia have now become the focus of attention in the world central asia is located in the center of the eurasian continent and belongs to an arid and semi arid region the management of water resources and the utilization of transboundary rivers are currently in constant dispute in upstream kyrgyzstan kgz tajikistan tjk and downstream kazakhstan kaz turkmenistan tkm and uzbekistan uzb o hara 2000 in fact the water problems arising from transboundary rivers have risen to the level of interregional water politics with the central asian region now facing severe challenges from the water security crisis karthe et al 2015 chen et al 2018 in view of these problems numerous scholars are carrying out studies and mainly focus on the response of water resources to climate change the water resources management of transboundary rivers and the watershed water environment akhtar et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 bekturganov et al 2016 for example chen et al 2017 2018 analyzed the impacts of climate change and human activities on the hydrological process and water resources of transboundary rivers in central asia proposing that global warming aggravates the frequency of extreme hydrological events and mismatched spatial distributions of water and land resources along with excessive human activities have all led to the water crisis in the region kai et al 2015 analyzed the current water security measures and future water security management challenges of the syr darya basin in central asia from the perspective of water supply and demand suggesting that public administration is the weakest link in water security management maja et al 2013 evaluated the vulnerability of wetland ecosystem in amu darya basin and tested the selection scheme of environmental flow under different climate scenarios in the future suggesting that the environmental flow should be incorporated into the water management system in addition water food energy security were also investigated in this region jalilov 2013 evaluated the development and distribution potential of water resources in various countries of the amu darya basin under different water supply modes in the future and assessed the economic benefits duan et al 2019 predicted the future agricultural water requirements and deficits crop yield and water productivity of turkmenistan under three different scenarios despite the wealth of data that emerged from these studies and the potential applications of their findings a comprehensive evaluation of water security in the five central asian countries has yet to be done in the present study the pso pee model integrates the theory of biological population evolution into the projection pursuit model particles make an efficient and intelligent global optimization in the process of establishing the assessment indicators system of water security and analyzing the four sub objectives that affect water security in this way a comprehensive assessment of water security in central asia is carried out the findings provide a scientific basis for a deeper understanding of water resources utilization and water security in central asia such an understanding will contribute both to regional sustainable development and the further construction of the one belt and one road 2 material and methods 2 1 data sources in this study data on water resources and regional socio

with the supply and demand system of water resources and be combined with the utilization characteristics of water in central asia the stochastic process of the water resources and changes in interannual water volume should also be considered ma et al 2009 therefore this study utilizes statistical mean data from 2010 to 2016 to find the appropriate assessment indicators system and classification standard data set for water security in the five central asian countries the system selects four criteria layers ecological security quantity security of water resources socio economic conditions and water supply and demand security as well as 16 indicator layers including 10 positive indicators and 6 negative indicators see tables 1 and 2 2 3 projection pursuit model based on particle swarm optimization pso pee projection pursuit model pee is an emerging mathematical method for turning high dimensional nonlinear problems into one dimensional ones via projection pursuit in the present work particle swarm optimization pso is used to find the best projection direction of the assessment indicators system in the model the optimal projection value is then found by the linear projection between the best projection direction and the evaluation indicators shi and eberhart 1998 friedman 2016 2 3 1 normalization of assessment indicators system to eliminate the dimension of assessment indicator value and unify the variation range for every indicator it is necessary to normalize each positive and negative indicator 1 f o r p o s i t i v e i n d i c a t o r s x i j x i j x m a x j 2 f o r n e g a t i v e i n d i c a t o r s x i j x m i n j x i j where x i j are the normalized sequence of assessment indicators x i j is the i th assessment indicator value of the i th sample and x min j with xmax j are the minimum and maximum values of the i th indicator fu et al 2002 2 3 2 establishment of projection indicator function the projection pursuit model integrates m dimensional data x i j j 1 2 m into one dimensional projection values let a be the unit projection direction vector of m dimension with components of a 1 a 2 am the one dimensional projection eigenvalue zi of xij is thus 3 z i j 1 m a j x i j i 1 n when integrating projection indicator values the inter class distance s z and intra class density d z of zi must be scattered in one dimensional space in order to obtain the maximum value simultaneously hence the expression of the objective function q a is 4 q a s z d z 5 s z i 1 n z i z 0 2 n 1 1 2 6 d z i 1 n k 1 n r r i j u r r i j where z 0 is the mean value of the projected eigenvalue zi the larger the value of s z the wider the sample dispersion r is the window radius of the local density and generally has a value of 0 1 s z r i j is the distance between samples and u t is the unit step function such that t r r i j when t 0 u t 1 and when t 0 u t 0 liu et al 2018 2 3 3 optimization of projection indicator function based on the particle swarm the optimal projection direction is determined by solving the maximization problem of the projection indicator function as shown below 7 maximization objective function q a s z d z 8 c o n s t r a i n t s j 1 p a 2 j 1 where the position of the i th i 1 2 n particle can be expressed as xi the speed is vi and the adaptation value is fi the best position the particle individual has experienced is denoted as pbesti t the best position the particle swarm has experienced is denoted as gbest t and two optimal values are determined at time of t 1 here the particles update their position and speed according to the following formulas 9 v t 1 wvi t c 1 b 1 t pbesti t si t c 2 b 2 t gbest t si t 10 si t 1 si t vi t 1 where w is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are constants called the learning factors and b 1 t and b 2 t are the uniformly distributed random functions between 0 1 the updating formulas for individual extremum of each particle and global extremum of all particles are as follows 11 p b e s t i t 1 x i t 1 f i t 1 f p b e s t i t p b e s t i t f i t 1 f p b e s t i t 12 gbest t 1 smax t 1 where fi t 1 is the best fitness value of particle i at time t 1 f pbesti t is the best fitness value for the history of particle i and smax t 1 is the particle position corresponding to the largest fpbesti t of all particles at t 1 time zhao et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the fitness value fi of each particle is determined by the actual optimization problem thus the optimization of the projection direction is as follows 1 the current particle position si t 1 is substituted into formula 3 to calculate the one dimensional projection value z i 2 s z and d z are then calculated according to formulas 5 and 6 and 3 the projection indicator function q a is calculated according to formula 4 which is the fitness value of particles fi t 1 note that when the difference between the fitness values of the optimal particle at t 1 time and t time is less than the set threshold or reaches the predetermined number of iterations gmax the operation of the algorithm ends at this point the global extreme value found by the particle swarm is the best projection direction a and the fitness value corresponding to the global extreme value is the optimal projection indicator function q a in this study the parameters of data set in modeling are set as follows the learning factor is c 1 c 2 1 4962 the inertia weight is w 0 99 the maximum number of iterations is 300 and the population size is n 200 fig 1 shows the optimizing processes of objective functions which reflect the relationship between the optimal maximum value of objective function and the number of iterations the faster the convergence speed of the model is the more accurate the results are as can be seen from fig 1 a the optimal objective function value of classification standard data 1 2055 is obtained after about 20 iterations indicating that the model has a fast convergence speed the best projection direction of the objective function is a 0 2621 0 2446 0 2524 0 2464 0 2551 0 2439 0 2543 0 2422 0 2460 0 2457 0 2465 0 2621 0 2537 0 2518 0 2475 0 2446 and the optimal projection values are q 3 9988 2 3659 0 9923 0 therefore the optimal projection value of the boundary point between water security levels ⅰ ii of the five central asian countries is q 1 3 9988 the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels ii iii is q 2 2 3659 the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels iii iv is q 3 0 9923 and the optimal projection value of the boundary point between levels iv v is q 4 0 the optimizing process of the objective function of the assessment indicators data set is shown in fig 1 b it becomes stable after about 170 iterations the best projection direction of the objective function is a 0 19338 0 0021 0 3778 0 2006 0 0013 0 1705 0 0062 0 3485 0 3689 0 3643 0 2388 0 3290 0 3693 0 0007 0 17258 0 16991 and the maximum objective function value is 0 7310 the optimal projection values for the assessment indicators data set of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan are q 3 0575 1 9258 1 1106 1 1111 0 3714 respectively working on the precept that the higher the projection value the better the water security situation of the country 3 results the water security levels for all five central asian countries were obtained based on the projection values of assessment indicators data set and classification standard data set furthermore the optimal projection values comprehensive scores and ranking of the four sub target levels ecological security quantity security of water resources socio economic conditions and water supply and demand security were calculated using the same method the comprehensive assessment results are shown in table 3 3 1 assessment of ecological security central asia is vast and sparsely populated and more than 50 of the region is desert or semi desert fig 2 the results of the ecological security assessment of the five central asian countries are shown in table 3 as can be seen the comprehensive score for kazakhstan is the highest and that country s ecological security status is the best this is because kazakhstan has the highest grassland coverage 67 89 and grassland being one of the main land use types in central asia in recent years however the problem of shrub encroachment has become increasingly prominent grassland areas have decreased by 25 90 over the past three decades with about 8 of the grassland being converted into shrubs between 2000 and 2013 turkmenistan and uzbekistan show the most significant increase in shrub encroachment li et al 2015 the increase in shrubs usually changes the structure and function of ecosystems reducing biodiversity and accelerating land desertification the country with the highest ecological water use ratio is kazakhstan 64 35 followed by kyrgyzstan 43 18 and tajikistan 35 07 while turkmenistan and uzbekistan have the lowest ecological water use ratios of 21 08 and 19 35 respectively the percentage of forest coverage in central asia is generally low with the highest percentage 8 78 in turkmenistan and the lowest 1 23 in kazakhstan for the soil salinization area ratio the upstream countries tajikistan 3 13 and kyrgyzstan 5 00 are lower while the downstream agricultural countries uzbekistan 68 00 and turkmenistan 65 90 have higher soil salinization area ratios inefficient and outmoded agricultural irrigation methods combined with over use of pesticides and fertilizers are the main causes of soil salinization in central asia zhang et al 2018 3 2 assessment of the quantity security of water resources water is the most critical natural factor affecting economic development ecological security and social stability in the arid areas of central asia to date total water resources in the region have been relatively abundant about 1 944 90 108 m3 table 4 surface water resources are 1 739 60 108 m3 and account for 89 44 of the total while groundwater resources are only 627 50 108 m3 by considering the amount of entry and exit for each country we can see the amount of available water resources in central asia are 2 275 70 108 m3 however the spatial distribution of water resources is extremely uneven the total amount of water resources in kazakhstan is the largest 643 50 108 m3 accounting for 33 09 of all water resources in central asia followed by the upstream mountain countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan which account for 32 63 and 25 19 respectively these two countries are rich in water resources from glaciers and snow and are major water producers in central asia however the two downstream countries of uzbekistan and turkmenistan produce much less water and are situated far from any water sources mainly relying on inbound water resources to satisfy their economic demands according to the assessment results tajikistan has the highest comprehensive score 1 81 for the quantity security of water resources whereas uzbekistan has the lowest 0 14 the water yield modulus refers to the average amount of water resources produced per unit land area shi et al 2013 among the five central asian countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have the highest water yield modulus at 44 56 104 m3 km2 and 24 47 104 m3 km2 respectively which are much higher than the downstream countries the water yield modulus of turkmenistan is the lowest at only 0 29 104 m3 km2 turkmenistan is located in southwest central asia and features a relatively dry climate the karakum desert accounts for more than 80 of the territory and the available water resources of turkmenistan mainly come from transboundary rivers such as the amu darya river the murgabu river and the tedjen river water resources per capita are one of the most important indicators reflecting the shortage of water resources and the state of regional water security according to the internationally recognized water shortage standard per capita water resources of less than 3000 m3 are a sign of mild water shortage those less than 2000 m3 denote moderate water shortage those less than 1000 m3 indicate severe water shortage and those less than 500 m3 indicate extreme water shortage of the five central asian countries uzbekistan has the lowest water resources per capita 1870 m3 which categorizes it as having a moderate water shortage the other four countries rank higher in the water shortage standard with the water resources per capita in tajikistan being the highest at 13 500 m3 thus it can be seen that the contradiction of water resources in central asia is not a problem of water shortage but a problem of water resources allocation and utilization chen et al 2018 based on water resources per unit area tajikistan has the highest 15 50 104 m3 km2 followed by kyrgyzstan 11 81 104 m3 km2 although kazakhstan has the most abundant water resources in central asia it also has a vast land area and relatively small water resources per unit area 3 98 104 m3 km2 the utilization rate of water resource is also one of the key indicators reflecting the scarcity of water resources in general the higher the degree of development and utilization of water resources the greater the pressure on the water system and natural ecosystem qadir et al 2009 the internationally recognized safety threshold for water resources development is 40 among the central asian countries kazakhstan 19 74 and kyrgyzstan 31 05 all have low utilization rates while uzbekistan and turkmenistan have relatively high rates of up to 112 84 and 112 83 respectively of the five countries uzbekistan and turkmenistan consume the most water which is mainly used for irrigation of crops such as cotton rice and wheat moreover because the irrigation facilities in these countries are so old and the routes are so long about 50 of the water resources are evaporated and or leaked during transportation cai et al 2003 this means there is a considerable difference between water withdrawal and actual crop water consumption kai et al 2015 central asia s average annual water consumption is approximately 1 255 57 108 m3 of the five countries uzbekistan s water consumption 560 13 108 m3 is much higher than that of other countries turkmenistan has the second highest average annual water consumption 266 82 108 m3 while the upstream countries tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have the lowest water consumption averaging 116 10 108 m3 and 82 95 108 m3 respectively meanwhile the total water consumption in central asia decreased slightly from 1 358 37 108 m3 in 1997 to 1 233 12 108 m3 in 2016 giving a reduction of 125 25 108 m3 fig 3 a shows that the agricultural sector consumes the most water accounting for an average of 89 39 of the total water consumption this is actually higher than the world s average consumption level 71 lee and jung 2018 on the other hand water consumption in central asian countries for industry and municipal sectors is far less than that for agriculture accounting for 7 22 and 3 92 of the total water consumption respectively however the proportion of agricultural water consumption has gradually decreased from 91 89 in 1997 to 87 61 in 2014 and the proportion of industrial and municipal water consumption gradually increased at the same time the re use rate of industrial water resources remained low and a large number of drinking water resources were directly used in industry therefore fresh water re use and recycling facilities should be vigorously developed to improve the utilization efficiency of industrial water consumption fig 3 b shows kazakhstan has the lowest proportion of agricultural water consumption 71 33 while the proportion of the other four countries is higher than 90 however the proportion of industrial water consumption is very low across all five countries 3 3 assessment of socio economic conditions population dynamics and economic situations are the potential drivers of water demand cashman 2014 jalilov et al 2016 according to the assessment results kazakhstan has the highest score 1 83 while tajikistan and uzbekistan both have the lowest 0 12 the population density of uzbekistan is the highest 67 64 km2 while kazakhstan has only 6 26 km2 for the gdp of per capita kazakhstan is the highest 11 144 96 dollars and tajikistan is the lowest 912 40 dollars indicating that the gap between rich and poor countries is significant water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is an important indicator for evaluating water utilization efficiency zhang et al 2006 in central asia water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is generally high which indicates low water utilization efficiency specifically the average annual water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp is higher in tajikistan 15 845 97 m3 and kyrgyzstan 12 551 10 m3 and the lowest in kazakhstan 1 214 88 m3 from the temporal changes we can see that water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp in central asia shows a significant declining trend from 1997 to 2016 fig 4 for example tajikistan decreased 11 22 104 m3 during that time frame and turkmenistan decreased 8 93 104 m3 although the socio economic development in central asia is heavily dependent on water resources and water consumption is relatively high the efficiency of water utilization in the region has gradually increased in recent decades technological progress and a decline in the proportion of agricultural water consumption have contributed to the reduction in water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp surface water is the main source of irrigation in central asian countries and the irrigated area covers 994 98 104 hectares but groundwater irrigation only accounts for 4 90 50 86 104 hectares of the total at present advanced technologies such as drip irrigation sprinkling irrigation and micro irrigation have not yet proved popular in the region so the primary sources of irrigation water remain those which have been traditionally used drawing directly from transboundary rivers the amu darya and syr darya are two major rivers flowing through central asia feeding 73 of the population goldewijk et al 2010 the water from the rivers is mainly used for agricultural irrigation for the middle and downstream countries while the upstream countries use the part of water for hydroelectric power as can be seen in fig 5 a the annual average water withdrawal from the amu darya river during the growing season is 342 49 108 m3 which is about 2 38 times that taken during the non growing season 143 90 108 m3 from 1997 to 2016 the overall changes of water withdrawal from the river during the growing season are not significant during the non growing season water withdrawal reached the highest in 2005 and the changes relatively stable in other years fig 5 b shows the total water withdrawal for the syr darya river as can be seen the withdrawal amounts are lower in the syr darya than the amu darya river moreover similar to the amu darya river water withdrawal from the syr darya river during the growing season is much higher than during the non growing season average annual water withdrawal during the growing season is 206 39 108 m3 or about 2 14 times that of the non growing season 96 41 108 m3 since 1997 water withdrawal from the syr darya river has shown a downward trend specifically water withdrawal during the growing season decreased from 198 19 108 m3 in 1997 to 176 30 108 m3 in 2016 while during the non growing season water withdrawal decreased from 101 63 108 m3 in 1997 to 60 49 108 m3 in 2016 3 4 assessment of water supply and demand security studies have shown that global warming leads to earlier seasonal runoff peaks in central asia which shift from summer to spring hagg et al 2013 li et al 2020a b this change has resulted in a significant decrease of runoff in july and august making it difficult for crops to obtain their irrigation requirements in the most critical season of water demand at the same time climate change has led to an increase in extreme hydrological events which is further aggravating the current shortage of water resources and will likely have a negative impact on the supply and demand of water resources in the future chen et al 2018 our assessment results show that in terms of water supply and demand security kyrgyzstan had the highest comprehensive score 1 38 while uzbekistan had the lowest 0 54 regarding the water supply and demand ratio kazakhstan was shown to be the safest scoring 1 84 followed by kyrgyzstan 1 69 and tajikistan 1 20 whereas turkmenistan and uzbekistan were the least safe the water supply module refers to the ratio of regional water supply to land area among the five countries uzbekistan has the highest water supply module 13 03 104 m3 km2 and kazakhstan has the lowest 0 82 104 m3 km2 the available water supply per capita of the five central asian countries is relatively abundant with the highest being in kyrgyzstan 8 826 m3 and tajikistan 7 629 m3 and the lowest being in uzbekistan 1 646 m3 the groundwater supply ratio was highest in tajikistan 19 04 while the proportion of groundwater supply in other countries was less than 10 excessive groundwater withdrawal will lead to a decrease in total water storage and a sharp decline in groundwater level which will eventually result in the degradation of ecosystem chen et al 2016 the relative risk categories of transboundary river basins are calculated based on the transboundary freshwater database fig 6 which are the ratios of the total annual water withdrawal to the annual water supply of various basins we set five relative risk categories very low 0 1 low 0 1 0 2 moderate 0 2 0 4 high 0 4 0 8 very high 0 8 according to the threshold values determined by the database in the upper reaches of the aral sea basin kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and the ural river basin kazakhstan the total storage of water resources is relatively rich despite the large water withdrawal so the relative risk categories of water resources in these basins are moderate however in the vast oasis irrigation districts e g the middle and lower reaches of the aral sea basin the southern basins of turkmenistan and the ili river basin a large portion of surface water resources is blocked and then introduced into irrigation through canals furthermore because most of the irrigation districts are situated far away from the water sources and the strong evaporation due to dry land surface the water supply is generally insufficient and the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is prominent micklin 2007 the result is that the relative risk categories of water resources in these basins are either high or very high 3 5 comprehensive assessment of water security the water security levels in central asia vary according to country table 3 as can be seen the water security level in kazakhstan is highest at the relatively safe level of ii with the projection value of 3 0575 indicating that the water security situation has improved among the five countries kazakhstan has the most sufficient water resources and the lowest population density meanwhile its utilization rate of water resources is only 19 74 overall the degree of water security in kazakhstan is relatively high the water security levels of kyrgyzstan turkmenistan and tajikistan are not as high all sitting at level ⅲ which is considered a basically safe level the projection values are ranked as follows kyrgyzstan 1 9258 turkmenistan 1 1111 tajikistan 1 1106 the upstream countries kyrgyzstan and tajikistan produce more water and the total amount of water resources is generally abundant the downstream country turkmenistan however has little water production and thus relies almost completely on transboundary rivers for its domestic usage and economic development currently the utilization rate of water resources and the degree of irrigation in turkmenistan are both high meanwhile uzbekistan has the worst water security situation showing a relatively unsafe level of ⅳ uzbekistan also shows the lowest projection value of the five countries 0 3714 and has the highest population density and least water resources per capita moreover the country s utilization rate of water resources has risen to 112 83 making the water security situation in uzbekistan severe going forward kazakhstan should increase the rational development and utilization of water resources kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan should promote the transformation of their economic structures from water consumption to water saving finally uzbekistan should coordinate its relationship between economic development and sustainable use of water resources on the basis of strict control of population growth 4 discussion 4 1 optimizing crop planting structure and improving the security of agricultural water in central asia the agricultural sector has the highest water consumption water intensive crops such as cotton and rice account for a large proportion in the planting structure of crops and need a large amount of water to meet growth requirements however after the collapse of the soviet union the agricultural policies of various countries including those in central asia drastically changed resulting in a downward trend in cotton planting area as illustrated in fig 7 the planting area of major crops in central asia increased by 351 104 hectares from 1997 2016 while the planting area of cotton decreased by 33 86 104 hectares and the area of wheat gradually increased among the main agricultural region of the central asia the northeast aral sea basin except namangan province saw a significant decrease in the cotton planting area from 2000 to 2018 fig 8 the decreasing rate was most obvious in the tashkent region of uzbekistan with an average decrease of 3 246 ha year followed by andijan province of uzbekistan which decreased by an average of 1 512 ha per year the main reason for the decreases is that since independence uzbekistan has implemented a policy of food self sufficiency reducing the cultivation of cotton and turning to large scale cultivation of wheat and other food crops kai et al 2015 cotton cultivation in other major irrigation districts of the aral sea basin such as south kazakhstan kyzylorda and fergana provinces also showed a downward trend in a recent study international crisis group icg asia report pointed out that a hectare of cotton needs 8 000 10 000 m3 of irrigation water while wheat needs less than half that zhupankhan et al 2017 therefore in recent years the decline of agricultural water consumption in central asia is related to the decrease in cotton cultivation fang et al 2018 kai et al 2015 also found that since the adoption of the food security policy in fergana province cotton cultivation decreased and wheat cultivation increased by 31 between 1994 and 2010 however farmers planted second crops between sowing and harvesting of winter wheat which greatly reduced the potential of agricultural water saving therefore as the largest user of water the agricultural sector needs to further optimize the planting structure increase the potential of water saving and ensure the security of agricultural water 4 2 suggestions for water security management in central asia there are many deficiencies of the water resource allocation systems in central asia so the optimization of water resource utilization and allocation is one of key important measures to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and the water security management and we hope to achieve the optimization from the following aspects firstly the water supply in central asia largely depends on surface water and the average groundwater supply ratio in the five countries is only 8 15 based on our calculations however the strong seasonality and spatial variation of surface water restrict the availability of utilization therefore it is necessary to unify the management of groundwater and surface water in a reasonable way secondly the existing water resource allocation mechanisms should be improved to coordinate the water consumption between the upstream and downstream countries economic development and ecological protection and agriculture and other sectors in addition optimizing the water conservancy and irrigation infrastructure to reduce water loss during transportation rahaman 2012 yang et al 2015 b moreover the construction of automated water management technologies should be strengthened and researchers are encouraged to develop more powerful and practical optimization models to guide the allocation of water resources in various regions davijani et al 2016 xu 2017 the right to water is also an important factor affecting water security in central asia during the soviet period this right mainly depended on the supply of water resources and gave priority to the water withdrawal for cotton planting after the collapse of the soviet union however the distribution of water resources became completely dependent on the situation of transboundary river basins and irrigation systems and there was no longer an effective distribution mechanism unger shayesteh et al 2013 the conflict of water rights mainly occurs in the shared transboundary river basins that less developed less democratic and less politically stable these countries rely on weak international water resources management institutions so the inter regional conflicts often occur due to confusion over ownership of water resources bernauer and siegfried 2012 since the 1990s central asian countries have successively created the water users association wua to allocate water resources and water management infrastructure but due to lack of funds and technical support and other reasons the operation of this organization is greatly limited abdullaev and mollinga 2010 in response to these challenges the fergana irrigation district created the informal water users groups wug for grassroots water management unlike the top down wua each wug member has a voice in the management system overall this change has proved to be an effective mechanism for water management in the region abdullaev et al 2010 all the central asian countries should therefore actively adopt a bottom up water resources management strategy which will give farmers relative autonomy in the operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure if this occurs more stakeholders will participate in the process of water management and water equity can thus be better guaranteed previously central asian countries tried to improve their water security by formulating a single water resources policy but the effort was ineffective it would be better for these countries to coordinate national water policies and seek new water agreements from a global political and economic perspective for example the european union water initiative euwi established in 2002 has created transnational water resources cooperation among 10 countries including eastern europe the caucasus and central asia the euwi has also promoted the development of water management at the basin level in central asia fritsch et al 2017 in addition central asia should pay more attention to ecological and environmental issues tries to improve fragile ecosystems and reduces the impact of ecological disasters halvorson and hamilton 2007 li et al 2019 providing effective water protection legislation and enhancing citizens awareness of water resources protection would be a good starting point to achieve those aims 5 conclusions based on the pso pee model we assessed the four main water security sub objectives and the comprehensive level of water security in all five central asian countries the conclusions are as follows the total annual water consumption in central asia is 1 255 57 108 m3 of which uzbekistan has the most water consumption 560 13 108 m3 while kyrgyzstan and tajikistan consumed the least amount of water in the past 20 years 1997 2016 water consumption in central asia decreased by 125 25 108 m3 with the proportion of agricultural water consumption showing a downward trend due to the changes in crop planting structure while the proportion of industrial and municipal water consumption both saw steady but gradual rises in terms of ecological security kazakhstan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have improved their status but turkmenistan is getting worse shrub encroachment and land salinization are prominent threats to turkmenistan s ecological security for the quantity security of water resources tajikistan and kyrgyzstan have higher comprehensive scores while uzbekistan has the lowest other than uzbekistan which has a moderate water shortage the other four countries have relatively safe conditions with water resources exceed the shortage standard however the utilization rates of water resources in uzbekistan and turkmenistan are far beyond the safe threshold for the socio economic conditions kazakhstan scored the highest while tajikistan and uzbekistan scored the lowest meanwhile water consumption per 10 000 dollars of gdp in all central asian countries is high but shows a significant decreasing trend for the water supply and demand security kyrgyzstan scored the highest and uzbekistan the lowest any increases in extreme hydrological events caused by climate change will further aggravate the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources kazakhstan is positioned at a relatively safe level of water resources level ⅱ and boasts the highest degree of water security in the five central asian countries kyrgyzstan tajikistan and turkmenistan are all in the basically safe level level iii of water security while uzbekistan has the worst water security status and is positioned in the relatively unsafe level level iv optimizing the utilization and allocation of water resources adopting bottom up water resources management strategies and formulating regional water resources agreements from a global perspective are effective suggestions for central asia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

10536,suitable spectral monitoring models of canopy water content provide a scientific basis for real time dynamic accurate non destructive diagnosis over large acreage this work investigates winter wheat under different water treatments to examine the relationship between canopy water content and spectral reflectance principal component regression spectral monitoring models are developed based on the combination of growth stages the growth stage constraints are divided and the influence of other background noises is removed to achieve accurate and stable spectral monitoring results of canopy water content at all growth stages the following main conclusions are derived 1 at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and during the entire growth period the spectral transforms with the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content are the first order derivative division by r930 division by r450 750 and division by r930 respectively the corresponding sensitivity bands are 758 759 690 and 759 nm respectively at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and during the entire growth period the three edge parameters with the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content are rg rr sdr sdy rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb respectively 2 in accordance with the rationale that the spectral parameters should have the highest correlation coefficients with canopy water content at each growth stage combinational models of canopy water content that are specific to individual growth stages are developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters compared with the optimal single parameter regression model the combinational models significantly improve the estimation accuracy of canopy water content at each growth stage 3 monitoring models based on principal component analysis are constructed with comprehensive spectral information these models can improve the monitoring accuracy at other growth stages especially at the stem elongation booting stage compared with combinational models developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters keywords winter wheat canopy water content spectral transforms three edge parameters combinational model principal component regression model 1 introduction water is one of the main factors that restrain crop growth water deficit has a direct impact on the physiological and biochemical processes and morphological structure of plants and ultimately leads to yield reduction or poor crop quality zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a 2018b gopal et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2019 therefore large scale real time monitoring of plant water content has theoretical and practical importance for improving the level of crop water management and enhancing the quality and water use efficiency of crops ullah et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a 2018b according to the china statistical yearbook winter wheat is one of the primary grain crops in north china and accounts for more than 30 of the total planting acreage in this region the annual temporal distribution of precipitation is poorly synchronized with the water demand of winter wheat due to the monsoon influence and this lack of synchronization causes frequent droughts during the growth period real time dynamic accurate monitoring data on canopy water content should be acquired to achieve stable and high winter wheat yields in this region such data can also be used to compensate for the water deficit via irrigation during the growth period plant water deficit changes the physiological and biochemical characteristics of winter wheat and its canopy spectral characteristics accordingly the canopy water content can be monitored by spectral means duan et al 2019 oven drying is a traditional plant water content monitoring method that involves destructive sampling and its monitoring process is time consuming and laborious this method cannot effectively reveal dynamic changes in individual plant water content liu et al 2015 angela et al 2017 however with the rapid development of spectral technology the spectral spatiotemporal resolution has improved considerably and now provides technical support for real time dynamic and precise non destructive monitoring of plant water content over large acreage many scholars have performed substantial research on the spectral monitoring of plant water content and created various plant water content spectral estimation models mirzaie et al 2014 kendall et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2019 ma et al 2019 many studies are restricted to the construction of water content spectral monitoring models for specific growth stages due to the limited sampling size of destructive tests or poor weather conditions during the growth period given that the spectral characteristics of plants vary significantly across growth stages panigrahi and das 2018 whether growth stage specific spectral models are applicable to the monitoring of plant water content throughout the entire growth period is questionable for convenience several scholars have conducted comparative studies on the simulation effects of various models at different growth stages to develop spectral monitoring models of plant water content that are applicable to the entire growth period hunt et al 2016 however the accuracy and applicability of such models need to be verified further before model application spectral reflectance varies from one growth stage to the next due to the variation in the various morph physiological characteristics of the plant at the canopy level at different growth stages thus spectral monitoring models built for the entire growth period are likely to exhibit different accuracies when applied to various growth stages the monitoring accuracy of these models must be improved to meet the precision requirements of crop water management high spectral resolution amplifies spectral information and temporarily creates interference from background noise zhang et al 2018a 2018b studies have shown that such fundamental transforms of reflectance spectral information as reciprocal logarithmic and derivative operations can reduce background and noise effects and enhance spectral absorption and extraction features thus improving the simulation accuracy of models wang et al 2014 the three edge parameters position amplitude and area and the spectral indices constructed with these parameters can reveal the spectral characteristics of green vegetation the three edge parameters are sensitive to the leaf area index nitrogen content and chlorophyll content guo et al 2018 xie et al 2018 however little research has focused on the monitoring of plant water content by using the three edge parameters thus establishing plant canopy water content models on the basis of the spectral three edge parameters is recommended a considerable information overlap exists among independent variables composed of single type data such as the three edge parameters and basic transforms of spectral information compared with a univariate model a principal component analysis model solves the collinearity problem among the original indices via linear transformation therefore crop canopy water content estimation models based on the principal component analysis exhibit high simulation accuracy feng et al 2013 this work takes north china winter wheat as the research object on the basis of spectral reflectance and wheat canopy water content data at different growth stages in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 the study examines how the three edge parameters and the basic transforms of spectral information are related to canopy water content suitable combinational models that account for the characteristics of each growth stage and provide high monitoring accuracy are developed principal component analysis estimation models of canopy water content are built these models consider the three edge parameters and basic transforms of spectral information to provide theoretical basis and technical support for hyperspectral diagnosis of winter wheat water content in north china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted at the irrigation experiment station of china institute of water resources and hydropower research daxing beijing the station which is located at 39 37 n and 116 26 e has a semi arid and continental monsoon climate and is dry in winter and spring and rainy in summer the annual average sunshine is approximately 2600 h the annual average rainfall is 540 mm and the annual average temperature is 12 1 c the annual frost free period is 185 d and the annual average evaporation from a free water surface is above 1800 mm 2 2 design of the experiment the tested winter wheat variety was zhongmai 175 the sowing and harvesting dates in 2016 2017 were october 6 2016 and june 7 2017 respectively the sowing and harvesting dates in 2017 2018 were october 13 2017 and june 6 2018 respectively the five stages were pre sowing sowing wintering tillering stem elongation stem elongation booting and booting milking in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 four treatments i e w2 w3 w4 w5 and five treatments i e w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 were provided in three replications respectively a total of 12 plots in 2016 2017 and 15 plots in 2017 2018 were studied and each plot covered approximately 60 m2 table 1 shows the watering treatments the plants were irrigated from groundwater and the watering volume was metered before sowing a compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 and 15 k2o was applied as the base fertilizer at the stem elongation booting stage urea was applied with irrigation and after rainfall as the top dressing in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 respectively the amount of fertilizer applied was 225 kg ha each time the fertilization level was the same across the plots field management including sowing weeding pesticide spraying and other agronomic work was consistent with local farmers practice 2 3 items to be measured and methods 2 3 1 spectral monitoring of the canopies during the growth period of the winter wheat the canopy spectral reflectance was measured on a sunny windless or breezy day by using field spec handheld2 a handheld ground spectrometer manufactured by american asd company the effective band range of this spectrometer is 325 1075 nm with a sampling interval of 1 nm and a resolution of 3 nm the time for spectral reflectance measuring was 10 00 am to 12 00 am before each measurement a white plate with a reflectance of 1 was used to calibrate the spectrometer wheat canopy reflectance was measured with the probe held approximately 15 cm directly above pointing to the canopy and the field of view angle of the spectrometer was 25 liu et al 2019 ten measurements were conducted for each point to ensure measurement accuracy and reliability and their average value was taken as each point s spectral reflectance in each plot measurements were obtained at three representative locations and the average value was used as the canopy spectral reflectance in 2016 2017 the canopy spectral reflectance was measured five times at the stem elongation booting 23 april the booting milking 6 may 13 may and the milking ripening 20 may 26 may respectively in 2017 2018 the canopy spectral reflectance was measured at the stem elongation booting 27 april the booting milking 5 may and the milking ripening 23 may 28 may respectively 2 3 2 determination of plant water content after sampling twenty representative plants measured by spectrum of each location so a total of 60 plants of each plot were taken to the laboratory without delay and their fresh weight m1 was determined the samples were then placed in an oven for drying at 105 c for 30 min thereafter the temperature was reduced to 75 c until the samples were dried to a constant weight the weight after drying is called dry weight m2 the plant water content is defined as follows 1 p w c m 1 m 2 m 1 where pwc is the plant water content m 1 is the plant fresh weight and m 2 is the plant dry weight 2 3 3 construction of spectral parameters 2 3 3 1 spectral transforms this study includes nine spectral transforms namely division by r450 750 division by r930 reciprocal logarithm of reciprocal first order derivative of reciprocal logarithm first order derivative of logarithm absorption depth of 670 nm and first order derivative table 2 2 3 3 2 three edge parameters a total of 20 representative three edge parameters were included as shown in table 3 these parameters include the position amplitude and area of the three edges nine parameters the amplitude and position of the green peak and red valley four parameters the normalized value of the green peak and red valley along with their ratio two parameters and the ratio difference and normalized value of the three edge areas five parameters 2 3 4 model accuracy evaluation index the correlation coefficient r was used to measure the correlation between the canopy water contents and the original spectral reflectance the different spectral transforms or the three edge parameters of the winter wheat plants generally the correlation is high when the absolute value of r is high the correlation coefficient is given by the equation 2 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 the accuracy of the monitoring models was evaluated using the decision coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae a large r2 and small rmse and mae suggest high model accuracy 3 r 2 y i y i 2 y y i 2 4 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 5 m a e i 1 n y i y i n where xi is the measured value of the spectral parameters x is the average value of the spectral parameters yi is the measured water content of the canopy yi is the predicted water content of the canopy y represents the mean of the measured canopy water contents and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the canopy water content of winter wheat plants under different water treatments tables 4 show the canopy water contents of the winter wheat plants under different water treatments with the progress of the winter wheat growth stages the water content generally exhibited a decline in 2016 2017 the water content decreased from 0 758 g g 1 fw at the stem elongation booting stage to 0 538 g g 1 fw at the milking ripening stage declined by 29 0 in 2017 2018 the corresponding decrease was 31 3 that is from 0 744 g g 1 fw to 0 511 g g 1 fw with the different water treatments the canopy water content increased with the increase in watering amount each water treatment included pre sowing irrigation to ensure that the soil water storage was sufficient for healthy and full seedling emergence however low temperature prevailed from pre sowing irrigation to the booting stage resulting in low evapotranspiration for such reasons the water contents between water treatments at the stem elongation booting stage and at the booting milking stage varied slightly at the milking ripening stage the water content difference observed between treatment w2 and the other treatments reached a significant level in 2016 2017 and between treatment w1 w2 or w3 and the other treatments reached a very significant level in 2017 2018 the canopy water content varied from one growth stage to another and from one year to the next not only because of the different watering volumes but also because of precipitation and other meteorological factors varying from one growth stage to another 3 2 variation in canopy spectral reflectance of winter wheat plants under different water treatments the canopy spectral characteristics of the winter wheat plants under different water treatments are shown in fig 1 generally the canopy spectral characteristics of the plants behaved in the same way at the different growth stages in particular spectral reflectance was low in the visible light band and high in the near infrared band two distinct absorption valleys were observed in the blue violet 350 500 nm and red 650 710 nm bands a distinct reflection peak was observed in the green band 500 600 nm mainly because the crops due to chlorophyll action in photosynthesis absorbed a large amount of red and blue light and minimal green light after 690 nm spectral reflectance sharply increased thereby creating a high reflection platform i e the so called red edge phenomenon at 690 740 nm with the progress of the growth stages canopy spectral reflectance decreased considerably particularly in the near infrared band 760 1075 nm mainly because of changes in the leaf tissue structure at different growth stages el hendawy et al 2017 the canopy spectral characteristics of plants vary from one growth stage to another thus the monitoring accuracy of the spectral estimation model should be further verified based on the monitoring data of the entire growth period otherwise the monitoring accuracy requirements of each growth period would be difficult to meet in the visible light range the canopy reflectance of the winter wheat plants decreased with watering volume at the milking ripening stage the spectral reflectance difference between the different water treatments reached a very significant level in the near infrared range the canopy reflectance increased with the increase in watering volume the spectral reflectance difference between the different water treatments reached a significant level at each growth stage a significant difference in spectral reflectance existed at the different stages between the various water treatments a similar variation was observed in the canopy water content suggesting that a canopy water content estimation model can be developed based on spectral reflectance data 3 3 correlation between different spectral parameters and winter wheat canopy water content 3 3 1 spectral transforms the sensitive bands for different spectral transforms and their respective correlation coefficients were determined based on the rationale of the high correlation coefficient table 5 shows the results at the stem elongation booting stage the correlation corresponding to the sensitive bands was at a significant level under all transforms except for the division by r450 750 at 507 nm the first order derivative of reciprocal at 635 nm the first order derivative of logarithm at 791 nm and the first order derivative at 758 nm which corresponded to a correlation level of very significant at the booting milking stage the correlation corresponding to all the sensitive bands reached a very significant level except for the correlations corresponding to the absorption depth at 670 nm and the division by r450 750 whose correlation were below the significant level and at a significant level at the milking ripening stage the absolute values of the correlation coefficients corresponding to the sensitive bands under different spectral transforms were greater than 0 517 reaching a very significant level compared with the other growth stages the stem elongation booting stage showed lower correlations because the canopy water content varied insignificantly across the water treatments at this stage the top three transforms arranged in a descending order of the absolute value of correlation are provided below as follows for each stage at the stem elongation booting stage the top three are the first order derivative the first order derivative of reciprocal and the first order derivative of logarithm with corresponding sensitive bands of 758 635 and 791 nm respectively and corresponding absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 555 0 510 and 0 508 respectively at the booting milking stage the top three are the division by r930 the first order derivative and the reciprocal the corresponding sensitive bands are 759 568 and 751 nm respectively and the absolute values are 0 812 0 755 and 0 709 respectively at the milking ripening stage the top three are the division by r450 750 the first order derivative of logarithm and the division by r930 the corresponding sensitive bands are 690 720 and 693 nm respectively and the corresponding absolute values are 0 745 0 704 and 0 690 respectively a correlation analysis was performed between canopy water content and the corresponding spectral reflectance transforms to determine the sensitive band with each spectral transform throughout the entire growth period table 5 illustrates the sensitive bands for the various transforms at different growth stages the top three transforms are the division by r930 the first order derivative and the first order derivative of logarithm the corresponding sensitive bands are 759 733 and 718 nm and the absolute values of the correlation coefficients are 0 810 0 778 and 0 763 respectively in general the spectral transforms along with their respective sensitive bands have a high correlation coefficient with canopy water content differing from one growth stage to another therefore the sensitive bands and their correlation coefficients at different growth stages should be considered by the winter wheat canopy water content model to ensure that the simulation results are reasonable 3 3 2 three edge parameters table 6 illustrates the corresponding correlation coefficients between each three edge parameter and canopy water content on the basis of the rationale of the highest correlation coefficient at a particular growth stage the correlation coefficients corresponding to the different three edge parameters varied greatly in the stem elongation booting stage a very significant correlation was observed in rg rr meanwhile a significant correlation was observed in green peak amplitude red valley amplitude and rg rr rg rr no significant level of correlation was reached by the other three edge parameters at the booting milking stage a very significant correlation was observed in red edge amplitude blue edge amplitude green peak amplitude red edge area yellow edge area blue edge area rg rr rg rr rg rr sdr sdb sdr sdy and sdr sdy sdr sdy by contrast the correlation only reached a significant level in the case of yellow edge amplitude the correlation for the eight three edge parameters including red edge position blue edge position and yellow edge position was below the significant level at the milking ripening stage a less than significant correlation was observed for red edge amplitude red edge position blue edge amplitude blue edge position yellow edge position and blue edge area the 14 three edge parameters including yellow amplitude green peak amplitude and peak location reached a very significant level of correlation the top three three edge parameters arranged in a descending order of the absolute value of the corresponding correlation coefficient for each growth stage are given as follows at the stem elongation booting stage the top three are rg rr rg rr rg rr and red valley amplitude with absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 437 0 388 and 0 351 respectively at the booting milking stage the top three are sdr sdy sdr sdy sdr sdy and yellow edge area with absolute values of 0 751 0 738 and 0 699 respectively at the milking ripening stage the top three are rg rr rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb sdr sdb which have absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 757 0 746 and 0 698 respectively a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy water contents throughout the growth stages and the three edge parameters to determine the three edge parameters with high correlation throughout the growth stages table 6 shows the analysis results the top three are sdr sdb rg rr rg rr and red edge area with absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 736 0 723 and 0 720 respectively in summary the three edge parameters having a high correlation coefficient with the canopy water contents of winter wheat differ from one growth stage to another and are not constant for the entire growth period the three edge parameters included in the canopy water content model should consider the changes in correlation throughout the growth period to obtain accurate and reasonable estimation results 3 4 construction of spectral models of winter wheat canopy water content related studies have suggested that a unary linear regression equation relating spectral parameters to canopy water content is more universal than other models such as logarithm exponential power function or quadratic equation with one unknown chen et al 2018 therefore in this study the canopy water content models developed based on spectral transforms and three edged parameters are all made up of linear regression equations this feature facilitates the comparison and analysis of model performance 3 4 1 spectral transforms table 7 lists the canopy water content models developed based on spectral transforms three transforms namely the first order derivative 758 nm for the stem elongation booting stage division by r930 759 nm for the booting milking stage and division by r450 750 690 nm for the milking ripening stage were retained on the basis of the high correlation coefficient between spectral transform and winter wheat canopy water content at different growth stages then a suitable regression model called model 1 for different stages and transforms was developed a single parameter regression model called model 2 that offers certain accuracy was constructed from r930 759 nm for simplicity and practicality in spectral monitoring the model was built based on the principle of the highest correlation coefficient between spectral transforms at their sensitive bands and winter wheat canopy water content throughout the entire growth period table 8 presents the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients r2 of models 1 and 2 were 0 308 and 0 133 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 016 and 0 063 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 013 and 0 055 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 1 and 2 were 0 660 the rmses were 0 034 and 0 038 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 028 and 0 029 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the two models were 0 555 and 0 380 respectively the rmses were 0 042 and 0 065 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 032 and 0 052 g g 1 fw respectively in the entire growth period the decision coefficients of models 1 and 2 were 0 883 and 0 657 respectively with rmses of 0 034 and 0 058 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 025 and 0 046 g g 1 fw respectively of the two models model 1 has a higher determination coefficient and a smaller error at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period this result suggests that a reasonably constructed combinational spectral transform model can improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat plant canopy water content at each growth stage despite the high accuracy for the entire growth period the models may not perform satisfactorily at certain grow stages e g model 1 at the stem elongation booting stage and model 2 at the stem elongation booting and milking ripening stages this condition demonstrates that the evaluation indices for the entire growth period alone cannot assess model applicability in a specific growth period thus the simulation effect at each growth stage should be examined 3 4 2 three edge parameters the canopy water content models built based on three edge parameters are given in table 9 on the basis of the highest correlation coefficient at different growth stages between the canopy water contents and the three edge parameters three parameters namely rg rr for the stem elongation booting stage sdr sdy for the booting milking stage and rg rr rg rr for the milking ripening stage were retained then a suitable regression model called model 3 was constructed for the different stages and three edge parameters a single parameter regression model called model 4 that offers certain accuracy was constructed from sdr sdb which was determined based on the principle of the highest correlation coefficient throughout the entire growth period between the canopy water content and different three edge parameters table 10 shows the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients r2 of models 3 and 4 were 0 191 and 0 083 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 017 and 0 095 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 014 and 0 084 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 3 and 4 were 0 563 and 0 029 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 038 and 0 068 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 029 and 0 052 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the two models were 0 574 and 0 478 the rmses were 0 041 and 0 065 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 031 and 0 050 g g 1 fw respectively for the entire growth period the decision coefficients of models 3 and 4 were 0 875 and 0 412 respectively with rmses of 0 035 and 0 076 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 025 and 0 061 g g 1 fw respectively model 3 which did not ideally behave at the stem elongation booting stage had a determination coefficient greater than 0 56 at all the other stages and throughout the entire growth period model 4 performed a bit less ideally at the stem elongation booting and booting milking stages however this model had a determination coefficient greater than 0 41 at the milking ripening stage and throughout the full growth period this finding shows that an estimation model of the canopy water content of winter wheat constructed from the whole growth period data does not provide an optimal estimation at all growth stages of the two models model 4 had a lower determination coefficient and greater rmse and mae at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period this finding suggests that a combinational three edge parameter model specific to growth stages can improve the winter wheat plant canopy water content estimation accuracy at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period 3 4 3 canopy water content estimation models for winter wheat plants based on principal component analysis the spectral transforms and three edge parameters were selected based on their correlation with the canopy water contents at each growth stage of winter wheat those that had a very significant correlation with canopy water content were nine spectral parameters namely first order derivative of logarithm rg rr first order derivative sdr sdb rg rr rg rr division by r930 first order derivative of reciprocal reciprocal and green peak amplitude table 11 lists the correlation between the nine spectral parameters apart from green peak amplitude first order derivative sdr sdb division by r930 and reciprocal which were correlated with one another to less than a very significant level all other parameters were correlated with one another to a very significant level the absolute value of their correlation coefficients varied between 0 300 and 0 980 suggesting that a serious information overlap exists among these nine spectral variables linear transformation of the original spectral parameters by principal component analysis to eliminate some redundant information is a good means to achieve balance between the comprehensiveness and independence of the parameters therefore the principal component analysis method was used in this study to construct multi parameter canopy water content models the sign negative or positive of the correlation coefficients between the nine spectral parameters and the canopy water content of winter wheat plants were analyzed parameters with a negative correlation underwent co trend transform against the spectral parameters with a positive correlation the co trended parameters were standardized against each growth stage and the entire growth period the indices were evaluated for their covariance correlation coefficient matrix and contribution by each principal component the components with a cumulative contribution above 86 included the first three principal components in the case of the stem elongation booting stage the booting milking stage the milking ripening stage and the entire growth period with these components winter wheat canopy water content models were developed table 12 the principal component regression models for specific growth stages were under model 5 and the principal component regression model for the entire growth period was under model 6 table 13 shows the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 402 and 0 084 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 015 and 0 056 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 012 and 0 042 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 744 and 0 414 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 029 and 0 045 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 022 and 0 038 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 518 and 0 452 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 044 and 0 053 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 034 and 0 043 g g 1 fw respectively the decision coefficients of models 5 and 6 for the entire growth period were 0 886 and 0 725 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 033 and 0 052 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 024 and 0 041 g g 1 fw respectively the determination coefficients of model 5 at specific growth stages and throughout the entire growth period were greater than 0 40 meanwhile the determination coefficient of model 6 at the stem elongation booting stage was merely 0 084 whereas this coefficient at the booting milking stage was 0 414 at the milking ripening stage and throughout the entire growth period this coefficient was greater than 0 45 these results show that a model constructed for the entire growth period does not work well enough in simulating the canopy moisture content at specific growth stages the applicability and reliability of the model should then be evaluated in consideration of its performance at different growth stages and throughout the entire growth period model 6 simulates the water content with less accuracy than model 5 at all specific stages and throughout the entire growth period suggesting that using a principal component regression model specific to individual growth stages improves the estimation accuracy at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period 3 5 comparison of canopy water content spectral models of winter wheat the accuracy of the six winter wheat canopy water content monitoring models was evaluated in terms of decision coefficient r2 rmse and mae fig 2 the results show that with the combinational canopy water content models developed with specific growth stages in mind at the stem elongation booting stage models 1 3 and 5 had determination coefficients of 0 308 0 191 and 0 402 respectively with rmses of 0 016 0 017 and 0 015 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 013 0 014 and 0 012 g g 1 fw respectively evidently model 5 had the highest determination coefficient and the lowest errors among the three models thus having the highest simulation accuracy at the booting milking stage model 3 had a determination coefficient of 0 563 and an rmse of 0 038 g g 1 fw by contrast models 1 had a coefficient of 0 660 and an rmse of 0 034 g g 1 fw and models 5 had a coefficient of 0 744 and an rmse of 0 029 g g 1 fw hence models 5 had high simulation accuracy and low errors for this stage at the milking ripening stage models 1 3 and 5 had a determination coefficient above 0 510 and an rsme below 0 044 g g 1 fw therefore the three models had good simulation accuracy for this stage the determination coefficients of the three models for the entire growth period were all greater than 0 870 and the rmses were less than 0 034 g g 1 fw however model 5 was the best among the models because it produced a determination coefficient as high as 0 886 in summary model 5 had the highest simulation accuracy and the lowest simulation errors among the combinational winter wheat canopy water content models this model was the most reliable and stable for the suitable regression models of the entire growth period the determination coefficients of the three models at the stem elongation booting stage were below 0 133 at the booting milking stage model 4 had a determination coefficient of only 0 029 whereas models 2 and 6 had 0 660 and 0 414 respectively the rmses were 0 038 and 0 045 g g 1 fw respectively thus model 2 had the highest simulation accuracy at this stage at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the three models were 0 380 0 487 and 0 452 respectively and their rmses were 0 065 0 065 and 0 053 g g 1 fw respectively model 4 was the most accurate model for this growth stage the determination coefficients of the three models for the entire growth period were 0 657 0 412 and 0 725 respectively the respective rmses were 0 058 0 076 and 0 052 g g 1 fw model 6 had the most accurate prediction for the entire growth period in summary model 6 was the best regression model for winter wheat canopy water content throughout the entire growth period in terms of stability and reliability model 5 had a higher coefficient of determination and lower rsme and mae for individual growth stages and the entire growth period compared with model 6 thus a suitable combinational model constructed for specific stages performs better than a model that is constructed for the entire growth period for both types of models constructed for individual growth stages or for the entire growth period they provide larger determination coefficients and lower errors for the entire growth period than for other individual stages hence evaluation indices for the entire growth period are inapplicable to other individual stages 4 conclusions this work investigated the relationship between canopy water content and spectral reflectance under different water treatments winter wheat canopy water content models were developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters and the models were compared in terms of simulation accuracy the following conclusions were obtained 1 the winter wheat canopy water content generally decreases with growth advancement under the different water treatments in this study the canopy water content increased with the increase in irrigation volume in the visible light range canopy reflectance decreased with irrigation volume meanwhile canopy reflectance increased with the increase in irrigation volume in the near infrared range a significant difference in spectral reflectance at each stage was observed between the different water treatments a similar variation pattern was also noted in canopy water content suggesting that a canopy water content estimation model can be developed based on spectral reflectance data 2 during the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and the entire growth period the spectral transforms that had a high correlation with winter wheat canopy water content were the first order derivative division by r930 division by r450 750 and division by r930 respectively their corresponding sensitive bands were 758 759 690 and 759 nm respectively at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and the entire growth period the three edge parameters that had the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content were rg rr sdr sdy rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb respectively the spectral parameters that had the highest correlation with water content differed from stage to stage for this reason canopy water content models based on spectral information should be designed to provide allowance to the differences in growth period 3 with the rationale that the spectral transforms and three edge parameters at each growth stage should have the highest correlation coefficient with winter wheat canopy water content combinational models based on specific growth stages were constructed on the basis of the spectral transforms or three edge parameters these combinational models significantly improved the estimation accuracy of canopy water content at each growth stage compared with the optimal single parameter regression model for the entire growth period at the stem elongation booting stage milking ripening stage and the entire growth period the combinational model based on spectral transforms showed an increase in determination coefficient of 57 32 and 26 respectively at the stem elongation booting stage booting milking stage milking ripening stage and the entire growth period the combinational model based on the three edge parameters had an increase in determination coefficient of 57 92 15 and 54 respectively 4 the spectral indices were correlated with one another to a very significant level suggesting a gross information overlap between the indices the collinearity among the indices was eliminated by principal component analysis a principal component analysis monitoring model was constructed based on comprehensive spectral information compared with the combinational models based on spectral transforms this model significantly improved the monitoring accuracy at the stem elongation booting stage while maintaining its monitoring accuracy at the other growth stages moreover the model notably improved the monitoring accuracy at the other growth stages compared with the combinational models based on three edge parameters while significantly improving the monitoring accuracy at the stem elongation booting stage the principal component analysis monitoring models based on comprehensive spectral information performed effectively in terms of monitoring accuracy and stability at individual growth

10536,suitable spectral monitoring models of canopy water content provide a scientific basis for real time dynamic accurate non destructive diagnosis over large acreage this work investigates winter wheat under different water treatments to examine the relationship between canopy water content and spectral reflectance principal component regression spectral monitoring models are developed based on the combination of growth stages the growth stage constraints are divided and the influence of other background noises is removed to achieve accurate and stable spectral monitoring results of canopy water content at all growth stages the following main conclusions are derived 1 at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and during the entire growth period the spectral transforms with the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content are the first order derivative division by r930 division by r450 750 and division by r930 respectively the corresponding sensitivity bands are 758 759 690 and 759 nm respectively at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and during the entire growth period the three edge parameters with the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content are rg rr sdr sdy rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb respectively 2 in accordance with the rationale that the spectral parameters should have the highest correlation coefficients with canopy water content at each growth stage combinational models of canopy water content that are specific to individual growth stages are developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters compared with the optimal single parameter regression model the combinational models significantly improve the estimation accuracy of canopy water content at each growth stage 3 monitoring models based on principal component analysis are constructed with comprehensive spectral information these models can improve the monitoring accuracy at other growth stages especially at the stem elongation booting stage compared with combinational models developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters keywords winter wheat canopy water content spectral transforms three edge parameters combinational model principal component regression model 1 introduction water is one of the main factors that restrain crop growth water deficit has a direct impact on the physiological and biochemical processes and morphological structure of plants and ultimately leads to yield reduction or poor crop quality zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a 2018b gopal et al 2019 zhang and zhou 2019 therefore large scale real time monitoring of plant water content has theoretical and practical importance for improving the level of crop water management and enhancing the quality and water use efficiency of crops ullah et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a 2018b according to the china statistical yearbook winter wheat is one of the primary grain crops in north china and accounts for more than 30 of the total planting acreage in this region the annual temporal distribution of precipitation is poorly synchronized with the water demand of winter wheat due to the monsoon influence and this lack of synchronization causes frequent droughts during the growth period real time dynamic accurate monitoring data on canopy water content should be acquired to achieve stable and high winter wheat yields in this region such data can also be used to compensate for the water deficit via irrigation during the growth period plant water deficit changes the physiological and biochemical characteristics of winter wheat and its canopy spectral characteristics accordingly the canopy water content can be monitored by spectral means duan et al 2019 oven drying is a traditional plant water content monitoring method that involves destructive sampling and its monitoring process is time consuming and laborious this method cannot effectively reveal dynamic changes in individual plant water content liu et al 2015 angela et al 2017 however with the rapid development of spectral technology the spectral spatiotemporal resolution has improved considerably and now provides technical support for real time dynamic and precise non destructive monitoring of plant water content over large acreage many scholars have performed substantial research on the spectral monitoring of plant water content and created various plant water content spectral estimation models mirzaie et al 2014 kendall et al 2016 el hendawy et al 2019 ma et al 2019 many studies are restricted to the construction of water content spectral monitoring models for specific growth stages due to the limited sampling size of destructive tests or poor weather conditions during the growth period given that the spectral characteristics of plants vary significantly across growth stages panigrahi and das 2018 whether growth stage specific spectral models are applicable to the monitoring of plant water content throughout the entire growth period is questionable for convenience several scholars have conducted comparative studies on the simulation effects of various models at different growth stages to develop spectral monitoring models of plant water content that are applicable to the entire growth period hunt et al 2016 however the accuracy and applicability of such models need to be verified further before model application spectral reflectance varies from one growth stage to the next due to the variation in the various morph physiological characteristics of the plant at the canopy level at different growth stages thus spectral monitoring models built for the entire growth period are likely to exhibit different accuracies when applied to various growth stages the monitoring accuracy of these models must be improved to meet the precision requirements of crop water management high spectral resolution amplifies spectral information and temporarily creates interference from background noise zhang et al 2018a 2018b studies have shown that such fundamental transforms of reflectance spectral information as reciprocal logarithmic and derivative operations can reduce background and noise effects and enhance spectral absorption and extraction features thus improving the simulation accuracy of models wang et al 2014 the three edge parameters position amplitude and area and the spectral indices constructed with these parameters can reveal the spectral characteristics of green vegetation the three edge parameters are sensitive to the leaf area index nitrogen content and chlorophyll content guo et al 2018 xie et al 2018 however little research has focused on the monitoring of plant water content by using the three edge parameters thus establishing plant canopy water content models on the basis of the spectral three edge parameters is recommended a considerable information overlap exists among independent variables composed of single type data such as the three edge parameters and basic transforms of spectral information compared with a univariate model a principal component analysis model solves the collinearity problem among the original indices via linear transformation therefore crop canopy water content estimation models based on the principal component analysis exhibit high simulation accuracy feng et al 2013 this work takes north china winter wheat as the research object on the basis of spectral reflectance and wheat canopy water content data at different growth stages in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 the study examines how the three edge parameters and the basic transforms of spectral information are related to canopy water content suitable combinational models that account for the characteristics of each growth stage and provide high monitoring accuracy are developed principal component analysis estimation models of canopy water content are built these models consider the three edge parameters and basic transforms of spectral information to provide theoretical basis and technical support for hyperspectral diagnosis of winter wheat water content in north china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted at the irrigation experiment station of china institute of water resources and hydropower research daxing beijing the station which is located at 39 37 n and 116 26 e has a semi arid and continental monsoon climate and is dry in winter and spring and rainy in summer the annual average sunshine is approximately 2600 h the annual average rainfall is 540 mm and the annual average temperature is 12 1 c the annual frost free period is 185 d and the annual average evaporation from a free water surface is above 1800 mm 2 2 design of the experiment the tested winter wheat variety was zhongmai 175 the sowing and harvesting dates in 2016 2017 were october 6 2016 and june 7 2017 respectively the sowing and harvesting dates in 2017 2018 were october 13 2017 and june 6 2018 respectively the five stages were pre sowing sowing wintering tillering stem elongation stem elongation booting and booting milking in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 four treatments i e w2 w3 w4 w5 and five treatments i e w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 were provided in three replications respectively a total of 12 plots in 2016 2017 and 15 plots in 2017 2018 were studied and each plot covered approximately 60 m2 table 1 shows the watering treatments the plants were irrigated from groundwater and the watering volume was metered before sowing a compound fertilizer 15 n 15 p2o5 and 15 k2o was applied as the base fertilizer at the stem elongation booting stage urea was applied with irrigation and after rainfall as the top dressing in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 respectively the amount of fertilizer applied was 225 kg ha each time the fertilization level was the same across the plots field management including sowing weeding pesticide spraying and other agronomic work was consistent with local farmers practice 2 3 items to be measured and methods 2 3 1 spectral monitoring of the canopies during the growth period of the winter wheat the canopy spectral reflectance was measured on a sunny windless or breezy day by using field spec handheld2 a handheld ground spectrometer manufactured by american asd company the effective band range of this spectrometer is 325 1075 nm with a sampling interval of 1 nm and a resolution of 3 nm the time for spectral reflectance measuring was 10 00 am to 12 00 am before each measurement a white plate with a reflectance of 1 was used to calibrate the spectrometer wheat canopy reflectance was measured with the probe held approximately 15 cm directly above pointing to the canopy and the field of view angle of the spectrometer was 25 liu et al 2019 ten measurements were conducted for each point to ensure measurement accuracy and reliability and their average value was taken as each point s spectral reflectance in each plot measurements were obtained at three representative locations and the average value was used as the canopy spectral reflectance in 2016 2017 the canopy spectral reflectance was measured five times at the stem elongation booting 23 april the booting milking 6 may 13 may and the milking ripening 20 may 26 may respectively in 2017 2018 the canopy spectral reflectance was measured at the stem elongation booting 27 april the booting milking 5 may and the milking ripening 23 may 28 may respectively 2 3 2 determination of plant water content after sampling twenty representative plants measured by spectrum of each location so a total of 60 plants of each plot were taken to the laboratory without delay and their fresh weight m1 was determined the samples were then placed in an oven for drying at 105 c for 30 min thereafter the temperature was reduced to 75 c until the samples were dried to a constant weight the weight after drying is called dry weight m2 the plant water content is defined as follows 1 p w c m 1 m 2 m 1 where pwc is the plant water content m 1 is the plant fresh weight and m 2 is the plant dry weight 2 3 3 construction of spectral parameters 2 3 3 1 spectral transforms this study includes nine spectral transforms namely division by r450 750 division by r930 reciprocal logarithm of reciprocal first order derivative of reciprocal logarithm first order derivative of logarithm absorption depth of 670 nm and first order derivative table 2 2 3 3 2 three edge parameters a total of 20 representative three edge parameters were included as shown in table 3 these parameters include the position amplitude and area of the three edges nine parameters the amplitude and position of the green peak and red valley four parameters the normalized value of the green peak and red valley along with their ratio two parameters and the ratio difference and normalized value of the three edge areas five parameters 2 3 4 model accuracy evaluation index the correlation coefficient r was used to measure the correlation between the canopy water contents and the original spectral reflectance the different spectral transforms or the three edge parameters of the winter wheat plants generally the correlation is high when the absolute value of r is high the correlation coefficient is given by the equation 2 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 the accuracy of the monitoring models was evaluated using the decision coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae a large r2 and small rmse and mae suggest high model accuracy 3 r 2 y i y i 2 y y i 2 4 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 5 m a e i 1 n y i y i n where xi is the measured value of the spectral parameters x is the average value of the spectral parameters yi is the measured water content of the canopy yi is the predicted water content of the canopy y represents the mean of the measured canopy water contents and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the canopy water content of winter wheat plants under different water treatments tables 4 show the canopy water contents of the winter wheat plants under different water treatments with the progress of the winter wheat growth stages the water content generally exhibited a decline in 2016 2017 the water content decreased from 0 758 g g 1 fw at the stem elongation booting stage to 0 538 g g 1 fw at the milking ripening stage declined by 29 0 in 2017 2018 the corresponding decrease was 31 3 that is from 0 744 g g 1 fw to 0 511 g g 1 fw with the different water treatments the canopy water content increased with the increase in watering amount each water treatment included pre sowing irrigation to ensure that the soil water storage was sufficient for healthy and full seedling emergence however low temperature prevailed from pre sowing irrigation to the booting stage resulting in low evapotranspiration for such reasons the water contents between water treatments at the stem elongation booting stage and at the booting milking stage varied slightly at the milking ripening stage the water content difference observed between treatment w2 and the other treatments reached a significant level in 2016 2017 and between treatment w1 w2 or w3 and the other treatments reached a very significant level in 2017 2018 the canopy water content varied from one growth stage to another and from one year to the next not only because of the different watering volumes but also because of precipitation and other meteorological factors varying from one growth stage to another 3 2 variation in canopy spectral reflectance of winter wheat plants under different water treatments the canopy spectral characteristics of the winter wheat plants under different water treatments are shown in fig 1 generally the canopy spectral characteristics of the plants behaved in the same way at the different growth stages in particular spectral reflectance was low in the visible light band and high in the near infrared band two distinct absorption valleys were observed in the blue violet 350 500 nm and red 650 710 nm bands a distinct reflection peak was observed in the green band 500 600 nm mainly because the crops due to chlorophyll action in photosynthesis absorbed a large amount of red and blue light and minimal green light after 690 nm spectral reflectance sharply increased thereby creating a high reflection platform i e the so called red edge phenomenon at 690 740 nm with the progress of the growth stages canopy spectral reflectance decreased considerably particularly in the near infrared band 760 1075 nm mainly because of changes in the leaf tissue structure at different growth stages el hendawy et al 2017 the canopy spectral characteristics of plants vary from one growth stage to another thus the monitoring accuracy of the spectral estimation model should be further verified based on the monitoring data of the entire growth period otherwise the monitoring accuracy requirements of each growth period would be difficult to meet in the visible light range the canopy reflectance of the winter wheat plants decreased with watering volume at the milking ripening stage the spectral reflectance difference between the different water treatments reached a very significant level in the near infrared range the canopy reflectance increased with the increase in watering volume the spectral reflectance difference between the different water treatments reached a significant level at each growth stage a significant difference in spectral reflectance existed at the different stages between the various water treatments a similar variation was observed in the canopy water content suggesting that a canopy water content estimation model can be developed based on spectral reflectance data 3 3 correlation between different spectral parameters and winter wheat canopy water content 3 3 1 spectral transforms the sensitive bands for different spectral transforms and their respective correlation coefficients were determined based on the rationale of the high correlation coefficient table 5 shows the results at the stem elongation booting stage the correlation corresponding to the sensitive bands was at a significant level under all transforms except for the division by r450 750 at 507 nm the first order derivative of reciprocal at 635 nm the first order derivative of logarithm at 791 nm and the first order derivative at 758 nm which corresponded to a correlation level of very significant at the booting milking stage the correlation corresponding to all the sensitive bands reached a very significant level except for the correlations corresponding to the absorption depth at 670 nm and the division by r450 750 whose correlation were below the significant level and at a significant level at the milking ripening stage the absolute values of the correlation coefficients corresponding to the sensitive bands under different spectral transforms were greater than 0 517 reaching a very significant level compared with the other growth stages the stem elongation booting stage showed lower correlations because the canopy water content varied insignificantly across the water treatments at this stage the top three transforms arranged in a descending order of the absolute value of correlation are provided below as follows for each stage at the stem elongation booting stage the top three are the first order derivative the first order derivative of reciprocal and the first order derivative of logarithm with corresponding sensitive bands of 758 635 and 791 nm respectively and corresponding absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 555 0 510 and 0 508 respectively at the booting milking stage the top three are the division by r930 the first order derivative and the reciprocal the corresponding sensitive bands are 759 568 and 751 nm respectively and the absolute values are 0 812 0 755 and 0 709 respectively at the milking ripening stage the top three are the division by r450 750 the first order derivative of logarithm and the division by r930 the corresponding sensitive bands are 690 720 and 693 nm respectively and the corresponding absolute values are 0 745 0 704 and 0 690 respectively a correlation analysis was performed between canopy water content and the corresponding spectral reflectance transforms to determine the sensitive band with each spectral transform throughout the entire growth period table 5 illustrates the sensitive bands for the various transforms at different growth stages the top three transforms are the division by r930 the first order derivative and the first order derivative of logarithm the corresponding sensitive bands are 759 733 and 718 nm and the absolute values of the correlation coefficients are 0 810 0 778 and 0 763 respectively in general the spectral transforms along with their respective sensitive bands have a high correlation coefficient with canopy water content differing from one growth stage to another therefore the sensitive bands and their correlation coefficients at different growth stages should be considered by the winter wheat canopy water content model to ensure that the simulation results are reasonable 3 3 2 three edge parameters table 6 illustrates the corresponding correlation coefficients between each three edge parameter and canopy water content on the basis of the rationale of the highest correlation coefficient at a particular growth stage the correlation coefficients corresponding to the different three edge parameters varied greatly in the stem elongation booting stage a very significant correlation was observed in rg rr meanwhile a significant correlation was observed in green peak amplitude red valley amplitude and rg rr rg rr no significant level of correlation was reached by the other three edge parameters at the booting milking stage a very significant correlation was observed in red edge amplitude blue edge amplitude green peak amplitude red edge area yellow edge area blue edge area rg rr rg rr rg rr sdr sdb sdr sdy and sdr sdy sdr sdy by contrast the correlation only reached a significant level in the case of yellow edge amplitude the correlation for the eight three edge parameters including red edge position blue edge position and yellow edge position was below the significant level at the milking ripening stage a less than significant correlation was observed for red edge amplitude red edge position blue edge amplitude blue edge position yellow edge position and blue edge area the 14 three edge parameters including yellow amplitude green peak amplitude and peak location reached a very significant level of correlation the top three three edge parameters arranged in a descending order of the absolute value of the corresponding correlation coefficient for each growth stage are given as follows at the stem elongation booting stage the top three are rg rr rg rr rg rr and red valley amplitude with absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 437 0 388 and 0 351 respectively at the booting milking stage the top three are sdr sdy sdr sdy sdr sdy and yellow edge area with absolute values of 0 751 0 738 and 0 699 respectively at the milking ripening stage the top three are rg rr rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb sdr sdb which have absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 757 0 746 and 0 698 respectively a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy water contents throughout the growth stages and the three edge parameters to determine the three edge parameters with high correlation throughout the growth stages table 6 shows the analysis results the top three are sdr sdb rg rr rg rr and red edge area with absolute values of correlation coefficients of 0 736 0 723 and 0 720 respectively in summary the three edge parameters having a high correlation coefficient with the canopy water contents of winter wheat differ from one growth stage to another and are not constant for the entire growth period the three edge parameters included in the canopy water content model should consider the changes in correlation throughout the growth period to obtain accurate and reasonable estimation results 3 4 construction of spectral models of winter wheat canopy water content related studies have suggested that a unary linear regression equation relating spectral parameters to canopy water content is more universal than other models such as logarithm exponential power function or quadratic equation with one unknown chen et al 2018 therefore in this study the canopy water content models developed based on spectral transforms and three edged parameters are all made up of linear regression equations this feature facilitates the comparison and analysis of model performance 3 4 1 spectral transforms table 7 lists the canopy water content models developed based on spectral transforms three transforms namely the first order derivative 758 nm for the stem elongation booting stage division by r930 759 nm for the booting milking stage and division by r450 750 690 nm for the milking ripening stage were retained on the basis of the high correlation coefficient between spectral transform and winter wheat canopy water content at different growth stages then a suitable regression model called model 1 for different stages and transforms was developed a single parameter regression model called model 2 that offers certain accuracy was constructed from r930 759 nm for simplicity and practicality in spectral monitoring the model was built based on the principle of the highest correlation coefficient between spectral transforms at their sensitive bands and winter wheat canopy water content throughout the entire growth period table 8 presents the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients r2 of models 1 and 2 were 0 308 and 0 133 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 016 and 0 063 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 013 and 0 055 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 1 and 2 were 0 660 the rmses were 0 034 and 0 038 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 028 and 0 029 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the two models were 0 555 and 0 380 respectively the rmses were 0 042 and 0 065 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 032 and 0 052 g g 1 fw respectively in the entire growth period the decision coefficients of models 1 and 2 were 0 883 and 0 657 respectively with rmses of 0 034 and 0 058 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 025 and 0 046 g g 1 fw respectively of the two models model 1 has a higher determination coefficient and a smaller error at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period this result suggests that a reasonably constructed combinational spectral transform model can improve the estimation accuracy of winter wheat plant canopy water content at each growth stage despite the high accuracy for the entire growth period the models may not perform satisfactorily at certain grow stages e g model 1 at the stem elongation booting stage and model 2 at the stem elongation booting and milking ripening stages this condition demonstrates that the evaluation indices for the entire growth period alone cannot assess model applicability in a specific growth period thus the simulation effect at each growth stage should be examined 3 4 2 three edge parameters the canopy water content models built based on three edge parameters are given in table 9 on the basis of the highest correlation coefficient at different growth stages between the canopy water contents and the three edge parameters three parameters namely rg rr for the stem elongation booting stage sdr sdy for the booting milking stage and rg rr rg rr for the milking ripening stage were retained then a suitable regression model called model 3 was constructed for the different stages and three edge parameters a single parameter regression model called model 4 that offers certain accuracy was constructed from sdr sdb which was determined based on the principle of the highest correlation coefficient throughout the entire growth period between the canopy water content and different three edge parameters table 10 shows the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients r2 of models 3 and 4 were 0 191 and 0 083 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 017 and 0 095 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 014 and 0 084 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 3 and 4 were 0 563 and 0 029 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 038 and 0 068 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 029 and 0 052 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the two models were 0 574 and 0 478 the rmses were 0 041 and 0 065 g g 1 fw respectively and the maes were 0 031 and 0 050 g g 1 fw respectively for the entire growth period the decision coefficients of models 3 and 4 were 0 875 and 0 412 respectively with rmses of 0 035 and 0 076 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 025 and 0 061 g g 1 fw respectively model 3 which did not ideally behave at the stem elongation booting stage had a determination coefficient greater than 0 56 at all the other stages and throughout the entire growth period model 4 performed a bit less ideally at the stem elongation booting and booting milking stages however this model had a determination coefficient greater than 0 41 at the milking ripening stage and throughout the full growth period this finding shows that an estimation model of the canopy water content of winter wheat constructed from the whole growth period data does not provide an optimal estimation at all growth stages of the two models model 4 had a lower determination coefficient and greater rmse and mae at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period this finding suggests that a combinational three edge parameter model specific to growth stages can improve the winter wheat plant canopy water content estimation accuracy at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period 3 4 3 canopy water content estimation models for winter wheat plants based on principal component analysis the spectral transforms and three edge parameters were selected based on their correlation with the canopy water contents at each growth stage of winter wheat those that had a very significant correlation with canopy water content were nine spectral parameters namely first order derivative of logarithm rg rr first order derivative sdr sdb rg rr rg rr division by r930 first order derivative of reciprocal reciprocal and green peak amplitude table 11 lists the correlation between the nine spectral parameters apart from green peak amplitude first order derivative sdr sdb division by r930 and reciprocal which were correlated with one another to less than a very significant level all other parameters were correlated with one another to a very significant level the absolute value of their correlation coefficients varied between 0 300 and 0 980 suggesting that a serious information overlap exists among these nine spectral variables linear transformation of the original spectral parameters by principal component analysis to eliminate some redundant information is a good means to achieve balance between the comprehensiveness and independence of the parameters therefore the principal component analysis method was used in this study to construct multi parameter canopy water content models the sign negative or positive of the correlation coefficients between the nine spectral parameters and the canopy water content of winter wheat plants were analyzed parameters with a negative correlation underwent co trend transform against the spectral parameters with a positive correlation the co trended parameters were standardized against each growth stage and the entire growth period the indices were evaluated for their covariance correlation coefficient matrix and contribution by each principal component the components with a cumulative contribution above 86 included the first three principal components in the case of the stem elongation booting stage the booting milking stage the milking ripening stage and the entire growth period with these components winter wheat canopy water content models were developed table 12 the principal component regression models for specific growth stages were under model 5 and the principal component regression model for the entire growth period was under model 6 table 13 shows the models and their evaluation indices at the stem elongation booting stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 402 and 0 084 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 015 and 0 056 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 012 and 0 042 g g 1 fw respectively at the booting milking stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 744 and 0 414 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 029 and 0 045 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 022 and 0 038 g g 1 fw respectively at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of models 5 and 6 were 0 518 and 0 452 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 044 and 0 053 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 034 and 0 043 g g 1 fw respectively the decision coefficients of models 5 and 6 for the entire growth period were 0 886 and 0 725 respectively the corresponding rmses were 0 033 and 0 052 g g 1 fw and the maes were 0 024 and 0 041 g g 1 fw respectively the determination coefficients of model 5 at specific growth stages and throughout the entire growth period were greater than 0 40 meanwhile the determination coefficient of model 6 at the stem elongation booting stage was merely 0 084 whereas this coefficient at the booting milking stage was 0 414 at the milking ripening stage and throughout the entire growth period this coefficient was greater than 0 45 these results show that a model constructed for the entire growth period does not work well enough in simulating the canopy moisture content at specific growth stages the applicability and reliability of the model should then be evaluated in consideration of its performance at different growth stages and throughout the entire growth period model 6 simulates the water content with less accuracy than model 5 at all specific stages and throughout the entire growth period suggesting that using a principal component regression model specific to individual growth stages improves the estimation accuracy at each growth stage and throughout the entire growth period 3 5 comparison of canopy water content spectral models of winter wheat the accuracy of the six winter wheat canopy water content monitoring models was evaluated in terms of decision coefficient r2 rmse and mae fig 2 the results show that with the combinational canopy water content models developed with specific growth stages in mind at the stem elongation booting stage models 1 3 and 5 had determination coefficients of 0 308 0 191 and 0 402 respectively with rmses of 0 016 0 017 and 0 015 g g 1 fw and maes of 0 013 0 014 and 0 012 g g 1 fw respectively evidently model 5 had the highest determination coefficient and the lowest errors among the three models thus having the highest simulation accuracy at the booting milking stage model 3 had a determination coefficient of 0 563 and an rmse of 0 038 g g 1 fw by contrast models 1 had a coefficient of 0 660 and an rmse of 0 034 g g 1 fw and models 5 had a coefficient of 0 744 and an rmse of 0 029 g g 1 fw hence models 5 had high simulation accuracy and low errors for this stage at the milking ripening stage models 1 3 and 5 had a determination coefficient above 0 510 and an rsme below 0 044 g g 1 fw therefore the three models had good simulation accuracy for this stage the determination coefficients of the three models for the entire growth period were all greater than 0 870 and the rmses were less than 0 034 g g 1 fw however model 5 was the best among the models because it produced a determination coefficient as high as 0 886 in summary model 5 had the highest simulation accuracy and the lowest simulation errors among the combinational winter wheat canopy water content models this model was the most reliable and stable for the suitable regression models of the entire growth period the determination coefficients of the three models at the stem elongation booting stage were below 0 133 at the booting milking stage model 4 had a determination coefficient of only 0 029 whereas models 2 and 6 had 0 660 and 0 414 respectively the rmses were 0 038 and 0 045 g g 1 fw respectively thus model 2 had the highest simulation accuracy at this stage at the milking ripening stage the determination coefficients of the three models were 0 380 0 487 and 0 452 respectively and their rmses were 0 065 0 065 and 0 053 g g 1 fw respectively model 4 was the most accurate model for this growth stage the determination coefficients of the three models for the entire growth period were 0 657 0 412 and 0 725 respectively the respective rmses were 0 058 0 076 and 0 052 g g 1 fw model 6 had the most accurate prediction for the entire growth period in summary model 6 was the best regression model for winter wheat canopy water content throughout the entire growth period in terms of stability and reliability model 5 had a higher coefficient of determination and lower rsme and mae for individual growth stages and the entire growth period compared with model 6 thus a suitable combinational model constructed for specific stages performs better than a model that is constructed for the entire growth period for both types of models constructed for individual growth stages or for the entire growth period they provide larger determination coefficients and lower errors for the entire growth period than for other individual stages hence evaluation indices for the entire growth period are inapplicable to other individual stages 4 conclusions this work investigated the relationship between canopy water content and spectral reflectance under different water treatments winter wheat canopy water content models were developed based on spectral transforms or three edge parameters and the models were compared in terms of simulation accuracy the following conclusions were obtained 1 the winter wheat canopy water content generally decreases with growth advancement under the different water treatments in this study the canopy water content increased with the increase in irrigation volume in the visible light range canopy reflectance decreased with irrigation volume meanwhile canopy reflectance increased with the increase in irrigation volume in the near infrared range a significant difference in spectral reflectance at each stage was observed between the different water treatments a similar variation pattern was also noted in canopy water content suggesting that a canopy water content estimation model can be developed based on spectral reflectance data 2 during the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and the entire growth period the spectral transforms that had a high correlation with winter wheat canopy water content were the first order derivative division by r930 division by r450 750 and division by r930 respectively their corresponding sensitive bands were 758 759 690 and 759 nm respectively at the stem elongation booting booting milking and milking ripening stages and the entire growth period the three edge parameters that had the highest correlation with winter wheat canopy water content were rg rr sdr sdy rg rr rg rr and sdr sdb respectively the spectral parameters that had the highest correlation with water content differed from stage to stage for this reason canopy water content models based on spectral information should be designed to provide allowance to the differences in growth period 3 with the rationale that the spectral transforms and three edge parameters at each growth stage should have the highest correlation coefficient with winter wheat canopy water content combinational models based on specific growth stages were constructed on the basis of the spectral transforms or three edge parameters these combinational models significantly improved the estimation accuracy of canopy water content at each growth stage compared with the optimal single parameter regression model for the entire growth period at the stem elongation booting stage milking ripening stage and the entire growth period the combinational model based on spectral transforms showed an increase in determination coefficient of 57 32 and 26 respectively at the stem elongation booting stage booting milking stage milking ripening stage and the entire growth period the combinational model based on the three edge parameters had an increase in determination coefficient of 57 92 15 and 54 respectively 4 the spectral indices were correlated with one another to a very significant level suggesting a gross information overlap between the indices the collinearity among the indices was eliminated by principal component analysis a principal component analysis monitoring model was constructed based on comprehensive spectral information compared with the combinational models based on spectral transforms this model significantly improved the monitoring accuracy at the stem elongation booting stage while maintaining its monitoring accuracy at the other growth stages moreover the model notably improved the monitoring accuracy at the other growth stages compared with the combinational models based on three edge parameters while significantly improving the monitoring accuracy at the stem elongation booting stage the principal component analysis monitoring models based on comprehensive spectral information performed effectively in terms of monitoring accuracy and stability at individual growth

10537,the managements of fertilization and surface mulching in apple orchards have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and soil nitrate movement in field ecosystem however the research to date had tended to focus on single measure rather than both together the aims of this study were to determine how integrated management for apple orchards influenced spatial and temporal changes of soil water content swc and soil water storage sws illustrate the effects on reducing soil nitrate accumulation sna and promoting n uptake determine the impacts of water use efficiency wue and apple yield we applied three treatments for demonstration contrast experiments traditional farming measure chemical fertilizer fm existing management measure chemical fertilizer plus manure plastic film mulch in row em and optimized management measure chemical fertilizer plus manure plastic film mulch in row and cover crop inter row om we found that the swc in 3 m soil layers was influenced by the tree growth period the clearly benefits of om to invariably increase sws in 3 m soil layer were observed in different period especially in dry year during the tree growth the om treatment significantly increased rainwater retention in deep soil below 1 m and received a maximum value of sws in 3 m soil layers apple yield was significantly enhanced in om but the water consumption in each treatment had no obvious difference and consequently wue was elevated compared with em and fm the sna after the apple harvest was significantly decreased under the om especially in 2 3 m soil depth meanwhile total n in fruits and leaves in om were significant higher than fm indicating that the risk of n leaching was reduced and the n was effectively used by trees regression relationships between sna and sws were significantly negative in the dry year means that the om would perform better in mitigating soil desiccation and soil nitrate leaching in dry climatic condition this study highlights integrated soil management is a considerable practice for apple orchards in loess plateau and the rain fed area around the world keywords cover crop plastic mulch manure wue nue soil nitrate accumulation n uptake 1 introduction apple is the fourth most important fruit crop around the word following all citrus types grapes and bananas forsline et al 2010 according to faostat 2018 china has become the largest apple producer in the world representing around 45 55 of the world s total production 39 24 106 t in 2018 however the annual yield in china still remains low and is significantly lower than that of other dominant apple producing countries including new zealand the united states and brazil zhang et al 2019a in the context of increasingly limited agricultural productive capacity increasing apple production still has a great challenge the loess plateau in china where is the biggest high quality apple production place due to the suitable sunshine and temperature for apple tree growth li et al 2018 however rainfall is the main resource of water for agriculture in this region because of the cost of irrigation is expensive song et al 2018 and 60 of the annual precipitation occurs during july and september summer when the evaporation precipitation ratio is extremely high zheng et al 2017 in addition to the limitation of the water for agricultural the soil fertility is poor in this arable land with the contents of soil organic matter som and total nitrogen tn are below 1 0 and range from 0 001 to 0 178 respectively tang 2004 base on the above reasons in order to ensure the sustainable development of the apple industry appropriate orchard managements are badly needed mulching measure a management which is widespread used as water conservation technique in arable dryland suo et al 2019 data from previous researches suggested that water use efficiency increased by 21 50 under plastic film mulch treatment due to the reduction of soil evaporation sun et al 2012b it was also now well established from a variety of studies that the total n uptake in plastic mulch was 72 5 greater and the estimated n leaching was much lower than no mulch guo et al 2019 additionally according to a meta analysis the mean effect of plastic mulching on nitrogen use efficiency was 35 78 qin et al 2015 and the grain yield was invariably increased by 35 when combined with straw mulch chen et al 2015 on the contrary studies had also shown that the n uptake by crop in mulch soil was decreased which was attributed to a dilution effect of increased soil n availability due to the stimulated n mineralization and plastic mulch is a physical barrier that reduces ammonia volatilization which could retain more n in soil and increase n leaching liu et al 2015 cover crop is a kind of organic mulching which had previously been observed that can promote rainfall infiltration after the thick roots decay and form channels archer et al 2002 acharya et al 2019 reported that the soil moisture content in 0 30 cm depth was increased by 3 5 compared to control plots meanwhile the cover crop especially nonlegumes can substantially reduce no3 nleaching by 56 thapa et al 2018 while the no3 n decreased after cover crops by 30 regardless if the cover crop species was or was not legume alvarez et al 2017 however another researches reported that the soil water storage was reduced because the increased water use in the cover crop as a result of evapotranspiration krstić et al 2018 and the apple yield under grass cover treatment remained at a low level by reason of the competition for nutrients and water suo et al 2019 therefore the mulching measures should be considered carefully before implementation the application of chemical fertilizers has a pivotal role in increasing crop yield in order to meet the food needs with limit arable land the mode of high input and high output has been adopted in many regions in china as a consequence china is now the largest producer and consumer of synthetic fertilizers accounting for ca 35 of the global total consumption sun et al 2012a in order to achieve sustainable development of grain production china passed through the action plan about the reduction of chemical fertilizers in 2018 wu and ge 2019 in agricultural production excessive use of chemical fertilizer had accentuated the problem of nutrient and yield loss long term in situ experiment had established that chemical fertilizer can acidify the soil and reduce soil fertility compared with manure or no fertilizer treatment ozlu and kumar 2018 thus reduced yield the application of organic fertilizer had a well impact on yield improvement however the risk of nitrate leaching would be elevated when the manure was used because of the desynchrony of n supply kirchmann and bergström 2007 furthermore application of manure would cause the same level of no3 n leaching as in chemical fertilizer application over longer periods maeda et al 2003 but the manure had also been applied to reduce nitrate leaching in agricultural soils zheng et al 2013 the ratio between manure and chemical fertilizer is another considerable factor of improving crop productive for instance studies had shown that there was no obvious advantage to crop yields between 7500 kg ha 1 year 1 and 15 000 kg ha 1 year 1 organic fertilizer plus the same ratio of chemical fertilizer but all significantly lower than 22 500 kg ha 1 year 1 ding et al 2012 and the optimal ratio of organic and inorganic fertilizer is still unclear it is also unidentified that whether substantial amounts of organic manure amendment could influence the apple production and soil meanwhile apple trees are perennial plant compared with some field crops e g wheat corn the demand of nutrient is different in each growth stage for example the net accumulation of n p in leaves and fruit was decreased sharply from budbreak to fruit harvest and a large proportion of the k accumulation 77 4 occurred from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest cheng and raba 2009 nutrients with the exception of k accumulated in the bourse shoots at the highest rate during fruit setting zanotelli et al 2014 on the other hand numerous studies have shown that the main water consumption period of apple trees is from june to october water consumption increases slowly in budding period increases rapidly in fruit setting peaks in fruit swelling and is low in fruit maturing chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 which means the demand of nutrient and water by tree was different at each growth stage therefore the fertilizer management and floor management should be adjusted in combination with tree growth and development characteristics for example the system of a spring n application plus cover crops could reduce nitrate leaching than the control kaspar et al 2007 optimal management during the fruit setting stage can enhance the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees zhong et al 2019 hence same as the mulching measure fertilization management for apple orchards also need multiple aspects over the past decades investigators have provided important information about the effects of mulching or fertilization on soil properties and crop growth nevertheless the research to date has tended to focus on single measure for mulching or fertilization management rather than both together hence the importance and originality of this study were that it combines the fertilization management with mulching measures to explore the effect of an integrated management treatment of orchard on soil water and n translocation we hypothesized that management of cover and fertilization to apple orchard would alter the soil moisture and nitrate also the wue and yield therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in soil moisture and soil water storage among 3 m soil profiles 2 examine the n balance accumulation in soil uptake by leaves and fruits 3 evaluate the wue and yield of apple and 4 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation in response to different rainfall years this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the optimal soil management for orchard in the loess plateau and other rain fed area around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions the field experiments were conducted between 2012 and 2016 at the baishui county shaanxi province 35 14 n 109 31 e located on the weibei dryland the loss plateau region of china the soil in the experiment site was silt loam 8 sand 67 silt and 25 clay classified as haplustalfs according to

agricultural a typical rain fed area of loss plateau 2 2 experimental design and field management fourteen year old fuji apple trees malus pumila mil were employed for this study with a planting density of 3 0 m 4 0 m the design of the experiment was based on a randomized block with three treatments and three replications 20 apple trees each replication as follows 1 fm traditional farming measure maintained the soil bare both in row and inter row and only chemical fertilizers were applied 2 em existing management measure only the inter row was bare while the in row was covered by black plastic films combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers 3 om optimized management measure in spite of the mulching in the tree lines a summer cover crop was also included between the tree line inter row combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers the rates and the times of fertilizers among the treatments were shown in table 1 of which the fm was the current farming practice em was determined according to the guidance of the center of agricultural technology extension and the om was based on the nutrient balance and soil testing combined with the law of nutrient demand in different growth stages of trees meanwhile the in rows were covered with black plastic films 0 012 mm thick and 100 cm wide with either side of the trees among the em and om inter rows were covered with cover crops among the om the cover crop rape brassica campestris l was sown in mid june mowed and plowed into the soil in late october the sowing rate was 7 5 kg ha 1 each year all the organic fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer in late october at a rate of 22 5 t ha 1 year 1 in the em treatment and 45 0 t ha 1 year 1 in the om treatment apple trees received chemical fertilizers at a rate of 450 kg n ha 1 year 1 240 kg p ha 1 year 1 180 kg k ha 1 year 1 in the fm 300 kg n ha 1 year 1 180 kg p ha 1 year 1 270 kg k ha 1 year 1 in the em 210 kg n ha 1 year 1 120 kg p

dressing were budding stage early march in fm fruit swelling mid july in em and fruit set stage late may in om respectively the types of chemical fertilizer were urea 46 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o pig manure was used as organic fertilizer contained 188 52 g kg 1 soc 6 01 g kg 1 total n 4 02 g kg 1 total p and 4 41 g kg 1 total k all the details were shown in the table 1 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil six replicate soil samples were collected from each 20 cm soil layer to 3 m depth at budding stage early march fruit set stage late may fruit swelling stage mid july and after the harvest early october each year the soil surface was cleaned before sampling and soil from same layer and plot was mixed and sealed with plastic bag then the soil samples were taken into the laboratory immediately a small part of samples of each layer was separated for soil moisture test using the oven drying method in which soil samples were dried to constant weight at 105 for 24 h then nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the rest fresh soil samples was extracted with 1 m kcl and determined via an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany 2 3 2 leaves and fruits leaf samples were collected from the same locations at which soil samples were obtained after the fruit maturation stage the seventh to ninth leaves counted from the base of the outer crown long shoot 40 cm were taken and 20 30 leaves were picked from each tree fruits were taken from each of the upper middle and lower parts of an apple tree s eastern southern western and northern aspects resulting in a total of 12 fruits obtained per tree then all samples were washed in tap water 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl and distilled water and dried they were ground to a fine powder in order to pass a 30 mesh screen 0 5000 g samples of leaves and fruits were digested with concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 ar 98 and h2o2 gr 30 from the resulting digestion and after the addition of 100 ml of deionized h2o total n concentrations were determined via an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany 2 4 calculated data 2 4 1 soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation soil water storage sws

the soil profile based on the generalized precipitation classification scheme guo et al 2012 and the yearly average precipitation 2014 was categorized as wet 2015 and 2016 were both dry fig 1 overall soil water content swc under om was higher than the other two treatments in most soil layers each year fig 2 especially in deep soil below 2 m indicating that om could promote the water infiltration this effect was more pronounced in dry years 2015 and 2016 additionally swc in 3 m layer was decreased with soil depth and changed with the stages of apple growth and soil moisture variation was also affected by rainfall fig 1 601 5 mm in 2014 and 471 7 mm in 2016 at tree budding stage as shown in fig 2 a e i swc in up layer 40 60 cm and deep layer 180 280 cm under three treatments had no significant difference in 2014 while the om was significant higher in the other layers in 2015 and 2016 there was a significant difference p 0 01 between three treatments in most soil layers and the swc in 3 m soil under om was significant higher than em and fm in dry years at budding stage fig 2 b f g presented an overview of the variation of swc in different soil profiles at period of apple fruit set as can be seen from the graph the swc in the upper soil 40 160 cm under om and em both had been significantly increased in wet year and the om treatment was even better similar results had also been observed in 2015 and 2016 what was different was that the swc in deep soil below 2 m under om was also significant higher than fm in these two years fig 2f j for example in 2015 the swc in 180 220 cm soil under om was significant higher than fm fig 2f this can be illustrated from the results that om could significantly enhance the swc in dry year at this stage at fruit swelling stage the results of the swc in different soil depth were shown in fig 2 c g k swc in most soil profiles in 2015 and 2016 both had been increased under em and om in 2014 no difference greater under om than fm was observed in deep soil profiles below 2 m while the higher soil moisture status in upper soil 60 200 cm was maintained by om treatment fig 2c hence om could promote the rainfall infiltration during the wet year and retain the rainfall during the wet year at this period at the stage of fruit maturing in 2014 fig 2d no significant difference was detected along all treatments in up layers 0 100 cm but the em and om treatments showed the higher swc than fm in deep soil 120 300 cm and the highest swc was observed in om except in 180 200 cm fig 2d on the contrary in 2015 swc of em and om in up layers 0 100 cm had been increased compared with the fm treatment fig 2h and no significant differences were found in deep soil profiles 200 220 cm and 260 280 cm similar to 2015 the highest level of swc in deep soil profile 200 260 cm was observed in the om in 2016 and the swc in the up layer 0 100 cm showed a clear decrease along the em and om treatments fig 2i 3 2 soil water storage at different growth stages fig 3 compared an overview of the soil water storage sws within 3 m soil layer in all growth stages under different treatments and showed that the highest value of sws was observed at budding stage in dry year fig 3b c maturing stage in wet year fig 3a furthermore sws decreased gradually with the passage of the growth period and reached the lowest in the fruit swelling period in summary the sws in 3 m soil layer under om was significantly increased in the whole period compared with fm and em and sws was steady decline from 2014 to 2016 in all growth stages the differences of the sws among the treatments at most stages were statistically significant p 0 05 p 0 01 no significant difference was observed at the period of fruit setting in 2015 in wet year fig 3a sws under all treatments felled to a low point at fruit swelling stage then rose to a high point and peaked in maturing stage a maximum value 857 07 mm was appeared during the apple maturing under om treatment in both dry years there was a gradual fall with the period increased fig 3b c however a slight increase of sws was observed in 2016 before fruit maturing results showed that the sws under om was significant higher than em and fm regardless if the year was or was not wet for example in 2016 the value of sws under fm was lower than em and om during fruit budding setting and swelling this result was significant a t the p 0 01 level surprisingly the maximum value of sws was observed in fm 516 75 mm at the stage of maturing in 2016 fig 3c which was higher than em 503 33 mm and om 506 98 mm treatment p 0 05 3 3 n uptake and accumulation the n uptake by leaves and fruits were presented in table 3 for each treatment these results showed that the n uptake by leaves fruits and nue pfpn under em and om had no significant difference in most years but were both higher than fm p 0 05 for instance in 2014 the value of total n in fruits under om was 29 44 g kg 1 which was significantly increased by 62 38 compared to fm n uptake by leaves in each treatment had no obvious differences while the nue pfpn under om 265 kg kg 1 was significant higher than the others in 2016 the n in fruits and leaves under om were both significantly increased by 47 10 and 50 15 compared with fm respectively furthermore the nue pfpn in om 252 kg kg 1 was significant higher than fm 82 kg kg 1 no obvious difference between em and the other two groups was evident together these results provided important insights into that the om could increase the n level in leaves and fruits also the nue pfpn according to previous research results 65 of root biomass in 12 18 year old apple trees was found in the surface 2 m moreover the root system had a high capacity for absorbing soil water and nutrients in the 0 2 m soil layer especially in the 0 1 m soil layer song et al 2018 hence the soil nitrate below 2 m soil layer had a higher risk of leaching the results of soil nitrate accumulation sna in three layers 1 m each layer within 3 m soil at the period of fruit maturing were summarised in fig 4 results suggested that the sna in wet year 2014 was lower than dry year 2015 and 2016 and the om could significantly decrease the sna below 2 m soil regardless if the year was or was not dry in 2014 fig 4a sna in 3 m depth soil under fm and om was gradually decreased as the soil deepening on the contrary the level of sna under em was higher in deeper layer than upper soil layer in top soil layer 0 100 cm the fm had the highest sna at 1411 71 kg ha 1 and was 154 59 and 52 83 greater than em and om respectively in the 100 200 cm depth soil sna among each treatment had no significant difference the sna in fm and em in deep soil layer 200 300 cm were approximately 2 times and 3 times as much as om respectively this phenomenon means that the soil nitrate in fm and em was easier to leach into deep soil than om in 2015 fig 4b sna in fm was higher than the other two treatments and the em and om had no significant difference in the top soil layer 0 100 cm sna in om was 14 99 lower than fm p 0 05 no significant differences were observed between om and em in up soil fig 4b the lowest level of sna appeared in deep soil depth 200 300 cm and the om got a lower value of sna at 761 20 kg ha 1 while the fm had the higher level of sna at 1500 54 kg ha 1 similar results were also observed in 2016 fig 4c 3 4 relationship of soil water storage with soil nitrate accumulation except for root distribution the nutrient in soil also influenced by soil water meanwhile the soil water would change with the rainfall it means that the n accumulation in soil was both subjected by soil water and precipitation and the relationship between soil water and n accumulation was affected by different rainfall considering the above factors we analyzed the relationship of sws with sna in wet year 2014 and dry year 2016 linear responses of sws with sna within 3 m soil depth in 2014 and 2016 at different growth stages were presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5e h soil water storage was significant negatively correlated with soil nitrate accumulation in 2016 dry year at all growth period except fruit setting meanwhile in 2014 fig 5a d soil nitrate accumulation presented a positively linear trend when the soil water storage increased at the stage of budding and swelling on the contrary there was a negative relationship between soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation at fruit setting and maturing but the responses of sws with sna at each growth stage was nonsignificant in summary these results showed that the relationship of sws with sna was different between dry year and wet year and presented a negative correlation in dry year 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic and vertical changes in soil water the dynamic change of soil moisture is a process of consumption and replenishment the vertical distribution of soil water is influenced by numerous factors such as amount of precipitation the results of this study indicated that swc of three treatments in deep soil below 180 cm had no significant differences before maturing stage in wet year fig 2a d and the sws in 3 m soil was higher in wet year than dry year fig 3 these results were in line with liu et al 2010 who found that the wetting depth of infiltrated rainwater may exceed 2 or even 3 m in wet year the vertical distribution of swc in different periods in 2015 and 2016 were exactly similar except maturing indicating that om could significantly increase swc along 3 m soil layers compared with em and fm in dry year fig 2e l the distribution of swc in 3 m soil was decreased with the growth period it was possible therefore more water would be uptake by tree to maintain normal growth with the growth which could influence the vertical distribution of swc wang and wang 2018 fig 2 further illustrated that swc in om treatment was significant higher than fm and em among the 3 m layers at budding period these results were in consistent with the changes of swc fig 3 which can be attributed to the more organic fertilizer was used in the autumn it may be the case therefore that the soil infiltration water holding capacity were both increased after several years of continues manure application hoover et al 2019 in the current study the swc in em and om didn t show any significant increase in 80 180 cm soil layers during fruit setting in 2015 a possible explanation for this might be that the high rainfall intensity fig 1 which can decrease the infiltration rate zhang et al 2019b in this period the cover crop had just been sown which was another reason for that fruit swelling is occurred in the summer in this region low rainfall accompanied high temperature in this period in the wet year 2014 swc under em was significant lower than fm and om in 0 1 m soil a similar result was also observed in sws fig 3a a note of caution was due here since the plastic film mulching was adopted in em this observation may support the hypothesis that plastic mulching may prevent the rainfall from infiltration and the bare inter row would accelerate ineffective evaporation in 2015 fig 1 the value of total precipitation was only 32 4 mm however the data in 2015 and 2016 showed that swc fig 2 and sws fig 3 in 3 m soil under om were significant higher than the other two treatments previous studies have noted that plastic mulching have a positive effect on soil environment by an adjustment in soil temperature li et al 2012 reduction in evaporation wang et al 2015 there was also a body of evidence that cover crops can reduce evaporation from the soil surface salado navarro and sinclair 2009 ward et al 2012 improve rainfall infiltration bodner et al 2007 thereby conserve soil and moisture these effects coupled with the effect of organic fertilizers the swc and sws were significant greater in the om treated soils when compared to em and fm this outcome was contrary to that of pan et al 2017 who found the cover crop might compete with trees for water and lead the soil water stress a possible explanation for this might be that the plastic film much and more manure were adopted in present study one unanticipated finding was that the swc in om and em was significant lower than fm among 0 1 m soil layers during apple maturing in 2016 fig 2l this finding was in consistent with that the sws of em and om led a significantly decrease in 2016 during apple maturing these results could be attributed to continuous drought from 2015 to 2016 and the higher apple productivity in om and em table 2 4 2 et wue and yield of apple the benefits of om were demonstrated by the positive effect of manure and cover crop addition on both apple yield and wue table 2 but the et under em and om didn t show any significant increase during 2014 and 2015 it seems possible that these results were due to the invalid evaporation was effectively restrained while the bare inter row under om was occupied by the rape furthermore previous studies had demonstrated that mulching or cover crop had numerous benefits on the improvement of yield and wue wang et al 2015 sanders andrews and hill 2018 yang et al 2019 a seven year in situ study by liu et al 2013 showed that applications of fertilizer and manure increased crops yields and wue by 54 and 51 respectively in the current research om offered the benefits of both surface cover management and combination of manure with chemical fertilizer consequently performed better than fm and em on improvement for yield and wue 4 3 n accumulation and uptake as shown in fig 4 the sna among 3 m soil layers in wet year was lower than dry year this result may be explained by the fact that improvement of the irrigation amounts could reduce the sna in soil huang et al 2018 our data showed that the sna in maturing period was significantly reduced under om treatment especially among 1 2 m and 2 3 m soil layers fig 4 which illustrated that nitrate leaching in om treated soils was substantially decreased this finding broadly supported the work of other studies in this area by yang et al 2006 who found that balanced application of n p and k fertilizers and manure at proper rates was important for sna what was noteworthy was that the benefits of cover crop rape brassica campestris l in our results couldn t be neglected this finding reflected those of dean and weil 2009 who found that brassica cover crops demonstrated significant potential for decreasing sna by the greater capacity of n absorption during fall besides in the om the time of top dressing was adjusted to fruit setting period when is the beginning of the greater nutrient requirements of apple trees led the lower risk of n leaching than the other treatments the n uptake by tree is another factor for n leaching in soil the more uptake led lower surplus during the experiment the total n in fruits and leaves under om and em were both enhanced compared with fm table 3 which was also the reason that the lower sna in 0 1 m and 1 2 m under those two treatments fig 4 a possible explanation for this might be that the plastic mulch was both adopted in em and om and this caused an increase in leaf and fruit n presumably by improving soil structure and moisture and enhancing soil temperature which led to the acceleration of nutrient transformations fang et al 2011 promotion of root growth and development and absorption of more nutrients from the soil in addition the n accumulation below 2 m soil in om was significant lower than em and fm in three years a similar result was found in nue pfpn this phenomenon suggested that n input under om was be used effectively and it benefited from various measures were implemented 4 4 the relationships between sna and sws soil moisture is a key factor influencing soil no3 n movement according to our results there was no significant correlation between sws and sna in wet year fig 5a d sna responded significantly decline with increased sws in most cases after two years of drought fig 5e j supporting the finding that the relationship between sws and sna were negative among 3 m soil layers liu et al 2019 in the wet year continuous rainfall recharge increased the level of sws in soil profiles the amounts of soil water and nitrate in the shallow depth 0 1 m could meet the tree growth fig 2a d but soil no3 n in deep profile was easily replenished by rainfall and held fig 4a hence complicated and unsynchronized changes in sws and sna may explain their non significant relationship in 3 m soil layers during the wet year after the succession of drought apple trees need to absorb the soil water from deeper profile to sustain their growth fig 2i l the movement of soil water among 3 m soil layers was frequent which could synchronously drive the transfer of soil nitrate liu et al 2017 this change might explain the sna responded significant declined with increased sws in dry year 4 5 further improvement in om apple production and industry in loess plateau has contributed considerably to the local economy and employment there is an urgent need to increase production to improve farmers livelihoods however there are many yield limiting factors for apple productivity such as orchard floor management and fertilizer management in addition the yields are often limited by water and nutrient availability the production constraints that limit current apple yields should be overcome by implementing improved management practices increasing water and nutrient use efficiency wang et al 2016 in the present study the ratio of chemical fertilizer input was based on the nutrient balance and soil testing and the time of top dressing was based on the law of nutrient demand in different growth stages more manure were adopted to fertilize the soil in om the purpose of these measures was to maximize the nutrient use efficiency and reduce the nutrients loss on the other hand the plastic mulch and cover crops were both adopted to maintain soil moisture in the choice of cover crop species we selected a nonlegume crop to reduce the risk of n loss and the time of sowing was adjusted to avoid the water competition with tree taken together these treatments the om had performed very well for instance the nue pfpn wue and yield in om were both significantly enhanced compared with em and fm and n leaching risk was significantly reduced however our results showed that the maximum value of yield in om was 55 7 t ha 1 the minimum value 41 9 t ha 1 appeared in 2015 which means that the effect on yield by om was unstable besides according the recent investigation in loess plateau by dong et al zhang et al 2019a the attainable yield of similar age trees was 58 1 t ha 1 the yield gaps still existed in the om in current study applying organic manure at the rate of 45 t ha 1 to the soil seems to be effective for improving apple productivity and reducing n pollution nevertheless the nutrient availability in organic fertilizer was not taken into account and the ratio of organic fertilizer input should reconsider the research by ding et al 2012 showed that the crop yield increased with organic manure addition rates it may be more efficient to improve the rate of organic manure input 45 t ha 1 without affecting the economic and environmental benefits moreover the rate of chemical fertilizer input was based on the soil test soil data are not easily obtained in actual situations by farmers in this region opening and sharing data of research institutions would be more helpful for fertilizer management in orchard on the other hand the plastic film recycling and reusing are difficult because soil particles often adhere tightly and plastic film mulch easily tears into small pieces due to weathering and the replacement is labor intensive disposal is costly brodhagen et al 2017 when the concentration of residual film was less than 360 kg ha 1 water and nitrate movement was slower yuanqiao et al 2020 which could influence the absorption of water and nutrient by trees biodegradable plastic film may be a good option for alternative meanwhile a nonlegume crop was adopted in om aims to reduce the n leaching which benefited from its high level shoot biomass thapa et al 2018 but when the cover crop is a non legume species crop yield tends to decrease by 8 alvarez et al 2017 and the higher shoot biomass means higher water consumption hence further studies should select more suitable species of cover crop to improve management practice ensure the economic and environmental efficiency in apple orchard 5 conclusion the main goals of the current study were to determine the effect of different soil managements for apple orchard on yield soil moisture and n translocation in rain fed area the most obvious finding to emerge from this study was that the integrated soil management can significantly increase soil water in 3 m soil layers during the whole growth period of trees especially in the deep soil below 1 m in dry year this partly indicated that the om could promote rainfall infiltration and ease the soil desiccation in apple orchard the et among three treatments had no obvious difference while the apple yield was significantly enhanced in om compared with em and fm therefore the stored soil water and precipitation in om were effectively used for tree growth total n in fruits and leaves under om and em were both enhanced compared with fm but the nue pfpn in om was significantly higher than the other treatments meanwhile the n accumulation under om featured substantial decreases in deep soil below 2 m these results suggested that the om could significantly promote the n translocation and reduce the risk of n leaching a negative correlation between the sws and sna was observed in dry year suggesting that the clearly benefits of om to increase the soil moisture when reduce no3 n leaching during arid climate condition it was unfortunate that the study did not include the changes of soil moisture and nitrate during the tree dormant period and the effect on apple yield by om was unstable the yield gaps still existed notwithstanding these limitations the study suggested that a combination of different soil managements for apple orchard had more advantages than single measure integrated soil management in apple orchards was more practical considerably more work should be done to determine the benefits of comprehensive soil management for apple orchard in rain fed area declaration of

10537,the managements of fertilization and surface mulching in apple orchards have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and soil nitrate movement in field ecosystem however the research to date had tended to focus on single measure rather than both together the aims of this study were to determine how integrated management for apple orchards influenced spatial and temporal changes of soil water content swc and soil water storage sws illustrate the effects on reducing soil nitrate accumulation sna and promoting n uptake determine the impacts of water use efficiency wue and apple yield we applied three treatments for demonstration contrast experiments traditional farming measure chemical fertilizer fm existing management measure chemical fertilizer plus manure plastic film mulch in row em and optimized management measure chemical fertilizer plus manure plastic film mulch in row and cover crop inter row om we found that the swc in 3 m soil layers was influenced by the tree growth period the clearly benefits of om to invariably increase sws in 3 m soil layer were observed in different period especially in dry year during the tree growth the om treatment significantly increased rainwater retention in deep soil below 1 m and received a maximum value of sws in 3 m soil layers apple yield was significantly enhanced in om but the water consumption in each treatment had no obvious difference and consequently wue was elevated compared with em and fm the sna after the apple harvest was significantly decreased under the om especially in 2 3 m soil depth meanwhile total n in fruits and leaves in om were significant higher than fm indicating that the risk of n leaching was reduced and the n was effectively used by trees regression relationships between sna and sws were significantly negative in the dry year means that the om would perform better in mitigating soil desiccation and soil nitrate leaching in dry climatic condition this study highlights integrated soil management is a considerable practice for apple orchards in loess plateau and the rain fed area around the world keywords cover crop plastic mulch manure wue nue soil nitrate accumulation n uptake 1 introduction apple is the fourth most important fruit crop around the word following all citrus types grapes and bananas forsline et al 2010 according to faostat 2018 china has become the largest apple producer in the world representing around 45 55 of the world s total production 39 24 106 t in 2018 however the annual yield in china still remains low and is significantly lower than that of other dominant apple producing countries including new zealand the united states and brazil zhang et al 2019a in the context of increasingly limited agricultural productive capacity increasing apple production still has a great challenge the loess plateau in china where is the biggest high quality apple production place due to the suitable sunshine and temperature for apple tree growth li et al 2018 however rainfall is the main resource of water for agriculture in this region because of the cost of irrigation is expensive song et al 2018 and 60 of the annual precipitation occurs during july and september summer when the evaporation precipitation ratio is extremely high zheng et al 2017 in addition to the limitation of the water for agricultural the soil fertility is poor in this arable land with the contents of soil organic matter som and total nitrogen tn are below 1 0 and range from 0 001 to 0 178 respectively tang 2004 base on the above reasons in order to ensure the sustainable development of the apple industry appropriate orchard managements are badly needed mulching measure a management which is widespread used as water conservation technique in arable dryland suo et al 2019 data from previous researches suggested that water use efficiency increased by 21 50 under plastic film mulch treatment due to the reduction of soil evaporation sun et al 2012b it was also now well established from a variety of studies that the total n uptake in plastic mulch was 72 5 greater and the estimated n leaching was much lower than no mulch guo et al 2019 additionally according to a meta analysis the mean effect of plastic mulching on nitrogen use efficiency was 35 78 qin et al 2015 and the grain yield was invariably increased by 35 when combined with straw mulch chen et al 2015 on the contrary studies had also shown that the n uptake by crop in mulch soil was decreased which was attributed to a dilution effect of increased soil n availability due to the stimulated n mineralization and plastic mulch is a physical barrier that reduces ammonia volatilization which could retain more n in soil and increase n leaching liu et al 2015 cover crop is a kind of organic mulching which had previously been observed that can promote rainfall infiltration after the thick roots decay and form channels archer et al 2002 acharya et al 2019 reported that the soil moisture content in 0 30 cm depth was increased by 3 5 compared to control plots meanwhile the cover crop especially nonlegumes can substantially reduce no3 nleaching by 56 thapa et al 2018 while the no3 n decreased after cover crops by 30 regardless if the cover crop species was or was not legume alvarez et al 2017 however another researches reported that the soil water storage was reduced because the increased water use in the cover crop as a result of evapotranspiration krstić et al 2018 and the apple yield under grass cover treatment remained at a low level by reason of the competition for nutrients and water suo et al 2019 therefore the mulching measures should be considered carefully before implementation the application of chemical fertilizers has a pivotal role in increasing crop yield in order to meet the food needs with limit arable land the mode of high input and high output has been adopted in many regions in china as a consequence china is now the largest producer and consumer of synthetic fertilizers accounting for ca 35 of the global total consumption sun et al 2012a in order to achieve sustainable development of grain production china passed through the action plan about the reduction of chemical fertilizers in 2018 wu and ge 2019 in agricultural production excessive use of chemical fertilizer had accentuated the problem of nutrient and yield loss long term in situ experiment had established that chemical fertilizer can acidify the soil and reduce soil fertility compared with manure or no fertilizer treatment ozlu and kumar 2018 thus reduced yield the application of organic fertilizer had a well impact on yield improvement however the risk of nitrate leaching would be elevated when the manure was used because of the desynchrony of n supply kirchmann and bergström 2007 furthermore application of manure would cause the same level of no3 n leaching as in chemical fertilizer application over longer periods maeda et al 2003 but the manure had also been applied to reduce nitrate leaching in agricultural soils zheng et al 2013 the ratio between manure and chemical fertilizer is another considerable factor of improving crop productive for instance studies had shown that there was no obvious advantage to crop yields between 7500 kg ha 1 year 1 and 15 000 kg ha 1 year 1 organic fertilizer plus the same ratio of chemical fertilizer but all significantly lower than 22 500 kg ha 1 year 1 ding et al 2012 and the optimal ratio of organic and inorganic fertilizer is still unclear it is also unidentified that whether substantial amounts of organic manure amendment could influence the apple production and soil meanwhile apple trees are perennial plant compared with some field crops e g wheat corn the demand of nutrient is different in each growth stage for example the net accumulation of n p in leaves and fruit was decreased sharply from budbreak to fruit harvest and a large proportion of the k accumulation 77 4 occurred from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest cheng and raba 2009 nutrients with the exception of k accumulated in the bourse shoots at the highest rate during fruit setting zanotelli et al 2014 on the other hand numerous studies have shown that the main water consumption period of apple trees is from june to october water consumption increases slowly in budding period increases rapidly in fruit setting peaks in fruit swelling and is low in fruit maturing chenafi et al 2016 song et al 2018 which means the demand of nutrient and water by tree was different at each growth stage therefore the fertilizer management and floor management should be adjusted in combination with tree growth and development characteristics for example the system of a spring n application plus cover crops could reduce nitrate leaching than the control kaspar et al 2007 optimal management during the fruit setting stage can enhance the fruit quality fruit yield and wue of apple trees zhong et al 2019 hence same as the mulching measure fertilization management for apple orchards also need multiple aspects over the past decades investigators have provided important information about the effects of mulching or fertilization on soil properties and crop growth nevertheless the research to date has tended to focus on single measure for mulching or fertilization management rather than both together hence the importance and originality of this study were that it combines the fertilization management with mulching measures to explore the effect of an integrated management treatment of orchard on soil water and n translocation we hypothesized that management of cover and fertilization to apple orchard would alter the soil moisture and nitrate also the wue and yield therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in soil moisture and soil water storage among 3 m soil profiles 2 examine the n balance accumulation in soil uptake by leaves and fruits 3 evaluate the wue and yield of apple and 4 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation in response to different rainfall years this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the optimal soil management for orchard in the loess plateau and other rain fed area around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and climatic conditions the field experiments were conducted between 2012 and 2016 at the baishui county shaanxi province 35 14 n 109 31 e located on the weibei dryland the loss plateau region of china the soil in the experiment site was silt loam 8 sand 67 silt and 25 clay classified as haplustalfs according to

agricultural a typical rain fed area of loss plateau 2 2 experimental design and field management fourteen year old fuji apple trees malus pumila mil were employed for this study with a planting density of 3 0 m 4 0 m the design of the experiment was based on a randomized block with three treatments and three replications 20 apple trees each replication as follows 1 fm traditional farming measure maintained the soil bare both in row and inter row and only chemical fertilizers were applied 2 em existing management measure only the inter row was bare while the in row was covered by black plastic films combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers 3 om optimized management measure in spite of the mulching in the tree lines a summer cover crop was also included between the tree line inter row combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers the rates and the times of fertilizers among the treatments were shown in table 1 of which the fm was the current farming practice em was determined according to the guidance of the center of agricultural technology extension and the om was based on the nutrient balance and soil testing combined with the law of nutrient demand in different growth stages of trees meanwhile the in rows were covered with black plastic films 0 012 mm thick and 100 cm wide with either side of the trees among the em and om inter rows were covered with cover crops among the om the cover crop rape brassica campestris l was sown in mid june mowed and plowed into the soil in late october the sowing rate was 7 5 kg ha 1 each year all the organic fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer in late october at a rate of 22 5 t ha 1 year 1 in the em treatment and 45 0 t ha 1 year 1 in the om treatment apple trees received chemical fertilizers at a rate of 450 kg n ha 1 year 1 240 kg p ha 1 year 1 180 kg k ha 1 year 1 in the fm 300 kg n ha 1 year 1 180 kg p ha 1 year 1 270 kg k ha 1 year 1 in the em 210 kg n ha 1 year 1 120 kg p

dressing were budding stage early march in fm fruit swelling mid july in em and fruit set stage late may in om respectively the types of chemical fertilizer were urea 46 n calcium superphosphate 12 p2o5 and potassium sulfate 50 k2o pig manure was used as organic fertilizer contained 188 52 g kg 1 soc 6 01 g kg 1 total n 4 02 g kg 1 total p and 4 41 g kg 1 total k all the details were shown in the table 1 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil six replicate soil samples were collected from each 20 cm soil layer to 3 m depth at budding stage early march fruit set stage late may fruit swelling stage mid july and after the harvest early october each year the soil surface was cleaned before sampling and soil from same layer and plot was mixed and sealed with plastic bag then the soil samples were taken into the laboratory immediately a small part of samples of each layer was separated for soil moisture test using the oven drying method in which soil samples were dried to constant weight at 105 for 24 h then nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the rest fresh soil samples was extracted with 1 m kcl and determined via an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany 2 3 2 leaves and fruits leaf samples were collected from the same locations at which soil samples were obtained after the fruit maturation stage the seventh to ninth leaves counted from the base of the outer crown long shoot 40 cm were taken and 20 30 leaves were picked from each tree fruits were taken from each of the upper middle and lower parts of an apple tree s eastern southern western and northern aspects resulting in a total of 12 fruits obtained per tree then all samples were washed in tap water 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl and distilled water and dried they were ground to a fine powder in order to pass a 30 mesh screen 0 5000 g samples of leaves and fruits were digested with concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 ar 98 and h2o2 gr 30 from the resulting digestion and after the addition of 100 ml of deionized h2o total n concentrations were determined via an auto analyzer autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany 2 4 calculated data 2 4 1 soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation soil water storage sws

each layer and d is the thickness of each layer 20 cm 2 4 2 et water and nitrogen use efficiencies evapotranspiration et was calculated by the following soil water balance equation runoff and deep percolation were neglected because of the limited heavy precipitation intilted topography and very deep groundwater level et mm p mm δw mm where the p δw represents the precipitation and soil water storage change in the 3 m soil layer between the beginning early march and the end of the apple tree growth early october respectively in addition water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and nitrogen

performed using spss software v 22 0 spss ibm chicago usa and the different measurements were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova pair wise mean comparison was performed using least

the soil profile based on the generalized precipitation classification scheme guo et al 2012 and the yearly average precipitation 2014 was categorized as wet 2015 and 2016 were both dry fig 1 overall soil water content swc under om was higher than the other two treatments in most soil layers each year fig 2 especially in deep soil below 2 m indicating that om could promote the water infiltration this effect was more pronounced in dry years 2015 and 2016 additionally swc in 3 m layer was decreased with soil depth and changed with the stages of apple growth and soil moisture variation was also affected by rainfall fig 1 601 5 mm in 2014 and 471 7 mm in 2016 at tree budding stage as shown in fig 2 a e i swc in up layer 40 60 cm and deep layer 180 280 cm under three treatments had no significant difference in 2014 while the om was significant higher in the other layers in 2015 and 2016 there was a significant difference p 0 01 between three treatments in most soil layers and the swc in 3 m soil under om was significant higher than em and fm in dry years at budding stage fig 2 b f g presented an overview of the variation of swc in different soil profiles at period of apple fruit set as can be seen from the graph the swc in the upper soil 40 160 cm under om and em both had been significantly increased in wet year and the om treatment was even better similar results had also been observed in 2015 and 2016 what was different was that the swc in deep soil below 2 m under om was also significant higher than fm in these two years fig 2f j for example in 2015 the swc in 180 220 cm soil under om was significant higher than fm fig 2f this can be illustrated from the results that om could significantly enhance the swc in dry year at this stage at fruit swelling stage the results of the swc in different soil depth were shown in fig 2 c g k swc in most soil profiles in 2015 and 2016 both had been increased under em and om in 2014 no difference greater under om than fm was observed in deep soil profiles below 2 m while the higher soil moisture status in upper soil 60 200 cm was maintained by om treatment fig 2c hence om could promote the rainfall infiltration during the wet year and retain the rainfall during the wet year at this period at the stage of fruit maturing in 2014 fig 2d no significant difference was detected along all treatments in up layers 0 100 cm but the em and om treatments showed the higher swc than fm in deep soil 120 300 cm and the highest swc was observed in om except in 180 200 cm fig 2d on the contrary in 2015 swc of em and om in up layers 0 100 cm had been increased compared with the fm treatment fig 2h and no significant differences were found in deep soil profiles 200 220 cm and 260 280 cm similar to 2015 the highest level of swc in deep soil profile 200 260 cm was observed in the om in 2016 and the swc in the up layer 0 100 cm showed a clear decrease along the em and om treatments fig 2i 3 2 soil water storage at different growth stages fig 3 compared an overview of the soil water storage sws within 3 m soil layer in all growth stages under different treatments and showed that the highest value of sws was observed at budding stage in dry year fig 3b c maturing stage in wet year fig 3a furthermore sws decreased gradually with the passage of the growth period and reached the lowest in the fruit swelling period in summary the sws in 3 m soil layer under om was significantly increased in the whole period compared with fm and em and sws was steady decline from 2014 to 2016 in all growth stages the differences of the sws among the treatments at most stages were statistically significant p 0 05 p 0 01 no significant difference was observed at the period of fruit setting in 2015 in wet year fig 3a sws under all treatments felled to a low point at fruit swelling stage then rose to a high point and peaked in maturing stage a maximum value 857 07 mm was appeared during the apple maturing under om treatment in both dry years there was a gradual fall with the period increased fig 3b c however a slight increase of sws was observed in 2016 before fruit maturing results showed that the sws under om was significant higher than em and fm regardless if the year was or was not wet for example in 2016 the value of sws under fm was lower than em and om during fruit budding setting and swelling this result was significant a t the p 0 01 level surprisingly the maximum value of sws was observed in fm 516 75 mm at the stage of maturing in 2016 fig 3c which was higher than em 503 33 mm and om 506 98 mm treatment p 0 05 3 3 n uptake and accumulation the n uptake by leaves and fruits were presented in table 3 for each treatment these results showed that the n uptake by leaves fruits and nue pfpn under em and om had no significant difference in most years but were both higher than fm p 0 05 for instance in 2014 the value of total n in fruits under om was 29 44 g kg 1 which was significantly increased by 62 38 compared to fm n uptake by leaves in each treatment had no obvious differences while the nue pfpn under om 265 kg kg 1 was significant higher than the others in 2016 the n in fruits and leaves under om were both significantly increased by 47 10 and 50 15 compared with fm respectively furthermore the nue pfpn in om 252 kg kg 1 was significant higher than fm 82 kg kg 1 no obvious difference between em and the other two groups was evident together these results provided important insights into that the om could increase the n level in leaves and fruits also the nue pfpn according to previous research results 65 of root biomass in 12 18 year old apple trees was found in the surface 2 m moreover the root system had a high capacity for absorbing soil water and nutrients in the 0 2 m soil layer especially in the 0 1 m soil layer song et al 2018 hence the soil nitrate below 2 m soil layer had a higher risk of leaching the results of soil nitrate accumulation sna in three layers 1 m each layer within 3 m soil at the period of fruit maturing were summarised in fig 4 results suggested that the sna in wet year 2014 was lower than dry year 2015 and 2016 and the om could significantly decrease the sna below 2 m soil regardless if the year was or was not dry in 2014 fig 4a sna in 3 m depth soil under fm and om was gradually decreased as the soil deepening on the contrary the level of sna under em was higher in deeper layer than upper soil layer in top soil layer 0 100 cm the fm had the highest sna at 1411 71 kg ha 1 and was 154 59 and 52 83 greater than em and om respectively in the 100 200 cm depth soil sna among each treatment had no significant difference the sna in fm and em in deep soil layer 200 300 cm were approximately 2 times and 3 times as much as om respectively this phenomenon means that the soil nitrate in fm and em was easier to leach into deep soil than om in 2015 fig 4b sna in fm was higher than the other two treatments and the em and om had no significant difference in the top soil layer 0 100 cm sna in om was 14 99 lower than fm p 0 05 no significant differences were observed between om and em in up soil fig 4b the lowest level of sna appeared in deep soil depth 200 300 cm and the om got a lower value of sna at 761 20 kg ha 1 while the fm had the higher level of sna at 1500 54 kg ha 1 similar results were also observed in 2016 fig 4c 3 4 relationship of soil water storage with soil nitrate accumulation except for root distribution the nutrient in soil also influenced by soil water meanwhile the soil water would change with the rainfall it means that the n accumulation in soil was both subjected by soil water and precipitation and the relationship between soil water and n accumulation was affected by different rainfall considering the above factors we analyzed the relationship of sws with sna in wet year 2014 and dry year 2016 linear responses of sws with sna within 3 m soil depth in 2014 and 2016 at different growth stages were presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5e h soil water storage was significant negatively correlated with soil nitrate accumulation in 2016 dry year at all growth period except fruit setting meanwhile in 2014 fig 5a d soil nitrate accumulation presented a positively linear trend when the soil water storage increased at the stage of budding and swelling on the contrary there was a negative relationship between soil water storage and soil nitrate accumulation at fruit setting and maturing but the responses of sws with sna at each growth stage was nonsignificant in summary these results showed that the relationship of sws with sna was different between dry year and wet year and presented a negative correlation in dry year 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic and vertical changes in soil water the dynamic change of soil moisture is a process of consumption and replenishment the vertical distribution of soil water is influenced by numerous factors such as amount of precipitation the results of this study indicated that swc of three treatments in deep soil below 180 cm had no significant differences before maturing stage in wet year fig 2a d and the sws in 3 m soil was higher in wet year than dry year fig 3 these results were in line with liu et al 2010 who found that the wetting depth of infiltrated rainwater may exceed 2 or even 3 m in wet year the vertical distribution of swc in different periods in 2015 and 2016 were exactly similar except maturing indicating that om could significantly increase swc along 3 m soil layers compared with em and fm in dry year fig 2e l the distribution of swc in 3 m soil was decreased with the growth period it was possible therefore more water would be uptake by tree to maintain normal growth with the growth which could influence the vertical distribution of swc wang and wang 2018 fig 2 further illustrated that swc in om treatment was significant higher than fm and em among the 3 m layers at budding period these results were in consistent with the changes of swc fig 3 which can be attributed to the more organic fertilizer was used in the autumn it may be the case therefore that the soil infiltration water holding capacity were both increased after several years of continues manure application hoover et al 2019 in the current study the swc in em and om didn t show any significant increase in 80 180 cm soil layers during fruit setting in 2015 a possible explanation for this might be that the high rainfall intensity fig 1 which can decrease the infiltration rate zhang et al 2019b in this period the cover crop had just been sown which was another reason for that fruit swelling is occurred in the summer in this region low rainfall accompanied high temperature in this period in the wet year 2014 swc under em was significant lower than fm and om in 0 1 m soil a similar result was also observed in sws fig 3a a note of caution was due here since the plastic film mulching was adopted in em this observation may support the hypothesis that plastic mulching may prevent the rainfall from infiltration and the bare inter row would accelerate ineffective evaporation in 2015 fig 1 the value of total precipitation was only 32 4 mm however the data in 2015 and 2016 showed that swc fig 2 and sws fig 3 in 3 m soil under om were significant higher than the other two treatments previous studies have noted that plastic mulching have a positive effect on soil environment by an adjustment in soil temperature li et al 2012 reduction in evaporation wang et al 2015 there was also a body of evidence that cover crops can reduce evaporation from the soil surface salado navarro and sinclair 2009 ward et al 2012 improve rainfall infiltration bodner et al 2007 thereby conserve soil and moisture these effects coupled with the effect of organic fertilizers the swc and sws were significant greater in the om treated soils when compared to em and fm this outcome was contrary to that of pan et al 2017 who found the cover crop might compete with trees for water and lead the soil water stress a possible explanation for this might be that the plastic film much and more manure were adopted in present study one unanticipated finding was that the swc in om and em was significant lower than fm among 0 1 m soil layers during apple maturing in 2016 fig 2l this finding was in consistent with that the sws of em and om led a significantly decrease in 2016 during apple maturing these results could be attributed to continuous drought from 2015 to 2016 and the higher apple productivity in om and em table 2 4 2 et wue and yield of apple the benefits of om were demonstrated by the positive effect of manure and cover crop addition on both apple yield and wue table 2 but the et under em and om didn t show any significant increase during 2014 and 2015 it seems possible that these results were due to the invalid evaporation was effectively restrained while the bare inter row under om was occupied by the rape furthermore previous studies had demonstrated that mulching or cover crop had numerous benefits on the improvement of yield and wue wang et al 2015 sanders andrews and hill 2018 yang et al 2019 a seven year in situ study by liu et al 2013 showed that applications of fertilizer and manure increased crops yields and wue by 54 and 51 respectively in the current research om offered the benefits of both surface cover management and combination of manure with chemical fertilizer consequently performed better than fm and em on improvement for yield and wue 4 3 n accumulation and uptake as shown in fig 4 the sna among 3 m soil layers in wet year was lower than dry year this result may be explained by the fact that improvement of the irrigation amounts could reduce the sna in soil huang et al 2018 our data showed that the sna in maturing period was significantly reduced under om treatment especially among 1 2 m and 2 3 m soil layers fig 4 which illustrated that nitrate leaching in om treated soils was substantially decreased this finding broadly supported the work of other studies in this area by yang et al 2006 who found that balanced application of n p and k fertilizers and manure at proper rates was important for sna what was noteworthy was that the benefits of cover crop rape brassica campestris l in our results couldn t be neglected this finding reflected those of dean and weil 2009 who found that brassica cover crops demonstrated significant potential for decreasing sna by the greater capacity of n absorption during fall besides in the om the time of top dressing was adjusted to fruit setting period when is the beginning of the greater nutrient requirements of apple trees led the lower risk of n leaching than the other treatments the n uptake by tree is another factor for n leaching in soil the more uptake led lower surplus during the experiment the total n in fruits and leaves under om and em were both enhanced compared with fm table 3 which was also the reason that the lower sna in 0 1 m and 1 2 m under those two treatments fig 4 a possible explanation for this might be that the plastic mulch was both adopted in em and om and this caused an increase in leaf and fruit n presumably by improving soil structure and moisture and enhancing soil temperature which led to the acceleration of nutrient transformations fang et al 2011 promotion of root growth and development and absorption of more nutrients from the soil in addition the n accumulation below 2 m soil in om was significant lower than em and fm in three years a similar result was found in nue pfpn this phenomenon suggested that n input under om was be used effectively and it benefited from various measures were implemented 4 4 the relationships between sna and sws soil moisture is a key factor influencing soil no3 n movement according to our results there was no significant correlation between sws and sna in wet year fig 5a d sna responded significantly decline with increased sws in most cases after two years of drought fig 5e j supporting the finding that the relationship between sws and sna were negative among 3 m soil layers liu et al 2019 in the wet year continuous rainfall recharge increased the level of sws in soil profiles the amounts of soil water and nitrate in the shallow depth 0 1 m could meet the tree growth fig 2a d but soil no3 n in deep profile was easily replenished by rainfall and held fig 4a hence complicated and unsynchronized changes in sws and sna may explain their non significant relationship in 3 m soil layers during the wet year after the succession of drought apple trees need to absorb the soil water from deeper profile to sustain their growth fig 2i l the movement of soil water among 3 m soil layers was frequent which could synchronously drive the transfer of soil nitrate liu et al 2017 this change might explain the sna responded significant declined with increased sws in dry year 4 5 further improvement in om apple production and industry in loess plateau has contributed considerably to the local economy and employment there is an urgent need to increase production to improve farmers livelihoods however there are many yield limiting factors for apple productivity such as orchard floor management and fertilizer management in addition the yields are often limited by water and nutrient availability the production constraints that limit current apple yields should be overcome by implementing improved management practices increasing water and nutrient use efficiency wang et al 2016 in the present study the ratio of chemical fertilizer input was based on the nutrient balance and soil testing and the time of top dressing was based on the law of nutrient demand in different growth stages more manure were adopted to fertilize the soil in om the purpose of these measures was to maximize the nutrient use efficiency and reduce the nutrients loss on the other hand the plastic mulch and cover crops were both adopted to maintain soil moisture in the choice of cover crop species we selected a nonlegume crop to reduce the risk of n loss and the time of sowing was adjusted to avoid the water competition with tree taken together these treatments the om had performed very well for instance the nue pfpn wue and yield in om were both significantly enhanced compared with em and fm and n leaching risk was significantly reduced however our results showed that the maximum value of yield in om was 55 7 t ha 1 the minimum value 41 9 t ha 1 appeared in 2015 which means that the effect on yield by om was unstable besides according the recent investigation in loess plateau by dong et al zhang et al 2019a the attainable yield of similar age trees was 58 1 t ha 1 the yield gaps still existed in the om in current study applying organic manure at the rate of 45 t ha 1 to the soil seems to be effective for improving apple productivity and reducing n pollution nevertheless the nutrient availability in organic fertilizer was not taken into account and the ratio of organic fertilizer input should reconsider the research by ding et al 2012 showed that the crop yield increased with organic manure addition rates it may be more efficient to improve the rate of organic manure input 45 t ha 1 without affecting the economic and environmental benefits moreover the rate of chemical fertilizer input was based on the soil test soil data are not easily obtained in actual situations by farmers in this region opening and sharing data of research institutions would be more helpful for fertilizer management in orchard on the other hand the plastic film recycling and reusing are difficult because soil particles often adhere tightly and plastic film mulch easily tears into small pieces due to weathering and the replacement is labor intensive disposal is costly brodhagen et al 2017 when the concentration of residual film was less than 360 kg ha 1 water and nitrate movement was slower yuanqiao et al 2020 which could influence the absorption of water and nutrient by trees biodegradable plastic film may be a good option for alternative meanwhile a nonlegume crop was adopted in om aims to reduce the n leaching which benefited from its high level shoot biomass thapa et al 2018 but when the cover crop is a non legume species crop yield tends to decrease by 8 alvarez et al 2017 and the higher shoot biomass means higher water consumption hence further studies should select more suitable species of cover crop to improve management practice ensure the economic and environmental efficiency in apple orchard 5 conclusion the main goals of the current study were to determine the effect of different soil managements for apple orchard on yield soil moisture and n translocation in rain fed area the most obvious finding to emerge from this study was that the integrated soil management can significantly increase soil water in 3 m soil layers during the whole growth period of trees especially in the deep soil below 1 m in dry year this partly indicated that the om could promote rainfall infiltration and ease the soil desiccation in apple orchard the et among three treatments had no obvious difference while the apple yield was significantly enhanced in om compared with em and fm therefore the stored soil water and precipitation in om were effectively used for tree growth total n in fruits and leaves under om and em were both enhanced compared with fm but the nue pfpn in om was significantly higher than the other treatments meanwhile the n accumulation under om featured substantial decreases in deep soil below 2 m these results suggested that the om could significantly promote the n translocation and reduce the risk of n leaching a negative correlation between the sws and sna was observed in dry year suggesting that the clearly benefits of om to increase the soil moisture when reduce no3 n leaching during arid climate condition it was unfortunate that the study did not include the changes of soil moisture and nitrate during the tree dormant period and the effect on apple yield by om was unstable the yield gaps still existed notwithstanding these limitations the study suggested that a combination of different soil managements for apple orchard had more advantages than single measure integrated soil management in apple orchards was more practical considerably more work should be done to determine the benefits of comprehensive soil management for apple orchard in rain fed area declaration of

10538,accurate knowledge of evapotranspiration et and irrigation return flow is critical for the sustainable management of water resources in arid inland river basins flood irrigation with large amounts of groundwater and resulting return flow may be not suitable for cropland with long cultivation history in the midstream of the heihe river basin of northwestern china flood irrigated cropland with rotation of spring wheat and spring maize from 2005 to 2014 was selected as study area deep percolation fluxes below the 1 5 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m layers were determined based on soil water balance for which soil evaporation transpiration and soil water content swc dynamics during the growing seasons were calibrated and validated by the hydrus 1d simulation mean annual soil evaporation and transpiration were 64 11 mm and 352 36 mm for spring wheat and 84 03 mm and 447 43 mm for spring maize respectively large amounts of water discharged within the first few days after irrigation from the second to the last irrigation events deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of applied water during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm water percolated from the 0 1 5 m soil were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m layer respectively groundwater recharge the amount of deep percolation below 5 0 m amounted to 734 03 mm and 1002 10 mm occupying 58 86 and 70 20 of applied irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively mean water productivity were 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize the impact of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation was assessed by assuming 80 80 i 60 60 i 50 50 i and 40 40 i of current irrigation quota i of each event throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 even the 40 i treatment would satisfy water demand of spring wheat and spring maize and deep percolation would decrease remarkably the percentage of percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil to irrigation would decrease on average by 8 31 22 43 33 88 and 49 78 under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively groundwater recharge would occupy 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water for spring wheat and 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water for spring maize respectively the 50 i treatment would improve water productivity by at least 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize the hypothesized irrigation schedule with current frequency and 50 quota of each event is promising to improve crop water utilization and protect groundwater resources optimized irrigation strategy for irrigated agriculture in the midstream will aid the comprehensive management of water resources at a watershed scale in the arid inland river basins keywords numerical simulation irrigation partition deep percolation evapotranspiration optimized irrigation schedule 1 introduction in the heihe river basin of northwestern china runoff generated in the mountainous upstream is the main water source supplying for the mid and down streams the midstream is a dominant production base for commodity grain agriculture relies heavily on irrigation which occupies about 90 of total water consumption and has become increasingly dependent on groundwater after implementing the water diversion scheme from 2000 chen et al 2003 farmers chronically irrigate the cropland based on the access to water rather than growth stage based water demand but more water does not necessarily mean increased yield and water use efficiency overexploitation of water resources due to the expansion of artificial oases has led to the decline of groundwater level and in turn the severe deterioration of natural ecosystem in the downstream ji et al 2006 kang et al 2007 improving irrigation water utilization by crops and developing water conserving irrigated agriculture in the midstream are necessary to meet the increasing economic and ecological water requirements under the comprehensive management of water resources at a watershed scale irrigation with large amounts of water is effective to alleviate salinity caused yield reduction in the new cultivated sandy land but it may cause high water and nutrient losses for example the seasonal drainage and no3 n leaching under continuous furrow irrigation was 50 higher than that under variable and fixed furrow irrigation for rapeseed in iran sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 high nitrogen leaching occurred when about 34 58 and 37 of irrigation and precipitation percolated for corn potato and the rotation of lettuce and melon in the western mediterranean poch massegú et al 2014 water saving irrigation can remarkably reduce water losses by seepage and deep percolation tan et al 2014 naghedifar et al 2018 yost et al 2019 however enhanced salt concentration in the root zone due to improper water saving irrigation reduces root water uptake and influences the grain yield rosa et al 2016 wang et al 2017 phogat et al 2018 the effect of water saving irrigation on crop production should be treated case by case for example deficit irrigation with mulching was effective to increase crop yield in the arid shiyang river basin of china wen et al 2017 surface drip irrigation under 60 field capacity was suitable for winter wheat than sprinkle and flood irrigation in the north china plain jha et al 2019 soil salinity increased and crop yield declined under deficit irrigation in the upper yellow river with shallow groundwater level xu et al 2013 ren et al 2018 deep percolation acts as a primary pathway to recharge groundwater and provides important hydrologic and ecosystem benefits porhemmat et al 2018 argued the sustainability of drip and sprinkler irrigation due to the lower potential groundwater recharge than furrow irrigation in iran flood irrigation for croplands with long cultivation history in the midstream of the heihe river should be properly managed to maximize crop utilization and control the volumes of percolated water previous studies showed that deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in croplands cultivated for more than 45 years in this region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 the government and farmers at present cannot afford to extensively develop water saving irrigation systems it seems to be feasible by altering present irrigation schedules to simultaneously account for crop production soil salinity and groundwater recharge high frequency irrigation with decreased amount of single event is necessary for meeting crop water demand and maintaining low soil salinity wang et al 2010 askri et al 2014 and has been suggested in this study area ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 however previous reports were almost from one or two years field experiments accurately quantifying the partition of irrigation water based on decades of observations and proposing modified irrigation schedules are vital for the sustainable utilization of water resources in the heihe river basin quantifying the dynamic partitioning of irrigation water during the growing season is essential for improving water use efficiency field measurements of soil water balance components using large scale weighting lysimeter sap flow and micro meteorological methods have been extensively used to establish relationship between the roots the vadose zone and the groundwater hydrology liu et al 2002 wolf et al 2008 lopez urrea et al 2009 the weighting lysimeter method is regarded to mimic field conditions reasonably well and is accurate to quantify the evapotranspiration et and deep percolation under well defined initial and boundary conditions liu et al 2002 fahle and dietrich 2014 dijkema et al 2018 however the construction and maintenance of the lysimeters are expensive mathematical models such as the soil water atmosphere plant model crescimanno and garofalo 2005 verma et al 2014 xue and ren 2017 root zone water quality model hanson et al 1998 soil plant system with water and solute transport model hu et al 2007 the hydrus program šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the aqyield model tribouillois et al 2018 and models coupling water and salt balance and crop yield estimation modules xue et al 2018 are alternatives to improve the mechanistic understanding of the physical processes and have been used for irrigation water management nutrient leaching salinity control and yield estimation over the world the hydrus 1d software is a one dimensional computer program based on the richard s equation for variability saturated water flow and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this software has been successively used to simulate vadose zone hydrologic processes salinization nutrient leaching and plant growth in a wide range of soils for example the hydrus 1d program was capable of simulating the reuse of saline drainage water by alfafa from shallow groundwater shouse et al 2011 the hydrus 1d program successively simulated the water balance of the sandy loess sediments for bare soil and soils with sparse or dense natural vegetation in the coastal plain of israel and gaza within 25 years dafny and šimůnek 2016 the hydrus 1d simulation provided consistent time series of et measured by eddy covariance systems in rainfed vineyard throughout the growth cycles in southern france galleguillos et al 2017 kader et al 2019 pointed out that the hydrus 1d software performed well in simulating heat and water movement under the treatments of rice straw mulching and bare soil the percentage of percolation to applied irrigation was simulated by the hydrus 1d program over the world such as 22 68 in semi arid southeastern spain jiménez martínez et al 2009 an increase by 3 for a warmer climate and a decrease by 85 for a colder climate in belgium for the next 10 000 years leterme et al 2012 and ranging from 35 to 60 in the hetao irrigation district of china ren et al 2016 the homogeneity of soil moisture in cropland with flat topography under surface flood irrigation suggests that the gravitational flow of water prevails in soil profiles of this area and might be accurately described by the hydrus 1d software therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the partitioning of irrigation based on long term observations and 2 to optimize the irrigation schedule considering both crop requirement and water saving based on the simulations by the hydrus 1d program in the midstream of the heihe river northwestern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experiment field experiments under rotation of spring wheat and spring maize were conducted in the agricultural field at the linze inland

is rectangular with an area of 0 22 ha and has been reclaimed as orchard from sand dunes since 1975 the desert vegetation of ephedraceae was planted after removing fruit trees and adding clayey soil into the top 20 cm soil in 2000 from 2004 spring maize and spring wheat were alternatively grown table 1 three aluminum neutron access tubes were installed across the field in march 2004 and soil water contents swcs were monitored with a neutron probe at a 10 cm increment in the 0 1 5 m profile every 3 or 5 days from march to october from 2004 additional measurements were implemented before and after each irrigation and heavy rainfall events there were on average 28 and 44 occasions of swc measurement during the growing season of spring wheat from march to july and spring maize from april to october respectively the amount of each irrigtaion event was determined by the access to water and detailed irrigation information is presented in fig 1 and table 2 irrigation accounted for more than 93 of water supply during the growing seasons and groundwater occupied more than 58 3 in frequency and 57 4 in amount of applied water nearly equal amounts of fertilizer 632 kg n ha 1 229 kg p ha 1 and 56 kg k ha 1 were applied in each year and crop development did not suffer nutrient stress throughout the growing seasons at the jointing heading wax ripeness and ripening stages of spring wheat and the five leaf jointing heading and ripening stages of spring maize the height leaf area index and aboveground biomass were recorded from six plots in the field the yield of each plot was determined after harvest in each year soil texture particle size distribution bulk density soil organic carbon content saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and swc pressure head h data pairs on soil water retention curve at various layers of the 0 3 0 m profile of this field were reported in shen 2015 the 20 cm topsoil is finer textured than the underlying layers due to the addition of clayey soil in 2000 and following cultivation the silt fraction and soil organic carbon contents decrease with the increasing depth while the sand content and bulk density increase table 3 daily meteorological data including precipitation solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed relative humidity and vapor pressure were recorded with a standard automated weather station located about 50 m away from the field from september 2004 daily soil evaporation and potential transpiration were calculated by combining the fao penman monteith equation and dual crop coefficient approach which has been verified suitable for various crops and environments allen et al 1998 bodner et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 cammalleri et al 2013 zhao and zhao 2014 rosa et al 2016 paredes et al 2017 naghedifar et al 2018 groundwater level was manually monitored through two groundwater wells in the field every 10 days from april 2004 the meteorological and groundwater dataset used in this study ranged from january 2005 to december 2014 2 2 model simulation the hydrus 1d software package version 4 17 šimůnek et al 2018 was selected for simulating one dimensional equilibrium water

80 cm for spring maize in this study area ji et al 2007 shen 2015 an atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer was selected as the upper boundary condition whereas a variable pressure head as the lower boundary condition daily groundwater level obtained by linear interpolation of the monitoring data daily rainfall irrigation and daily evaporation and transpiration were input as the time variable boundary condition the vertical domain was discretized into 100 equidistant nodes with 5 cm thickness interval initial swc values were obtained by interpolating the first measured swc values in each year to saturation for the nodes above the groundwater table and being equal to the measured θs values between groundwater table and the bottom of soil domain the simulation was conducted separately during the growing season of each year including the period from march to july in 2005 2007 2009 2011 and 2003 for spring wheat and the period from april to october in 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2014 for spring maize the measured 0 1 5 m swc values in 2006 and 2007 were used to calibrate the model and those in the remaining years 2005 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 were used for validation the minimum effective rooting depths of wheat and maize are both 0 3 m raes et al 2012 and the maximum effective rooting depths are 1 2 m and 0 8 m respectively ji et al 2007 shen 2015 comparison in the swcs between the measured and simulated values during the calibration period was thus grouped into 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 0 9 m 0 9 1 2 m and 1 2 1 5 m layers to reflect soil moisture dynamic in the root zone and to facilitate visual inspection the hydrus 1d software solves the governing equation numerically using galerkin type linear finite element schemes and uses a marquardt levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm for inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters šimůnek et al 2018 the parameters θr θs α and n fitted by the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 using the experimental θ h data pairs were input as the initial values during the inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters for soils below 3 0 m hydraulic parameters were assumed to be the same as those in the 2 8 3 0 m the hydrus 1d program allows to optimize up to 15 parameters however optimizing so many parameters simultaneously is not recommended because the calculation often becomes nonunique šimůnek and hopmans 2002 previous studies clarified that parameters ks θs and n profoundly impacted the irrigation return flow jiménez martínez et al 2009 min et al 2015 naghedifar et al 2018 the soil domain was divided into three materials in depths of 0 0 2 m 0 2 1 5 m and 1 5 5 0 m considering the difference in particle size distribution bulk density and soil organic carbon contents among layers in shen 2015 the values of θs n and ks of the three materials were inversely estimated whereas the values of θr and α were fixed in this study table 3 the best parameterization was determined based on diagnostic information of the hydrus 1d routines about the model fit and convergence of the inverse algorithm the performance of the calibration and validation was assessed by three criteria including the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d willmott 1982 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 r m s e i

is the number of observations 2 3 water balance and productivity the swcs were measured in the 0 1 5 m soil and groundwater levels fluctuated from about 3 0 m 5 0 m fig 1 the 5 m soil profile was specified into three layers of 0 1 5 m 1 5 3 0 m and 3 0 5 0 m to simulate the soil moisture discharge or groundwater recharge this stratification guarantees the first layer to cover the maximum rooting depth the second layer to be above the groundwater table and the bottom boundary to immerse into groundwater reservoir daily drainage below the specified medium was calculated based on soil water balance 9 v i 1 p i e t d p v i r 0 where vi 1 and vi are the water volume mm in the soil layer on the i 1 th day and ith day respectively p is rainfall mm i is irrigation mm e is soil evaporation mm t is transpiration mm dp is drainage out of the soil layer mm and r is runoff which is ignorable due to the flat topography in this study positive values of dp mean downward percolation out of the layer whereas negative values suggest capillary rise upwards the layer water productivity was assessed by the ratio of crop yield to water supply including rainfall and irrigation during the crop growing season 10 p w y i e l d i p where pw is the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 yield is the grain yield kg and i and p have the same meanings aforementioned relative contribution of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation was assessed via scenario analysis by assuming 80 60 50 and 40 of current irrigation quotas i and irrigation times meteorological condition antecedent soil moisture and groundwater depth unchanged as before throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the good agreement of simulated swcs with the field swc data during the calibration period verified the suitability of inverse solution in the hydrus 1d simulation fig 2 the optimized θs n and ks values of the three materials are listed in table 3 pooling the 645 swc observations in 2006 the values of r2 mean weighted error and mean weighted absolute error were 0 750 0 004 cm3 cm 3 and 0 014 cm3 cm 3 respectively as for 480 observations in 2007 the above values were 0 790 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 011 cm3 cm 3 respectively the temporal series of swcs in five soil layers in 2006 and 2007 had the rmse values nearing to zero and the d values approximating to 1 fig 2 these results indicate that the models were properly calibrated based on the inversely estimated unbiased and reliable hydraulic parameters which concurs with previous findings for example the inverse modeling in the hydrus 1d program was feasible in estimating groundwater recharge in nebraska of usa wang et al 2016 soil hydraulic parameters derived by the inverse optimization in the hydrus 1d simulation provided a better performance in full pressure head range of evaporation on 431 soil samples in six european countries dettmann et al 2019 soil water contents simulated by the hydrus 1d program were compared with the measured swc values during the growing seasons of the remaining eight years the high r2 values low rmse values and the d and slope values approximating to 1 indicate the good performance of the models fig 3 a the hydrus 1d program simulated well the dynamics of swc and reflected its response to irrigation the swcs increased after irrigation immediately and then decreased until next irrigation event the swcs of the 0 3 m topsoil fluctuated stronger than the underlying layers with the 1 2 1 5 m soil showing the weakest variation figs 2 and 3a the feasibility of applying the hydrus 1d program in simulating the swc dynamics coincides with previous studies in arid regions tian et al 2019 used the hydrus 1d program successively simulated the temporal pattern of soil moisture response to rainfall in the upstream of the heihe river in northwestern china miller et al 2019 showed that the hydrus 1d software accurately simulated the swc in the root zone of wheat in israel 3 2 evapotranspiration dynamics daily actual soil evaporation matched well with potential soil evaporation data indicating the sufficient water supply for atmospheric demand in the ten years fig 3b actual transpiration of spring wheat agreed with potential transpiration values suggesting no occurrence of water stress during the growth of spring wheat fig 3b after irrigation actual transpiration of spring maize was lower than the potential values within the first two days and then approximated to the potential values until next irrigation event figs 3b and 4 differences between the potential and actual transpiration values ranged from 2 38 mm to 3 14 mm from 2 00 mm to 2 89 mm and from 0 37 mm to 0 61 mm on the day conducting irrigation the first day after irrigation and the second day after irrigation in 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2014 respectively actual transpiration values were smaller on average by 2 70 mm 2 33 mm and 0 44 mm than the potential values on the three days respectively fig 4 water uptake is generally assumed to be zero close to saturation wetter than anaerobiosis point h1 and under remarkably dry condition dryer than wilting point pressure head h4 eq 5 feddes et al 1978 roots of wheat start extracting water from soil near saturation h1 0 and h2 1 cm water and maintain the maximum rate under pressure heads above 500 cm water h3 wesseling et al 1991 maize starts to take up water under pressure head of 15 cm water h1 reaches the maximum rate at 30 cm water h2 and remains until 325 cm water h3 wesseling et al 1991 roots of spring wheat do not suffer from water uptake restriction near saturation and spring maize is susceptible to transpiration reduction near saturation immediately after flood irrigation for flood irrigated spring wheat in this region about 94 of water uptake occurred in the 0 0 4 m soil at initial stage and 25 and 69 in the 0 0 4 m and 0 4 1 2 m soil at the mature stage respectively ji et al 2017 about 73 90 and 95 absorbing roots of spring maize distributed in the 0 0 2 m 0 0 4 m and 0 0 6 m soil respectively shen 2015 yi 2015 more water uptake by deeper roots favors to protect spring wheat from the transpiration reduction after irrigation and shallow effective rooting depth of spring maize contributes to water uptake reduction immediately after flood irrigation during the growing season ground cover by crops is ignorable at the beginning of the growing season increases with the expansion of canopy and reaches the maximum in the mid season stage soil evaporation dominates the upward water loss during the establishment and senescence stages of plants while transpiration increases with the leaf area index from the initial to the mid season stages and decreases with the declining canopy coverage fig 5 during the growing season soil evaporation varied from 58 73 mm to 69 03 mm for spring wheat and from 72 69 mm to 93 62 mm for spring maize with mean values of 64 11 mm and 84 03 mm respectively actual transpiration ranged from 304 22 mm to 374 74 mm for spring wheat and from 401 31 mm to 503 44 mm for spring maize averaging to 352 36 mm and 447 43 mm respectively changes in meteorological factors and irrigation amounts lead to the temporal variation in the et values mean annual actual et values of spring wheat and spring maize were 416 47 mm and 531 47 mm with transpiration occupying 84 61 and 84 19 respectively evapotranspiration of cropland in the same or similar regions has been extensively studied the et of spring wheat and spring maize were 425 7 mm and 572 5 mm determined by gravimetric lysimeter in semiarid naiman of north china respectively li et al 2003 ji et al 2007 reported transpiration estimated from measured leaf stomatal conductance was 352 3 mm for spring wheat in this region in 2004 ji et al 2017 showed that the et values of spring maize measured by an eddy covariance system were 451 52 mm in 2003 and 492 54 mm in 2004 in this region actual evapotranspiration varied from 400 to 470 mm for maize under flood irrigation in a floodplain of ethiopia beyene et al 2018 differences in estimation method irrigation amount crop cultivar and soil properties contribute to the disagreement among the studies actual et values of spring wheat and spring maize fell in the range of previous findings indicating the feasibility and accuracy of the hydrus 1d simulation 3 3 deep percolation and groundwater recharge antecedent soil moisture has a great correlation with deep percolation and et is the most important variable defining groundwater recharge mastrocicco et al 2010 lai et al 2016 hu et al 2019 irrigation before seeding acts to restore the moisture and temperature of soil for germination deep percolation happens rapidly from the second to the last irrigation event and remarkable amounts of irrigated water discharge within the first few days after irrigation fig 6 mean percolation of irrigated water from the 0 1 5 m soil of spring wheat and spring maize were 1 61 mm day 1 and 1 66 mm day 1 on the day conducting irrigation increased sharply to 27 37 mm day 1 and 25 19 mm day 1 on the first day after irrigation respectively and decreased until next irrigation event there were 79 23 mm and 82 49 mm of water for spring wheat and spring maize percolated below the 1 5 m soil within ten days after each irrigation event among which about 72 30 and 69 10 occurred within the first three days respectively the highest drainage fluxes of each irrigation event reached the 3 0 m and 5 0 m depths nearly 5 days and 8 days later after irrigation respectively fig 7 groundwater table responds positively to deep percolation of soil water groundwater level in the initial stage became shallower during the mid season stage and deepened again in the late season fig 7 which coincides with previous findings ren et al 2016 reported that percolation from over irrigation raised groundwater table quickly in the hetao irrigation district the distribution pattern of percolation is also influenced by the parameter n of water retention curve coarse textured soil has a large n value and the hydraulic conductivity decreases strongly with declining soil moisture reducing the capability of the soil profile to transmit moisture upwards and increasing groundwater recharge wang et al 2009 deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil during the growing seasons ranged from 692 17 mm to 1015 47 mm for spring wheat and from 752 97 mm to 1218 87 mm for spring maize mean annual amounts were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of irrigated water respectively fig 8 among the percolated water below 1 5 m soil about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m soil respectively deep percolation from the 0 5 0 m layer was regarded as irrigation return flow in this study for spring wheat the amount of groundwater recharge 734 03 mm equaled to the percolation from the 0 3 0 m soil and occupied 87 19 of deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil and 58 86 of irrigated water fig 8 for spring maize more 99 10 mm water was extracted from the 3 0 5 0 m layer amounting to 1002 10 mm of groundwater recharge occupying 70 20 of applied water fig 8 these percentages were higher than the findings in the similar regions for example water percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil occupied over 35 of irrigation for maize in the hetao irrigation district of china ren et al 2016 about 12 41 of flood irrigated water for maize percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil in a floodplain of ethiopia beyene et al 2018 deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in the same region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 differences in meteorology irrigation strategy specific cultivar soil properties and groundwater regime might explain the differences of the studies 3 4 crop production the yield of spring wheat varied from 2150 kg ha 1 in 2011 to 5800 kg ha 1 in 2007 and the yield of spring maize changed from 8350 kg ha 1 in 2014 to 10 850 kg ha 1 in 2008 crop yield of the same cultivar depended on the amount of water supplied for the same seeding density and on the seeding density for the similar amount of water supply table 1 mean yields were 3964 kg ha 1 and 9990 kg ha 1 for spring wheat and spring maize respectively water productivity ranged from 1 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 7 16 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and from 1 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 7 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize with mean values of 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 5 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively 3 5 optimization of irrigation schedule the hypothesized irrigation strategy would satisfy crop water demand and improve water utilization during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize fig 8 mean annual et values under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i would be 416 13 mm 416 15 mm 416 16 mm and 416 20 mm for spring wheat and 535 98 mm 545 22 mm 553 20 mm and 560 92 mm for spring maize respectively these values approximated to those of 416 47 mm and 531 47 mm for spring wheat and spring maize under current irrigation practices respectively fig 9 b the percentage of et to the summation of rainfall and irrigation would raise from 33 97 to 42 11 55 51 66 07 and 92 12 under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively fig 8 deep percolation would decrease with the reducing irrigation quotas the amount of cumulatively percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil of spring wheat and spring maize on average occupied 22 85 47 70 and 63 23 of applied water within the first three and ten days after irrigation under current schedules the percentages would be 11 23 35 38 and 53 94 under the 80 i treatment 6 39 20 49 and 39 06 under the 60 i treatment 3 58 11 99 and 27 42 under the 50 i treatment and 2 04 4 69 and 12 65 under the 40 i treatment mean amount of water percolated out of the 1 5 m soil during the growing seasons would decrease to 591 92 mm 341 66 mm 216 68 mm and 94 86 mm for spring wheat and 684 05 mm 390 22 mm 240 92 mm and 101 20 mm for spring maize under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil would occupy 59 24 45 12 33 67 and 17 77 of irrigated water respectively deep percolation below the 3 0 m soil would be 483 02 mm 238 37 mm 123 59 mm and 44 65 mm for spring wheat and 613 16 mm 321 00 mm 178 70 mm and 71 35 mm for spring maize respectively fig 9 the percentage of deep percolation from the 3 0 m soil to irrigation would decrease to 48 20 31 63 19 51 and 8 93 for spring wheat and 53 46 37 10 24 62 and 12 63 for spring maize respectively fig 8 groundwater recharge of spring wheat would be 487 39 mm 256 00 mm 151 77 mm and 106 53 mm occupying 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water under the treatments respectively figs 8 and 9a groundwater recharge of spring maize would be 712 34 mm 430 26 mm 302 93 mm and 225 05 mm occupying 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water respectively figs 8 and 9b wang et al 2015 suggested that appropriate irrigation depth should be 62 5 of the difference between 20 cm pan evaporation and precipitation in the north china plain measured 20 cm pan evaporation and rainfall were 913 4 mm and 102 2 mm in the weather station of this study during the growing season in 2006 respectively the associated irrigation amount of 507 mm approximated to that of 506 mm under the 40 i treatment in 2006 however hu et al 2017 pointed out that optimized drainage should occupy no less than 25 of irrigation water to control soil salinity in the aksu river basin this coincides with the finding in yang 1993 that most suitable irrigation to drainage ratio should be 4 1 3 1 in the tarim river basin of china slightly more precipitation and stronger evaporation in the midstream of the heihe river basin than the tarim river basin determined that the 40 i treatment would be not enough for controlling soil salinity the percentage of discharge from the 0 1 5 m 0 3 0 m and 0 5 0 m layers to irrigated water under the 50 i treatment for spring wheat and spring maize fell within the ranges reported reduced nutrient loss such as no3 n and no occurrence of salinity stress under properly managed irrigation practices favor maintaining or even improving grain yield the 50 i treatment satisfies crop water demand in terms of evapotranspiration alleviates root water uptake reduction of spring maize near saturation and percolates less water than current irrigation practice and the 80 i and 60 i treatments during the growing seasons lower deep percolation results into less nutrient leaching of each irrigation event the 50 i treatment will protect crops from suffering soil salinity compared to the 40 i treatment no occurrence of water stress nutrient stress and salinity stress during the growing season under the 50 i treatment may lead to improved water productivity the 50 i treatment for spring wheat matched the suggested eleven events of irrigation with quota of 63 mm in ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 advised that irrigation of 40 mm and 50 mm every ten days for spring wheat and spring maize would be suitable throughout the growing seasons and would cause 8 and 9 2 yield reduction in the similar fields respectively about 480 mm of irrigation water during the growing season of spring wheat approximated to that 501 mm of the 40 i treatment there is no need for water in nearly one month before harvesting spring maize a total of 700 mm irrigation water 14 events with quota of 50 mm agreed with the mean value 712 mm of the 50 i treatment during the growing season of spring maize water productivity values would be 6 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat under the 40 i treatment and 11 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize under the 50 i treatment compared to current irrigation practice water productivity of spring wheat would improve by 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the 40 i treatment and that of spring maize would improve by 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the 50 i treatment in the cropland of this study with the improvement of soil texture and hydraulic properties crop water utilization will be more effective water productivity of spring wheat were 12 37 kg ha 1 mm 1 under 480 mm irrigation in the old oasis cropland of this region which has been cultivated for more than 100 years and soil is well developed ma 2013 these results indicate the feasibility of improving crop water productivity by the hypothesized irrigation schedule with the same frequency and 50 of current quotas more field measurements on soil moisture crop growth soil salinity and groundwater table fluctuation are necessary to accurately quantify the improvement of crop water productivity under the hypothesized irrigation strategies 4 conclusions the hydrus 1d program properly simulated the dynamic partitioning of irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize from 2005 to 2014 the simulated swcs agreed well with the measured swc data and its temporal series reflected the impact of irrigation current flood irrigation schedules satisfied water demand of crops and resulted into large amounts of deep percolation and groundwater return flow especially within the first few days after irrigation mean annual soil evaporation and transpiration were 64 11 mm and 352 36 mm for spring wheat and 84 03 mm and 447 43 mm for spring maize respectively mean amounts of deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of applied water during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm water percolated from the 0 1 5 m soil were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m layer respectively groundwater return flow of spring wheat equaled to the deep percolation from the 0 3 0 m soil layer except for deep percolation from the 0 3 0 m layer more 99 10 mm water was extracted to recharge groundwater for spring maize groundwater recharge amounts were 734 03 mm and 1002 10 mm occupying 58 86 and 70 20 of irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively scenario analysis was conducted to assess the relative contribution of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation using the hydrus 1d program irrigation quota of each event was assumed to reduce by 20 80 i 40 60 i 50 50 i and 60 40 i and the other factors remain unchanged as before throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 the assumed irrigation schedules would meet crop water demand with mean annual et values of spring wheat and spring maize under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i approximated to those under current irrigation practices deep percolation would decrease under the treatments mean amount of percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil would occupy on average 59 24 45 12 33 67 and 17 77 of irrigation during the growing seasons under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively groundwater recharge would occupy 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water for spring wheat and 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water for spring maize respectively the hypothesized irrigation schedule with the same frequency and 50 of current quotas would improve water productivity by at least 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize in the cropland this measure is promising for protecting groundwater resources and balancing the conflicts on water requirement either among irrigated agriculture industry and natural ecosystem in the midstream or between the mid and down streams antecedent soil moisture and groundwater depth were assumed unchanged in the scenario analysis which needs to be modified in future studies field measurements of soil water contents soil salinity groundwater

10538,accurate knowledge of evapotranspiration et and irrigation return flow is critical for the sustainable management of water resources in arid inland river basins flood irrigation with large amounts of groundwater and resulting return flow may be not suitable for cropland with long cultivation history in the midstream of the heihe river basin of northwestern china flood irrigated cropland with rotation of spring wheat and spring maize from 2005 to 2014 was selected as study area deep percolation fluxes below the 1 5 m 3 0 m and 5 0 m layers were determined based on soil water balance for which soil evaporation transpiration and soil water content swc dynamics during the growing seasons were calibrated and validated by the hydrus 1d simulation mean annual soil evaporation and transpiration were 64 11 mm and 352 36 mm for spring wheat and 84 03 mm and 447 43 mm for spring maize respectively large amounts of water discharged within the first few days after irrigation from the second to the last irrigation events deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of applied water during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm water percolated from the 0 1 5 m soil were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m layer respectively groundwater recharge the amount of deep percolation below 5 0 m amounted to 734 03 mm and 1002 10 mm occupying 58 86 and 70 20 of applied irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively mean water productivity were 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize the impact of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation was assessed by assuming 80 80 i 60 60 i 50 50 i and 40 40 i of current irrigation quota i of each event throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 even the 40 i treatment would satisfy water demand of spring wheat and spring maize and deep percolation would decrease remarkably the percentage of percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil to irrigation would decrease on average by 8 31 22 43 33 88 and 49 78 under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively groundwater recharge would occupy 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water for spring wheat and 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water for spring maize respectively the 50 i treatment would improve water productivity by at least 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize the hypothesized irrigation schedule with current frequency and 50 quota of each event is promising to improve crop water utilization and protect groundwater resources optimized irrigation strategy for irrigated agriculture in the midstream will aid the comprehensive management of water resources at a watershed scale in the arid inland river basins keywords numerical simulation irrigation partition deep percolation evapotranspiration optimized irrigation schedule 1 introduction in the heihe river basin of northwestern china runoff generated in the mountainous upstream is the main water source supplying for the mid and down streams the midstream is a dominant production base for commodity grain agriculture relies heavily on irrigation which occupies about 90 of total water consumption and has become increasingly dependent on groundwater after implementing the water diversion scheme from 2000 chen et al 2003 farmers chronically irrigate the cropland based on the access to water rather than growth stage based water demand but more water does not necessarily mean increased yield and water use efficiency overexploitation of water resources due to the expansion of artificial oases has led to the decline of groundwater level and in turn the severe deterioration of natural ecosystem in the downstream ji et al 2006 kang et al 2007 improving irrigation water utilization by crops and developing water conserving irrigated agriculture in the midstream are necessary to meet the increasing economic and ecological water requirements under the comprehensive management of water resources at a watershed scale irrigation with large amounts of water is effective to alleviate salinity caused yield reduction in the new cultivated sandy land but it may cause high water and nutrient losses for example the seasonal drainage and no3 n leaching under continuous furrow irrigation was 50 higher than that under variable and fixed furrow irrigation for rapeseed in iran sepaskhah and tafteh 2012 high nitrogen leaching occurred when about 34 58 and 37 of irrigation and precipitation percolated for corn potato and the rotation of lettuce and melon in the western mediterranean poch massegú et al 2014 water saving irrigation can remarkably reduce water losses by seepage and deep percolation tan et al 2014 naghedifar et al 2018 yost et al 2019 however enhanced salt concentration in the root zone due to improper water saving irrigation reduces root water uptake and influences the grain yield rosa et al 2016 wang et al 2017 phogat et al 2018 the effect of water saving irrigation on crop production should be treated case by case for example deficit irrigation with mulching was effective to increase crop yield in the arid shiyang river basin of china wen et al 2017 surface drip irrigation under 60 field capacity was suitable for winter wheat than sprinkle and flood irrigation in the north china plain jha et al 2019 soil salinity increased and crop yield declined under deficit irrigation in the upper yellow river with shallow groundwater level xu et al 2013 ren et al 2018 deep percolation acts as a primary pathway to recharge groundwater and provides important hydrologic and ecosystem benefits porhemmat et al 2018 argued the sustainability of drip and sprinkler irrigation due to the lower potential groundwater recharge than furrow irrigation in iran flood irrigation for croplands with long cultivation history in the midstream of the heihe river should be properly managed to maximize crop utilization and control the volumes of percolated water previous studies showed that deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in croplands cultivated for more than 45 years in this region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 the government and farmers at present cannot afford to extensively develop water saving irrigation systems it seems to be feasible by altering present irrigation schedules to simultaneously account for crop production soil salinity and groundwater recharge high frequency irrigation with decreased amount of single event is necessary for meeting crop water demand and maintaining low soil salinity wang et al 2010 askri et al 2014 and has been suggested in this study area ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 however previous reports were almost from one or two years field experiments accurately quantifying the partition of irrigation water based on decades of observations and proposing modified irrigation schedules are vital for the sustainable utilization of water resources in the heihe river basin quantifying the dynamic partitioning of irrigation water during the growing season is essential for improving water use efficiency field measurements of soil water balance components using large scale weighting lysimeter sap flow and micro meteorological methods have been extensively used to establish relationship between the roots the vadose zone and the groundwater hydrology liu et al 2002 wolf et al 2008 lopez urrea et al 2009 the weighting lysimeter method is regarded to mimic field conditions reasonably well and is accurate to quantify the evapotranspiration et and deep percolation under well defined initial and boundary conditions liu et al 2002 fahle and dietrich 2014 dijkema et al 2018 however the construction and maintenance of the lysimeters are expensive mathematical models such as the soil water atmosphere plant model crescimanno and garofalo 2005 verma et al 2014 xue and ren 2017 root zone water quality model hanson et al 1998 soil plant system with water and solute transport model hu et al 2007 the hydrus program šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 the aqyield model tribouillois et al 2018 and models coupling water and salt balance and crop yield estimation modules xue et al 2018 are alternatives to improve the mechanistic understanding of the physical processes and have been used for irrigation water management nutrient leaching salinity control and yield estimation over the world the hydrus 1d software is a one dimensional computer program based on the richard s equation for variability saturated water flow and the advection dispersion equation for solute transport šimůnek and van genuchten 2008 this software has been successively used to simulate vadose zone hydrologic processes salinization nutrient leaching and plant growth in a wide range of soils for example the hydrus 1d program was capable of simulating the reuse of saline drainage water by alfafa from shallow groundwater shouse et al 2011 the hydrus 1d program successively simulated the water balance of the sandy loess sediments for bare soil and soils with sparse or dense natural vegetation in the coastal plain of israel and gaza within 25 years dafny and šimůnek 2016 the hydrus 1d simulation provided consistent time series of et measured by eddy covariance systems in rainfed vineyard throughout the growth cycles in southern france galleguillos et al 2017 kader et al 2019 pointed out that the hydrus 1d software performed well in simulating heat and water movement under the treatments of rice straw mulching and bare soil the percentage of percolation to applied irrigation was simulated by the hydrus 1d program over the world such as 22 68 in semi arid southeastern spain jiménez martínez et al 2009 an increase by 3 for a warmer climate and a decrease by 85 for a colder climate in belgium for the next 10 000 years leterme et al 2012 and ranging from 35 to 60 in the hetao irrigation district of china ren et al 2016 the homogeneity of soil moisture in cropland with flat topography under surface flood irrigation suggests that the gravitational flow of water prevails in soil profiles of this area and might be accurately described by the hydrus 1d software therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the partitioning of irrigation based on long term observations and 2 to optimize the irrigation schedule considering both crop requirement and water saving based on the simulations by the hydrus 1d program in the midstream of the heihe river northwestern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and experiment field experiments under rotation of spring wheat and spring maize were conducted in the agricultural field at the linze inland

is rectangular with an area of 0 22 ha and has been reclaimed as orchard from sand dunes since 1975 the desert vegetation of ephedraceae was planted after removing fruit trees and adding clayey soil into the top 20 cm soil in 2000 from 2004 spring maize and spring wheat were alternatively grown table 1 three aluminum neutron access tubes were installed across the field in march 2004 and soil water contents swcs were monitored with a neutron probe at a 10 cm increment in the 0 1 5 m profile every 3 or 5 days from march to october from 2004 additional measurements were implemented before and after each irrigation and heavy rainfall events there were on average 28 and 44 occasions of swc measurement during the growing season of spring wheat from march to july and spring maize from april to october respectively the amount of each irrigtaion event was determined by the access to water and detailed irrigation information is presented in fig 1 and table 2 irrigation accounted for more than 93 of water supply during the growing seasons and groundwater occupied more than 58 3 in frequency and 57 4 in amount of applied water nearly equal amounts of fertilizer 632 kg n ha 1 229 kg p ha 1 and 56 kg k ha 1 were applied in each year and crop development did not suffer nutrient stress throughout the growing seasons at the jointing heading wax ripeness and ripening stages of spring wheat and the five leaf jointing heading and ripening stages of spring maize the height leaf area index and aboveground biomass were recorded from six plots in the field the yield of each plot was determined after harvest in each year soil texture particle size distribution bulk density soil organic carbon content saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and swc pressure head h data pairs on soil water retention curve at various layers of the 0 3 0 m profile of this field were reported in shen 2015 the 20 cm topsoil is finer textured than the underlying layers due to the addition of clayey soil in 2000 and following cultivation the silt fraction and soil organic carbon contents decrease with the increasing depth while the sand content and bulk density increase table 3 daily meteorological data including precipitation solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature wind speed relative humidity and vapor pressure were recorded with a standard automated weather station located about 50 m away from the field from september 2004 daily soil evaporation and potential transpiration were calculated by combining the fao penman monteith equation and dual crop coefficient approach which has been verified suitable for various crops and environments allen et al 1998 bodner et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 cammalleri et al 2013 zhao and zhao 2014 rosa et al 2016 paredes et al 2017 naghedifar et al 2018 groundwater level was manually monitored through two groundwater wells in the field every 10 days from april 2004 the meteorological and groundwater dataset used in this study ranged from january 2005 to december 2014 2 2 model simulation the hydrus 1d software package version 4 17 šimůnek et al 2018 was selected for simulating one dimensional equilibrium water

80 cm for spring maize in this study area ji et al 2007 shen 2015 an atmospheric boundary condition with surface layer was selected as the upper boundary condition whereas a variable pressure head as the lower boundary condition daily groundwater level obtained by linear interpolation of the monitoring data daily rainfall irrigation and daily evaporation and transpiration were input as the time variable boundary condition the vertical domain was discretized into 100 equidistant nodes with 5 cm thickness interval initial swc values were obtained by interpolating the first measured swc values in each year to saturation for the nodes above the groundwater table and being equal to the measured θs values between groundwater table and the bottom of soil domain the simulation was conducted separately during the growing season of each year including the period from march to july in 2005 2007 2009 2011 and 2003 for spring wheat and the period from april to october in 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2014 for spring maize the measured 0 1 5 m swc values in 2006 and 2007 were used to calibrate the model and those in the remaining years 2005 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 were used for validation the minimum effective rooting depths of wheat and maize are both 0 3 m raes et al 2012 and the maximum effective rooting depths are 1 2 m and 0 8 m respectively ji et al 2007 shen 2015 comparison in the swcs between the measured and simulated values during the calibration period was thus grouped into 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 0 9 m 0 9 1 2 m and 1 2 1 5 m layers to reflect soil moisture dynamic in the root zone and to facilitate visual inspection the hydrus 1d software solves the governing equation numerically using galerkin type linear finite element schemes and uses a marquardt levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm for inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters šimůnek et al 2018 the parameters θr θs α and n fitted by the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 using the experimental θ h data pairs were input as the initial values during the inverse estimation of soil hydraulic parameters for soils below 3 0 m hydraulic parameters were assumed to be the same as those in the 2 8 3 0 m the hydrus 1d program allows to optimize up to 15 parameters however optimizing so many parameters simultaneously is not recommended because the calculation often becomes nonunique šimůnek and hopmans 2002 previous studies clarified that parameters ks θs and n profoundly impacted the irrigation return flow jiménez martínez et al 2009 min et al 2015 naghedifar et al 2018 the soil domain was divided into three materials in depths of 0 0 2 m 0 2 1 5 m and 1 5 5 0 m considering the difference in particle size distribution bulk density and soil organic carbon contents among layers in shen 2015 the values of θs n and ks of the three materials were inversely estimated whereas the values of θr and α were fixed in this study table 3 the best parameterization was determined based on diagnostic information of the hydrus 1d routines about the model fit and convergence of the inverse algorithm the performance of the calibration and validation was assessed by three criteria including the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d willmott 1982 8 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 r m s e i

is the number of observations 2 3 water balance and productivity the swcs were measured in the 0 1 5 m soil and groundwater levels fluctuated from about 3 0 m 5 0 m fig 1 the 5 m soil profile was specified into three layers of 0 1 5 m 1 5 3 0 m and 3 0 5 0 m to simulate the soil moisture discharge or groundwater recharge this stratification guarantees the first layer to cover the maximum rooting depth the second layer to be above the groundwater table and the bottom boundary to immerse into groundwater reservoir daily drainage below the specified medium was calculated based on soil water balance 9 v i 1 p i e t d p v i r 0 where vi 1 and vi are the water volume mm in the soil layer on the i 1 th day and ith day respectively p is rainfall mm i is irrigation mm e is soil evaporation mm t is transpiration mm dp is drainage out of the soil layer mm and r is runoff which is ignorable due to the flat topography in this study positive values of dp mean downward percolation out of the layer whereas negative values suggest capillary rise upwards the layer water productivity was assessed by the ratio of crop yield to water supply including rainfall and irrigation during the crop growing season 10 p w y i e l d i p where pw is the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 yield is the grain yield kg and i and p have the same meanings aforementioned relative contribution of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation was assessed via scenario analysis by assuming 80 60 50 and 40 of current irrigation quotas i and irrigation times meteorological condition antecedent soil moisture and groundwater depth unchanged as before throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the good agreement of simulated swcs with the field swc data during the calibration period verified the suitability of inverse solution in the hydrus 1d simulation fig 2 the optimized θs n and ks values of the three materials are listed in table 3 pooling the 645 swc observations in 2006 the values of r2 mean weighted error and mean weighted absolute error were 0 750 0 004 cm3 cm 3 and 0 014 cm3 cm 3 respectively as for 480 observations in 2007 the above values were 0 790 0 003 cm3 cm 3 and 0 011 cm3 cm 3 respectively the temporal series of swcs in five soil layers in 2006 and 2007 had the rmse values nearing to zero and the d values approximating to 1 fig 2 these results indicate that the models were properly calibrated based on the inversely estimated unbiased and reliable hydraulic parameters which concurs with previous findings for example the inverse modeling in the hydrus 1d program was feasible in estimating groundwater recharge in nebraska of usa wang et al 2016 soil hydraulic parameters derived by the inverse optimization in the hydrus 1d simulation provided a better performance in full pressure head range of evaporation on 431 soil samples in six european countries dettmann et al 2019 soil water contents simulated by the hydrus 1d program were compared with the measured swc values during the growing seasons of the remaining eight years the high r2 values low rmse values and the d and slope values approximating to 1 indicate the good performance of the models fig 3 a the hydrus 1d program simulated well the dynamics of swc and reflected its response to irrigation the swcs increased after irrigation immediately and then decreased until next irrigation event the swcs of the 0 3 m topsoil fluctuated stronger than the underlying layers with the 1 2 1 5 m soil showing the weakest variation figs 2 and 3a the feasibility of applying the hydrus 1d program in simulating the swc dynamics coincides with previous studies in arid regions tian et al 2019 used the hydrus 1d program successively simulated the temporal pattern of soil moisture response to rainfall in the upstream of the heihe river in northwestern china miller et al 2019 showed that the hydrus 1d software accurately simulated the swc in the root zone of wheat in israel 3 2 evapotranspiration dynamics daily actual soil evaporation matched well with potential soil evaporation data indicating the sufficient water supply for atmospheric demand in the ten years fig 3b actual transpiration of spring wheat agreed with potential transpiration values suggesting no occurrence of water stress during the growth of spring wheat fig 3b after irrigation actual transpiration of spring maize was lower than the potential values within the first two days and then approximated to the potential values until next irrigation event figs 3b and 4 differences between the potential and actual transpiration values ranged from 2 38 mm to 3 14 mm from 2 00 mm to 2 89 mm and from 0 37 mm to 0 61 mm on the day conducting irrigation the first day after irrigation and the second day after irrigation in 2006 2008 2010 2012 and 2014 respectively actual transpiration values were smaller on average by 2 70 mm 2 33 mm and 0 44 mm than the potential values on the three days respectively fig 4 water uptake is generally assumed to be zero close to saturation wetter than anaerobiosis point h1 and under remarkably dry condition dryer than wilting point pressure head h4 eq 5 feddes et al 1978 roots of wheat start extracting water from soil near saturation h1 0 and h2 1 cm water and maintain the maximum rate under pressure heads above 500 cm water h3 wesseling et al 1991 maize starts to take up water under pressure head of 15 cm water h1 reaches the maximum rate at 30 cm water h2 and remains until 325 cm water h3 wesseling et al 1991 roots of spring wheat do not suffer from water uptake restriction near saturation and spring maize is susceptible to transpiration reduction near saturation immediately after flood irrigation for flood irrigated spring wheat in this region about 94 of water uptake occurred in the 0 0 4 m soil at initial stage and 25 and 69 in the 0 0 4 m and 0 4 1 2 m soil at the mature stage respectively ji et al 2017 about 73 90 and 95 absorbing roots of spring maize distributed in the 0 0 2 m 0 0 4 m and 0 0 6 m soil respectively shen 2015 yi 2015 more water uptake by deeper roots favors to protect spring wheat from the transpiration reduction after irrigation and shallow effective rooting depth of spring maize contributes to water uptake reduction immediately after flood irrigation during the growing season ground cover by crops is ignorable at the beginning of the growing season increases with the expansion of canopy and reaches the maximum in the mid season stage soil evaporation dominates the upward water loss during the establishment and senescence stages of plants while transpiration increases with the leaf area index from the initial to the mid season stages and decreases with the declining canopy coverage fig 5 during the growing season soil evaporation varied from 58 73 mm to 69 03 mm for spring wheat and from 72 69 mm to 93 62 mm for spring maize with mean values of 64 11 mm and 84 03 mm respectively actual transpiration ranged from 304 22 mm to 374 74 mm for spring wheat and from 401 31 mm to 503 44 mm for spring maize averaging to 352 36 mm and 447 43 mm respectively changes in meteorological factors and irrigation amounts lead to the temporal variation in the et values mean annual actual et values of spring wheat and spring maize were 416 47 mm and 531 47 mm with transpiration occupying 84 61 and 84 19 respectively evapotranspiration of cropland in the same or similar regions has been extensively studied the et of spring wheat and spring maize were 425 7 mm and 572 5 mm determined by gravimetric lysimeter in semiarid naiman of north china respectively li et al 2003 ji et al 2007 reported transpiration estimated from measured leaf stomatal conductance was 352 3 mm for spring wheat in this region in 2004 ji et al 2017 showed that the et values of spring maize measured by an eddy covariance system were 451 52 mm in 2003 and 492 54 mm in 2004 in this region actual evapotranspiration varied from 400 to 470 mm for maize under flood irrigation in a floodplain of ethiopia beyene et al 2018 differences in estimation method irrigation amount crop cultivar and soil properties contribute to the disagreement among the studies actual et values of spring wheat and spring maize fell in the range of previous findings indicating the feasibility and accuracy of the hydrus 1d simulation 3 3 deep percolation and groundwater recharge antecedent soil moisture has a great correlation with deep percolation and et is the most important variable defining groundwater recharge mastrocicco et al 2010 lai et al 2016 hu et al 2019 irrigation before seeding acts to restore the moisture and temperature of soil for germination deep percolation happens rapidly from the second to the last irrigation event and remarkable amounts of irrigated water discharge within the first few days after irrigation fig 6 mean percolation of irrigated water from the 0 1 5 m soil of spring wheat and spring maize were 1 61 mm day 1 and 1 66 mm day 1 on the day conducting irrigation increased sharply to 27 37 mm day 1 and 25 19 mm day 1 on the first day after irrigation respectively and decreased until next irrigation event there were 79 23 mm and 82 49 mm of water for spring wheat and spring maize percolated below the 1 5 m soil within ten days after each irrigation event among which about 72 30 and 69 10 occurred within the first three days respectively the highest drainage fluxes of each irrigation event reached the 3 0 m and 5 0 m depths nearly 5 days and 8 days later after irrigation respectively fig 7 groundwater table responds positively to deep percolation of soil water groundwater level in the initial stage became shallower during the mid season stage and deepened again in the late season fig 7 which coincides with previous findings ren et al 2016 reported that percolation from over irrigation raised groundwater table quickly in the hetao irrigation district the distribution pattern of percolation is also influenced by the parameter n of water retention curve coarse textured soil has a large n value and the hydraulic conductivity decreases strongly with declining soil moisture reducing the capability of the soil profile to transmit moisture upwards and increasing groundwater recharge wang et al 2009 deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil during the growing seasons ranged from 692 17 mm to 1015 47 mm for spring wheat and from 752 97 mm to 1218 87 mm for spring maize mean annual amounts were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of irrigated water respectively fig 8 among the percolated water below 1 5 m soil about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m soil respectively deep percolation from the 0 5 0 m layer was regarded as irrigation return flow in this study for spring wheat the amount of groundwater recharge 734 03 mm equaled to the percolation from the 0 3 0 m soil and occupied 87 19 of deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil and 58 86 of irrigated water fig 8 for spring maize more 99 10 mm water was extracted from the 3 0 5 0 m layer amounting to 1002 10 mm of groundwater recharge occupying 70 20 of applied water fig 8 these percentages were higher than the findings in the similar regions for example water percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil occupied over 35 of irrigation for maize in the hetao irrigation district of china ren et al 2016 about 12 41 of flood irrigated water for maize percolated from the 0 3 0 m soil in a floodplain of ethiopia beyene et al 2018 deep percolation from the 0 1 2 m soil accounted for 32 3 and 42 9 of applied water for spring wheat and spring maize and that from the 0 2 0 m soil occupied 43 0 of irrigated water for spring wheat in the same region ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 differences in meteorology irrigation strategy specific cultivar soil properties and groundwater regime might explain the differences of the studies 3 4 crop production the yield of spring wheat varied from 2150 kg ha 1 in 2011 to 5800 kg ha 1 in 2007 and the yield of spring maize changed from 8350 kg ha 1 in 2014 to 10 850 kg ha 1 in 2008 crop yield of the same cultivar depended on the amount of water supplied for the same seeding density and on the seeding density for the similar amount of water supply table 1 mean yields were 3964 kg ha 1 and 9990 kg ha 1 for spring wheat and spring maize respectively water productivity ranged from 1 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 7 16 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and from 1 98 kg ha 1 mm 1 to 7 97 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize with mean values of 4 24 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 5 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively 3 5 optimization of irrigation schedule the hypothesized irrigation strategy would satisfy crop water demand and improve water utilization during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize fig 8 mean annual et values under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i would be 416 13 mm 416 15 mm 416 16 mm and 416 20 mm for spring wheat and 535 98 mm 545 22 mm 553 20 mm and 560 92 mm for spring maize respectively these values approximated to those of 416 47 mm and 531 47 mm for spring wheat and spring maize under current irrigation practices respectively fig 9 b the percentage of et to the summation of rainfall and irrigation would raise from 33 97 to 42 11 55 51 66 07 and 92 12 under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively fig 8 deep percolation would decrease with the reducing irrigation quotas the amount of cumulatively percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil of spring wheat and spring maize on average occupied 22 85 47 70 and 63 23 of applied water within the first three and ten days after irrigation under current schedules the percentages would be 11 23 35 38 and 53 94 under the 80 i treatment 6 39 20 49 and 39 06 under the 60 i treatment 3 58 11 99 and 27 42 under the 50 i treatment and 2 04 4 69 and 12 65 under the 40 i treatment mean amount of water percolated out of the 1 5 m soil during the growing seasons would decrease to 591 92 mm 341 66 mm 216 68 mm and 94 86 mm for spring wheat and 684 05 mm 390 22 mm 240 92 mm and 101 20 mm for spring maize under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil would occupy 59 24 45 12 33 67 and 17 77 of irrigated water respectively deep percolation below the 3 0 m soil would be 483 02 mm 238 37 mm 123 59 mm and 44 65 mm for spring wheat and 613 16 mm 321 00 mm 178 70 mm and 71 35 mm for spring maize respectively fig 9 the percentage of deep percolation from the 3 0 m soil to irrigation would decrease to 48 20 31 63 19 51 and 8 93 for spring wheat and 53 46 37 10 24 62 and 12 63 for spring maize respectively fig 8 groundwater recharge of spring wheat would be 487 39 mm 256 00 mm 151 77 mm and 106 53 mm occupying 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water under the treatments respectively figs 8 and 9a groundwater recharge of spring maize would be 712 34 mm 430 26 mm 302 93 mm and 225 05 mm occupying 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water respectively figs 8 and 9b wang et al 2015 suggested that appropriate irrigation depth should be 62 5 of the difference between 20 cm pan evaporation and precipitation in the north china plain measured 20 cm pan evaporation and rainfall were 913 4 mm and 102 2 mm in the weather station of this study during the growing season in 2006 respectively the associated irrigation amount of 507 mm approximated to that of 506 mm under the 40 i treatment in 2006 however hu et al 2017 pointed out that optimized drainage should occupy no less than 25 of irrigation water to control soil salinity in the aksu river basin this coincides with the finding in yang 1993 that most suitable irrigation to drainage ratio should be 4 1 3 1 in the tarim river basin of china slightly more precipitation and stronger evaporation in the midstream of the heihe river basin than the tarim river basin determined that the 40 i treatment would be not enough for controlling soil salinity the percentage of discharge from the 0 1 5 m 0 3 0 m and 0 5 0 m layers to irrigated water under the 50 i treatment for spring wheat and spring maize fell within the ranges reported reduced nutrient loss such as no3 n and no occurrence of salinity stress under properly managed irrigation practices favor maintaining or even improving grain yield the 50 i treatment satisfies crop water demand in terms of evapotranspiration alleviates root water uptake reduction of spring maize near saturation and percolates less water than current irrigation practice and the 80 i and 60 i treatments during the growing seasons lower deep percolation results into less nutrient leaching of each irrigation event the 50 i treatment will protect crops from suffering soil salinity compared to the 40 i treatment no occurrence of water stress nutrient stress and salinity stress during the growing season under the 50 i treatment may lead to improved water productivity the 50 i treatment for spring wheat matched the suggested eleven events of irrigation with quota of 63 mm in ji et al 2007 zhou and zhao 2019 advised that irrigation of 40 mm and 50 mm every ten days for spring wheat and spring maize would be suitable throughout the growing seasons and would cause 8 and 9 2 yield reduction in the similar fields respectively about 480 mm of irrigation water during the growing season of spring wheat approximated to that 501 mm of the 40 i treatment there is no need for water in nearly one month before harvesting spring maize a total of 700 mm irrigation water 14 events with quota of 50 mm agreed with the mean value 712 mm of the 50 i treatment during the growing season of spring maize water productivity values would be 6 76 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat under the 40 i treatment and 11 12 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize under the 50 i treatment compared to current irrigation practice water productivity of spring wheat would improve by 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the 40 i treatment and that of spring maize would improve by 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 under the 50 i treatment in the cropland of this study with the improvement of soil texture and hydraulic properties crop water utilization will be more effective water productivity of spring wheat were 12 37 kg ha 1 mm 1 under 480 mm irrigation in the old oasis cropland of this region which has been cultivated for more than 100 years and soil is well developed ma 2013 these results indicate the feasibility of improving crop water productivity by the hypothesized irrigation schedule with the same frequency and 50 of current quotas more field measurements on soil moisture crop growth soil salinity and groundwater table fluctuation are necessary to accurately quantify the improvement of crop water productivity under the hypothesized irrigation strategies 4 conclusions the hydrus 1d program properly simulated the dynamic partitioning of irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize from 2005 to 2014 the simulated swcs agreed well with the measured swc data and its temporal series reflected the impact of irrigation current flood irrigation schedules satisfied water demand of crops and resulted into large amounts of deep percolation and groundwater return flow especially within the first few days after irrigation mean annual soil evaporation and transpiration were 64 11 mm and 352 36 mm for spring wheat and 84 03 mm and 447 43 mm for spring maize respectively mean amounts of deep percolation below the 1 5 m soil were 841 87 mm and 973 73 mm occupying 67 10 and 68 00 of applied water during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively about 108 86 mm and 70 72 mm water percolated from the 0 1 5 m soil were stored in the 1 5 3 0 m layer respectively groundwater return flow of spring wheat equaled to the deep percolation from the 0 3 0 m soil layer except for deep percolation from the 0 3 0 m layer more 99 10 mm water was extracted to recharge groundwater for spring maize groundwater recharge amounts were 734 03 mm and 1002 10 mm occupying 58 86 and 70 20 of irrigation during the growing seasons of spring wheat and spring maize respectively scenario analysis was conducted to assess the relative contribution of decreasing irrigation amount on deep percolation using the hydrus 1d program irrigation quota of each event was assumed to reduce by 20 80 i 40 60 i 50 50 i and 60 40 i and the other factors remain unchanged as before throughout the growing seasons from 2005 to 2014 the assumed irrigation schedules would meet crop water demand with mean annual et values of spring wheat and spring maize under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i approximated to those under current irrigation practices deep percolation would decrease under the treatments mean amount of percolated water from the 0 1 5 m soil would occupy on average 59 24 45 12 33 67 and 17 77 of irrigation during the growing seasons under the treatments of 80 i 60 i 50 i and 40 i respectively groundwater recharge would occupy 48 90 34 20 24 45 and 21 79 of irrigated water for spring wheat and 62 32 50 21 42 68 and 40 44 of irrigated water for spring maize respectively the hypothesized irrigation schedule with the same frequency and 50 of current quotas would improve water productivity by at least 2 52 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring wheat and 5 26 kg ha 1 mm 1 for spring maize in the cropland this measure is promising for protecting groundwater resources and balancing the conflicts on water requirement either among irrigated agriculture industry and natural ecosystem in the midstream or between the mid and down streams antecedent soil moisture and groundwater depth were assumed unchanged in the scenario analysis which needs to be modified in future studies field measurements of soil water contents soil salinity groundwater

10539,in order to explore the application value of the stable carbon isotope discrimination method in improving water use efficiency wue and productivity of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation five water deficit levels 55 65 75 85 and 100 of full irrigation with thirteen treatments were established at three growth stages in field grown kiwifruit the leaf stable carbon isotope discrimination δl at different growth stages and fruit stable carbon isotope discrimination δf at fruit maturation stage of kiwifruit were determined the changes of wue at leaf and yield levels were analyzed and the indicating effect of carbon isotope discrimination δ13c on the wue of kiwifruit was also verified the results showed that moderate water deficit improved the wuei photosynthesis rate transpiration rate pn tr and wuen photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance pn gs of kiwifruit at each growth stage compared with full irrigation ck the yield y and wuey yield crop evapotranspiration y et of low water deficit treatment ld at fruit maturation stage increased by 14 75 and 23 74 respectively there were significant relationships between δl and δf versus wue ci ca the specific value of intercellular co2 concentration and ambient atmosphere co2 concentration ce carboxylation rate et crop evapotranspiration and y under deficit drip irrigation respectively δl was negatively correlated with wuen coefficient of determination r2 0 4844 p 0 01 over the whole growth period whereas δf was positively correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 and et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 respectively overall this study verifies that δl can be used as a useful evaluation index of wuen and δf is an important indicator of quantifying y and et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation keywords stable carbon isotope discrimination deficit drip irrigation water use efficiency kiwifruit growth stage 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources accounting for about 70 of the global water use rosegrant et al 2009 the shortage of water resources and effective managements and the uneven distribution of rainfall are the main factors constraining agricultural production as climate changes and the demand for agricultural water use increases water shortage will become more serious under the premise of sustainable development of regional water resources the efficient use of water resources is the primary way to solve current water shortage condition yasir et al 2013 unver et al 2017 du et al 2015 promoting scientific rational irrigation methods and techniques is significant for alleviating water shortage and achieving the sustainable development of agricultural production deficit irrigation di has been proven to be an effective water saving irrigation method to improve yield and water use efficiency under the premise of minimizing irrigation amount during the crop growth period geerts and raes 2009 plants can adapt to water deficit and the mechanisms are characterized by drought avoidance and drought tolerance yue et al 2006 crop transpiration and soil evapotranspiration are inhibited when crops are subjected to water stress and crops are trained to have an adaption against drought to enhance the ability of drought resistance and water use efficiency banik et al 2016 the distribution of assimilates from vegetative organs to reproductive organs in plant increased under water deficit and after water stress relieved compensatory effects on the growth losses caused by water stress condition occurred in crops farquhar et al 1989 abscisic acid aba is produced as a signal for soil drought to regulate stomata in crops when they are suffering water stress nakashima and yamaguchi shinozaki 2013 stomatal conductance gs reduces when the soil gets drier which causes a lower transpiration rate tr and a higher water use efficiency du et al 2015 crop water use efficiency wue can express the relationship between carbon assimilation and water consumption including instantaneous water use efficiency wuei and intrinsic water use efficiency wuen at leaf level and water use efficiency at yield level wuey jones et al 1980 medrano et al 2015 crop wue is affected by many factors such as leaf area leaf stomatal conductance root distribution and other crop physiological characteristics as well as atmospheric co2 concentration temperature precipitation illumination and other atmospheric factors many studies have shown that in the case of moderate water deficit crop yields did not necessarily and significantly reduced but wue has dramatically improved iniesta et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 water deficit significantly decreases gs and tr while photosynthesis is less affected resulting in an increase in wuei and wuen further increasing wuey in recent years the carbon isotope discrimination δ13c has been successfully employed to evaluate the wue of c3 plants when plants absorb co2 in photosynthesis the rubp carboxylase of photocatalytic carboxylation produces different catalytic reactions and discriminates 12co2 and 13co2 farquhar et al 1989 which leads to variations of 13c 12c in plant tissues and further in δ13c low specific value of intercellular co2 concentration ci to ambient atmosphere co2 concentration ca ci ca decreases the discrimination reaction of rubp leading to low δ13c easlon et al 2014 monneveux et al 2006 xu et al 2007 high photosynthetic rate low transpiration rate and low stomatal conductance often represent low ci ca as well as high wue therefore the smaller δ13c corresponds to the higher wue and hence wue can be effectively evaluated by the δ13c value a large number of experiments have been conducted to study the variation of stable carbon isotope in different tissues of crops and δ13c was used to assess wue at different levels of plants a negative relationship between leaf δ13c and wuen in c3 plants was reported farquhar et al 1989 leaf δ13c δl negatively correlated with wuei coefficient of determination r2 0 82 and wuey r2 0 77 in a collection of bush beans under three water regimes raeini sarjaz et al 1998 respectively significant negative correlations were found between wuei and grain δ13c δg in winter wheat wang et al 2013 shoot δ13c in durum wheat cabrera bosquet et al 2007 and δl in apple glenn 2014 respectively when different irrigation was applied to greenhouse barley the wuey was negatively associated with δl and δg anyia et al 2007 wei et al 2016 observed a negative correlation between δl and fruit δ13c δf versus wuey in field grown tomato by adopting different irrigation methods the negative correlation between δ13c and wue has been confirmed in many studies while the correlation between δ13c and yield y is still unclear because of the effects of ambient situation growth period and sampling tissue araus et al 2003 which might be positive zhang et al 2014 wahbi and shaaban 2011 negative anyia et al 2007 bloch et al 2006 or even unrelated xu et al 2007 furthermore there are few reports on the relationship between plant tissue δ13c versus crop wue and y under deficit drip irrigation at different growth stages the different growth stages of water stress applied at may result in a greater impact on the final y and wuey than the reduction of the total irrigation amount du et al 2015 which may affect the reliability of the correlation between δ13c versus crop wue and y as china is one of the world s largest kiwifruit growers kiwifruit is widely grown and has become one of the important industries in the humid areas of south china however the lack of scientific and effective management and the uneven distribution of rainfall have led to low water use efficiency and a decline in the yield and quality of kiwifruit therefore it is particularly important to apply the stable carbon isotope technology to the production of kiwifruit and further propose a reliable way to make an irrigation schedule to support high wue based on the stable carbon isotope discrimination method this study aims to 1 study the change rule of δl and δf in kiwifruit under different irrigation treatments 2 investigate the correlation of δl δf and wue yield et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation and 3 verify the reliability and practicability of kiwifruit δ13c for evaluating wue and determine the optimal sampling time of δ13c in kiwifruit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted from march to october 2017 at the kiwifruit experimental base in pujiang county chengdu city sichuan province 30 19 n

experimental area was dominated by shallow hills where the main soil type is yellow soil with averaged soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm3 and field capacity of 30 2 2 2 experimental design seven year old kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis cv jin yan were selected as experimental trees with the height of 170 200 cm and the diameter of 8 10 cm the trees were equally spaced with a spacing of 5 0 4 5 m the growth period of kiwifruit trees was divided into four growth stages including bud burst to leafing stage stage i late march to middle april flowering to fruit set stage stage ii middle april to early may fruit expansion stage stage iii early may to late june and fruit maturation stage stage iv late june to late october thirteen treatments were designed including a full irrigation treatment ck control and four levels of water deficit treatments treated during stages ii iv the water stress levels in the deficit treatments consisted of low ld mild md2 moderate md1 and severe sd water deficit with 85 75 65 and 55 of irrigation amount compared to full irrigation treatment a plot with one tree was replicated 3 times in each treatment a drain ditch between different plots with a depth of 60 cm and a width of 20 cm was used to prevent the lateral movement of soil moisture according to the irrigation experience of local fruit growers and physiological water requirement of kiwifruit the ck treatment was irrigated when soil water content was approximately near to or lower than 65 of field capacity at stage i and 70 of field capacity at stages ii iv other treatments were as same as the irrigation date of ck treatment details of irrigation treatments at different growth stages were shown in table 1 all treatments were treated with the same fertilization cultivation and diseases and insect control etc the fertilization was implemented by fertigation the fertilizers used for kiwifruit trees were shown in table 2 the drip irrigation belts were laid down 2 8 m along both sides of the kiwifruit trees trunk each drip irrigation belt was evenly distributed with seven drip emitters whose flow rate was 1 6 l h a rainproof shed was adopted in the experiment to eliminate the effect of rainfall the groundwater depth in the experimental field was below 12 m 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 evapotranspiration the crop evapotranspiration for the trees in each treatment was calculated by following equation as 1 e t i p u r f d w 0 w f where et is crop evapotranspiration mm i is the quantity of irrigation water mm p is effective rainfall mm u is groundwater supply mm rf is surface runoff mm d is water loss of deep seepage mm w0 and wf are soil water storages at the beginning and the end of the period mm respectively the rainfall is prevented by rainproof shed so p 0 the groundwater is below 12 m so u 0 furthermore rf and d were not significant so rf 0 d 0 therefore formula 1 can be simplified as 2 e t i w 0 w f 2 3 2 gas exchange yield and water use efficiency each

determination of photosynthetic characteristics the labeled leaves were sampled each tree selected 4 healthy random fruits for samples at fruit maturation stage the samples of leaves and fruits were dried grounded and then sieved through 100 meshes the δ 13c of different organs in kiwifruit was determined by the mat 253 mass analyzer finnigan mat corp usa the δ 13c values were calculated by the

leaf and fruit δ13c was denoted as δl and δf respectively 2 4 data analysis correlation analysis multi way analysis of variance anova were analyzed using spss version 22 0 spss inc usa and the means were compared by duncan s analyses p 0 05 3 results 3 1 changes of ci ca ce wuei and wuen deficit drip irrigation significantly affected ci ca and ce at different growth stages of kiwifruit trees ci ca ranged from 0 83 to 0 93 table 3 which significantly differed among treatments at stages iii and iv ci ca generally decreased with decreasing irrigation water at each growth stage the highest ci ca was observed in ii ld ck and iv ld treatments at stages ii iv respectively different water deficits resulted in the remarkable differences in ce which ranged from 8 12 μmol m 2 s 1 11 41 μmol m 2 s 1 7 91 μmol m 2 s 1 10 84 μmol m 2 s 1 and 7 51 μmol m 2 s 1 9 39 μmol m 2 s 1 at stages ii iv respectively ce reached the maximum values of 11 41 μmol m 2 s 1 10 84 μmol m 2 s 1 and 9 39 μmol m 2 s 1 in ii md2 iii md1 and iv md1 at stages ii iv respectively water stress significantly affected wuei and wuen table 3 wuei and wuen increased firstly and then decreased with increasing water deficit at each growth stage the differences of wuei and wuen among deficit irrigation treatments at the same growth stage were significant all deficit treatments except ii sd significantly increased wuei and wuen compared with ck wuei reached the maximum values of 1 19 μmol mmol 1 1 32 μmol mmol 1 and 1 32 μmol mmol 1 in ii md2 iii md1 and iv ld and wuen reached the maximum values of 16 41 μmol mmol 1 10 16 μmol mmol 1 and 12 29 μmol mmol 1 in ii md1 iii md1 and iv md2 at stages ii iv respectively the lowest wuei and wuen were both observed under severe water deficit treatment or control treatment at each growth stage 3 2 changes of et y and wuey deficit drip irrigation decreased the et and significantly affected y and wuey table 3 compared with ck the et in different deficit irrigation treatments decreased by 0 2 5 2 4 19 13 29 and 7 29 24 39 at stages ii iv respectively there were significant variation in y and wuey among deficit irrigation treatments and they ranged from 9530 kg hm 2 to 20 169 kg hm 2 and from 2 72 kg m 3 to 4 64 kg m 3 respectively compared with ck ld treatment at stage iv significantly increased y whereas all water deficit treatments at stage iii decreased y meanwhile ld treatment at stage iv also had the largest wuey at 4 64 kg m 3 besides compared with ck sd and md2 treatments at stage iv showed larger wuey with a smaller y mainly as a result of reduced irrigation amount 3 3 changes of δ13c in leaf δl and fruit δf as shown in fig 2 δl of kiwifruit trees ranged from 22 33 to 24 09 were significantly larger than δf of kiwifruit trees ranged from 19 22 to 21 59 under deficit drip irrigation compared with ck the average δl in severe sd moderate md1 mild md2 and low ld water deficit treatments were decreased by 0 89 0 74 0 61 and 0 28 respectively and the average δf in corresponding treatments decreased by 0 38 0 43 0 90 and 1 20 respectively compared with ck the average δl of deficit irrigation treatments at stages ii iv were decreased by 0 89 0 51 and 0 49 respectively and the average δf at the corresponding stages were decreased by 0 21 0 75 and 1 22 respectively significant differences were observed in δl among different treatments at the same growth stage fig 2 δl increased with the decrease of deficit degree at the same stage except for ii sd δf significantly differed among the treatments and increased with the decrease of deficit degree at the same stage except stage ii δl and δf were also affected by the deficit stages that the averaged δl of different treatments at stages ii iv was 22 80 23 36 and 23 70 respectively whereas the averaged δf of different treatments at stages ii iv was 21 29 20 86 and 20 48 respectively 3 4 relationships between δl and δf versus ci ca ce wue et and y at different growth stages it was found that δl was correlated positively with δf and the relationship between δl and δf was significant at stages iii and iv p 0 05 or 0 01 table 4 δl had a significant positive relationship with ci ca at stages ii and iv p 0 05 furthermore the relation between δl and ce was negative at each growth stage and it reached the significant level at stage ii p 0 05 there was a significant negative relationship between δl and wuen at stages ii and iii p 0 05 but no significant relationship was found at stage iv moreover the correlations between δl and wuei δf and wuey were not significant at each growth stage in general the relationship between δl and wuen was stronger than that between δl and wuei under deficit drip irrigation significant correlation between δl and y was observed at stages iii and iv p 0 05 and δf was positively correlated with y p 0 05 at stage iii meanwhile significant positive correlations were found between δl and δf versus et at stages iii and iv p 0 05 or 0 01 3 5 correlations between δl and δf versus ci ca ce wue et and y over the whole growth period there were significant correlations between δ13c versus photosynthetic parameters wue and relevant indicators under deficit drip irrigation treatments over the whole growth period fig 3 significant positive correlation was observed between δl and ci ca under deficit drip irrigation condition r2 0 4862 p 0 01 δl was significantly and negatively correlated with ce r2 0 5527 p 0 01 δl was highly and negatively correlated with wuen r2 0 4844 p 0 01 whereas there was a weak relationship between δl versus wuei and wuey p 0 05 indicating a stronger indication effect of δl on wuen than that of δl on wuei and wuey meanwhile δl was not correlated with yield y p 0 05 while δf was significantly correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 moreover δf was significantly affected by et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 4 discussion previous studies demonstrated that deficit irrigation increases y and wuey in fruit trees and food crops du et al 2010 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 however the plants sensitivity to water stress varies at different growth stages chai et al 2015 in this study wuey was significantly improved when md2 and ld treatments were applied at stage iv while a huge reduction of wuey and y occurred at all deficit treatments at stage iii table 3 cell enlargement is sensitive to water deficit leading to a reduced production at stage iii since fruit expansion was almost completed at fruit maturation stage md2 and ld treatments at stage iv did not cause a reduction in production therefore appropriate application of water stress to kiwifruit trees is conducive to saving irrigation water and improving wuey the similar results have been reported in maize cakir 2004 and soybean eck et al 1987 the lower δ13c values were found in fruit fig 2 which is consistent with anyia et al 2007 wei et al 2016 and wahbi and shaaban 2011 de souza et al 2005 interpreted this situation as the different chemical components of different organs that lower discrimination of 13c in sugar and organic acids of fruit the fractionation of photosynthetic product during the transport process also contributes to the difference of δl and δf bloch et al 2006 furthermore previous studies have confirmed that 13co2 was released during dark respiration processes in leaves leading to lower δl tcherkez et al 2003 the growth stages affected δ13c values in general δl increased at the later growth stages under deficit drip irrigation fig 2 and this is consistent with previous studies on peer jujube cui et al 2009a b mature leaves have a more stable structure and a larger amount of chlorophyll affecting the discrimination of stable carbon isotopes the δ13c values differed in different water deficit treatments and the less water stress increased δ13c in kiwifruit trees at the same growth stage which is consistent with the previous studies on sugar beet bloch et al 2006 winter wheat wang et al 2013 and c3 grasses martensson et al 2017 in the present study water stress reduced stomatal conductance gs in kiwifruit leaves resulting in a reduction of 12co2 and an increment of absorbed 13co2 leading to decreased δl a large number of studies have reported that drought induced the root to shoot abscisic acid signaling nakashima and yamaguchi shinozaki 2013 mature leaves fell and new leaves grew resulting in a decrease in the average age of the sampled leaves and a decrease of δl farquhar et al 1989 proposed that increasing ci ca results in a positive response of δ13c cabrera bosquet et al 2007 found that higher ci ca corresponded to a larger value of δ13c for potted durum wheat grown under water deficit this study also showed a significant positive correlation between ci ca and δl p 0 01 in kiwifruit trees under deficit drip irrigation fig 3 furthermore many researches have shown that increasing carboxylation efficiency resulted in a decrease of ci ca lowering δ13c ripullone et al 2004 the significant negative relationship between carboxylation rate ce and δl p 0 01 was observed in our study higher ce as the premise of higher photosynthetic capacity and lower gs caused by water stress mainly lead to reduced ci ca which corresponds to a higher ratio of 13co2 to 12co2 and lower δ13c araus et al 2003 evaluated wue and δ13c in the grains of wheat and used δ13c to reflect responses of wheat plants to water deficit zhang et al 2015 used δ13c in maize leaves and grains to evaluate wue at different levels and adopted δ13c as an important indicator to quantify crop wue the significant relationship between δ13c and wuey reported in previous studies on potted grapes bchir et al 2016 c3 grasses martensson et al 2017 apple glenn 2014 and tomato wei et al 2016 have shown the impact of water deficit on wue in this study it was found that δl in the leaves of kiwifruit trees was significantly and negatively correlated with wuen p 0 01 under deficit drip irrigation fig 3 which is in line with those reports in tomato wei et al 2016 and grape de souza et al 2005 however there was no correlation between δl and wuei p 0 05 mainly caused by the rupture of the relationship between leaf transpiration efficiency and crop wue condon et al 1993 δl showed a higher correlation with wuen than wuei since wuen can directly express the effect of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis on ci ca in our study the insignificant correlation was found between δl and wuey as well the large contribution of deficit stages on wuey should be considered which led to a broken relationship between δ13c and wuey many researches have shown that δ13c in plant tissue is correlated with y but the correlation between δ13c and y is still controversial the results of researches on potted wheat cabrera bosquet et al 2007 and sugar beet bloch et al 2006 showed that δ13c was negatively correlated with yield whereas the positive correlation between δl and δg versus y was reported in durum wheat by wahbi and shaaban 2011 in our study δf was significantly and positively correlated with y p 0 05 while there was no correlation between δl and y during the whole growth period fig 3 the relationship between δf and y was stronger than that between δl and y because δf can continuously record the information about the transfer of photosynthetic products into fruits during fruit development bloch et al 2006 suggesting that δf was more reliable than δl in indicating y of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation in our study δf was significantly and negatively correlated with et under deficit drip irrigation p 0 01 δf was featured with a high response level to moisture changes because the continuous water stress during the fruit growth period directly affected the long term process of plant absorption and discrimination of 13co2 which influenced the specific value of 13c and 12c in fruits the similar result has been documented in pear jujube cui et al 2009a b appropriate sampling time is conducive to improve the representativeness of δ13c in evaluating wue bchir et al 2016 a significant positive correlation between ci ca and δl was only found at stages ii and iv table 4 the negative relationships between δl and wuen under water deficit condition at stages ii and iii p 0 05 are consistent with farquhar et al 1989 δl was significantly and positively correlated with δf at stage iii p 0 05 and stage iv p 0 01 mainly as a result of the long term water deficit and effective stable carbon isotope transport at stages iii and iv which is in accordance with previous research on cotton saranga et al 1999 δf was significantly associated with et and y at each stage p 0 05 or p 0 01 except stage ii because of the small proportion of fruit dry matter accumulated in stage ii to the final fruit volume leading to an indistinctive difference in δf among different treatments considering the leaf age and the complete and stable structure of the leaf we can conclude that stage iii is better for measuring the values of δ13c in leaves of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation 5 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the change rule of δl and δf in kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation investigate the correlation of δl and δf versus wue y and et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation and further propose a fast and accurate evaluation method of wue y and et in kiwifruit based on the stable carbon isotope discrimination in the humid areas of south china the results showed 1 water deficit significantly improved kiwifruit wuei wuen at different growth stages applied water stress at different growth stages has great impact on kiwifruit y and wuey compared with ck the water deficit treatments increased y and wuey by 14 75 and 23 74 when ld treatment was treated at stage iv respectively on the contrary stage iii was not suitable for the deficit treatment from the perspective of water saving and production increase 2 δl and δf of kiwifruit ranged 22 33 24 09 and 19 22 21 59 under deficit drip irrigation with averaged δl and δf of 23 29 and 20 88 respectively δl was significantly greater than δf under the same deficit treatment δl and δf decreased with water deficit at the same growth stage except for δf at stage ii δl increased at the later growth stages under deficit drip irrigation 3 kiwifruit δl was significantly correlated with δf ce wuen et and y at stage iii p 0 05 under deficit drip irrigation in addition δl was significantly and negatively correlated with wuen r2 0 4844 p 0 01 over the whole growth period δf was significantly correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 and et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 stage iii is the best time for sampling kiwifruit leaves δl can effectively indicate kiwifruit wuen under deficit drip

10539,in order to explore the application value of the stable carbon isotope discrimination method in improving water use efficiency wue and productivity of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation five water deficit levels 55 65 75 85 and 100 of full irrigation with thirteen treatments were established at three growth stages in field grown kiwifruit the leaf stable carbon isotope discrimination δl at different growth stages and fruit stable carbon isotope discrimination δf at fruit maturation stage of kiwifruit were determined the changes of wue at leaf and yield levels were analyzed and the indicating effect of carbon isotope discrimination δ13c on the wue of kiwifruit was also verified the results showed that moderate water deficit improved the wuei photosynthesis rate transpiration rate pn tr and wuen photosynthesis rate stomatal conductance pn gs of kiwifruit at each growth stage compared with full irrigation ck the yield y and wuey yield crop evapotranspiration y et of low water deficit treatment ld at fruit maturation stage increased by 14 75 and 23 74 respectively there were significant relationships between δl and δf versus wue ci ca the specific value of intercellular co2 concentration and ambient atmosphere co2 concentration ce carboxylation rate et crop evapotranspiration and y under deficit drip irrigation respectively δl was negatively correlated with wuen coefficient of determination r2 0 4844 p 0 01 over the whole growth period whereas δf was positively correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 and et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 respectively overall this study verifies that δl can be used as a useful evaluation index of wuen and δf is an important indicator of quantifying y and et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation keywords stable carbon isotope discrimination deficit drip irrigation water use efficiency kiwifruit growth stage 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater resources accounting for about 70 of the global water use rosegrant et al 2009 the shortage of water resources and effective managements and the uneven distribution of rainfall are the main factors constraining agricultural production as climate changes and the demand for agricultural water use increases water shortage will become more serious under the premise of sustainable development of regional water resources the efficient use of water resources is the primary way to solve current water shortage condition yasir et al 2013 unver et al 2017 du et al 2015 promoting scientific rational irrigation methods and techniques is significant for alleviating water shortage and achieving the sustainable development of agricultural production deficit irrigation di has been proven to be an effective water saving irrigation method to improve yield and water use efficiency under the premise of minimizing irrigation amount during the crop growth period geerts and raes 2009 plants can adapt to water deficit and the mechanisms are characterized by drought avoidance and drought tolerance yue et al 2006 crop transpiration and soil evapotranspiration are inhibited when crops are subjected to water stress and crops are trained to have an adaption against drought to enhance the ability of drought resistance and water use efficiency banik et al 2016 the distribution of assimilates from vegetative organs to reproductive organs in plant increased under water deficit and after water stress relieved compensatory effects on the growth losses caused by water stress condition occurred in crops farquhar et al 1989 abscisic acid aba is produced as a signal for soil drought to regulate stomata in crops when they are suffering water stress nakashima and yamaguchi shinozaki 2013 stomatal conductance gs reduces when the soil gets drier which causes a lower transpiration rate tr and a higher water use efficiency du et al 2015 crop water use efficiency wue can express the relationship between carbon assimilation and water consumption including instantaneous water use efficiency wuei and intrinsic water use efficiency wuen at leaf level and water use efficiency at yield level wuey jones et al 1980 medrano et al 2015 crop wue is affected by many factors such as leaf area leaf stomatal conductance root distribution and other crop physiological characteristics as well as atmospheric co2 concentration temperature precipitation illumination and other atmospheric factors many studies have shown that in the case of moderate water deficit crop yields did not necessarily and significantly reduced but wue has dramatically improved iniesta et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 water deficit significantly decreases gs and tr while photosynthesis is less affected resulting in an increase in wuei and wuen further increasing wuey in recent years the carbon isotope discrimination δ13c has been successfully employed to evaluate the wue of c3 plants when plants absorb co2 in photosynthesis the rubp carboxylase of photocatalytic carboxylation produces different catalytic reactions and discriminates 12co2 and 13co2 farquhar et al 1989 which leads to variations of 13c 12c in plant tissues and further in δ13c low specific value of intercellular co2 concentration ci to ambient atmosphere co2 concentration ca ci ca decreases the discrimination reaction of rubp leading to low δ13c easlon et al 2014 monneveux et al 2006 xu et al 2007 high photosynthetic rate low transpiration rate and low stomatal conductance often represent low ci ca as well as high wue therefore the smaller δ13c corresponds to the higher wue and hence wue can be effectively evaluated by the δ13c value a large number of experiments have been conducted to study the variation of stable carbon isotope in different tissues of crops and δ13c was used to assess wue at different levels of plants a negative relationship between leaf δ13c and wuen in c3 plants was reported farquhar et al 1989 leaf δ13c δl negatively correlated with wuei coefficient of determination r2 0 82 and wuey r2 0 77 in a collection of bush beans under three water regimes raeini sarjaz et al 1998 respectively significant negative correlations were found between wuei and grain δ13c δg in winter wheat wang et al 2013 shoot δ13c in durum wheat cabrera bosquet et al 2007 and δl in apple glenn 2014 respectively when different irrigation was applied to greenhouse barley the wuey was negatively associated with δl and δg anyia et al 2007 wei et al 2016 observed a negative correlation between δl and fruit δ13c δf versus wuey in field grown tomato by adopting different irrigation methods the negative correlation between δ13c and wue has been confirmed in many studies while the correlation between δ13c and yield y is still unclear because of the effects of ambient situation growth period and sampling tissue araus et al 2003 which might be positive zhang et al 2014 wahbi and shaaban 2011 negative anyia et al 2007 bloch et al 2006 or even unrelated xu et al 2007 furthermore there are few reports on the relationship between plant tissue δ13c versus crop wue and y under deficit drip irrigation at different growth stages the different growth stages of water stress applied at may result in a greater impact on the final y and wuey than the reduction of the total irrigation amount du et al 2015 which may affect the reliability of the correlation between δ13c versus crop wue and y as china is one of the world s largest kiwifruit growers kiwifruit is widely grown and has become one of the important industries in the humid areas of south china however the lack of scientific and effective management and the uneven distribution of rainfall have led to low water use efficiency and a decline in the yield and quality of kiwifruit therefore it is particularly important to apply the stable carbon isotope technology to the production of kiwifruit and further propose a reliable way to make an irrigation schedule to support high wue based on the stable carbon isotope discrimination method this study aims to 1 study the change rule of δl and δf in kiwifruit under different irrigation treatments 2 investigate the correlation of δl δf and wue yield et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation and 3 verify the reliability and practicability of kiwifruit δ13c for evaluating wue and determine the optimal sampling time of δ13c in kiwifruit 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiments were conducted from march to october 2017 at the kiwifruit experimental base in pujiang county chengdu city sichuan province 30 19 n 103 25 e fig 1 in the subtropical monsoon climate zone with averaged annual temperature of 16 3 rainfall of 1301 mm aridity of 0 68 sunshine duration about 1122 h and relative humidity of 84 the experimental area was dominated by shallow hills where the main soil type is yellow soil with averaged soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm3 and field capacity of 30 2 2 2 experimental design seven year old kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis cv jin yan were selected as experimental trees with the height of 170 200 cm and the diameter of 8 10 cm the trees were equally spaced with a spacing of 5 0 4 5 m the growth period of kiwifruit trees was divided into four growth stages including bud burst to leafing stage stage i late march to middle april flowering to fruit set stage stage ii middle april to early may fruit expansion stage stage iii early may to late june and fruit maturation stage stage iv late june to late october thirteen treatments were designed including a full irrigation treatment ck control and four levels of water deficit treatments treated during stages ii iv the water stress levels in the deficit treatments consisted of low ld mild md2 moderate md1 and severe sd water deficit with 85 75 65 and 55 of irrigation amount compared to full irrigation treatment a plot with one tree was replicated 3 times in each treatment a drain ditch between different plots with a depth of 60 cm and a width of 20 cm was used to prevent the lateral movement of soil moisture according to the irrigation experience of local fruit growers and physiological water requirement of kiwifruit the ck treatment was irrigated when soil water content was approximately near to or lower than 65 of field capacity at stage i and 70 of field capacity at stages ii iv other treatments were as same as the irrigation date of ck treatment details of irrigation treatments at different growth stages were shown in table 1 all treatments were treated with the same fertilization cultivation and diseases and insect control etc the fertilization was implemented by fertigation the fertilizers used for kiwifruit trees were shown in table 2 the drip irrigation belts were laid down 2 8 m along both sides of the kiwifruit trees trunk each drip irrigation belt was evenly distributed with seven drip emitters whose flow rate was 1 6 l h a rainproof shed was adopted in the experiment to eliminate the effect of rainfall the groundwater depth in the experimental field was below 12 m 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 evapotranspiration the crop evapotranspiration for the trees in each treatment was calculated by following equation as 1 e t i p u r f d w 0 w f where et is crop evapotranspiration mm i is the quantity of irrigation water mm p is effective rainfall mm u is groundwater supply mm rf is surface runoff mm d is water loss of deep seepage mm w0 and wf are soil water storages at the beginning and the end of the period mm respectively the rainfall is prevented by rainproof shed so p 0 the groundwater is below 12 m so u 0 furthermore rf and d were not significant so rf 0 d 0 therefore formula 1 can be simplified as 2 e t i w 0 w f 2 3 2 gas exchange yield and water use efficiency each

measured every two hours on cloudless sunny days during the growth stages the measurements at 8 00 10 00 12 00 14 00 16 00 and 18 00 were averaged to indicate the mean values during the day the wuei and wuen were calculated as pn tr and pn gs the yield y per tree was determined after the kiwifruits matured the wuey was determined as the ratio between y and et 2 3 3 δ 13c and δ13c after the determination of photosynthetic characteristics the labeled leaves were sampled each tree selected 4 healthy random fruits for samples at fruit maturation stage the samples of leaves and fruits were dried grounded and then sieved through 100 meshes the δ 13c of different organs in kiwifruit was determined by the mat 253 mass analyzer finnigan mat corp usa the δ 13c values were calculated by the

ca ranged from 0 83 to 0 93 table 3 which significantly differed among treatments at stages iii and iv ci ca generally decreased with decreasing irrigation water at each growth stage the highest ci ca was observed in ii ld ck and iv ld treatments at stages ii iv respectively different water deficits resulted in the remarkable differences in ce which ranged from 8 12 μmol m 2 s 1 11 41 μmol m 2 s 1

in ii md2 iii md1 and iv md1 at stages ii iv respectively water stress significantly affected wuei and wuen table 3 wuei and wuen increased firstly and then decreased with increasing water deficit at each growth stage the differences of wuei and wuen among deficit irrigation treatments at the same growth stage were significant all deficit treatments except ii sd significantly increased wuei and wuen compared with ck wuei reached the maximum values of 1 19 μmol mmol 1 1 32 μmol mmol 1 and 1 32 μmol mmol 1 in ii md2 iii md1 and iv ld and wuen reached the maximum values of 16 41 μmol mmol 1 10 16 μmol mmol 1 and 12 29 μmol mmol 1 in ii md1 iii md1 and iv md2 at stages ii iv respectively the lowest wuei and wuen were both observed under severe water deficit treatment or control treatment at each growth stage 3 2 changes of et y and wuey deficit drip irrigation decreased the et and significantly affected y and wuey table 3 compared with ck the et in different deficit irrigation treatments decreased by 0 2 5 2 4 19 13 29 and 7 29 24 39 at stages ii iv respectively there were significant variation in y and wuey among deficit irrigation treatments and they ranged from 9530 kg hm 2 to 20 169 kg hm 2 and from 2 72 kg m 3 to 4 64 kg m 3 respectively compared with ck ld treatment at stage iv significantly increased y whereas all water deficit treatments at stage iii decreased y meanwhile ld treatment at stage iv also had the largest wuey at 4 64 kg m 3 besides compared with ck sd and md2 treatments at stage iv showed larger wuey with a smaller y mainly as a result of reduced irrigation amount 3 3 changes of δ13c in leaf δl and fruit δf as shown in fig 2 δl of kiwifruit trees ranged from 22 33 to 24 09 were significantly larger than δf of kiwifruit trees ranged from 19 22 to 21 59 under deficit drip irrigation compared with ck the average δl in severe sd moderate md1 mild md2 and low ld water deficit treatments were decreased by 0 89 0 74 0 61 and 0 28 respectively and the average δf in corresponding treatments decreased by 0 38 0 43 0 90 and 1 20 respectively compared with ck the average δl of deficit irrigation treatments at stages ii iv were decreased by 0 89 0

same growth stage fig 2 δl increased with the decrease of deficit degree at the same stage except for ii sd δf significantly differed among the treatments and increased with the decrease of deficit degree at the same stage except stage ii δl and δf were also affected by the deficit stages that the averaged δl of different treatments at stages ii iv was 22 80 23 36 and 23 70 respectively whereas the averaged δf of different treatments at stages ii iv was 21 29 20 86 and 20 48 respectively 3 4 relationships between δl and δf versus ci ca ce wue et and y at different growth stages it was found that δl was correlated positively with δf and the relationship between δl and δf was significant at stages iii and iv p 0 05 or 0 01 table 4 δl had a significant positive relationship with ci ca at stages ii and iv p 0 05 furthermore the relation between δl and ce was negative at each growth stage and it reached the significant level at stage ii p 0 05 there was a significant negative relationship between δl and wuen at stages ii and iii p 0 05 but no significant relationship was found at stage iv moreover the correlations between δl and wuei δf and wuey were not significant at

correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 moreover δf was significantly affected by et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 4 discussion previous studies demonstrated that deficit irrigation increases y and wuey in fruit trees and food crops du et al 2010 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 however the plants sensitivity to water stress varies at different growth stages chai et al 2015 in this study wuey was significantly improved when md2 and ld treatments were applied at stage iv while a huge reduction of wuey and y occurred at all deficit treatments at stage iii table 3 cell enlargement is sensitive to water deficit leading to a reduced production at stage iii since fruit expansion was almost completed at fruit maturation stage md2 and ld treatments at stage iv did not cause a reduction in production therefore appropriate application of water stress to kiwifruit trees is conducive to saving irrigation water and improving wuey the similar results have been reported in maize cakir 2004 and soybean eck et al 1987 the lower δ13c values were found in fruit fig 2 which is consistent with anyia et al 2007 wei et al 2016 and wahbi and shaaban 2011 de souza et al 2005 interpreted this situation as the different chemical components of different organs that lower discrimination of 13c in sugar and organic acids of fruit the fractionation of photosynthetic product during the transport process also contributes to the difference of δl and δf bloch et al 2006 furthermore previous studies have confirmed that 13co2 was released during dark respiration processes in leaves leading to lower δl tcherkez et al 2003 the growth stages affected δ13c values in general δl increased at the later growth stages under deficit drip irrigation fig 2 and this is consistent with previous studies on peer jujube cui et al 2009a b mature leaves have a more stable structure and a larger amount of chlorophyll affecting the discrimination of stable carbon isotopes the δ13c values differed in different water deficit treatments and the less water stress increased δ13c in kiwifruit trees at the same growth stage which is consistent with the previous studies on sugar beet bloch et al 2006 winter wheat wang et al 2013 and c3 grasses martensson et al 2017 in the present study water stress reduced stomatal conductance gs in kiwifruit leaves resulting in a reduction of 12co2 and an increment of absorbed 13co2 leading to decreased δl a large number of studies have reported that drought induced the root to shoot abscisic acid signaling nakashima and yamaguchi shinozaki 2013 mature leaves fell and new leaves grew resulting in a decrease in the average age of the sampled leaves and a decrease of δl farquhar et al 1989 proposed that increasing ci ca results in a positive response of δ13c cabrera bosquet et al 2007 found that higher ci ca corresponded to a larger value of δ13c for potted durum wheat grown under water deficit this study also showed a significant positive correlation between ci ca and δl p 0 01 in kiwifruit trees under deficit drip irrigation fig 3 furthermore many researches have shown that increasing carboxylation efficiency resulted in a decrease of ci ca lowering δ13c ripullone et al 2004 the significant negative relationship between carboxylation rate ce and δl p 0 01 was observed in our study higher ce as the premise of higher photosynthetic capacity and lower gs caused by water stress mainly lead to reduced ci ca which corresponds to a higher ratio of 13co2 to 12co2 and lower δ13c araus et al 2003 evaluated wue and δ13c in the grains of wheat and used δ13c to reflect responses of wheat plants to water deficit zhang et al 2015 used δ13c in maize leaves and grains to evaluate wue at different levels and adopted δ13c as an important indicator to quantify crop wue the significant relationship between δ13c and wuey reported in previous studies on potted grapes bchir et al 2016 c3 grasses martensson et al 2017 apple glenn 2014 and tomato wei et al 2016 have shown the impact of water deficit on wue in this study it was found that δl in the leaves of kiwifruit trees was significantly and negatively correlated with wuen p 0 01 under deficit drip irrigation fig 3 which is in line with those reports in tomato wei et al 2016 and grape de souza et al 2005 however there was no correlation between δl and wuei p 0 05 mainly caused by the rupture of the relationship between leaf transpiration efficiency and crop wue condon et al 1993 δl showed a higher correlation with wuen than wuei since wuen can directly express the effect of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis on ci ca in our study the insignificant correlation was found between δl and wuey as well the large contribution of deficit stages on wuey should be considered which led to a broken relationship between δ13c and wuey many researches have shown that δ13c in plant tissue is correlated with y but the correlation between δ13c and y is still controversial the results of researches on potted wheat cabrera bosquet et al 2007 and sugar beet bloch et al 2006 showed that δ13c was negatively correlated with yield whereas the positive correlation between δl and δg versus y was reported in durum wheat by wahbi and shaaban 2011 in our study δf was significantly and positively correlated with y p 0 05 while there was no correlation between δl and y during the whole growth period fig 3 the relationship between δf and y was stronger than that between δl and y because δf can continuously record the information about the transfer of photosynthetic products into fruits during fruit development bloch et al 2006 suggesting that δf was more reliable than δl in indicating y of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation in our study δf was significantly and negatively correlated with et under deficit drip irrigation p 0 01 δf was featured with a high response level to moisture changes because the continuous water stress during the fruit growth period directly affected the long term process of plant absorption and discrimination of 13co2 which influenced the specific value of 13c and 12c in fruits the similar result has been documented in pear jujube cui et al 2009a b appropriate sampling time is conducive to improve the representativeness of δ13c in evaluating wue bchir et al 2016 a significant positive correlation between ci ca and δl was only found at stages ii and iv table 4 the negative relationships between δl and wuen under water deficit condition at stages ii and iii p 0 05 are consistent with farquhar et al 1989 δl was significantly and positively correlated with δf at stage iii p 0 05 and stage iv p 0 01 mainly as a result of the long term water deficit and effective stable carbon isotope transport at stages iii and iv which is in accordance with previous research on cotton saranga et al 1999 δf was significantly associated with et and y at each stage p 0 05 or p 0 01 except stage ii because of the small proportion of fruit dry matter accumulated in stage ii to the final fruit volume leading to an indistinctive difference in δf among different treatments considering the leaf age and the complete and stable structure of the leaf we can conclude that stage iii is better for measuring the values of δ13c in leaves of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation 5 conclusion this study aimed to investigate the change rule of δl and δf in kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation investigate the correlation of δl and δf versus wue y and et of kiwifruit under deficit drip irrigation and further propose a fast and accurate evaluation method of wue y and et in kiwifruit based on the stable carbon isotope discrimination in the humid areas of south china the results showed 1 water deficit significantly improved kiwifruit wuei wuen at different growth stages applied water stress at different growth stages has great impact on kiwifruit y and wuey compared with ck the water deficit treatments increased y and wuey by 14 75 and 23 74 when ld treatment was treated at stage iv respectively on the contrary stage iii was not suitable for the deficit treatment from the perspective of water saving and production increase 2 δl and δf of kiwifruit ranged 22 33 24 09 and 19 22 21 59 under deficit drip irrigation with averaged δl and δf of 23 29 and 20 88 respectively δl was significantly greater than δf under the same deficit treatment δl and δf decreased with water deficit at the same growth stage except for δf at stage ii δl increased at the later growth stages under deficit drip irrigation 3 kiwifruit δl was significantly correlated with δf ce wuen et and y at stage iii p 0 05 under deficit drip irrigation in addition δl was significantly and negatively correlated with wuen r2 0 4844 p 0 01 over the whole growth period δf was significantly correlated with y r2 0 2805 p 0 05 and et r2 0 9267 p 0 01 stage iii is the best time for sampling kiwifruit leaves δl can effectively indicate kiwifruit wuen under deficit drip irrigation and δf can be used as an important indicator to evaluate kiwifruit yield and crop evapotranspiration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
