1640,nitrogen n fertilizers have been extensively used to maintain soil fertility in intensively agricultural soils creating serious environmental pollution in this study a 70 day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different n fertilizers urea manure straw on n mineralization soluble organic nitrogen son dynamics and its leaching potential in typical agricultural soils of the shandong peninsula the results showed that the addition of n fertilizers affected the son pools and soil n mineralization in different ways owing to their various properties and interaction with soils when comparing treatments urea application was found to decrease son content whereas manure and straw addition increased the son content after long term incubation considering that son content depended on a complicated formation process and consumption process no direct link between son content and n mineralization capacity was observed in different treatments additionally we analyzed free amino acids faas in son and found that faa content was negatively correlated with n mineralization except for the straw treatment this suggested that faas were important substrates of n mineralization in soils in addition the composition of son was determined by 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix and ultraviolet visible absorbance spectrophotometer after long term incubation the piii v pi ii iv ratio suva254 and a253 a203 ratio decreased after fertilizer application this indicated that fertilizer addition decreased the son humification degree and increased son leaching therefore son should be taken into account when optimizing fertilization management and evaluating the risk of n leaching in groundwater systems graphical abstract unlabelled image

fertilization is widely considered as a way to improve soil quality and productivity sun et al 2015 chemical fertilizers are commonly used in intensive agricultural soils because of their high nutrient content and ease of availability however overuse of chemical fertilizers has caused a diversity of environmental problems in unsaturated and saturated zones such as low fertilizer use efficiency soil acidification and groundwater contamination ju et al 2006 watts et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 to avoid environmental risks and enhance resource utilization the application of exogenous organic amendments eoas e g animal manures straw is encouraged mohanty et al 2011 masunga et al 2016 although organic amendments can modify soil physical conditions e g bulk density soil structure the nutrient and its release are too low to satisfy crop growth in order to support sustainable nutrients the combination of organic amendments and chemical fertilizers has become the predominant approach in intensive agriculture sun et al 2015 notably adding different types of fertilizers to soils may influence nitrogen n mineralization and sequentially alter the n supply in soils azeez and van averbeke 2010 an inappropriate n supply limits vegetation growth and leads to n losses amanullah 2007 therefore a complete understanding of the effects of different fertilizers on n mineralization in agricultural soils will help us to optimize fertilization management and associated strategies soil n mineralization is the biological process of organic n on to inorganic n in which influenced by the physical chemical properties of exogenous materials e g chemical fertilizer animal manures and crop residues masunga et al 2016 some studies showed that the effects of exogenous materials on soil n mineralization were not consistent watts et al 2010 mohanty et al 2011 the exogenous material with low carbon c n ratio mineralizes surplus n conversely available n is immobilized by microorganisms with high c n ratio chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 previous soil n mineralization related research has mainly focused on the dynamics of total tn and in pools after fertilization in agricultural systems fan et al 2018 but there is little information regarding the evolution of soluble organic n son pools soluble organic n is the organic n which can be extracted by water salt solutions or electro ultra filtration euf matsumoto and ae 2004 bregliani et al 2010 as the available pools of total organic nitrogen ton son has the potential for rapid turnover and plays a key role in regulating n mineralization murphy et al 2000 christou et al 2006 although recent studies have focused on the relationship between son and n mineralization the conclusions remain controversial christou et al 2005 christou et al 2006 chen and xu 2008 murphy et al 1998 found a significant negative correlation between son and n mineralization in arable soils mengel et al 1999 confirmed the same results in forest and grassland soils conversely numerous studies have concluded that there was no direct link between son turnover and n mineralization mariano et al 2016 these opposing results regarding the relationships between son and n mineralization resulted from the complex components and intricate son sources and sinks soluble organic n is extremely complex and contains numerous nitrogenous organic constituents including free amino acids faas peptides and proteins jones and kielland 2012 ge et al 2012 the chemical composition and structure of son determine its bioavailability in n cycling xu et al 2003 some studies have shown that faa is the key component in n mineralization jones and kielland 2002 brant et al 2006 engelking et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 smolander et al 1995 indicated that only a fraction of son would be mineralized because a proportion of organic compounds was soluble yet recalcitrant to microbial decomposition furthermore son is not only the product derived from the conversion of ton but also the substrate for n mineralization perakis and hedin 2002 kessel et al 2009 liang et al 2015 and these processes determine the role of son in n cycling thus investigating the role of son in n mineralization should not only involve its quantities and qualities but also consider its cycling in soils to our knowledge limited information is available on son pools especially as affected by different fertilizers besides nutrient accumulation in soils n loss into groundwater is another concern that drives us to explore the n mineralization process it is conventionally postulated that n losses in agricultural systems are dominated by inorganic n however an increasing number of studies have claimed that leaching leads to losses of dissolved organic nitrogen don from agricultural systems and is a crucial pathway of n loss perakis and hedin 2002 vinther et al 2006 kessel et al 2009 liang et al 2015 siemens and kaupenjohann 2002 reported that seepage losses of don accounted for 6 21 of total n fluxes from agricultural lands lapworth et al 2008 pointed out that don was abundant in groundwater accounting for 47 80 of the total dissolved n large amounts of don loss leach into streams and underground water and lead to eutrophication and acidification vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu et al 2011 watanabe et al 2014 in particular don in drinking water can react with chlorine during disinfection and release toxic byproducts lee et al 2007 gu et al 2011 thus the contents and extent of don leaching from surface soils to groundwater and streams is of concern liu et al 2012 qin et al 2015 don is defined as the fraction of son which is collected in situ with no extractant used kessel et al 2009 we postulated that constituents of son in surface soils may determine the extent of don loss however to date little has been discovered about the mechanistic processes of son leaching the shandong peninsula is an intensive farmland area and the vegetation yield accounts for 50 of the total yield in china chai et al 2017 excessive n application resulted in nitrate accumulation in soils and groundwater liang et al 2015 therefore the effects of fertilization on soil n mineralization have become a vital research requirement in this region in our study a typical chemical fertilizer urea and two organic amendments manure and straw were adopted to explore the effects of different fertilizers on son pools in agricultural soils in shandong peninsula specifically the goals of the study were to 1 determine the effects of different fertilizers on soil n mineralization 2 investigate the contents and components of son involved in n cycling when different fertilizers are added to soils and 3 discuss the potential of son leaching to groundwater by component analysis in agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 soil soil samples were collected in august 2016 from a 0 20 cm depth from a field that was an intensive

reagent colorimetric method respectively jones et al 2004 total soluble nitrogen tsn was measured using the persulfate oxidation method soluble organic n son was calculated by the difference between the tsn and the mineral n sum of no3 n and nh4 n table 1 shows the physical chemical properties of the exogenous fertilizers used in this experiment 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 mineralization of soil organic n before the incubation experiment the soil was adjusted to 75 of the maximum water holding capacity by gravimetric method and pre incubated at constant temperature 25 c to recover microbial activity the incubation experiment was conducted in plastic containers upper caliber lower caliber height 74 mm 57 mm 47 mm filled with pre incubated soil equivalently 60 g of air dried soil

manure m 4 application of straw s for each sample exogenous fertilizers mixed with 60 g soil to give a field application rate in topsoil equivalent to approximately 340 kg hm2 in order to maintain the soil n supply at the same level total n added by each exogenous n material was consistent the soils were incubated in the dark at 25 1 c soil moisture content was maintained at 75 of the maximum water holding capacity by gravimetric method during the entire incubation period three replicates of each treatment were prepared for each sampling date 1 4 7 12 22 36 and 70 days after incorporation to allow for destructive sampling briefly 5 g of soil were extracted with 50 ml 0 50 m k2so4 in polypropylene tubes by shaking at 220 rev min for 1 h after shaking samples were centrifuged 15 min 4000 rpm and the supernatant recovered for further analysis 2 2 2 measurements of mineral n faa son and microbial organic nitrogen mbn the contents of the different n forms in the soils were measured in this study mineral n no3 n and nh4 n was determined using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent colorimetric method respectively total soluble nitrogen tsn was measured using the persulfate oxidation method soluble organic n son was calculated by the difference between the tsn and the mineral n sum of no3 n and nh4 n faa was determined by the spectrophotometric ninhydrin method moore 1968 microbial organic nitrogen mbn was measured using the fumigation extraction method ross 1990 to determine the composition of son a fluorescence spectrometer f 4600 hitachi japan was used to characterize the 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem the spectroscopy conditions were as follows excitation ex and emission em wavelengths 200 400 and 200 500 nm respectively at 5 nm intervals scan rate 2400 nm min ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance spectrophotometer 2800 uv vis onico australia was selected to determine son fractions using a 1 cm quartz cuvette at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 700 nm 2 3 calculations and statistical analyses the mineral n or son accumulation was best described by a zero order kinetic model n t n 0 k 0 t where t is the time in days n t is the amount of mineral n or son at time t n 0 is the initial amount of mineral n or son mg n kg and k 0 is the zero order mineral n or son accumulation rate mg n kg day all results were presented as the mean values and tested by analysis of variance anova the significant differences between pairs were determined using duncan s multiple range test p 05 and the statistical product and service solutions software spss version 20 0 was used 3 results 3 1 the effects of exogenous fertilizers on soil physical chemical properties table 2 shows soil characteristics with exogenous fertilizer addition at the beginning of experiment exogenous fertilizer application caused statistically significant shifts in soil characteristics p 05 soil ph significantly increased with exogenous fertilizers addition the ph in the control treatment was 5 94 and the values in exogenous fertilizer amended soils ranged from 6 45 to 6 69 the electrical conductivity ec also increased along with the exogenous fertilizer addition especially in the straw amended soil the ec in straw amended soil was 1 59 fold greater than in the control treatment the content of soluble organic carbon soc and ton in soils were significantly higher in treatments with exogenous fertilizers than in the control the highest soc content was 207 94 mg c kg in the straw amended soil ton contents were higher in exogenous fertilizer amended soils ranging from 653 35 to 690 32 mg n kg than in the control 565 59 mg n kg however ton content did not differ significantly between any two exogenous organic amendments 3 2 soil mineral n dynamics the mineral n dynamics varied in different treatments fig 1 in the control the mineral n content increased slightly during the first 12 days but remained relatively constant after 22 days in the urea amended soil during the entire incubation soil mineral n concentrations rapidly increased and peaked at day 12 and then remained stable generally the mineral n content in manure amended soil initially decreased during the first 7 days and increased from 7 to 50 days finally the mineral n content remained constant after 50 days however in the straw amended soil the mineral n content decreased rapidly during the first 7 days and then remained constant after 7 days the mineral n content was influenced by the n fertilizer type p 05 during the entire incubation period the ranges of mineral n were 114 41 124 73 136 65 232 59 104 78 120 62 and 0 83 99 68 mg n kg in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively during the entire incubation period the mineral n content in the urea amended soil was markedly higher than that of other treatments the mineral n content was always lower in the straw amended soil than in the control cumulative n mineralization resulted in the increase in soil mineral n content beyond the content already present before incubation cumulative n mineralization showed similar trends in all treatments after a 70 day incubation period the amount of cumulative n mineralization was 9 78 89 09 and 12 14 mg n kg in the control urea amended and manure amended soils respectively compared to the non amended soil adding urea increased the amount of cumulative n mineralization whereas manure addition had little effect on the amount of cumulative n mineralization 3 3 soil son dynamics the son contents were significantly p 05 influenced by exogenous fertilizers fig 2 the son content in control soil significantly increased from 104 42 to 128 83 mg n kg during the first 12 days but slightly decreased from 12 to 22 days then the son content remained relatively constant after 22 days fig 2 the final son was 115 66 mg n kg after the 70 day incubation period in the urea amended soil the son content notably decreased from 206 70 to 107 55 mg n kg during the entire incubation in the eoa amended soils the son contents significantly increased during the first 7 days then remarkably decreased thereafter the son content increased by 7 51 and 12 01 mg n kg at 7 days whereas the son content decreased by 5 49 and 19 08 mg n kg from 7 to 70 days in manure amended and straw amended soils respectively overall the son content was lower in urea amended than non amended soils after 7 days conversely manure and straw application increased son contents by 5 85 and 2 40 mg n kg compared with the control after 70 days following the order of manure amended straw amended soils 3 4 soil faa dynamics the faa content initially increased for a short time and then decreased with increasing incubation days except in the urea amended soil fig 3 the maximum faa content was 31 57 59 01 37 94 and 85 60 mg n kg in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively after the 70 day incubation period the faa content decreased to 7 96 20 83 23 52 and 37 66 mg n kg in the above treatments respectively at the end of incubation compared with that of the control the faa content increased in all fertilizer amended treatments on average the proportion of faa to son ranged from 17 39 to 44 26 in all treatments during the entire incubation period the proportion of faa to son was higher after fertilizer addition than that of the control at the end of incubation period the proportion of faa to son decreased to 6 88 19 37 19 35 and 31 87 in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively 3 5 soil mbn dynamics during all incubation treatments we found that the mbn content increased during first 7 days and decreased thereafter fig 4 the maximum values of mbn in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended treatments were 125 10 167 34 218 67 176 73 mg n kg respectively at the end of incubation period the mbn content in the above treatments decreased to 18 79 19 11 19 05 and 51 43 mg n kg respectively pairwise comparisons among treatment revealed a significant difference for mbn content between all the treatments during the entire incubation the mbn content in the soils with exogenous fertilizer addition was significantly higher than that the control treatment in particular in straw amended soils the mbn content was always higher than the non amended soil 3 6 composition of son investigated by 3d eem and uv vis absorbance spectroscopy the 3d eem spectrum of son in soils is shown in fig 5 based on fluorescence peak characteristics the 3d eem spectra were divided into five regions generally peaks of regions i and ii occurred at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm peaks of region iii appeared at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm peaks of region iv exhibited shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm in addition peaks of region v emerged at longer emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm the 3d eem spectrum of son in soils exhibited fluorescence peak characteristics namely protein like compounds regions i and ii fulvic acid like substances region iii soluble microbial byproduct materials region iv and humic like substances region v wang et al 2015 our results showed that peaks of 3d eem spectrum were located at region ii in all treatments after long term incubation table 3 shows the percent distribution of volumetric fluorescence among the five regions i e p i for son at the end of incubation pi ii accounted for 47 65 58 18 of the total in all treatments compared with different treatments piii v pi ii iv ratios were lower in fertilizer amended soils than in the control the lowest ratio was in urea amended soil in this study we also monitored the suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios table 3 the suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios ranged from 0 10 to 0 45 and 0 03 to 0 22 respectively the values and ratios displayed a declining trend in fertilizer amended soils comparisons between different fertilizers revealed that the values and ratios were lower for urea amendment than organic amendment 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of adding different fertilizers on soil n mineralization in this study soil n mineralization differed among all treatments with the highest amount of n mineralization in the urea amended soil and the lowest amount of n mineralization in the straw amended soil the extent of soil n mineralization depended on the physical chemical properties of exogenous fertilizers e g n content content of labile c c n ratio kieloaho et al 2016 in particular the effect of the c n ratio of exogenous fertilizers on soil n mineralization is complicated chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 the c n ratio of exogenous fertilizers will influence soil microbial growth when added to soils adding organic amendments with a higher c n ratio c n ratio 30 leads to the shortage of n in soils and available n is immobilized by microorganisms in contrast adding organic amendments with a lower c n ratio c n 20 causes soil n surpluses and sufficient n mineralizes chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 in the present study the extremely low c n ratio c n 20 in urea amended soil facilitated soil n mineralization whereas the higher c n ratio c n ratio 30 after straw application accounted for greater n immobilization than n mineralization in addition we analyzed faa and son to determine their roles in n mineralization table 4 shows the relationships between both faa and son with cumulative n mineralization in our findings there were significant differences between the relationships between faa or son and cumulative n mineralization in different treatments our results illustrated that faa was negatively related to cumulative n mineralization r 0 77 p 01 r 0 63 p 05 r 0 42 p 05 in the control urea amended and manure amended treatments respectively suggesting that amino acid n was the important substrate for n mineralization to our knowledge amino acid n compounds are the important substrates of n mineralization in soils because they can be utilized by microorganisms jones and kielland 2002 mariano et al 2016 however faa had no significant relationship with cumulative n mineralization in the straw amended soil this might be because numerous faas were not available for microbial decomposition in the straw amended soil smolander et al 1995 in addition the relationship of son and cumulative n mineralization varied because of the complicated components of son a strongly negative linear relationship between son and cumulative n mineralization was observed r 0 98 p 01 in the urea amended soil this may be because the rapid decomposition of urea when it was incorporated into soils however in other treatments son exhibited both positive and negative relationships with cumulative n mineralization no significant relationship between son and n mineralization was detected except in urea amended soil this might have been caused by the complicated components and conversion of son to unveil the governing mechanism for distinct soil n mineralization behaviors with the addition of different fertilizers we investigated soil microorganisms which play the dominant role in soil n mineralization during the entire incubation experiment we found that the growth of microbes increased during the first 7 days and decreased thereafter in all treatments fig 4 comparing between different treatments we found that addition of exogenous fertilizers markedly stimulated the growth of microorganisms especially in straw amended soil this could be explained by the improvement in soil conditions and the input of labile c in soils cookson et al 2005 hoyle et al 2008 generally soil microorganisms were stimulated by improvement of their environment e g ph nutrient content with the addition of exogenous fertilizers in particular soc in exogenous fertilizers can be utilized as a c source by soil microorganisms resulting in enhancement of microbial growth shand et al 2002 our findings indicated that exogenous fertilizer application caused a statistically significant increase in soc content p 05 with the highest level in straw amended soil table 2 these results implied that soil n mineralization was stimulated by a rapid increase in microbes with fertilizer addition our results were consistent with previous reports michel et al 2006 kemmitt et al 2006 4 2 son dynamics in soils in our research no direct link between son turnover and n mineralization was established except in urea amended soils it resulted from the complicated components of son including amino acid n amino sugar nucleotides etc greenfield 2001 friedel and scheller 2002 only a fraction of son can mineralize moreover as median products son is consumed as substrates for n mineralization although it originates from the transformation of complex organic n thus to completely understand the role of son pools involved in n cycling a hypothetical model for the son cycling in agricultural ecosystems was proposed fig 6 son measured in our study can include two parts 1 dissolved organic n don in the soil solution and 2 soluble organic n that was adsorbed aon in soils but could be acquired by specific solutions e g kcl cacl2 k2so4 compared to aon don is more easily to be mineralized in our study the potential sources of son as shown in fig 6 include 1 depolymerization and decomposition of complex organic n compounds e g high molecular weight hmw and 2 microbial debris and metabolites the fates of son include 1 decomposition into inorganic n 2 humification into recalcitrant organic n compounds and 3 microbial cell uptake if the inorganic n in soils is insufficient jones et al 2004 because no3 is rich in soils there may be little reason for microorganisms to take up low molecular weight lmw don jones et al 2004 in this study no3 was rich in soils thus the microbial cell uptake of son was eliminated in our study we analyzed the sources and fates of son to assess its role in n cycling in agricultural ecosystems 4 2 1 son dynamics in a typical agricultural soil in the control treatment we observed that son increased with inorganic n accumulation during the first 12 days the rate of son increase was 2 22 mg n kg d and the rate of mineral n accumulation was 0 94 mg n kg d during the first 12 days the rate of son increase was 2 36 fold greater than the rate of mineral n accumulation it confirmed that the process of depolymerization and decomposition of complex organic n compounds was enhanced because of rapid microbial growth during the first 12 days of incubation after 12 days the rates of son increase and mineral n accumulation decreased to very low levels 4 2 2 son dynamics after adding the chemical fertilizer addition of exogenous fertilizers to soils stimulated soil microbial activity by improving soil conditions e g soil ph nutrient retention and affected the rates of son production and mineral n accumulation in the urea amended treatment cumulative n mineralization was significantly negatively correlated with son content r 0 98 p 01 table 4 urea was considered lmw don to be amended to soils berman and bronk 2003 wang et al 2008 because of its chemical structure an amide can be transformed into mineral n which can be utilized directly by microorganisms therefore son containing a large number of amides was depleted and it became the major substrate for n mineralization the results showed that the contents of son in urea amended soils was lower than in the control soils after 7 days implying that urea application stimulated rapid microbial growth and further accelerated native son mineralization in soils after 70 days of incubation the rates of son increase and mineral n accumulation decreased to very low levels this can be explained by the minimization of microbial biomass and activity with decomposition and depletion of the labile c 4 2 3 son dynamics with eoa in the present study manure and straw addition increased the content of son in soils during the entire incubation this finding was confirmed by previous studies embacher et al 2008 ros et al 2009 liang et al 2015 in our study the content of son in manure and straw were 9591 85 and 1526 31 mg kg respectively if all the son in eoa was released into the soil the theoretical maximum content of son in the soil was equal to 108 74 and 105 80 mg kg at the total n application rate 120 mg kg for manure and straw respectively the experimental maximum content of son in the soils with manure and straw amendment was 129 39 and 137 24 mg kg respectively the experimental values were significantly higher than the theoretical this indicated that son increased when eoa were added to soils the sources of increased son may include 1 the increased decomposition of complex organic n compounds by high microbial biomass and activity and 2 microbial debris and metabolites our data provided supporting evidence for these two sources firstly our data showed that the contents of mbn with eoa addition were higher than with chemical fertilizer addition during the entire incubation fig 4 in particular the maximum mbn content was 1 31 and 1 06 fold higher in manure amended and straw amended soils respectively than in urea amended soil at day 7 our results demonstrated that manure and straw addition accelerated the process of complex organic n to son by rapid growth of microorganisms this process has been considered the dominant pathway for n supply in agricultural soils hadas et al 1992 schimel and bennett 2004 secondly our results showed that mineral n decreased during the entire incubation period in straw amend soils and at an earlier stage in manure amended soils indicating that mineral n immobilization in soils with a high c n ratio occurred in eoa amended soils fig 1 meanwhile it was also found that the content of mbn and son in eoa amended soils increased with decreasing mineral n and were higher than in other treatments after long incubation periods which suggested that the application of eoa could promote the immobilization of excessive nitrates by stimulating microbial growth qiu et al 2013 the immobilized n in live or dead microbial cells entered son pools and thus became another key source for the increased son pools qiu et al 2016 thus if excessive eoa are added to soils it will increase the son pools and may promote its leaching potential murphy et al 2000 carswell et al 2016 to further analyze the distinct effects of different eoa amendments the results in both treatments manure and straw were compared unlike in the straw amended treatment the c n ratio decreased with the depletion of labile c at a later period and mineral n accumulated in manure amended soil this suggested that in manure amended soil nitrification was the dominant process at the end of incubation after 70 day incubation period the content of son in manure amended soil was higher than that of straw amended soil in this work manure contained much more soluble forms of n than straw furthermore soil n immobilization was stronger than n mineralization over time in straw amended soil little of the immobilized n would later be mineralized xu et al 2003 thus decomposition of complex organic n compounds was easier in manure amended soil than in straw amended soil in the later period contributing to the higher son content in manure amended soil 4 3 the potential of son leaching to groundwater from soils son is a dynamic participant in agriculture ecosystems and its compositional characteristics can influence its bioavailability and mobility pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2006 in this study the 3d eem spatial characteristics of son and its fractions displayed some differences because of the complexity of their structural composition in different treatments son was mainly comprised of protein like substances and fulvic like materials by the end of incubation fig 5 the protein like substances are usually eliminated by biodegradation although fulvic like and humic like materials are not easily utilized by microbes the piii v pi ii iv ratio was regarded as the humification index a higher humification index suggests that son contains more complex and stable organic n forms by the end of incubation piii v pi ii iv ranged from 0 41 to 0 62 table 3 compared to the control exogenous fertilizer addition resulted in lower ratios this indicated a lower proportion of humic material with exogenous fertilizer application suva254 values have been widely used as an index to estimate the aromatic content of dissolved organic matter dom li et al 2014 values 3 indicate that organic matter contains a specific hydrophilic substance a253 a203 ratios are usually used to reflect the concentration of substitution groups li et al 2014 the higher ratios indicate that substitution groups in aromatic rings contain more carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and ester groups conversely lower a253 a203 values indicate that substitution groups contain more aliphatic chains wang et al 2015 our study showed that suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios ranged from 0 10 to 0 45 and 0 03 to 0 22 respectively table 3 this indicated that son was mainly comprised of hydrophilic substances and substitution groups of aromatic rings with more aliphatic chains the hydrophilic son could be easily leached because of its low molecular weight kušlienė et al 2015 to evaluate the potential of son leaching both its properties and total content should be taken into consideration on the one hand compared with organic amendments the extent of humification with chemical fertilizer addition was lower table 3 indicating that substantial son leaching would be triggered if extensive chemical fertilizers were added to soils under specific hydrological conditions e g heavy rainfall excessive irrigation barton et al 2006 on the other hand in terms of son contents chemical fertilizer addition decreased son content whereas eoa addition increased son content the application of eoa resulted in much more son accumulated in soils hence eoa addition also contributed to a high potential of son leaching finally our study indicated that son leaching in intensive agricultural soils should not be ignored when evaluating the risk of n leaching 4 4 the implications of fertilization management in agricultural soils in our research two fertilization strategies chemical fertilizer alone and organic amendment alone were investigated in terms of the nutrient efficiency and leaching risks for chemical fertilizer it was found that the addition of chemical fertilizer alone increased the contents of mineral n in soils after 70 day incubation the increased mineral n in soils could be utilized by plants however when the increased mineral n following excessive chemical fertilizer addition exceeded plants requirements the extra mineral n would accumulate in soils and leach into deeper profiles under irrigation for organic amendment the application of organic amendments alone resulted to mineral n immobilization by microorganisms due to a high c n ratio in soils thus the organic amendments as slow releasing mineral n source fail to guarantee enough mineral n for plants growth particularly for some key growth stages moreover the contents of son increased after long time incubation and the increased son was mainly comprised of hydrophilic substances and substitution groups of aromatic rings with more aliphatic chains accordingly son leaching potential was enhanced considering the advantages and disadvantages of above two fertilization strategies we suggested the combination of chemical and organic fertilizers should be considered in agricultural practice and son should not be ignored when evaluating the risk of n leaching in future studies the mechanisms of how plants compete for son and how their presences affect the n cycling or release of n in the field need to be further addressed 5 conclusion various properties of fertilizers and their distinct interactions with soil made them influence soil n in different ways chemical fertilizer addition increased cumulative n mineralization whereas organic amendments with higher c n ratio stimulated soil n immobilization with enhanced mbn in the soil no direct link between son contents and n mineralization capacity was observed in different treatments because of the intricate components and conversion processes of son the chemical fertilizer addition decreased the content of son and organic amendment application increased the content of son in addition the increased son in eoa amended soils containing large amounts of hydrophilic substances contributed to a high potential for son

1640,nitrogen n fertilizers have been extensively used to maintain soil fertility in intensively agricultural soils creating serious environmental pollution in this study a 70 day incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different n fertilizers urea manure straw on n mineralization soluble organic nitrogen son dynamics and its leaching potential in typical agricultural soils of the shandong peninsula the results showed that the addition of n fertilizers affected the son pools and soil n mineralization in different ways owing to their various properties and interaction with soils when comparing treatments urea application was found to decrease son content whereas manure and straw addition increased the son content after long term incubation considering that son content depended on a complicated formation process and consumption process no direct link between son content and n mineralization capacity was observed in different treatments additionally we analyzed free amino acids faas in son and found that faa content was negatively correlated with n mineralization except for the straw treatment this suggested that faas were important substrates of n mineralization in soils in addition the composition of son was determined by 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix and ultraviolet visible absorbance spectrophotometer after long term incubation the piii v pi ii iv ratio suva254 and a253 a203 ratio decreased after fertilizer application this indicated that fertilizer addition decreased the son humification degree and increased son leaching therefore son should be taken into account when optimizing fertilization management and evaluating the risk of n leaching in groundwater systems graphical abstract unlabelled image

fertilization is widely considered as a way to improve soil quality and productivity sun et al 2015 chemical fertilizers are commonly used in intensive agricultural soils because of their high nutrient content and ease of availability however overuse of chemical fertilizers has caused a diversity of environmental problems in unsaturated and saturated zones such as low fertilizer use efficiency soil acidification and groundwater contamination ju et al 2006 watts et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 to avoid environmental risks and enhance resource utilization the application of exogenous organic amendments eoas e g animal manures straw is encouraged mohanty et al 2011 masunga et al 2016 although organic amendments can modify soil physical conditions e g bulk density soil structure the nutrient and its release are too low to satisfy crop growth in order to support sustainable nutrients the combination of organic amendments and chemical fertilizers has become the predominant approach in intensive agriculture sun et al 2015 notably adding different types of fertilizers to soils may influence nitrogen n mineralization and sequentially alter the n supply in soils azeez and van averbeke 2010 an inappropriate n supply limits vegetation growth and leads to n losses amanullah 2007 therefore a complete understanding of the effects of different fertilizers on n mineralization in agricultural soils will help us to optimize fertilization management and associated strategies soil n mineralization is the biological process of organic n on to inorganic n in which influenced by the physical chemical properties of exogenous materials e g chemical fertilizer animal manures and crop residues masunga et al 2016 some studies showed that the effects of exogenous materials on soil n mineralization were not consistent watts et al 2010 mohanty et al 2011 the exogenous material with low carbon c n ratio mineralizes surplus n conversely available n is immobilized by microorganisms with high c n ratio chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 previous soil n mineralization related research has mainly focused on the dynamics of total tn and in pools after fertilization in agricultural systems fan et al 2018 but there is little information regarding the evolution of soluble organic n son pools soluble organic n is the organic n which can be extracted by water salt solutions or electro ultra filtration euf matsumoto and ae 2004 bregliani et al 2010 as the available pools of total organic nitrogen ton son has the potential for rapid turnover and plays a key role in regulating n mineralization murphy et al 2000 christou et al 2006 although recent studies have focused on the relationship between son and n mineralization the conclusions remain controversial christou et al 2005 christou et al 2006 chen and xu 2008 murphy et al 1998 found a significant negative correlation between son and n mineralization in arable soils mengel et al 1999 confirmed the same results in forest and grassland soils conversely numerous studies have concluded that there was no direct link between son turnover and n mineralization mariano et al 2016 these opposing results regarding the relationships between son and n mineralization resulted from the complex components and intricate son sources and sinks soluble organic n is extremely complex and contains numerous nitrogenous organic constituents including free amino acids faas peptides and proteins jones and kielland 2012 ge et al 2012 the chemical composition and structure of son determine its bioavailability in n cycling xu et al 2003 some studies have shown that faa is the key component in n mineralization jones and kielland 2002 brant et al 2006 engelking et al 2007 roberts et al 2007 smolander et al 1995 indicated that only a fraction of son would be mineralized because a proportion of organic compounds was soluble yet recalcitrant to microbial decomposition furthermore son is not only the product derived from the conversion of ton but also the substrate for n mineralization perakis and hedin 2002 kessel et al 2009 liang et al 2015 and these processes determine the role of son in n cycling thus investigating the role of son in n mineralization should not only involve its quantities and qualities but also consider its cycling in soils to our knowledge limited information is available on son pools especially as affected by different fertilizers besides nutrient accumulation in soils n loss into groundwater is another concern that drives us to explore the n mineralization process it is conventionally postulated that n losses in agricultural systems are dominated by inorganic n however an increasing number of studies have claimed that leaching leads to losses of dissolved organic nitrogen don from agricultural systems and is a crucial pathway of n loss perakis and hedin 2002 vinther et al 2006 kessel et al 2009 liang et al 2015 siemens and kaupenjohann 2002 reported that seepage losses of don accounted for 6 21 of total n fluxes from agricultural lands lapworth et al 2008 pointed out that don was abundant in groundwater accounting for 47 80 of the total dissolved n large amounts of don loss leach into streams and underground water and lead to eutrophication and acidification vandenbruwane et al 2007 xu et al 2011 watanabe et al 2014 in particular don in drinking water can react with chlorine during disinfection and release toxic byproducts lee et al 2007 gu et al 2011 thus the contents and extent of don leaching from surface soils to groundwater and streams is of concern liu et al 2012 qin et al 2015 don is defined as the fraction of son which is collected in situ with no extractant used kessel et al 2009 we postulated that constituents of son in surface soils may determine the extent of don loss however to date little has been discovered about the mechanistic processes of son leaching the shandong peninsula is an intensive farmland area and the vegetation yield accounts for 50 of the total yield in china chai et al 2017 excessive n application resulted in nitrate accumulation in soils and groundwater liang et al 2015 therefore the effects of fertilization on soil n mineralization have become a vital research requirement in this region in our study a typical chemical fertilizer urea and two organic amendments manure and straw were adopted to explore the effects of different fertilizers on son pools in agricultural soils in shandong peninsula specifically the goals of the study were to 1 determine the effects of different fertilizers on soil n mineralization 2 investigate the contents and components of son involved in n cycling when different fertilizers are added to soils and 3 discuss the potential of son leaching to groundwater by component analysis in agricultural systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 soil soil samples were collected in august 2016 from a 0 20 cm depth from a field that was an intensive

fertilizers in an incubation experiment the eoa manure and straw was chopped into small pieces using a grinder and passed a 2 mm sieve total c tc total n tn and organic n ton were measured by an elemental analyzer flash 2000 thermo america moreover these fertilizers were extracted with 0 50 m k2so4 1 10 w v in polypropylene tubes on a reciprocating shaker is rdd3 crystal america at 220 rev

reagent colorimetric method respectively jones et al 2004 total soluble nitrogen tsn was measured using the persulfate oxidation method soluble organic n son was calculated by the difference between the tsn and the mineral n sum of no3 n and nh4 n table 1 shows the physical chemical properties of the exogenous fertilizers used in this experiment 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 mineralization of soil organic n before the incubation experiment the soil was adjusted to 75 of the maximum water holding capacity by gravimetric method and pre incubated at constant temperature 25 c to recover microbial activity the incubation experiment was conducted in plastic containers upper caliber lower caliber height 74 mm 57 mm 47 mm filled with pre incubated soil equivalently 60 g of air dried soil there were three types of n supplies one chemical fertilizer urea and two eoas manure and straw the treatments were 1 control ck no application 2 application of chemical fertilizer u 3 application of manure m 4 application of straw s for each sample exogenous fertilizers mixed with 60 g soil to give a field application rate in topsoil equivalent to approximately 340 kg hm2 in order to maintain the soil n supply at the same level total n added by each exogenous n material was consistent the soils were incubated in the dark at 25 1 c soil moisture content was maintained at 75 of the maximum water holding capacity by gravimetric method during the entire incubation period three replicates of each treatment were prepared for each sampling date 1 4 7 12 22 36 and 70 days after incorporation to allow for destructive sampling briefly 5 g of soil were extracted with 50 ml 0 50 m k2so4 in polypropylene tubes by shaking at 220 rev min for 1 h after shaking samples were centrifuged 15 min 4000 rpm and the supernatant recovered for further analysis 2 2 2 measurements of mineral n faa son and microbial organic nitrogen mbn the contents of the different n forms in the soils were measured in this study mineral n no3 n and nh4 n was determined using the ultraviolet spectrophotometric method and nessler s reagent colorimetric method respectively total soluble nitrogen tsn was measured using the persulfate oxidation method soluble organic n son was calculated by the difference between the tsn and the mineral n sum of no3 n and nh4 n faa was determined by the spectrophotometric ninhydrin method moore 1968 microbial organic nitrogen mbn was measured using the fumigation extraction method ross 1990 to determine the composition of son a fluorescence spectrometer f 4600 hitachi japan was used to characterize the 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem the spectroscopy conditions were as follows excitation ex and emission em wavelengths 200 400 and 200 500 nm respectively at 5 nm intervals scan rate 2400 nm min ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance spectrophotometer 2800 uv vis onico australia was selected to determine son fractions using a 1 cm quartz cuvette at wavelengths ranging from 200 to 700 nm 2 3 calculations and statistical analyses the mineral n or son accumulation was best described by a zero order kinetic model n t n 0 k 0 t where t is the time in days n t is the amount of mineral n or son at time t n 0 is the initial amount of mineral n or son mg n kg and k 0 is the zero order mineral n or son accumulation rate mg n kg day all results were presented as the mean values and tested by analysis of variance anova the significant differences between pairs were determined using duncan s multiple range test p 05 and the statistical product and service solutions software spss version 20 0 was used 3 results 3 1 the effects of exogenous fertilizers on soil physical chemical properties table 2 shows soil characteristics with exogenous fertilizer addition at the beginning of experiment exogenous fertilizer application caused statistically significant shifts in soil characteristics p 05 soil ph significantly increased with exogenous fertilizers addition the ph in the control treatment was 5 94 and the values in exogenous fertilizer amended soils ranged from 6 45 to 6 69 the electrical conductivity ec also increased along with the exogenous fertilizer addition especially in the straw amended soil the ec in straw amended soil was 1 59 fold greater than in the control treatment the content of soluble organic carbon soc and ton in soils were significantly higher in treatments with exogenous fertilizers than in the control the highest soc content was 207 94 mg c kg in the straw amended soil ton contents were higher in exogenous fertilizer amended soils ranging from 653 35 to 690 32 mg n kg than in the control 565 59 mg n kg however ton content did not differ significantly between any two exogenous organic amendments 3 2 soil mineral n dynamics the mineral n dynamics varied in different treatments fig 1 in the control the mineral n content increased slightly during the first 12 days but remained relatively constant after 22 days in the urea amended soil during the entire incubation soil mineral n concentrations rapidly increased and peaked at day 12 and then remained stable generally the mineral n content in manure amended soil initially decreased during the first 7 days and increased from 7 to 50 days finally the mineral n content remained constant after 50 days however in the straw amended soil the mineral n content decreased rapidly during the first 7 days and then remained constant after 7 days the mineral n content was influenced by the n fertilizer type p 05 during the entire incubation period the ranges of mineral n were 114 41 124 73 136 65 232 59 104 78 120 62 and 0 83 99 68 mg n kg in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively during the entire incubation period the mineral n content in the urea amended soil was markedly higher than that of other treatments the mineral n content was always lower in the straw amended soil than in the control cumulative n mineralization resulted in the increase in soil mineral n content beyond the content already present before incubation cumulative n mineralization showed similar trends in all treatments after a 70 day incubation period the amount of cumulative n mineralization was 9 78 89 09 and 12 14 mg n kg in the control urea amended and manure amended soils respectively compared to the non amended soil adding urea increased the amount of cumulative n mineralization whereas manure addition had little effect on the amount of cumulative n mineralization 3 3 soil son dynamics the son contents were significantly p 05 influenced by exogenous fertilizers fig 2 the son content in control soil significantly increased from 104 42 to 128 83 mg n kg during the first 12 days but slightly decreased from 12 to 22 days then the son content remained relatively constant after 22 days fig 2 the final son was 115 66 mg n kg after the 70 day incubation period in the urea amended soil the son content notably decreased from 206 70 to 107 55 mg n kg during the entire incubation in the eoa amended soils the son contents significantly increased during the first 7 days then remarkably decreased thereafter the son content increased by 7 51 and 12 01 mg n kg at 7 days whereas the son content decreased by 5 49 and 19 08 mg n kg from 7 to 70 days in manure amended and straw amended soils respectively overall the son content was lower in urea amended than non amended soils after 7 days conversely manure and straw application increased son contents by 5 85 and 2 40 mg n kg compared with the control after 70 days following the order of manure amended straw amended soils 3 4 soil faa dynamics the faa content initially increased for a short time and then decreased with increasing incubation days except in the urea amended soil fig 3 the maximum faa content was 31 57 59 01 37 94 and 85 60 mg n kg in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively after the 70 day incubation period the faa content decreased to 7 96 20 83 23 52 and 37 66 mg n kg in the above treatments respectively at the end of incubation compared with that of the control the faa content increased in all fertilizer amended treatments on average the proportion of faa to son ranged from 17 39 to 44 26 in all treatments during the entire incubation period the proportion of faa to son was higher after fertilizer addition than that of the control at the end of incubation period the proportion of faa to son decreased to 6 88 19 37 19 35 and 31 87 in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended soils respectively 3 5 soil mbn dynamics during all incubation treatments we found that the mbn content increased during first 7 days and decreased thereafter fig 4 the maximum values of mbn in the control urea amended manure amended and straw amended treatments were 125 10 167 34 218 67 176 73 mg n kg respectively at the end of incubation period the mbn content in the above treatments decreased to 18 79 19 11 19 05 and 51 43 mg n kg respectively pairwise comparisons among treatment revealed a significant difference for mbn content between all the treatments during the entire incubation the mbn content in the soils with exogenous fertilizer addition was significantly higher than that the control treatment in particular in straw amended soils the mbn content was always higher than the non amended soil 3 6 composition of son investigated by 3d eem and uv vis absorbance spectroscopy the 3d eem spectrum of son in soils is shown in fig 5 based on fluorescence peak characteristics the 3d eem spectra were divided into five regions generally peaks of regions i and ii occurred at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm peaks of region iii appeared at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm peaks of region iv exhibited shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm in addition peaks of region v emerged at longer emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm the 3d eem spectrum of son in soils exhibited fluorescence peak characteristics namely protein like compounds regions i and ii fulvic acid like substances region iii soluble microbial byproduct materials region iv and humic like substances region v wang et al 2015 our results showed that peaks of 3d eem spectrum were located at region ii in all treatments after long term incubation table 3 shows the percent distribution of volumetric fluorescence among the five regions i e p i for son at the end of incubation pi ii accounted for 47 65 58 18 of the total in all treatments compared with different treatments piii v pi ii iv ratios were lower in fertilizer amended soils than in the control the lowest ratio was in urea amended soil in this study we also monitored the suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios table 3 the suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios ranged from 0 10 to 0 45 and 0 03 to 0 22 respectively the values and ratios displayed a declining trend in fertilizer amended soils comparisons between different fertilizers revealed that the values and ratios were lower for urea amendment than organic amendment 4 discussion 4 1 the effects of adding different fertilizers on soil n mineralization in this study soil n mineralization differed among all treatments with the highest amount of n mineralization in the urea amended soil and the lowest amount of n mineralization in the straw amended soil the extent of soil n mineralization depended on the physical chemical properties of exogenous fertilizers e g n content content of labile c c n ratio kieloaho et al 2016 in particular the effect of the c n ratio of exogenous fertilizers on soil n mineralization is complicated chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 the c n ratio of exogenous fertilizers will influence soil microbial growth when added to soils adding organic amendments with a higher c n ratio c n ratio 30 leads to the shortage of n in soils and available n is immobilized by microorganisms in contrast adding organic amendments with a lower c n ratio c n 20 causes soil n surpluses and sufficient n mineralizes chaves et al 2008 miller et al 2008 in the present study the extremely low c n ratio c n 20 in urea amended soil facilitated soil n mineralization whereas the higher c n ratio c n ratio 30 after straw application accounted for greater n immobilization than n mineralization in addition we analyzed faa and son to determine their roles in n mineralization table 4 shows the relationships between both faa and son with cumulative n mineralization in our findings there were significant differences between the relationships between faa or son and cumulative n mineralization in different treatments our results illustrated that faa was negatively related to cumulative n mineralization r 0 77 p 01 r 0 63 p 05 r 0 42 p 05 in the control urea amended and manure amended treatments respectively suggesting that amino acid n was the important substrate for n mineralization to our knowledge amino acid n compounds are the important substrates of n mineralization in soils because they can be utilized by microorganisms jones and kielland 2002 mariano et al 2016 however faa had no significant relationship with cumulative n mineralization in the straw amended soil this might be because numerous faas were not available for microbial decomposition in the straw amended soil smolander et al 1995 in addition the relationship of son and cumulative n mineralization varied because of the complicated components of son a strongly negative linear relationship between son and cumulative n mineralization was observed r 0 98 p 01 in the urea amended soil this may be because the rapid decomposition of urea when it was incorporated into soils however in other treatments son exhibited both positive and negative relationships with cumulative n mineralization no significant relationship between son and n mineralization was detected except in urea amended soil this might have been caused by the complicated components and conversion of son to unveil the governing mechanism for distinct soil n mineralization behaviors with the addition of different fertilizers we investigated soil microorganisms which play the dominant role in soil n mineralization during the entire incubation experiment we found that the growth of microbes increased during the first 7 days and decreased thereafter in all treatments fig 4 comparing between different treatments we found that addition of exogenous fertilizers markedly stimulated the growth of microorganisms especially in straw amended soil this could be explained by the improvement in soil conditions and the input of labile c in soils cookson et al 2005 hoyle et al 2008 generally soil microorganisms were stimulated by improvement of their environment e g ph nutrient content with the addition of exogenous fertilizers in particular soc in exogenous fertilizers can be utilized as a c source by soil microorganisms resulting in enhancement of microbial growth shand et al 2002 our findings indicated that exogenous fertilizer application caused a statistically significant increase in soc content p 05 with the highest level in straw amended soil table 2 these results implied that soil n mineralization was stimulated by a rapid increase in microbes with fertilizer addition our results were consistent with previous reports michel et al 2006 kemmitt et al 2006 4 2 son dynamics in soils in our research no direct link between son turnover and n mineralization was established except in urea amended soils it resulted from the complicated components of son including amino acid n amino sugar nucleotides etc greenfield 2001 friedel and scheller 2002 only a fraction of son can mineralize moreover as median products son is consumed as substrates for n mineralization although it originates from the transformation of complex organic n thus to completely understand the role of son pools involved in n cycling a hypothetical model for the son cycling in agricultural ecosystems was proposed fig 6 son measured in our study can include two parts 1 dissolved organic n don in the soil solution and 2 soluble organic n that was adsorbed aon in soils but could be acquired by specific solutions e g kcl cacl2 k2so4 compared to aon don is more easily to be mineralized in our study the potential sources of son as shown in fig 6 include 1 depolymerization and decomposition of complex organic n compounds e g high molecular weight hmw and 2 microbial debris and metabolites the fates of son include 1 decomposition into inorganic n 2 humification into recalcitrant organic n compounds and 3 microbial cell uptake if the inorganic n in soils is insufficient jones et al 2004 because no3 is rich in soils there may be little reason for microorganisms to take up low molecular weight lmw don jones et al 2004 in this study no3 was rich in soils thus the microbial cell uptake of son was eliminated in our study we analyzed the sources and fates of son to assess its role in n cycling in agricultural ecosystems 4 2 1 son dynamics in a typical agricultural soil in the control treatment we observed that son increased with inorganic n accumulation during the first 12 days the rate of son increase was 2 22 mg n kg d and the rate of mineral n accumulation was 0 94 mg n kg d during the first 12 days the rate of son increase was 2 36 fold greater than the rate of mineral n accumulation it confirmed that the process of depolymerization and decomposition of complex organic n compounds was enhanced because of rapid microbial growth during the first 12 days of incubation after 12 days the rates of son increase and mineral n accumulation decreased to very low levels 4 2 2 son dynamics after adding the chemical fertilizer addition of exogenous fertilizers to soils stimulated soil microbial activity by improving soil conditions e g soil ph nutrient retention and affected the rates of son production and mineral n accumulation in the urea amended treatment cumulative n mineralization was significantly negatively correlated with son content r 0 98 p 01 table 4 urea was considered lmw don to be amended to soils berman and bronk 2003 wang et al 2008 because of its chemical structure an amide can be transformed into mineral n which can be utilized directly by microorganisms therefore son containing a large number of amides was depleted and it became the major substrate for n mineralization the results showed that the contents of son in urea amended soils was lower than in the control soils after 7 days implying that urea application stimulated rapid microbial growth and further accelerated native son mineralization in soils after 70 days of incubation the rates of son increase and mineral n accumulation decreased to very low levels this can be explained by the minimization of microbial biomass and activity with decomposition and depletion of the labile c 4 2 3 son dynamics with eoa in the present study manure and straw addition increased the content of son in soils during the entire incubation this finding was confirmed by previous studies embacher et al 2008 ros et al 2009 liang et al 2015 in our study the content of son in manure and straw were 9591 85 and 1526 31 mg kg respectively if all the son in eoa was released into the soil the theoretical maximum content of son in the soil was equal to 108 74 and 105 80 mg kg at the total n application rate 120 mg kg for manure and straw respectively the experimental maximum content of son in the soils with manure and straw amendment was 129 39 and 137 24 mg kg respectively the experimental values were significantly higher than the theoretical this indicated that son increased when eoa were added to soils the sources of increased son may include 1 the increased decomposition of complex organic n compounds by high microbial biomass and activity and 2 microbial debris and metabolites our data provided supporting evidence for these two sources firstly our data showed that the contents of mbn with eoa addition were higher than with chemical fertilizer addition during the entire incubation fig 4 in particular the maximum mbn content was 1 31 and 1 06 fold higher in manure amended and straw amended soils respectively than in urea amended soil at day 7 our results demonstrated that manure and straw addition accelerated the process of complex organic n to son by rapid growth of microorganisms this process has been considered the dominant pathway for n supply in agricultural soils hadas et al 1992 schimel and bennett 2004 secondly our results showed that mineral n decreased during the entire incubation period in straw amend soils and at an earlier stage in manure amended soils indicating that mineral n immobilization in soils with a high c n ratio occurred in eoa amended soils fig 1 meanwhile it was also found that the content of mbn and son in eoa amended soils increased with decreasing mineral n and were higher than in other treatments after long incubation periods which suggested that the application of eoa could promote the immobilization of excessive nitrates by stimulating microbial growth qiu et al 2013 the immobilized n in live or dead microbial cells entered son pools and thus became another key source for the increased son pools qiu et al 2016 thus if excessive eoa are added to soils it will increase the son pools and may promote its leaching potential murphy et al 2000 carswell et al 2016 to further analyze the distinct effects of different eoa amendments the results in both treatments manure and straw were compared unlike in the straw amended treatment the c n ratio decreased with the depletion of labile c at a later period and mineral n accumulated in manure amended soil this suggested that in manure amended soil nitrification was the dominant process at the end of incubation after 70 day incubation period the content of son in manure amended soil was higher than that of straw amended soil in this work manure contained much more soluble forms of n than straw furthermore soil n immobilization was stronger than n mineralization over time in straw amended soil little of the immobilized n would later be mineralized xu et al 2003 thus decomposition of complex organic n compounds was easier in manure amended soil than in straw amended soil in the later period contributing to the higher son content in manure amended soil 4 3 the potential of son leaching to groundwater from soils son is a dynamic participant in agriculture ecosystems and its compositional characteristics can influence its bioavailability and mobility pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2006 in this study the 3d eem spatial characteristics of son and its fractions displayed some differences because of the complexity of their structural composition in different treatments son was mainly comprised of protein like substances and fulvic like materials by the end of incubation fig 5 the protein like substances are usually eliminated by biodegradation although fulvic like and humic like materials are not easily utilized by microbes the piii v pi ii iv ratio was regarded as the humification index a higher humification index suggests that son contains more complex and stable organic n forms by the end of incubation piii v pi ii iv ranged from 0 41 to 0 62 table 3 compared to the control exogenous fertilizer addition resulted in lower ratios this indicated a lower proportion of humic material with exogenous fertilizer application suva254 values have been widely used as an index to estimate the aromatic content of dissolved organic matter dom li et al 2014 values 3 indicate that organic matter contains a specific hydrophilic substance a253 a203 ratios are usually used to reflect the concentration of substitution groups li et al 2014 the higher ratios indicate that substitution groups in aromatic rings contain more carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and ester groups conversely lower a253 a203 values indicate that substitution groups contain more aliphatic chains wang et al 2015 our study showed that suva254 values and a253 a203 ratios ranged from 0 10 to 0 45 and 0 03 to 0 22 respectively table 3 this indicated that son was mainly comprised of hydrophilic substances and substitution groups of aromatic rings with more aliphatic chains the hydrophilic son could be easily leached because of its low molecular weight kušlienė et al 2015 to evaluate the potential of son leaching both its properties and total content should be taken into consideration on the one hand compared with organic amendments the extent of humification with chemical fertilizer addition was lower table 3 indicating that substantial son leaching would be triggered if extensive chemical fertilizers were added to soils under specific hydrological conditions e g heavy rainfall excessive irrigation barton et al 2006 on the other hand in terms of son contents chemical fertilizer addition decreased son content whereas eoa addition increased son content the application of eoa resulted in much more son accumulated in soils hence eoa addition also contributed to a high potential of son leaching finally our study indicated that son leaching in intensive agricultural soils should not be ignored when evaluating the risk of n leaching 4 4 the implications of fertilization management in agricultural soils in our research two fertilization strategies chemical fertilizer alone and organic amendment alone were investigated in terms of the nutrient efficiency and leaching risks for chemical fertilizer it was found that the addition of chemical fertilizer alone increased the contents of mineral n in soils after 70 day incubation the increased mineral n in soils could be utilized by plants however when the increased mineral n following excessive chemical fertilizer addition exceeded plants requirements the extra mineral n would accumulate in soils and leach into deeper profiles under irrigation for organic amendment the application of organic amendments alone resulted to mineral n immobilization by microorganisms due to a high c n ratio in soils thus the organic amendments as slow releasing mineral n source fail to guarantee enough mineral n for plants growth particularly for some key growth stages moreover the contents of son increased after long time incubation and the increased son was mainly comprised of hydrophilic substances and substitution groups of aromatic rings with more aliphatic chains accordingly son leaching potential was enhanced considering the advantages and disadvantages of above two fertilization strategies we suggested the combination of chemical and organic fertilizers should be considered in agricultural practice and son should not be ignored when evaluating the risk of n leaching in future studies the mechanisms of how plants compete for son and how their presences affect the n cycling or release of n in the field need to be further addressed 5 conclusion various properties of fertilizers and their distinct interactions with soil made them influence soil n in different ways chemical fertilizer addition increased cumulative n mineralization whereas organic amendments with higher c n ratio stimulated soil n immobilization with enhanced mbn in the soil no direct link between son contents and n mineralization capacity was observed in different treatments because of the intricate components and conversion processes of son the chemical fertilizer addition decreased the content of son and organic amendment application increased the content of son in addition the increased son in eoa amended soils containing large amounts of hydrophilic substances contributed to a high potential for son

1641,a two dimensional model for solute migration transformation and deposition in a phreatic solution conduit penetrating a karst aquifer is presented in which the solute is anthropogenic to the natural system transformation of a reacting solute in a solution conduit has generally been accepted as likely occurring but actual physical measurements and mathematical analyses of the suspected process have been generally minimally investigated primarily because of the logistical difficulties and complexities associated with solute transport through solution conduits the model demonstrates how a reacting solute might decay or be transformed to a product solute some of which then migrates via radial dispersion to the conduit wall where it may become adsorbed model effects vary for laminar flow and turbulent flow in the axial direction dispersion in the radial direction also exhibits marked differences for both laminar flow and turbulent flow reaction zones may enhance subsequent reactions due to some overlap resulting from the longitudinal dispersion caused by flow in the axial direction simulations showed that varying the reaction rate coefficient strongly affects solute reactions but that varying deposition coefficients had only minimal impacts the model was applied to a well known tracer test that used the tracer dye rhodamine wt which readily converts to deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt after release to illustrate how the model may be used to suggest one possible cause in addition to other possible causes for less than 100 tracer mass recovery in terms of pollutants in a karst aquifer the model also suggests one possible mechanism for pollutant transformation in a solution conduit graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phreatic solution conduit karst aquifer transport reactivity deposition 1 introduction solute reactivity in perennially flooded solution conduits penetrating karst aquifers are of interest for understanding basic fate and transport processes in karst aquifers it is well known that various solutes will at times undergo deposition transformation and decay as they migrate through one or more solution conduits although the degree to which any particular solute undergoes any one or more of the listed processes varies depending on the specifics of the solute the solvent i e water aquifer materials conduit walls breakdown sediment infilling organic debris etc and spatiotemporal variations related to temperature seasonal effects and human surface and subsurface activities determining solute reactions in solution conduits is further complicated by the general inaccessibility of most phreatic solution conduits conduits below the water table and continuously pipe full to be accessible and amenable to such investigations a solution conduit must have a clearly defined entrance and or exit be large enough for a human to penetrate making it a cave but not too large and be accessible to scuba divers overly large phreatic solution conduits such as have been explored in florida e g caves feeding wakulla spring are too deep broad and extensive to allow for adequate investigations see for example kernagis et al 2008 milanovic 2007 just being able to access a solution conduit with a borehole an unpredictable and very fortuitous occurrence quinlan and ewers 1985 is inadequate for developing any sense of solute reactivity in a solution conduit because the physical range of any measurements to be taken is limited and the logistics and related complexities can be overwhelming previous studies on solute reactivity in karst aquifers have generally been limited to vadose zone passages e g savoy 2008 perhaps because of the much easier access relative to a phreatic solution conduit for contaminated sites located in karst terranes quantitative groundwater tracing utilizing a tracer budget is required for correctly establishing transport trajectories velocities dispersions etc davies 2004 kincaid et al 2005 a tracer budget is also critical for confirming that all resurgences connected to the tracer injection point have been established gouzie et al 2015 the tracer budget for tracer tests conducted in karst aquifers often results in less than 100 tracer mass recovery because of 1 tracer discharge at unmonitored resurgences 2 errors in discharge measurements 3 early cessation of the tracer test 4 inadequate sampling frequency 5 tracer reactivity e g deposition transformation and or decay or 6 some combination of the previous five if it is confirmed that all resurgences connected to the tracer injection point were properly monitored sampling frequency was adequate discharge measurements were reasonably accurate and the tracer test was run to completion then tracer reactivity may be considered as partially maximally or even solely responsible for a less than 100 tracer mass recovery an assessment regarding tracer solute reactivity in the aquifer should be investigated if possible to verify the potential effects and importance of solute reactivity previous solute reactivity investigations have been primarily devoted more to porous media and fractured rock aquifers although some solute reactivity research studies in karst aquifers have been developed e g white 1997 for example dijk and berkowitz 1998 investigated the effect of precipitation and dissolution of reactive solutes in saturated fractured media based on the efforts of békri et al 1995 békri et al 1997 lowell et al 1993 and mourzenko et al 1996 although solute reactivity in karst aquifers has long been recognized as occurring few if any investigations into the supposed reactivity of anthropogenic solutes have been conducted savoy 2008 p 11 17 probably because of the complications related to conducting such an investigation sinreich 2011 as a result little if anything is known about anthropogenic solute reactivity in phreatic solution conduits savoy 2008 p 135 although some investigations into solute reactivity in karst aquifers are beginning e g faulkner et al 2009 hillebrand et al 2015 sinreich 2014 sinreich et al 2007 in an effort to better understand the reactivity in karst aquifers geyer et al 2007 conducted a multitracer test in the gallusquelle catchment situated on the swabian alb using one conservative tracer sodium fluorescein also commonly known as uranine colour index acid yellow 73 and two reactive tracers sulforhodamine g c i acid red 50 and tinopal cbs x c i fluorescent brightener 351 in which retardation effects were observed as late peak tracer arrivals of the reactive dyes relative to fluorescein later in an effort to better understand the attenuation capacity of karst aquifers hillebrand et al 2012 repeated the tracer experiments of geyer et al 2007 with fluorescein as the conservative tracer and caffeine as the reactive tracer the efforts by hillebrand et al 2012 demonstrated that pollutant attenuation rates in a karst aquifer may be more significant than is generally accepted still as noted by hillebrand et al little is known regarding the attenuation capacity of karst aquifers although the work of odutola and walsh 2002 and hillebrand et al 2014 provide some insights into the processes unfortunately as previously noted the inaccessibility of most phreatic solution conduits severely limits the extent to which the significance of solute reactions occurring within solution conduits may be evaluated and understood for this reason theoretical modeling can form an important investigative tool in understanding solute fate and transport in phreatic solution conduits the objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model that considers solute reactivity decay and transformation for an anthropogenic substance within selected portions of a solution conduit and consequent dispersion and deposition of some percentage of a newly created solute product onto conduit walls the approach is different from that of similar types of studies e g steefel and lichtner 1994 in that we focused on a phreatic solution conduit in which mineral precipitation is nonexistent sorption onto the solution conduit walls may be enhanced or reduced by specific coatings that may occur on some parts of the conduit walls it has long been known that solution conduits act as repositories for secondary deposits such as breakdown from conduit roof collapse sands silts and clays transported underground via streams sasowsky and mylroie 2007 and deposition of chemical reactants e g caco3 and raco3 due to chemical precipitation bosch and white 2007 many of these substances either precipitate or get plastered onto the walls and ceiling or get deposited on the floor of a conduit although it will be noted that mineral precipitation does not occur in perennially flooded phreatic conduits these all function to react e g sorb with other anthropogenic substances being transported into the conduit 2 theoretical concept we consider a single phreatic solution conduit with one entrance point and one resurgence point fig 1 a reactant enters the solution conduit at z 0 and is naturally transformed to some product or by reaction with some substance that is either in the water or adhering to portions of the conduit wall the substance causing the solute transformation may be biological or chemical may have entered the conduit via conduit flow or via seepage from the surrounding rock matrix transport of the solute reactant and transformed product occurs axially via advection and non fickian longitudinal dispersion and radially via a much lower dispersion from intuition we can expect radial movement of a solute or chemical component simply because they will not flow in a straight line axial direction particularly if the system has some form of packing e g a catalyst in a chemical reactor or sediment buildup in a solution conduit radial dispersion d r is used to account for the radial movement that is with a d r 2 c r 2 1 r c z the term d r is not a molecular diffusivity which is too small but rather a dispersion coefficient that fits any observations lastly the transformed product is assumed to deposit onto the conduit wall if it encounters the conduit wall deposition occurs when molecules settle out of a solution and may be regarded as the process of a coating buildup on a substrate surface by adsorptive processes deposition processes include settling and in terms of turbulent flow turbophoresis van thienen et al 2011 according to vreeburg and boxall 2007 turbophoresis is the process that describes the turbulent transportation of particles from more turbid regions to less turbid regions in a flow pattern the turbophoretic force is dependent on the gradient of turbulence over the flow profile for flow through conduits particles are transported from the bulk fluid to less turbid regions near the wall where they may become trapped in cohesive layers at higher velocities the gradient is greater because the turbulence at the pipe wall must always be zero this greater turbulent gradient results in a concomitantly greater force that drives particles from the conduit center to the wall of the conduit vreeburg and boxall further emphasize that in light of this theory it may be suggested that at a flow velocity of 0 14 m s 1 the turbophoresis force exceeds the gravitational force and causes a uniform supply of material at the conduit surface while at 0 06 m s 1 the gravity and turbophoresic forces approach equilibrium sorption specifically adsorption is the net accumulation of matter on the solid phase at an interface with an aqueous solution but also may be defined as the excess concentration of a chemical at the subsurface solid interface compared to that in the bulk solution berkowitz et al 2014 p 45 according to sinreich et al 2007 reversible sorption processes may be modeled using either an equilibrium or a kinetic approach the difficulty in terms of sorption on conduit walls is the general inability to obtain relevant samples for laboratory analyses that would verify modeling efforts as recommended by sinreich 2010 sinreich 2011 later emphasized that when reactive and or non persistent contaminants are involved transport rates and concentrations are determined by contaminant specific properties and hydrochemical characteristics rather than by the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer additional details regarding the concepts of sorption retention and release of contaminants are provided in berkowitz et al 2014 p 107 146 the model allows for consideration of laminar and turbulent flow in the positive axial direction of the conduit that is constrained within a circular cross section with radial symmetry for laminar flow conditions solute transport is considered to occur primarily in the axial direction as a function of advection and longitudinal dispersion whereas solute transport in the radial direction is limited to molecular diffusion according to fick s first law of mass diffusion however for turbulent flow conditions longitudinal dispersion behaves asymptotically in a manner similar to fickian diffusion socolofsky and jirka 2005 p 21 often termed eddy diffusion no conduit bank storage or matrix diffusion is considered because as previously demonstrated by wicks 2005 for paleozoic carbonates conduit bank storage is relatively insignificant and matrix diffusion is regarded as unimportant due to inadequate conduit surface area and inadequate contact time field and pinsky 2000 2 1 mathematical formulation for a solution conduit reactor the governing model is two dimensional in the radial r and axial z directions with time t as a third independent variable for simplification the model assumes isothermal flow constant transport coefficients parabolic radial velocity profile first order kinetics for reactant conversion and axial and radial dispersions the basic model is formulated in cylindrical coordinates and is similar to that of bobba 1989 and peterson and wicks 2005 but with some necessary differences using fig 4 as a basic guide the mathematical model describing flow and solute transport through a phreatic solution conduit appears as 1 c r t υ r c r z d r c r 2 c r r 2 1 r c r z d z 2 c r z 2 γ z t k r c r μ r c r 2 c p t υ r c p z d r c p 2 c p r 2 1 r c p z d z 2 c p z 2 k r c r μ p c p with all variables described in the notation section subscripts r and p refer to reactant and product respectively solute reactions in eqs 1 and 2 are described by a first order irreversible kinetic surface model in which the forward reaction is very strong and the reverse very weak equilibrium is reached very slowly the reaction rate used in the model is characterized by a first order kinetic rate coefficient k r that connects eq 1 with eq 2 solute reactivity is a highly complex process with numerous processes occurring at times simultaneously see for example berkowitz et al 2014 for our purposes it was necessary that solute reactivity processes be simplified complex reaction kinetics with multiple chemical species would lead to a large system of partial differential equations pdes that would be intractable to solve numerically solute decay in both eqs 1 and 2 is characterized by a first order decay coefficient μ r and μ p for the reactant and product respectively in this instance decay of a reactant may be very different from decay of a product the possibility of a point source pulse release of a reactant is determined by the function γ z t this function controls the length of time for a pulse release and both the location and distance for a pulse release the model initial conditions for eqs 1 and 2 are respectively 3 c r r z 0 c 0 0 0 z z l 0 r r 0 γ 0 c 0 0 0 z z l 0 r r 0 γ 0 and 4 c p r z 0 0 the boundary conditions for eq 1 are 5a c r r 0 t c 0 5b c r 0 z t r 0 5c c r r 0 z t r 0 5d c r r z l t t υ r c r r z l t z and the boundary conditions for eq 2 are 6a c p r 0 t 0 6b c p 0 z t r 0 6c d r c p c p r 0 z t r k d 1 c p r 0 z t k d 2 6d c p r z l t t υ r c p r z l t z according to eq 3 at time t 0 the entering fluid may contain the reactant solute of concern that may also include a pulse release of the same reactant solute or the entering fluid may be initially reactant solute free but a pulse release adds the reactant solute to the entering fluid in addition eq 4 ensures an initially product solute free entering fluid eq 5a ensures that the initial concentration at z 0 to c 0 for an entering fluid with a continuous source or to 0 for a solute free entering fluid while eq 6a ensures that c p 0 at z 0 eqs 5b and 6b ensure zero radial gradients along the conduit centerline by symmetry diffusion of c r through the conduit wall i e matrix diffusion is prevented by eq 5c a time dependent boundary condition at the exit z z l for both c r and c p is provided by eqs 5d and 6d to ensure a smooth decrease in reactant and a smooth increase in product application of the more typical danckwerts boundary condition danckwerts 1953 pearson 1959 wehner and wilhelm 1956 near z z l causes the energy to pile up because mathematically the danckwerts boundary condition requires a zero slope at the downstream end of the reaction zone which is physically impossible as demonstrated by schiesser 1996 application of a danckwerts boundary condition to solute transport models with large péclet numbers p e will cause unrealistic results near z z l péclet numbers are typically quite high in phreatic solution conduits relative to transport in porous media and fractured rock aquifers field 2002 p 43 examples of typically elevated péclet numbers in solution conduits may be found in table 1 of field and pinsky 2000 the rate of deposition of c p onto the conduit wall controlled by the right side of eq 6c 7 k d 1 c p r 0 z t k d 2 and is equal to the rate of diffusion of c p to the conduit wall which is controlled by the left side of eq 6c 8 d r c p c p r 0 z t r the auxiliary function for the radial velocity profile for laminar flow is bird et al 1960 p 46 9 υ r 2 υ 1 r 2 r 0 2 and for turbulent flow may be obtained from štigler 2016 10 υ r υ 2 1 r 2 r 0 2 1 n d n 1 n 1 1 r 2 n r 0 2 n 2 n n 1 1 r 2 r 0 2 where n d represents the difference between maximal velocity and mean velocity normalized by the mean velocity which is dependent on re as re increases n d decreases and tends to zero as re the parameter n d is obtained from 11 n d 2 1 n 0 3 9 8 where n 0 may be obtained from 12 1 n 0 ln re 0 78911 1 56827 the parameter n may then be obtained from 13 n p 1 p 2 l r 0 2 4 μ υ 2 1 1 n d which when a friction factor f r is expressed for the pressure drop p 1 p 2 l may be obtained from 14 n f r re 64 1 2 1 n d efforts to obtain a theoretically derived equation for a turbulent flow profile has been elusive but the efforts of štigler 2014 2016 has resulted in the development of eqs 10 14 that this author found matches well with empirically derived equations e g eq 9 2 in mott 2006 eq 10 was selected for turbulent flow because it represents an analytical formula for the turbulent mean flow velocity profile that addresses all fluid flow regimes the viscous sublayer the log law region the overlap region and the region of core of the fluid flow many previous investigations were primarily focused on the near wall region specifically the log law region štigler 2016 rather than fluid flow regimes our reasoning was that consideration of all fluid regions would be more representative of conduit flow conditions and effects the darcy weisbach friction factor f r may be obtained by applying the lambert w function which allows for an explicit reformulation of the colebrook white equation and avoidance of the more commonly applied iterative process brkic 2012 15 f r 1 2 w ln 10 b a 2 where 16a a 2 51 re 16b b ξ 14 8 r h 16c c ln 10 2 a 10 b 2 a use of the colebrook white equation which is valid for re 4000 to estimate f r was chosen because it has been extensively investigated and is well established the absolute roughness ξ may be approximated from the manning roughness coefficient n by webber 1971 17 ξ c k n 6 in which n is assumed to represent fully rough turbulent flow when c k max 26 metcalf and vilioen 2009 for solution conduits n range phrase 0 050 10 may be considered appropriate palmer 2007 p 98 luhmann et al 2015 set ξ 21 5 as reasonably representative of roughness in solution conduits which is generally greater than most rock types but less than that of pillow lava metcalf and vilioen 2009 reaction of c r occurs along one or more selected reaches of the conduit where microbial and or chemical substances may react with c r to create c p locations where c p may be created may occur along the entire conduit length or along one or more selected reaches along the conduit length 2 2 model solution the solution of the conventional advection dispersion equation formulated in cylindrical coordinates is extremely complex as demonstrated by chen et al 2011a and chen et al 2011b for that reason eqs 1 6d were solved numerically using the numerical method of lines schiesser 1991 the partial derivatives were computed spatially and temporally for eqs 1 and 2 over a two dimensional domain using a five point centered approximation for longitudinal dispersion and a five point biased upwind approximation in the positive direction for advection schiesser 1994 p 464 468 567 for a 2 5 25 point grid silebi and schiesser 1992 p 443 with 5 points in r and 25 points in z that can easily be changed in the calculations to test spatial convergence solution of the resulting 250 ordinary differential equations odes was achieved using a fourth order runge kutta routine with an embedded modified euler method schiesser 2013 p 24 27 to check convergence in t absolute error criteria were applied to each dependent variable silebi and schiesser 1992 p 48 2 3 numerical dispersion assessment numerical approximations to for example strongly advective hyperbolic parabolic equations typical of advection dispersion problems are well known to result in some unwanted numerical dispersion pdes that are strongly convective strongly hyperbolic can propagate sharp fronts and even discontinuities which are difficult to resolve in space experience has demonstrated that for these systems some form of upwinding is generally required when replacing the spatial derivatives with algebraic approximations saucez et al 2001 upwinding may also be considered to be useful in that it is quite effective when convective velocity is not constant and that upwind differencing carries information on the structure of the solution forward in the direction of the traveling wave and thus anticipates and suppresses the growth of unwanted perturbations pozirikidis 2008 p 1032 analyses comparing upwind methods against exact solutions to pdes amenable to such have shown that for example two point upwind approximations can be problematic and that just increasing the number of points does not improve the approximations schiesser et al 1994 p 16 biasing upwind methods such as was applied in the five point biased upwind approximation used for the model described in this paper carver and hinds 1978 where biasing applies to the use of downstream and well as upstream points but with more upstream than downstream points does significantly improve the results schiesser et al 1994 p 17 pozirikidis 2008 p 1017 1080 also provides a comprehensive analysis of biased upwinding schiesser 1991 p 122 141 examined the problem of numerical dispersion in detail and noted that a combination of centered and upwind approximations would result in better approximations after careful analyses schiesser 1991 p 141 was able to note that the five point biased upwind approximations proposed by carver and hinds 1978 are quite effective when simulating convective systems modeled by first order hyperbolic pdes 3 sensitivity analysis the model allows for advective flow and longitudinal dispersion in the positive axial direction with much lower dispersion in the radial direction first order reaction and decay and solute product deposition to the conduit walls a fast flowing turbulent stream in a phreatic conduit typical of karst aquifers is the principal focus of the model the model can also account for a low velocity laminar conduit stream but such a stream is generally regarded as somewhat atypical of phreatic solution conduits penetrating karst aquifers ford and williams 1989 p 518 ford and williams 2007 p 109 basic solute reactivities involving a reactant and resulting product for differing flow regimes synthetic parameters for 10 listed in table 1 are shown in fig 2 all three flow regimes did result in some decay of the reactant and deposition of some product on the conduit wall with some longitudinal dispersion significantly turbulent flow with high axial and radial diffusivities resulted in the most longitudinal dispersion increasing transport time from 10 to 50 serves to emphasize the effect of reactivity over time with respect to the differing flow regimes listed in table 1 depicting the results as contour plots and spaciotemporal distribution plots can be helpful in illustrating increasing reactivity complexity as transport time increases fig 3 3 1 varying reactivities for a relatively low velocity laminar stream with significantly lower radial diffusivity using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersion of the solutes increases with increasing k r fig 4a c longitudinal dispersion although not very great is evident in the axial direction for a high velocity turbulent stream with relatively low axial and radial diffusivities using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersion of the solutes is similar to the laminar flow case fig 4d f axial dispersivity is more evident than for the laminar case depicted in fig 4a c most likely because axial velocity is 11 greater and diffusivity is 10 that of the laminar flow case in addition c p appears to be smoother possibly because of the more rapid transport for a high velocity turbulent stream with relatively high axial and radial diffusivities using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersivity of the solutes is similar to that of the turbulent flow with a lower radial diffusivities fig 4d f but with lesser radial dispersion fig 4g i axial dispersion is evident but not as much as for the turbulent flow case with lower axial and radial diffusivities the apparent decrease in radial dispersion is most likely a result of the 10 fold increase in axial diffusivity over the turbulent flow case with lower radial diffusivity and the change in diffusivity for c r and c p table 1 3 2 varying deposition rates sorption of product solute on the conduit walls is controlled by two different parameters a linear parameter k d 1 the effects of which are quite subtle and a nonlinear parameter k d 2 the effects of which are readily apparent 3 2 1 linear deposition rates the effect of linear deposition of a solute product defined by the coefficient k d 1 is shown in fig 5 as a linear reactant parameter k d 1 requires a fairly high value in order for an obvious affect to be noted as might be expected product deposition to conduit walls is most pronounced when flow is laminar and increases for all flow cases as originally listed in table 1 as k d 1 increases 3 2 2 nonlinear deposition rates nonlinear deposition of a product solute defined by the coefficient k d 2 on conduit walls is considerably more apparent than that controlled by the linear deposition coefficient fig 6 in this instance maximum deposition on conduit walls is basically equivalent for all three flow cases but more axial dispersion occurs for the two turbulent flow fig 6d i which is to be expected the other laminar flow case as originally listed in table 1 fig 6a c does not exhibit such strong axial dispersion effects because differences between axial flow and radial diffusivity are not as significant and flow velocity is much less 3 3 varying decay constants in terms of reactant solute decay effects are most pronounced when μ r is dominant fig 7a d and g as would be expected whereas product solute decay effects are not as obvious even when μ p is dominant fig 7b e and h when both μ r and μ p are active the decay effects on both the reactant and product are readily apparent fig 7c f and i again as previously observed the individual and combined effects of both μ r and μ p are most apparent when difference between axial flow and radial diffusivity are greatest fig 7d f 3 4 multiple reaction zones the effect of multiple differently spaced reaction zones separated by differently spaced nonreaction zones was also found to affect solute migration and reaction turbulent with relatively high axial and radial diffusivities with multiple reaction zones as originally listed in table 1 fig 8 a depicts a single reaction zone fig 8 b depicts two reaction zones z r fig 8 c depicts three reaction zones z r fig 8 d depicts four reaction zones z r and fig 8 e depicts five reaction zones z r all with a nonvarying reactivity coefficient k r 0 03 from fig 8 it is evident that reaction zones separated by a relatively smaller nonreaction zone results in enhanced reactivity and enhanced axial dispersivity but separation of reaction zones by a somewhat wider nonreaction zone has less effect on the extent of reactivity in the subsequent reaction zone 4 application to a mildly reactive tracer dye during the mid 1980s the u s geological survey conducted a series of quantitative tracer tests in the dyers spring drainage basin located in the elizabethtown area of north central kentucky mull et al 1988a b additional tracer tests were conducted in the 1990s taylor 1997 dyers spring is a rise pit that discharges on the east bank about 31 from valley creek the rise pit and the channel draining to valley creek were reported to be about 3 below the surrounding land surface at the time of the 1980s tracer tests mull et al 1988b p 18 the seven tracer tests reported in mull et al 1988b were initiated at a karst window approximately 914 upstream of dyers spring on a straight line distance mull et al 1988b p 58 but which is more correctly taken to be approximately 1372 from dyers spring when a sinuosity factor of 1 5 is applied to the straight line distance field 2002 p 34 at the karst window a spring or stream emerges at the upper end of the sinkhole flows about 76 and drains into a swallow hole at the lower end of the sinkhole the karst window receives relatively little runoff because of the small area that drains directly into the karst window mull et al 1988b p 18 19 a detailed description of the seven tracer tests conducted in the dyers spring drainage basin is provided in mull et al 1988b p 58 59 the quantitative tracer tests conducted by the u s geological survey used rhodamine wt c i acid red 388 mull et al 1988b p 41 which has an estimated log kow 3 71 as calculated using the epi suite program us epa 2012 although smart 1984 reported a log kow 1 33 such very low log kow estimates suggests retardation effects caused by deposition would be minimal but this has not always been the case rhodamine wt has been identified as being problematic for quantitative tracer studies see for example runkel 2015 and references therein even so successful quantitative traces appear to have mostly been obtained by mullsl88 individual breakthrough curves btcs for the seven tracer tests conducted by mullsl88 are shown in fig 9 the seven btcs depicted in fig 9 emphasize the varying transport rates that occurred as a result of differing hydrologic conditions during the tracer tests table 2 lists the dates of tracer release dye masses released masses recovered and travel times for each of the seven tracer tests tracer recoveries varied from a low of 55 mass recovered to a high of 172 mass recovered mass recoveries that are significantly different from that which was released are often attributed to errors in discharge measurements but other factors may be important as well for example under high flow conditions low mass recoveries could be a result of significant quantities of tracer mass being shunted to transient high level overflow springs white 2018 that may not have been monitored during the tracer test alternatively excessively high tracer mass recoveries could be a result of detecting similar compounds without applying necessary chemical separation techniques to the samples for example although not used for the quantitative tracer tests automobile antifreeze and sodium fluorescein dye which was used by the u s geological survey for conducting qualitative tracer tests mull et al 1988b p 35 are difficult to separate from each other resolution of tracer discrepancies is recognized as an inexact science at best because complexities caused by numerous natural and anthropogenic occurring fluorophores in the environment are to be expected brown 2009 travel times for the seven tracer tests listed in table 1 varied significantly depending on the time of year see fig 9 as would be expected late winter and early spring resulted in the earlier travel times faster velocities and higher mass recoveries while subsequent months exhibited later travel times slower velocities and lower mass recoveries the greater than 100 mass recoveries for the tracer tests listed in table 2 were reported to be a result of inaccurate stage measurements at dyers spring during the high flow conditions mull et al 1988b p 31 the same could be said for the less than 100 tracer mass recoveries for the other tracer tests 4 1 degradation of rhodamine wt for this study the tracer test initiated on may 30 1985 trace 20 in table 2 fig 9 was taken as an example of a tracer test with a low mass recovery that was similar to the even poorer mass recovery for the tracer test conducted seven days earlier may 23 1985 table 2 contrary to the common assumption that the poor mass recoveries were due either to errors in discharge measurements or tracer discharge at unmonitored locations this study assumes that the tracer dye rhodamine wt reacts with some unknown reacting substance in the solution conduit the net effect is that the rhodamine wt is sufficiently altered such that the basic rhodamine wt becomes what is commonly known as deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt with properties that are quite different from rhodamine wt such as excitation and emission wavelengths hoffman et al 2007 p 40 although the rates and extent of deaminoalkylation are still not fully understood field 2005 typically most tracer dyes decompose by chemical degradation photodegradation and biochemical degradation flury and wai 2003 deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt was not addressed in runkel 2015 flury and wai 2003 or other studies on the reactivity of rhodamine wt even though deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt is a recognized process related to rhodamine wt idstein and ewers 2002 albeit a poorly understood process the process of deaminoalkylation is believed to affect most if not all rhodamines käß 1998 p 34 glenn et al 2013 p 4 37 4 38 and is thought to be a result of a pseudomonas bacteria scavenging amine groups from the rhodamine molecule gareth davies pers comm but this remains speculative field 2005 most dyes are xenobiotic because they are generally manufactured to resist biodegradation flury and wai 2003 so the possibility of bacteria scavenging the amine groups may not be a dominant process the assumption that pseudomonas bacteria were washed into the solution conduit that connects the upgradient karst window used for tracer injection with dyers spring attacked the injected rhodamine wt and significantly degraded it with a consequent 37 tracer mass loss may be regarded as reasonable unfortunately there appears to be a dearth of published research on deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt most studies focused on the reactivity of rhodamine wt are concerned primarily with photodecay keefe et al 2004 tai and rathbun 1988 deposition bencala et al 1983 lin et al 2003 russell et al 2004 and the effects caused by the two separate isomers that make up commercially available rhodamine wt sabatini and austin 1991 shiau et al 1993 sutton et al 2001 vasudevan et al 2001 although it could be argued that deaminoalkylation is just as important a process alternatively there are some indications of metabolizing of fluorescent tracer dyes such as rhodamine wt when in contact with other chemicals leibundgut et al 2009 p 85 so it is possible that reactions with an entering chemical substance caused a decrease in recovered rhodamine wt mass by chemical reaction it was noted by leibundgut et al that such chemical reactions were determined to have occurred during long term experiments however the length of time for a long term experiment was not defined and the process so poorly understood that it may generally be accepted that rhodamine wt degradation may begin at any time and can progress at any rate or varying rates after tracer injection 4 2 modeling the reactivity of rhodamine wt the 37 loss of rhodamine wt mass for the may 30 1985 tracer test may have been due to some sort of reaction the reactivity model developed in this paper considers the conversion of rhodamine wt to a different compound i e deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt that is then either sorbed to the conduit walls decays through some process e g microbial or gets discharged at dyers spring table 3 lists the model parameters used to assess the possible reactivity resulting in the new compound most of the parameters listed in table 3 are relatively straightforward and were either known a priori e g tracer mass calculated from the results of the tracer test e g r 0 or taken from the literature e g d r c r other values were estimated from the available parameters e g re the reaction zone z r was assumed to range from 200 m 400 m although no evidence is available for arbitrarily determining the size of the reaction zone it may reasonably be assumed that the reaction did not immediately begin upon dye entrance into the phreatic conduit and that the reaction ceased somewhere along the conduit before the resurgence the reaction rate constant k r was arbitrarily set to 0 01 h 1 on the assumption that rhodamine wt reactivity would probably be fairly low decay rates for the reactant solute μ r and the product solute μ p were arbitrarily set to 0 001 h 1 and 0 002 h 1 respectively a comparison of the model results with the measured may 30 1985 btc are shown in fig 10 the apparent match of model results to the measured btc may be regarded as reasonable because most of the parameters listed in table 3 are very similar to those obtained from analyses using the qtracer2 program field 2002 and the cxtfit2 program field and pinsky 2000 toride et al 1993 1995 statistical measures of model fit to measured data are shown in table 4 most commonly the pearson correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r 2 are used to assess model fit to measured data but are regarded as being rather poor statistics press et al 1992 p 630 in some instances nonparametric rank correlation e g spearman rank order correlation coefficient r s and kendall rank order correlation coefficient τ may provide better assessments of model fit to measured data press et al 1992 p 633 637 alternatively other measures designed to assess model fit to measured data e g nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr are sometimes recommended for hydrologic studies moriasi et al 2007 as can be noted in fig 10 that for the first 10 h of time measured rhodamine wt concentrations equaled 0 0 μg l 1 suggesting a departure from normality and thus necessitating the need to consider alternative statistical measures on correlation in addition to pearson as is apparent in table 4 each of the various statistical measures all suggest a high degree of confidence of the model fit to the measured data correlation coefficients r r s and τ with probability calculations all strongly support the hypothesis that the model and data are highly correlated unlike pearson coefficient of determination r 2 it isn t customary to report the coefficients of determination for spearman and kendall r s 2 and τ 2 respectively they both represent the proportion of shared variance in the two ranked variables and all three suggest a high degree of correlation the additional measures of fit shown in table 4 nse rsr and pbias also suggest a high degree of correlation although pbias 0 0 would be preferable the effect of decreasing rhodamine wt concentration and increasing deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt concentration are shown in fig 11 figs 11a and reffig rwtdecrease increase b are two dimensional plots of the solutes as they migrate along the conduit with the reaction zone depicted and figs 11 c and reffig rwtdecrease increase d are three dimensional plots of the solutes as they migrate along the conduit in which the time of travel in relation to the distance traveled is also included from fig 11 it is apparent that the specified reaction zone 200 m 400 m significantly affects the solutes by accelerating the decrease in rhodamine wt and the increase in deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt once past the reaction zone the rates of change are less pronounced the spatiotemporal distribution of the rhodamine wt reactant solute and deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt product solute are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively figs 12 and 13 allow for a more clear visualization of the two solutes in the solution conduits over the approximately 37 h of transport time for the rhodamine wt solute a small quantity of the solute migrates radially to the conduit walls at early times fig 11 a e but starting about 18 h after tracer release radial migration of the rhodamine wt becomes much more apparent fig 11 f l for the deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt solute a relatively small quantity of the solute is evident very soon after tracer release and slowly increases for several hours fig 13 a f however about 21 h after tracer release much more significant increases in deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt becomes apparent but stabilizes at about 24 h fig 13 g l 5 concluding remarks a two dimensional mathematical model for solute reactivity in a phreatic solution conduit was presented and solved numerically assumptions used in the model were isothermal flow constant transport properties parabolic velocity profile first order kinetics for reactant conversion radial diffusion and axial dispersion sorption of the solute product created by reaction of the entering solute onto the conduit wall controlled by two deposition rate constants was assumed to be equal to solute product diffusion rate simulations showed that the first order rate coefficient was the dominant factor affecting the concentrations for both the entering solute and the product solute created by the reaction axial velocity and longitudinal dispersion was shown to be capable of causing both the entering solute and some of the product solute to migrate to the downstream resurgence multiple reaction zones separated by nonreaction zones were affected by reactions in earlier reaction zones as a result of the longitudinal dispersion when flow in the axial direction was turbulent varying deposition coefficients only minimally affected radial dispersion and deposition onto conduit walls during laminar conditions and were found to have virtually no affect for turbulent conditions but varying reaction rate constants strongly affected concentrations application of the model to a well known tracer test conducted in a karst aquifer in the 1980s showed how the poor mass recovery of just 63 could have been a result of conversion of the tracer dye rhodamine wt to deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt such a conversion is a recognized but poorly understood process the model showed that as the reacting solute rhodamine wt migrated the axial distance over time concentration of the rhodamine wt continued to decrease through the zone of reactivity while the concentration of the produced solute deaminolakylated rhodamine wt continued to increase the rate of rhodamine wt concentration decrease was more rapid and greater than the rate and magnitude of increase of deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt however averaging the concentrations across the radius of the phreatic solution conduit showed greater radial variations associated with the deaminoalkylated

1641,a two dimensional model for solute migration transformation and deposition in a phreatic solution conduit penetrating a karst aquifer is presented in which the solute is anthropogenic to the natural system transformation of a reacting solute in a solution conduit has generally been accepted as likely occurring but actual physical measurements and mathematical analyses of the suspected process have been generally minimally investigated primarily because of the logistical difficulties and complexities associated with solute transport through solution conduits the model demonstrates how a reacting solute might decay or be transformed to a product solute some of which then migrates via radial dispersion to the conduit wall where it may become adsorbed model effects vary for laminar flow and turbulent flow in the axial direction dispersion in the radial direction also exhibits marked differences for both laminar flow and turbulent flow reaction zones may enhance subsequent reactions due to some overlap resulting from the longitudinal dispersion caused by flow in the axial direction simulations showed that varying the reaction rate coefficient strongly affects solute reactions but that varying deposition coefficients had only minimal impacts the model was applied to a well known tracer test that used the tracer dye rhodamine wt which readily converts to deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt after release to illustrate how the model may be used to suggest one possible cause in addition to other possible causes for less than 100 tracer mass recovery in terms of pollutants in a karst aquifer the model also suggests one possible mechanism for pollutant transformation in a solution conduit graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords phreatic solution conduit karst aquifer transport reactivity deposition 1 introduction solute reactivity in perennially flooded solution conduits penetrating karst aquifers are of interest for understanding basic fate and transport processes in karst aquifers it is well known that various solutes will at times undergo deposition transformation and decay as they migrate through one or more solution conduits although the degree to which any particular solute undergoes any one or more of the listed processes varies depending on the specifics of the solute the solvent i e water aquifer materials conduit walls breakdown sediment infilling organic debris etc and spatiotemporal variations related to temperature seasonal effects and human surface and subsurface activities determining solute reactions in solution conduits is further complicated by the general inaccessibility of most phreatic solution conduits conduits below the water table and continuously pipe full to be accessible and amenable to such investigations a solution conduit must have a clearly defined entrance and or exit be large enough for a human to penetrate making it a cave but not too large and be accessible to scuba divers overly large phreatic solution conduits such as have been explored in florida e g caves feeding wakulla spring are too deep broad and extensive to allow for adequate investigations see for example kernagis et al 2008 milanovic 2007 just being able to access a solution conduit with a borehole an unpredictable and very fortuitous occurrence quinlan and ewers 1985 is inadequate for developing any sense of solute reactivity in a solution conduit because the physical range of any measurements to be taken is limited and the logistics and related complexities can be overwhelming previous studies on solute reactivity in karst aquifers have generally been limited to vadose zone passages e g savoy 2008 perhaps because of the much easier access relative to a phreatic solution conduit for contaminated sites located in karst terranes quantitative groundwater tracing utilizing a tracer budget is required for correctly establishing transport trajectories velocities dispersions etc davies 2004 kincaid et al 2005 a tracer budget is also critical for confirming that all resurgences connected to the tracer injection point have been established gouzie et al 2015 the tracer budget for tracer tests conducted in karst aquifers often results in less than 100 tracer mass recovery because of 1 tracer discharge at unmonitored resurgences 2 errors in discharge measurements 3 early cessation of the tracer test 4 inadequate sampling frequency 5 tracer reactivity e g deposition transformation and or decay or 6 some combination of the previous five if it is confirmed that all resurgences connected to the tracer injection point were properly monitored sampling frequency was adequate discharge measurements were reasonably accurate and the tracer test was run to completion then tracer reactivity may be considered as partially maximally or even solely responsible for a less than 100 tracer mass recovery an assessment regarding tracer solute reactivity in the aquifer should be investigated if possible to verify the potential effects and importance of solute reactivity previous solute reactivity investigations have been primarily devoted more to porous media and fractured rock aquifers although some solute reactivity research studies in karst aquifers have been developed e g white 1997 for example dijk and berkowitz 1998 investigated the effect of precipitation and dissolution of reactive solutes in saturated fractured media based on the efforts of békri et al 1995 békri et al 1997 lowell et al 1993 and mourzenko et al 1996 although solute reactivity in karst aquifers has long been recognized as occurring few if any investigations into the supposed reactivity of anthropogenic solutes have been conducted savoy 2008 p 11 17 probably because of the complications related to conducting such an investigation sinreich 2011 as a result little if anything is known about anthropogenic solute reactivity in phreatic solution conduits savoy 2008 p 135 although some investigations into solute reactivity in karst aquifers are beginning e g faulkner et al 2009 hillebrand et al 2015 sinreich 2014 sinreich et al 2007 in an effort to better understand the reactivity in karst aquifers geyer et al 2007 conducted a multitracer test in the gallusquelle catchment situated on the swabian alb using one conservative tracer sodium fluorescein also commonly known as uranine colour index acid yellow 73 and two reactive tracers sulforhodamine g c i acid red 50 and tinopal cbs x c i fluorescent brightener 351 in which retardation effects were observed as late peak tracer arrivals of the reactive dyes relative to fluorescein later in an effort to better understand the attenuation capacity of karst aquifers hillebrand et al 2012 repeated the tracer experiments of geyer et al 2007 with fluorescein as the conservative tracer and caffeine as the reactive tracer the efforts by hillebrand et al 2012 demonstrated that pollutant attenuation rates in a karst aquifer may be more significant than is generally accepted still as noted by hillebrand et al little is known regarding the attenuation capacity of karst aquifers although the work of odutola and walsh 2002 and hillebrand et al 2014 provide some insights into the processes unfortunately as previously noted the inaccessibility of most phreatic solution conduits severely limits the extent to which the significance of solute reactions occurring within solution conduits may be evaluated and understood for this reason theoretical modeling can form an important investigative tool in understanding solute fate and transport in phreatic solution conduits the objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model that considers solute reactivity decay and transformation for an anthropogenic substance within selected portions of a solution conduit and consequent dispersion and deposition of some percentage of a newly created solute product onto conduit walls the approach is different from that of similar types of studies e g steefel and lichtner 1994 in that we focused on a phreatic solution conduit in which mineral precipitation is nonexistent sorption onto the solution conduit walls may be enhanced or reduced by specific coatings that may occur on some parts of the conduit walls it has long been known that solution conduits act as repositories for secondary deposits such as breakdown from conduit roof collapse sands silts and clays transported underground via streams sasowsky and mylroie 2007 and deposition of chemical reactants e g caco3 and raco3 due to chemical precipitation bosch and white 2007 many of these substances either precipitate or get plastered onto the walls and ceiling or get deposited on the floor of a conduit although it will be noted that mineral precipitation does not occur in perennially flooded phreatic conduits these all function to react e g sorb with other anthropogenic substances being transported into the conduit 2 theoretical concept we consider a single phreatic solution conduit with one entrance point and one resurgence point fig 1 a reactant enters the solution conduit at z 0 and is naturally transformed to some product or by reaction with some substance that is either in the water or adhering to portions of the conduit wall the substance causing the solute transformation may be biological or chemical may have entered the conduit via conduit flow or via seepage from the surrounding rock matrix transport of the solute reactant and transformed product occurs axially via advection and non fickian longitudinal dispersion and radially via a much lower dispersion from intuition we can expect radial movement of a solute or chemical component simply because they will not flow in a straight line axial direction particularly if the system has some form of packing e g a catalyst in a chemical reactor or sediment buildup in a solution conduit radial dispersion d r is used to account for the radial movement that is with a d r 2 c r 2 1 r c z the term d r is not a molecular diffusivity which is too small but rather a dispersion coefficient that fits any observations lastly the transformed product is assumed to deposit onto the conduit wall if it encounters the conduit wall deposition occurs when molecules settle out of a solution and may be regarded as the process of a coating buildup on a substrate surface by adsorptive processes deposition processes include settling and in terms of turbulent flow turbophoresis van thienen et al 2011 according to vreeburg and boxall 2007 turbophoresis is the process that describes the turbulent transportation of particles from more turbid regions to less turbid regions in a flow pattern the turbophoretic force is dependent on the gradient of turbulence over the flow profile for flow through conduits particles are transported from the bulk fluid to less turbid regions near the wall where they may become trapped in cohesive layers at higher velocities the gradient is greater because the turbulence at the pipe wall must always be zero this greater turbulent gradient results in a concomitantly greater force that drives particles from the conduit center to the wall of the conduit vreeburg and boxall further emphasize that in light of this theory it may be suggested that at a flow velocity of 0 14 m s 1 the turbophoresis force exceeds the gravitational force and causes a uniform supply of material at the conduit surface while at 0 06 m s 1 the gravity and turbophoresic forces approach equilibrium sorption specifically adsorption is the net accumulation of matter on the solid phase at an interface with an aqueous solution but also may be defined as the excess concentration of a chemical at the subsurface solid interface compared to that in the bulk solution berkowitz et al 2014 p 45 according to sinreich et al 2007 reversible sorption processes may be modeled using either an equilibrium or a kinetic approach the difficulty in terms of sorption on conduit walls is the general inability to obtain relevant samples for laboratory analyses that would verify modeling efforts as recommended by sinreich 2010 sinreich 2011 later emphasized that when reactive and or non persistent contaminants are involved transport rates and concentrations are determined by contaminant specific properties and hydrochemical characteristics rather than by the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer additional details regarding the concepts of sorption retention and release of contaminants are provided in berkowitz et al 2014 p 107 146 the model allows for consideration of laminar and turbulent flow in the positive axial direction of the conduit that is constrained within a circular cross section with radial symmetry for laminar flow conditions solute transport is considered to occur primarily in the axial direction as a function of advection and longitudinal dispersion whereas solute transport in the radial direction is limited to molecular diffusion according to fick s first law of mass diffusion however for turbulent flow conditions longitudinal dispersion behaves asymptotically in a manner similar to fickian diffusion socolofsky and jirka 2005 p 21 often termed eddy diffusion no conduit bank storage or matrix diffusion is considered because as previously demonstrated by wicks 2005 for paleozoic carbonates conduit bank storage is relatively insignificant and matrix diffusion is regarded as unimportant due to inadequate conduit surface area and inadequate contact time field and pinsky 2000 2 1 mathematical formulation for a solution conduit reactor the governing model is two dimensional in the radial r and axial z directions with time t as a third independent variable for simplification the model assumes isothermal flow constant transport coefficients parabolic radial velocity profile first order kinetics for reactant conversion and axial and radial dispersions the basic model is formulated in cylindrical coordinates and is similar to that of bobba 1989 and peterson and wicks 2005 but with some necessary differences using fig 4 as a basic guide the mathematical model describing flow and solute transport through a phreatic solution conduit appears as 1 c r t υ r c r z d r c r 2 c r r 2 1 r c r z d z 2 c r z 2 γ z t k r c r μ r c r 2 c p t υ r c p z d r c p 2 c p r 2 1 r c p z d z 2 c p z 2 k r c r μ p c p with all variables described in the notation section subscripts r and p refer to reactant and product respectively solute reactions in eqs 1 and 2 are described by a first order irreversible kinetic surface model in which the forward reaction is very strong and the reverse very weak equilibrium is reached very slowly the reaction rate used in the model is characterized by a first order kinetic rate coefficient k r that connects eq 1 with eq 2 solute reactivity is a highly complex process with numerous processes occurring at times simultaneously see for example berkowitz et al 2014 for our purposes it was necessary that solute reactivity processes be simplified complex reaction kinetics with multiple chemical species would lead to a large system of partial differential equations pdes that would be intractable to solve numerically solute decay in both eqs 1 and 2 is characterized by a first order decay coefficient μ r and μ p for the reactant and product respectively in this instance decay of a reactant may be very different from decay of a product the possibility of a point source pulse release of a reactant is determined by the function γ z t this function controls the length of time for a pulse release and both the location and distance for a pulse release the model initial conditions for eqs 1 and 2 are respectively 3 c r r z 0 c 0 0 0 z z l 0 r r 0 γ 0 c 0 0 0 z z l 0 r r 0 γ 0 and 4 c p r z 0 0 the boundary conditions for eq 1 are 5a c r r 0 t c 0 5b c r 0 z t r 0 5c c r r 0 z t r 0 5d c r r z l t t υ r c r r z

entering fluid may contain the reactant solute of concern that may also include a pulse release of the same reactant solute or the entering fluid may be initially reactant solute free but a pulse release adds the reactant solute to the entering fluid in addition eq 4 ensures an initially product solute free entering fluid eq 5a ensures that the initial concentration at z 0 to c 0 for an entering fluid with a continuous source or to 0 for a solute free entering fluid while eq 6a ensures that c p 0 at z 0 eqs 5b and 6b ensure zero radial gradients along the conduit centerline by symmetry diffusion of c r through the conduit wall i e matrix diffusion is prevented by eq 5c a time dependent boundary condition at the exit z z l for both c r and c p is provided by eqs 5d and 6d to ensure a smooth decrease in reactant and a smooth increase in product application of the more typical danckwerts boundary condition danckwerts 1953 pearson 1959 wehner and wilhelm 1956 near z z l causes the energy to pile up because mathematically the danckwerts boundary condition requires a zero slope at the downstream end of the reaction zone which is physically impossible as demonstrated by schiesser 1996 application of a danckwerts boundary condition to solute transport models with large péclet numbers p e will cause unrealistic results near z z l péclet numbers are typically quite high in phreatic solution conduits relative to transport in porous media and fractured rock aquifers field 2002 p 43 examples of typically elevated péclet numbers in solution conduits may be found in table 1 of field and pinsky 2000 the rate of deposition of c p onto the conduit wall controlled by the right side of eq 6c 7 k d 1 c p r 0 z t k d 2 and is equal to the rate of diffusion of c p to the conduit wall which is controlled by the left side of eq 6c 8 d r c p c p r 0 z t r the auxiliary function for the radial velocity profile for laminar flow is bird et al 1960 p 46 9 υ r 2 υ 1 r 2 r 0 2 and for turbulent flow may be obtained from štigler 2016 10 υ r υ 2 1 r 2 r 0 2 1 n d n 1 n 1 1 r 2 n r 0 2 n 2 n n 1 1 r 2 r 0 2 where n d represents the difference between maximal velocity and mean velocity normalized by the mean velocity which is dependent on re as re increases n d decreases and tends to zero as re the parameter n d is obtained from 11 n d 2 1 n 0 3 9 8 where n 0 may be obtained from 12 1 n 0 ln re 0 78911 1 56827 the parameter n may then be obtained from 13 n p 1 p 2 l r 0 2 4 μ υ 2 1 1 n d which when a friction factor f r is expressed for the pressure drop p 1 p 2 l may be obtained from 14 n f r re 64 1 2 1 n d efforts to obtain a theoretically derived equation for a turbulent flow profile has been elusive but the efforts of štigler 2014 2016 has resulted in the development of eqs 10 14 that this author found matches well with empirically derived equations e g eq 9 2 in mott 2006 eq 10 was selected for turbulent flow because it represents an analytical formula for the turbulent mean flow velocity profile that addresses all fluid flow regimes the viscous sublayer the log law region the overlap region and the region of core of the fluid flow many previous investigations were primarily focused on the near wall region specifically the log law region štigler 2016 rather than fluid flow regimes our reasoning was that consideration of all fluid regions would be more representative of conduit flow conditions and effects the darcy weisbach friction factor f r may be obtained by applying the lambert w function which allows for an explicit reformulation of the colebrook white equation and avoidance of the more commonly applied iterative process brkic 2012 15 f r 1 2 w ln 10 b a 2 where 16a a 2 51 re 16b b ξ 14 8 r h 16c c ln 10 2 a 10 b 2 a use of the colebrook white equation which is valid for re 4000 to estimate f r was chosen because it has been extensively investigated and is well established the absolute roughness ξ may be approximated from the manning roughness coefficient n by webber 1971 17 ξ c k n 6 in which n is assumed to represent fully rough turbulent flow when c k max 26 metcalf and vilioen 2009 for solution conduits n range phrase 0 050 10 may be considered appropriate palmer 2007 p 98 luhmann et al 2015 set ξ 21 5 as reasonably representative of roughness in solution conduits which is generally greater than most rock types but less than that of pillow lava metcalf and vilioen 2009 reaction of c r occurs along one or more selected reaches of the conduit where microbial and or chemical substances may react with c r to create c p locations where c p may be created may occur along the entire conduit length or along one or more selected reaches along the conduit length 2 2 model solution the solution of the conventional advection dispersion equation formulated in cylindrical coordinates is extremely complex as demonstrated by chen et al 2011a and chen et al 2011b for that reason eqs 1 6d were solved numerically using the numerical method of lines schiesser 1991 the partial derivatives were computed spatially and temporally for eqs 1 and 2 over a two dimensional domain using a five point centered approximation for longitudinal dispersion and a five point biased upwind approximation in the positive direction for advection schiesser 1994 p 464 468 567 for a 2 5 25 point grid silebi and schiesser 1992 p 443 with 5 points in r and 25 points in z that can easily be changed in the calculations to test spatial convergence solution of the resulting 250 ordinary differential equations odes was achieved using a fourth order runge kutta routine with an embedded modified euler method schiesser 2013 p 24 27 to check convergence in t absolute error criteria were applied to each dependent variable silebi and schiesser 1992 p 48 2 3 numerical dispersion assessment numerical approximations to for example strongly advective hyperbolic parabolic equations typical of advection dispersion problems are well known to result in some unwanted numerical dispersion pdes that are strongly convective strongly hyperbolic can propagate sharp fronts and even discontinuities which are difficult to resolve in space experience has demonstrated that for these systems some form of upwinding is generally required when replacing the spatial derivatives with algebraic approximations saucez et al 2001 upwinding may also be considered to be useful in that it is quite effective when convective velocity is not constant and that upwind differencing carries information on the structure of the solution forward in the direction of the traveling wave and thus anticipates and suppresses the growth of unwanted perturbations pozirikidis 2008 p 1032 analyses comparing upwind methods against exact solutions to pdes amenable to such have shown that for example two point upwind approximations can be problematic and that just increasing the number of points does not improve the approximations schiesser et al 1994 p 16 biasing upwind methods such as was applied in the five point biased upwind approximation used for the model described in this paper carver and hinds 1978 where biasing applies to the use of downstream and well as upstream points but with more upstream than downstream points does significantly improve the results schiesser et al 1994 p 17 pozirikidis 2008 p 1017 1080 also provides a comprehensive analysis of biased upwinding schiesser 1991 p 122 141 examined the problem of numerical dispersion in detail and noted that a combination of centered and upwind approximations would result in better approximations after careful analyses schiesser 1991 p 141 was able to note that the five point biased upwind approximations proposed by carver and hinds 1978 are quite effective when simulating convective systems modeled by first order hyperbolic pdes 3 sensitivity analysis the model allows for advective flow and longitudinal dispersion in the positive axial direction with much lower dispersion in the radial direction first order reaction and decay and solute product deposition to the conduit walls a fast flowing turbulent stream in a phreatic conduit typical of karst aquifers is the principal focus of the model the model can also account for a low velocity laminar conduit stream but such a stream is generally regarded as somewhat atypical of phreatic solution conduits penetrating karst aquifers ford and williams 1989 p 518 ford and williams 2007 p 109 basic solute reactivities involving a reactant and resulting product for differing flow regimes synthetic parameters for 10 listed in table 1 are shown in fig 2 all three flow regimes did result in some decay of the reactant and deposition of some product on the conduit wall with some longitudinal dispersion significantly turbulent flow with high axial and radial diffusivities resulted in the most longitudinal dispersion increasing transport time from 10 to 50 serves to emphasize the effect of reactivity over time with respect to the differing flow regimes listed in table 1 depicting the results as contour plots and spaciotemporal distribution plots can be helpful in illustrating increasing reactivity complexity as transport time increases fig 3 3 1 varying reactivities for a relatively low velocity laminar stream with significantly lower radial diffusivity using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersion of the solutes increases with increasing k r fig 4a c longitudinal dispersion although not very great is evident in the axial direction for a high velocity turbulent stream with relatively low axial and radial diffusivities using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersion of the solutes is similar to the laminar flow case fig 4d f axial dispersivity is more evident than for the laminar case depicted in fig 4a c most likely because axial velocity is 11 greater and diffusivity is 10 that of the laminar flow case in addition c p appears to be smoother possibly because of the more rapid transport for a high velocity turbulent stream with relatively high axial and radial diffusivities using the synthetic parameters listed in table 1 radial dispersivity of the solutes is similar to that of the turbulent flow with a lower radial diffusivities fig 4d f but with lesser radial dispersion fig 4g i axial dispersion is evident but not as much as for the turbulent flow case with lower axial and radial diffusivities the apparent decrease in radial dispersion is most likely a result of the 10 fold increase in axial diffusivity over the turbulent flow case with lower radial diffusivity and the change in diffusivity for c r and c p table 1 3 2 varying deposition rates sorption of product solute on the conduit walls is controlled by two different parameters a linear parameter k d 1 the effects of which are quite subtle and a nonlinear parameter k d 2 the effects of which are readily apparent 3 2 1 linear deposition rates the effect of linear deposition of a solute product defined by the coefficient k d 1 is shown in fig 5 as a linear reactant parameter k d 1 requires a fairly high value in order for an obvious affect to be noted as might be expected product deposition to conduit walls is most pronounced when flow is laminar and increases for all flow cases as originally listed in table 1 as k d 1 increases 3 2 2 nonlinear deposition rates nonlinear deposition of a product solute defined by the coefficient k d 2 on conduit walls is considerably more apparent than that controlled by the linear deposition coefficient fig 6 in this instance maximum deposition on conduit walls is basically equivalent for all three flow cases but more axial dispersion occurs for the two turbulent flow fig 6d i which is to be expected the other laminar flow case as originally listed in table 1 fig 6a c does not exhibit such strong axial dispersion effects because differences between axial flow and radial diffusivity are not as significant and flow velocity is much less 3 3 varying decay constants in terms of reactant solute decay effects are most pronounced when μ r is dominant fig 7a d and g as would be expected whereas product solute decay effects are not as obvious even when μ p is dominant fig 7b e and h when both μ r and μ p are active the decay effects on both the reactant and product are readily apparent fig 7c f and i again as previously observed the individual and combined effects of both μ r and μ p are most apparent when difference between axial flow and radial diffusivity are greatest fig 7d f 3 4 multiple reaction zones the effect of multiple differently spaced reaction zones separated by differently spaced nonreaction zones was also found to affect solute migration and reaction turbulent with relatively high axial and radial diffusivities with multiple reaction zones as originally listed in table 1 fig 8 a depicts a single reaction zone fig 8 b depicts two reaction zones z r fig 8 c depicts three reaction zones z r fig 8 d depicts four reaction zones z r and fig 8 e depicts five reaction zones z r all with a nonvarying reactivity coefficient k r 0 03 from fig 8 it is evident that reaction zones separated by a relatively smaller nonreaction zone results in enhanced reactivity and enhanced axial dispersivity but separation of reaction zones by a somewhat wider nonreaction zone has less effect on the extent of reactivity in the subsequent reaction zone 4 application to a mildly reactive tracer dye during the mid 1980s the u s geological survey conducted a series of quantitative tracer tests in the dyers spring drainage basin located in the elizabethtown area of north central kentucky mull et al 1988a b additional tracer tests were conducted in the 1990s taylor 1997 dyers spring is a rise pit that discharges on the east bank about 31 from valley creek the rise pit and the channel draining to valley creek were reported to be about 3 below the surrounding land surface at the time of the 1980s tracer tests mull et al 1988b p 18 the seven tracer tests reported in mull et al 1988b were initiated at a karst window approximately 914 upstream of dyers spring on a straight line distance mull et al 1988b p 58 but which is more correctly taken to be approximately 1372 from dyers spring when a sinuosity factor of 1 5 is applied to the straight line distance field 2002 p 34 at the karst window a spring or stream emerges at the upper end of the sinkhole flows about 76 and drains into a swallow hole at the lower end of the sinkhole the karst window receives relatively little runoff because of the small area that drains directly into the karst window mull et al 1988b p 18 19 a detailed description of the seven tracer tests conducted in the dyers spring drainage basin is provided in mull et al 1988b p 58 59 the quantitative tracer tests conducted by the u s geological survey used rhodamine wt c i acid red 388 mull et al 1988b p 41 which has an estimated log kow 3 71 as calculated using the epi suite program us epa 2012 although smart 1984 reported a log kow 1 33 such very low log kow estimates suggests retardation effects caused by deposition would be minimal but this has not always been the case rhodamine wt has been identified as being problematic for quantitative tracer studies see for example runkel 2015 and references therein even so successful quantitative traces appear to have mostly been obtained by mullsl88 individual breakthrough curves btcs for the seven tracer tests conducted by mullsl88 are shown in fig 9 the seven btcs depicted in fig 9 emphasize the varying transport rates that occurred as a result of differing hydrologic conditions during the tracer tests table 2 lists the dates of tracer release dye masses released masses recovered and travel times for each of the seven tracer tests tracer recoveries varied from a low of 55 mass recovered to a high of 172 mass recovered mass recoveries that are significantly different from that which was released are often attributed to errors in discharge measurements but other factors may be important as well for example under high flow conditions low mass recoveries could be a result of significant quantities of tracer mass being shunted to transient high level overflow springs white 2018 that may not have been monitored during the tracer test alternatively excessively high tracer mass recoveries could be a result of detecting similar compounds without applying necessary chemical separation techniques to the samples for example although not used for the quantitative tracer tests automobile antifreeze and sodium fluorescein dye which was used by the u s geological survey for conducting qualitative tracer tests mull et al 1988b p 35 are difficult to separate from each other resolution of tracer discrepancies is recognized as an inexact science at best because complexities caused by numerous natural and anthropogenic occurring fluorophores in the environment are to be expected brown 2009 travel times for the seven tracer tests listed in table 1 varied significantly depending on the time of year see fig 9 as would be expected late winter and early spring resulted in the earlier travel times faster velocities and higher mass recoveries while subsequent months exhibited later travel times slower velocities and lower mass recoveries the greater than 100 mass recoveries for the tracer tests listed in table 2 were reported to be a result of inaccurate stage measurements at dyers spring during the high flow conditions mull et al 1988b p 31 the same could be said for the less than 100 tracer mass recoveries for the other tracer tests 4 1 degradation of rhodamine wt for this study the tracer test initiated on may 30 1985 trace 20 in table 2 fig 9 was taken as an example of a tracer test with a low mass recovery that was similar to the even poorer mass recovery for the tracer test conducted seven days earlier may 23 1985 table 2 contrary to the common assumption that the poor mass recoveries were due either to errors in discharge measurements or tracer discharge at unmonitored locations this study assumes that the tracer dye rhodamine wt reacts with some unknown reacting substance in the solution conduit the net effect is that the rhodamine wt is sufficiently altered such that the basic rhodamine wt becomes what is commonly known as deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt with properties that are quite different from rhodamine wt such as excitation and emission wavelengths hoffman et al 2007 p 40 although the rates and extent of deaminoalkylation are still not fully understood field 2005 typically most tracer dyes decompose by chemical degradation photodegradation and biochemical degradation flury and wai 2003 deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt was not addressed in runkel 2015 flury and wai 2003 or other studies on the reactivity of rhodamine wt even though deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt is a recognized process related to rhodamine wt idstein and ewers 2002 albeit a poorly understood process the process of deaminoalkylation is believed to affect most if not all rhodamines käß 1998 p 34 glenn et al 2013 p 4 37 4 38 and is thought to be a result of a pseudomonas bacteria scavenging amine groups from the rhodamine molecule gareth davies pers comm but this remains speculative field 2005 most dyes are xenobiotic because they are generally manufactured to resist biodegradation flury and wai 2003 so the possibility of bacteria scavenging the amine groups may not be a dominant process the assumption that pseudomonas bacteria were washed into the solution conduit that connects the upgradient karst window used for tracer injection with dyers spring attacked the injected rhodamine wt and significantly degraded it with a consequent 37 tracer mass loss may be regarded as reasonable unfortunately there appears to be a dearth of published research on deaminoalkylation of rhodamine wt most studies focused on the reactivity of rhodamine wt are concerned primarily with photodecay keefe et al 2004 tai and rathbun 1988 deposition bencala et al 1983 lin et al 2003 russell et al 2004 and the effects caused by the two separate isomers that make up commercially available rhodamine wt sabatini and austin 1991 shiau et al 1993 sutton et al 2001 vasudevan et al 2001 although it could be argued that deaminoalkylation is just as important a process alternatively there are some indications of metabolizing of fluorescent tracer dyes such as rhodamine wt when in contact with other chemicals leibundgut et al 2009 p 85 so it is possible that reactions with an entering chemical substance caused a decrease in recovered rhodamine wt mass by chemical reaction it was noted by leibundgut et al that such chemical reactions were determined to have occurred during long term experiments however the length of time for a long term experiment was not defined and the process so poorly understood that it may generally be accepted that rhodamine wt degradation may begin at any time and can progress at any rate or varying rates after tracer injection 4 2 modeling the reactivity of rhodamine wt the 37 loss of rhodamine wt mass for the may 30 1985 tracer test may have been due to some sort of reaction the reactivity model developed in this paper considers the conversion of rhodamine wt to a different compound i e deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt that is then either sorbed to the conduit walls decays through some process e g microbial or gets discharged at dyers spring table 3 lists the model parameters used to assess the possible reactivity resulting in the new compound most of the parameters listed in table 3 are relatively straightforward and were either known a priori e g tracer mass calculated from the results of the tracer test e g r 0 or taken from the literature e g d r c r other values were estimated from the available parameters e g re the reaction zone z r was assumed to range from 200 m 400 m although no evidence is available for arbitrarily determining the size of the reaction zone it may reasonably be assumed that the reaction did not immediately begin upon dye entrance into the phreatic conduit and that the reaction ceased somewhere along the conduit before the resurgence the reaction rate constant k r was arbitrarily set to 0 01 h 1 on the assumption that rhodamine wt reactivity would probably be fairly low decay rates for the reactant solute μ r and the product solute μ p were arbitrarily set to 0 001 h 1 and 0 002 h 1 respectively a comparison of the model results with the measured may 30 1985 btc are shown in fig 10 the apparent match of model results to the measured btc may be regarded as reasonable because most of the parameters listed in table 3 are very similar to those obtained from analyses using the qtracer2 program field 2002 and the cxtfit2 program field and pinsky 2000 toride et al 1993 1995 statistical measures of model fit to measured data are shown in table 4 most commonly the pearson correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r 2 are used to assess model fit to measured data but are regarded as being rather poor statistics press et al 1992 p 630 in some instances nonparametric rank correlation e g spearman rank order correlation coefficient r s and kendall rank order correlation coefficient τ may provide better assessments of model fit to measured data press et al 1992 p 633 637 alternatively other measures designed to assess model fit to measured data e g nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr are sometimes recommended for hydrologic studies moriasi et al 2007 as can be noted in fig 10 that for the first 10 h of time measured rhodamine wt concentrations equaled 0 0 μg l 1 suggesting a departure from normality and thus necessitating the need to consider alternative statistical measures on correlation in addition to pearson as is apparent in table 4 each of the various statistical measures all suggest a high degree of confidence of the model fit to the measured data correlation coefficients r r s and τ with probability calculations all strongly support the hypothesis that the model and data are highly correlated unlike pearson coefficient of determination r 2 it isn t customary to report the coefficients of determination for spearman and kendall r s 2 and τ 2 respectively they both represent the proportion of shared variance in the two ranked variables and all three suggest a high degree of correlation the additional measures of fit shown in table 4 nse rsr and pbias also suggest a high degree of correlation although pbias 0 0 would be preferable the effect of decreasing rhodamine wt concentration and increasing deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt concentration are shown in fig 11 figs 11a and reffig rwtdecrease increase b are two dimensional plots of the solutes as they migrate along the conduit with the reaction zone depicted and figs 11 c and reffig rwtdecrease increase d are three dimensional plots of the solutes as they migrate along the conduit in which the time of travel in relation to the distance traveled is also included from fig 11 it is apparent that the specified reaction zone 200 m 400 m significantly affects the solutes by accelerating the decrease in rhodamine wt and the increase in deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt once past the reaction zone the rates of change are less pronounced the spatiotemporal distribution of the rhodamine wt reactant solute and deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt product solute are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively figs 12 and 13 allow for a more clear visualization of the two solutes in the solution conduits over the approximately 37 h of transport time for the rhodamine wt solute a small quantity of the solute migrates radially to the conduit walls at early times fig 11 a e but starting about 18 h after tracer release radial migration of the rhodamine wt becomes much more apparent fig 11 f l for the deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt solute a relatively small quantity of the solute is evident very soon after tracer release and slowly increases for several hours fig 13 a f however about 21 h after tracer release much more significant increases in deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt becomes apparent but stabilizes at about 24 h fig 13 g l 5 concluding remarks a two dimensional mathematical model for solute reactivity in a phreatic solution conduit was presented and solved numerically assumptions used in the model were isothermal flow constant transport properties parabolic velocity profile first order kinetics for reactant conversion radial diffusion and axial dispersion sorption of the solute product created by reaction of the entering solute onto the conduit wall controlled by two deposition rate constants was assumed to be equal to solute product diffusion rate simulations showed that the first order rate coefficient was the dominant factor affecting the concentrations for both the entering solute and the product solute created by the reaction axial velocity and longitudinal dispersion was shown to be capable of causing both the entering solute and some of the product solute to migrate to the downstream resurgence multiple reaction zones separated by nonreaction zones were affected by reactions in earlier reaction zones as a result of the longitudinal dispersion when flow in the axial direction was turbulent varying deposition coefficients only minimally affected radial dispersion and deposition onto conduit walls during laminar conditions and were found to have virtually no affect for turbulent conditions but varying reaction rate constants strongly affected concentrations application of the model to a well known tracer test conducted in a karst aquifer in the 1980s showed how the poor mass recovery of just 63 could have been a result of conversion of the tracer dye rhodamine wt to deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt such a conversion is a recognized but poorly understood process the model showed that as the reacting solute rhodamine wt migrated the axial distance over time concentration of the rhodamine wt continued to decrease through the zone of reactivity while the concentration of the produced solute deaminolakylated rhodamine wt continued to increase the rate of rhodamine wt concentration decrease was more rapid and greater than the rate and magnitude of increase of deaminoalkylated rhodamine wt however averaging the concentrations across the radius of the phreatic solution conduit showed greater radial variations associated with the deaminoalkylated

1642,industrial use has led to the presence of liquid elemental mercury hg0 worldwide in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl resulting in long lasting sources of contamination which cause harmful effects on human health and detrimental consequences on ecosystems however to date insight into the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury dnapl is lacking in this study a two stage flow container experiment of elemental mercury dnapl infiltration into a variably water saturated stratified sand is described during the first stage of the experiment 16 3 ml of liquid hg0 infiltrated and distributed into an initially partially water saturated system afterwards during the second stage of the experiment consisting of the simulation of a rain event to assess whether the elemental mercury already infiltrated could be mobilized due to local increases in water saturation a significant additional infiltration of 4 7 ml of liquid mercury occurred from the remaining dnapl source the experiment showed that under conditions similar to those found in the field hg0 dnapl infiltration is likely to occur via fingers and is strongly controlled by porous medium structure and water saturation heterogeneities within the porous medium likely determined preferential pathways for liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution as also suggested by dual gamma ray measurements overall this study highlights that the infiltration behaviour of mercury dnapl is strongly impacted by water saturation in the field this may result in a preferential infiltration of hg0 dnapl in wetter areas or in its mobilization due to wetting during a rain event as indicated by this study or a groundwater table rise this should be considered when assessing the likely distribution pathways of historic mercury dnapl contamination as well as the remediation efforts keywords elemental mercury dnapl unsaturated multiphase flow dual gamma ray 1 introduction mercury is a contaminant of global concern as it causes harmful effects on human health and detrimental consequences on ecosystems us epa 2007 world chlorine council 2011 as a result of natural processes and anthropogenic activities mercury is ubiquitous in the environment risher 2003 mercury release in ecosystems can result from a variety of anthropogenic sources like mercury mining unep 2002 mercury amalgamation for gold and silver mining lechler et al 2000 unep 2002 hylander and meili 2003 and from industrial activities such as wood preservation bollen et al 2008 chlor alkali facilities and thermometer manufacturing plants biester et al 2002 hylander and meili 2003 bernaus et al 2006 arbestain et al 2009 brooks and southworth 2011 miller et al 2013 in particular the chlor alkali industry is among the principal appliers of mercury as well as the most important producer of wastes containing mercury pirrone et al 2010 in 1996 almost 40 of the mercury produced in the world was used in the chlor alkali industry sznopek and goonan 2000 in recent years efforts have been made to control and further reduce mercury emissions into the environment and legislative texts and government policies like the united nations environmental programme unep global mercury convention minamata convention on mercury 2013 are restricting its industrial use nicole 2015 the occurrence of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl has been reported worldwide in proximity of several chlor alkali plants like in lavaca bay texas usa scanlon et al 2005 near the onondaga lake new york usa where it was found 17 m below the ground level deeb et al 2011 itrc 2012 at the oak ridge y 12 national security complex tennessee usa where the estimated loss of liquid hg0 to the soil is about 193 000 kg brooks and southworth 2011 at the botany industrial park sydney australia golder associates 2011 and at a former plant in the netherlands sweijen et al 2014 once hg0 dnapl infiltrates in the subsurface and immobilizes it acts as a long lasting source of mercury contamination davis et al 1997 in addition liquid mercury may be subjected to speciation leterme and jacques 2013 gonzález fernández et al 2014 leterme et al 2014 and methylation compeau and bartha 1985 gilmour et al 1992 thus releasing in the water phase organic and inorganic mercury compounds that are more toxic mobile and soluble than hg0 itself furthermore the volatilization of liquid elemental mercury also contributes to the spread of mercury through the environment walvoord et al 2008 despite the worldwide importance and presence of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface only recently its dnapl behaviour in porous media has been addressed as for more extensively studied dnapls such as creosote carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce liquid elemental mercury requires to overcome an entry head to infiltrate in fully water saturated porous media devasena and nambi 2010 and it has a relatively high capacity to infiltrate as illustrated by numerical simulations sweijen et al 2014 d aniello et al 2018b and by capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments under stable flow behaviour d aniello et al 2018a however in contrast with other dnapls liquid elemental mercury was found to behave as a nonwetting phase with respect to both air and water and therefore it requires to overcome an entry head to infiltrate in partially water saturated porous media d aniello et al 2018a moreover as shown by pc s experiments performed under stable flow behaviour d aniello et al 2018a liquid elemental mercury entry head in partially water saturated porous media is even higher than for fully water saturated conditions in the field however infiltration of elemental mercury dnapl is expected to occur under unstable flow behaviour therefore this study focussed on exploring the unstable flow behaviour of elemental mercury dnapl in variably water saturated porous media to this aim a two stage flow container experiment in a variably water saturated stratified sand was performed to allow a quantitative analysis of hg0 dnapl infiltration and distribution behaviour non intrusive measurements of porosity water and hg0 saturations were performed with a dual gamma ray apparatus 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media and fluids filtersand 0 2 0 5 mm and silversand s60 filcom sibelco group 2015 were used as granular materials based on wentworth classification 1922 the two sands are classified as medium sands and will be referred to as medium sand 1 ms1 and medium sand 2 ms2 for both sands the intrinsic permeability table 1 was obtained experimentally d aniello et al 2018a by means of the falling head method bear 1972 demineralized water was used as the wetting fluid and 99 9 redistilled liquid elemental mercury hg0 alfa aesar was used as the nonwetting fluid table 2 elemental mercury entry heads for fully and partially water saturated systems table 3 were derived with the graphical method sillers et al 2001 pasha et al 2015 based on the capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments performed under stable flow behaviour described in d aniello et al 2018a 2 2 flow container experiment the hg0 dnapl infiltration experiment was performed in a poly methyl methacrylate pmma flow container fig 1 the walls thickness was specifically designed and set to 1 5 cm to prevent any deformations in addition the back and front walls were layered with a glass plate of 0 5 cm resulting in an inner thickness of the container of 3 95 cm pmma and glass were chosen as liquid hg0 is nonwetting with respect to these materials to maintain constant air pressure within the container the pmma lid put on the top of the container was constructed with a ventilation hole the flow container was mainly filled with ms1 and to study the effects of macro heterogeneities on hg0 migration a layer of 5 cm height of ms2 was located 9 cm from the top of the upper ms1 layer fig 1 resulting in a total height of the system of 25 cm two pmma inlet walls of 1 cm thickness were added to create an undisturbed location for the liquid hg0 reservoir to avoid relative displacements between the two screens and to fix them at the desired distance the inlet walls were hooked on the front walls of the container and were equipped with a series of adjustable screws the two inlet walls were placed 2 5 cm deep from the top of the upper ms1 layer in the middle of the container with a spacing of 1 5 cm the sand in the container was packed under water saturated conditions to avoid any entrapped air between the sand particles the flow container was initially filled halfway with water and then after having thoroughly mixed the sand with water in another container the sand was gradually poured into the flow container to maintain a fully water saturated system during packing a water head over the top layer of the sand was kept at all times at each filling step each sand layer was tamped in the same manner to compact the porous medium to prevent accumulation of sand in the bottom valve a nylon filter was put in the bottom port to create partially water saturated conditions in the sand filled container the system was drained from the bottom after having allowed the water phase to achieve an equilibrium configuration 24 h after the partial drainage of the system a trench of 1 5 cm width and 6 cm depth with vertical walls was carefully excavated between the inlet screens fig 1 right thus creating additional space for the hg0 dnapl reservoir this made it possible to observe whether hg0 lateral spreading from the reservoir would occur the flow container experiment consisted of two stages in the first stage liquid hg0 was carefully added in the trench in five steps of about 9 2 ml each until the dnapl built enough head to infiltrate and migrate within the partially water saturated system the second stage of the experiment consisted of the simulation of a rain event to assess whether the elemental mercury already infiltrated within the system could be mobilized due to local increases in water saturation the rain event lasted 40 min and was performed by pouring water on top of the upper ms1 layer with two sources of 2 5 ml min each placed in the middle of each portion outside the inlet walls fig 1 during the entire experiment the hg0 level in the reservoir and its infiltration front were tracked with a camera to determine its infiltration rate and its position over time within the system visual and camera observations allowed to determine when hg0 migration ceased and equilibrium was achieved equilibrium was assumed when no visible changes in the hg0 front were noticeable in the recorded images 2 3 porosity and fluid saturations measurements non intrusive measurements of porosity water and hg0 saturations were performed over the whole system with a dual gamma ray apparatus d aniello 2017 d aniello et al 2018b consisting of two radioactive sources namely americium 241 241am and cesium 137 137cs and a sodium iodide nai detector the measurements were made over a regular grid of 632 points with 1 cm spacing the porosity field was measured first at the end of the packing procedure when the system was fully water saturated then when the system was drained the initial water saturation distribution was determined after the trench excavation liquid hg0 and water saturation profiles were measured 24 h after the end of each experimental stage sec 2 2 established when there was no further change in the liquid hg0 level in the trench 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow container experiment stage 1 during the first stage of the flow container experiment liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution occurred in the partially water saturated stratified sand under an observed dnapl head of 7 76 cm infiltration of hg0 took place directly at the bottom of the trench with no evidence of lateral spreading until the ms2 layer was encountered a volume of 16 3 ml of elemental mercury infiltrated within the system infiltration stopped after 50 9 h 3054 min and the hg0 level in the reservoir reached the final value of 5 cm the hg0 inflow rate did not show a clear trend over time fig 2 other than highest infiltration rates occurring in the first 2 h as observed for the infiltration of other dnapls kueper and gerhard 1995 the fluctuations reported in the elemental mercury inflow rate were likely induced by the heterogeneities present within the porous formation another factor that probably increased these variations was the spatial and temporal variability of the water saturation field as hg0 infiltrated and distributed within the system d aniello et al 2018a observed that hg0 migration in partially water saturated porous media is followed by a redistribution of water within the pores hence of air as elemental mercury is nonwetting with respect to air the variation over time of the air saturation within the pores probably affected hg0 migration as well as its infiltration pattern infiltration of liquid hg0 into ms1 occurred when raising the dnapl level in the trench from 6 21 cm to 7 76 cm this is significantly lower 25 7 40 6 than the dnapl entry head of 10 45 cm table 3 d aniello et al 2018a observed in the pc s experiment under stable flow behaviour for this sand moreover this lower entry head occurred despite both average porosity 0 344 and water saturation 0 240 in the first centimetre beneath the trench were about 4 and 2 5 times lower than in the pc s experiment a reduction in porosity hence likely in intrinsic permeability and in water saturation would be expected to yield higher rather than lower entry heads probably hg0 infiltrated thanks to the presence of locally larger pores but its migration through the upper layer of ms1 was possible because of the triggering of gravity induced instabilities like fingering homsy 1987 kueper and frind 1988 illangasekare et al 1995a 1995b mayer and hassanizadeh 2005 initially the static dnapl head available in the trench was sufficient to allow hg0 to overcome the entry head dictated by the locally present heterogeneities and the effect of gravity likely induced an infiltration through preferential pathways rather than through a uniform front visual observations further suggested this indicating that at least two fingers might have developed fig 3 integration of dual gamma ray measurements over the 2 cm below the reservoir may also help suggesting this hypothesis at the end of the first stage of the experiment only 2 of the total pore volume in the 2 cm below the reservoir was occupied by liquid mercury based on a measured average porosity of 0 345 and a liquid hg0 volume of about 0 08 ml therefore based on such a small volume it is likely that hg0 migration occurred through preferential pathways since lateral spreading occurred on top of ms2 elemental mercury was also likely continuous beneath the reservoir thus providing a connection with the dnapl source in the trench elemental mercury reached the top of the ms2 layer in about 9 min when a volume of 0 79 ml of liquid hg0 had infiltrated based on the measured inflow rate fig 2 the dual gamma ray measurements figs 4 and 8 performed at the end of the first stage of the experiment indicated that 0 69 ml of liquid hg0 infiltrated in the first 3 cm beneath the trench the comparison of the volume obtained by integration of the dual gamma ray measurements with that calculated based on the measured inflow rate suggests that in the first 3 cm below the dnapl reservoir most of the elemental mercury infiltrated in the first minutes of the experiment and that no significant changes were observed at later times therefore once mercury found a pathway from the dnapl source in the trench down to the bottom of the upper ms1 layer all the additional infiltrated hg0 probably migrated through this pathway before distributing on top of the ms2 layer including the 3 cm of dnapl head below the bottom of the trench fig 3 the total liquid hg0 head on top of the ms2 layer was at maximum 10 5 cm according to the mercury level in the reservoir fig 2 however this head was not sufficient to allow liquid hg0 to penetrate ms2 this is in keeping with the higher entry heads found under stable flow behaviour for hg0 in this sand table 3 d aniello et al 2018a in both fully 12 51 cm and partially water saturated conditions 15 74 cm no infiltration via fingers occurred in ms2 as its narrower particle size distribution and lower particles sizes than ms1 table 1 likely prevented mercury from invading even a single pore of this layer therefore elemental mercury found easier pathways to continue its infiltration into the upper ms1 layer thus distributing on top of the ms2 layer once mercury reached the top of ms2 it created a pool of about 1 cm height elemental mercury distribution over ms2 was not symmetric figs 6 and 7 and the infiltration front was initially faster on the left side because of the higher porosity hence higher intrinsic permeability found fig 4 since water saturation was practically the same in the first 6 7 cm on both sides of the lateral spreading zone above ms2 fig 5 this trend reversed after 30 min fig 7 because of the lower water saturation found at the left side fig 5 as a result of the higher porosity fig 4 the larger the pores the lower the entry head so air easily filled this part of the system thus locally dampening the infiltration as hg0 is nonwetting with respect to air and is required to overcome higher entry heads due to its presence table 3 d aniello et al 2018a then at about 42 min the infiltration temporarily ceased on the right side even though the water saturation was nearly the same at the hg0 front locations and the higher porosity on the left side allowed liquid mercury to infiltrate easier and faster through this part of the system fig 7 therefore the effect induced by the heterogeneity of the porous medium structure likely prevailed in determining a preferential pathway for liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution the inspection of fig 8 further suggests this thus showing a tendency of liquid hg0 to migrate towards the left side of the container where porosity was the highest 0 392 above the ms2 layer as well as the hg0 saturation 0 615 and the height of the dnapl pool increased to 2 cm 3 2 flow container experiment stage 2 rain event the second stage of the flow container experiment consisted of the simulation of a rain event to test whether redistribution of the liquid hg0 present within the system could be induced by local increases in water saturation the increase in water saturation of the system induced the infiltration of a significant additional volume of 4 7 ml of elemental mercury for a total of 21 ml infiltration stopped after 35 h 2100 min and the hg0 level in the trench reached the final value of 4 2 cm fig 9 the mobilization of the liquid hg0 present within the system occurred at the end of the rain event after 40 min when the additional water infiltrated from the top almost completely saturated the ms1 layer above ms2 fig 10 during stage 2 the infiltration of elemental mercury mostly occurred in the first 40 min following the end of the rain event fig 9 in this time interval the hg0 inflow rate reached its maximum value 0 592 10 1 ml min fig 9 of about half of the maximum rate measured during stage 1 0 116 ml min fig 2 but of about one order of magnitude higher than the average inflow rate of stage 1 0 536 10 2 ml min fig 9 both inflow rate and dnapl level in the trench showed a stepwise pattern over time fig 9 with large time intervals where no or negligible liquid hg0 infiltration occurred this may be explained based on the time required for water to redistribute within the system as water slowly imbibed the pores a displacement of air occurred allowing further elemental mercury infiltration the mobilization of elemental mercury was likely dictated by the local increase of the water saturation up to values near to unity fig 10 since the hg0 entry head is lower in a fully rather than in a partially water saturated porous medium table 3 d aniello et al 2018a dual gamma ray measurements showed no considerable changes in the shape of the hg0 front at the end of stage 2 fig 11 compared to the final distribution at the end of stage 1 fig 8 the additional volume of elemental mercury mainly moved within the areas of the system where it already infiltrated before the rain event stage 1 thus locally increasing the dnapl saturation fig 11 as for the first stage of the experiment the heterogeneity in the porosity field hence in the intrinsic permeability field likely had a crucial role in determining the hg0 redistribution pathway liquid mercury mainly moved towards the left side of the system where porosity was the highest above ms2 fig 4 in particular hg0 reached a saturation almost equal to unity in the left side of the system fig 11 as confirmed by the visual observation of a local thickening of its redistribution front fig 12 these last experimental results provide evidence that if liquid hg0 infiltration occurs within a partially water saturated system in contrast with other napls yang et al 2013 the extent and the magnitude of its migration can considerably increase when the water saturation increases and reaches values near to unity for example if hg0 dnapl is present in a ditch or in wastes buried in the unsaturated zone an increase in the water saturation induced by a groundwater table rise prolonged and intense rains or flooding may cause elemental mercury to remobilize and infiltrate deeper in the subsurface moreover if the mercury dnapl is still connected within the porous formation with the original source of contamination from which it infiltrated it has a head and volume contribution readily available to feed further infiltration once the water saturation increases where the hg0 infiltration front previously stopped and reached equilibrium this study further enforces the previous findings of d aniello et al 2018a stressing the importance of the effects of the variation in water saturation on hg0 dnapl infiltration and distribution in variably water saturated porous media thanks to its extraordinary high surface tension table 2 liquid elemental mercury shows a different infiltration and distribution behaviour with respect to well known dnapls and the conventional wettability hierarchy in which the napl is intermediate wetting between air and water cannot stand for elemental mercury therefore more physical knowledge is required to formulate a new constitutive model able to describe elemental mercury dnapl infiltration and distribution behaviour in variably water saturated porous media in particular experimental investigations at the pore level would be beneficial to assess whether a wettability hierarchy exists between liquid hg0 air and water and what happens when these three phases interact between each other within a porous medium 4 conclusions the flow container experiment presented in this study demonstrated that under conditions similar to those found in the field hg0 dnapl infiltration is likely to occur via fingers and is strongly controlled by porous medium structure and water saturation as elemental mercury is nonwetting with respect to air the presence of air within the pores locally dampened its infiltration and distribution however the effect induced by the heterogeneity of the porous medium structure likely prevailed in determining a preferential pathway for liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution dual gamma ray measurements further suggested this as elemental mercury was found in higher saturations where porosity was higher the experiment further showed that if liquid hg0 infiltration occurs within a partially water saturated system the extent and the magnitude of its migration can considerably increase when the water saturation increases up to values near to unity and the mercury dnapl already infiltrated is still connected with the original source of contamination in field scenarios a groundwater table rise prolonged and intense rains or flooding may cause elemental mercury to remobilize and infiltrate deeper if it is present in

1642,industrial use has led to the presence of liquid elemental mercury hg0 worldwide in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl resulting in long lasting sources of contamination which cause harmful effects on human health and detrimental consequences on ecosystems however to date insight into the infiltration behaviour of elemental mercury dnapl is lacking in this study a two stage flow container experiment of elemental mercury dnapl infiltration into a variably water saturated stratified sand is described during the first stage of the experiment 16 3 ml of liquid hg0 infiltrated and distributed into an initially partially water saturated system afterwards during the second stage of the experiment consisting of the simulation of a rain event to assess whether the elemental mercury already infiltrated could be mobilized due to local increases in water saturation a significant additional infiltration of 4 7 ml of liquid mercury occurred from the remaining dnapl source the experiment showed that under conditions similar to those found in the field hg0 dnapl infiltration is likely to occur via fingers and is strongly controlled by porous medium structure and water saturation heterogeneities within the porous medium likely determined preferential pathways for liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution as also suggested by dual gamma ray measurements overall this study highlights that the infiltration behaviour of mercury dnapl is strongly impacted by water saturation in the field this may result in a preferential infiltration of hg0 dnapl in wetter areas or in its mobilization due to wetting during a rain event as indicated by this study or a groundwater table rise this should be considered when assessing the likely distribution pathways of historic mercury dnapl contamination as well as the remediation efforts keywords elemental mercury dnapl unsaturated multiphase flow dual gamma ray 1 introduction mercury is a contaminant of global concern as it causes harmful effects on human health and detrimental consequences on ecosystems us epa 2007 world chlorine council 2011 as a result of natural processes and anthropogenic activities mercury is ubiquitous in the environment risher 2003 mercury release in ecosystems can result from a variety of anthropogenic sources like mercury mining unep 2002 mercury amalgamation for gold and silver mining lechler et al 2000 unep 2002 hylander and meili 2003 and from industrial activities such as wood preservation bollen et al 2008 chlor alkali facilities and thermometer manufacturing plants biester et al 2002 hylander and meili 2003 bernaus et al 2006 arbestain et al 2009 brooks and southworth 2011 miller et al 2013 in particular the chlor alkali industry is among the principal appliers of mercury as well as the most important producer of wastes containing mercury pirrone et al 2010 in 1996 almost 40 of the mercury produced in the world was used in the chlor alkali industry sznopek and goonan 2000 in recent years efforts have been made to control and further reduce mercury emissions into the environment and legislative texts and government policies like the united nations environmental programme unep global mercury convention minamata convention on mercury 2013 are restricting its industrial use nicole 2015 the occurrence of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl has been reported worldwide in proximity of several chlor alkali plants like in lavaca bay texas usa scanlon et al 2005 near the onondaga lake new york usa where it was found 17 m below the ground level deeb et al 2011 itrc 2012 at the oak ridge y 12 national security complex tennessee usa where the estimated loss of liquid hg0 to the soil is about 193 000 kg brooks and southworth 2011 at the botany industrial park sydney australia golder associates 2011 and at a former plant in the netherlands sweijen et al 2014 once hg0 dnapl infiltrates in the subsurface and immobilizes it acts as a long lasting source of mercury contamination davis et al 1997 in addition liquid mercury may be subjected to speciation leterme and jacques 2013 gonzález fernández et al 2014 leterme et al 2014 and methylation compeau and bartha 1985 gilmour et al 1992 thus releasing in the water phase organic and inorganic mercury compounds that are more toxic mobile and soluble than hg0 itself furthermore the volatilization of liquid elemental mercury also contributes to the spread of mercury through the environment walvoord et al 2008 despite the worldwide importance and presence of liquid elemental mercury in the subsurface only recently its dnapl behaviour in porous media has been addressed as for more extensively studied dnapls such as creosote carbon tetrachloride trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce liquid elemental mercury requires to overcome an entry head to infiltrate in fully water saturated porous media devasena and nambi 2010 and it has a relatively high capacity to infiltrate as illustrated by numerical simulations sweijen et al 2014 d aniello et al 2018b and by capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments under stable flow behaviour d aniello et al 2018a however in contrast with other dnapls liquid elemental mercury was found to behave as a nonwetting phase with respect to both air and water and therefore it requires to overcome an entry head to infiltrate in partially water saturated porous media d aniello et al 2018a moreover as shown by pc s experiments performed under stable flow behaviour d aniello et al 2018a liquid elemental mercury entry head in partially water saturated porous media is even higher than for fully water saturated conditions in the field however infiltration of elemental mercury dnapl is expected to occur under unstable flow behaviour therefore this study focussed on exploring the unstable flow behaviour of elemental mercury dnapl in variably water saturated porous media to this aim a two stage flow container experiment in a variably water saturated stratified sand was performed to allow a quantitative analysis of hg0 dnapl infiltration and distribution behaviour non intrusive measurements of porosity water and hg0 saturations were performed with a dual gamma ray apparatus 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media and fluids filtersand 0 2 0 5 mm and silversand s60 filcom sibelco group 2015 were used as granular materials based on wentworth classification 1922 the two sands are classified as medium sands and will be referred to as medium sand 1 ms1 and medium sand 2 ms2 for both sands the intrinsic permeability table 1 was obtained experimentally d aniello et al 2018a by means of the falling head method bear 1972 demineralized water was used as the wetting fluid and 99 9 redistilled liquid elemental mercury hg0 alfa aesar was used as the nonwetting fluid table 2 elemental mercury entry heads for fully and partially water saturated systems table 3 were derived with the graphical method sillers et al 2001 pasha et al 2015 based on the capillary pressure saturation pc s experiments performed under stable flow behaviour described in d aniello et al 2018a 2 2 flow container experiment the hg0 dnapl infiltration experiment was performed in a poly methyl methacrylate pmma flow container fig 1 the walls thickness was specifically designed and set to 1 5 cm to prevent any deformations in addition the back and front walls were layered with a glass plate of 0 5 cm resulting in an inner thickness of the container of 3 95 cm pmma and glass were chosen as liquid hg0 is nonwetting with respect to these materials to maintain constant air pressure within the container the pmma lid put on the top of the container was constructed with a ventilation hole the flow container was mainly filled with ms1 and to study the effects of macro heterogeneities on hg0 migration a layer of 5 cm height of ms2 was located 9 cm from the top of the upper ms1 layer fig 1 resulting in a total height of the system of 25 cm two pmma inlet walls of 1 cm thickness were added to create an undisturbed location for the liquid hg0 reservoir to avoid relative displacements between the two screens and to fix them at the desired distance the inlet walls were hooked on the front walls of the container and were equipped with a series of adjustable screws the two inlet walls were placed 2 5 cm deep from the top of the upper ms1 layer in the middle of the container with a spacing of 1 5 cm the sand in the container was packed under water saturated conditions to avoid any entrapped air between the sand particles the flow container was initially filled halfway with water and then after having thoroughly mixed the sand with water in another container the sand was gradually poured into the flow container to maintain a fully water saturated system during packing a water head over the top layer of the sand was kept at all times at each filling step each sand layer was tamped in the same manner to compact the porous medium to prevent accumulation of sand in the bottom valve a nylon filter was put in the bottom port to create partially water saturated conditions in the sand filled container the system was drained from the bottom after having allowed the water phase to achieve an equilibrium configuration 24 h after the partial drainage of the system a trench of 1 5 cm width and 6 cm depth with vertical walls was carefully excavated between the inlet screens fig 1 right thus creating additional space for the hg0 dnapl reservoir this made it possible to observe whether hg0 lateral spreading from the reservoir would occur the flow container experiment consisted of two stages in the first stage liquid hg0 was carefully added in the trench in five steps of about 9 2 ml each until the dnapl built enough head to infiltrate and migrate within the partially water saturated system the second stage of the experiment consisted of the simulation of a rain event to assess whether the elemental mercury already infiltrated within the system could be mobilized due to local increases in water saturation the rain event lasted 40 min and was performed by pouring water on top of the upper ms1 layer with two sources of 2 5 ml min each placed in the middle of each portion outside the inlet walls fig 1 during the entire experiment the hg0 level in the reservoir and its infiltration front were tracked with a camera to determine its infiltration rate and its position over time within the system visual and camera observations allowed to determine when hg0 migration ceased and equilibrium was achieved equilibrium was assumed when no visible changes in the hg0 front were noticeable in the recorded images 2 3 porosity and fluid saturations measurements non intrusive measurements of porosity water and hg0 saturations were performed over the whole system with a dual gamma ray apparatus d aniello 2017 d aniello et al 2018b consisting of two radioactive sources namely americium 241 241am and cesium 137 137cs and a sodium iodide nai detector the measurements were made over a regular grid of 632 points with 1 cm spacing the porosity field was measured first at the end of the packing procedure when the system was fully water saturated then when the system was drained the initial water saturation distribution was determined after the trench excavation liquid hg0 and water saturation profiles were measured 24 h after the end of each experimental stage sec 2 2 established when there was no further change in the liquid hg0 level in the trench 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow container experiment stage 1 during the first stage of the flow container experiment liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution occurred in the partially water saturated stratified sand under an observed dnapl head of 7 76 cm infiltration of hg0 took place directly at the bottom of the trench with no evidence of lateral spreading until the ms2 layer was encountered a volume of 16 3 ml of elemental mercury infiltrated within the system infiltration stopped after 50 9 h 3054 min and the hg0 level in the reservoir reached the final value of 5 cm the hg0 inflow rate did not show a clear trend over time fig 2 other than highest infiltration rates occurring in the first 2 h as observed for the infiltration of other dnapls kueper and gerhard 1995 the fluctuations reported in the elemental mercury inflow rate were likely induced by the heterogeneities present within the porous formation another factor that probably increased these variations was the spatial and temporal variability of the water saturation field as hg0 infiltrated and distributed within the system d aniello et al 2018a observed that hg0 migration in partially water saturated porous media is followed by a redistribution of water within the pores hence of air as elemental mercury is nonwetting with respect to air the variation over time of the air saturation within the pores probably affected hg0 migration as well as its infiltration pattern infiltration of liquid hg0 into ms1 occurred when raising the dnapl level in the trench from 6 21 cm to 7 76 cm this is significantly lower 25 7 40 6 than the dnapl entry head of 10 45 cm table 3 d aniello et al 2018a observed in the pc s experiment under stable flow behaviour for this sand moreover this lower entry head occurred despite both average porosity 0 344 and water saturation 0 240 in the first centimetre beneath the trench were about 4 and 2 5 times lower than in the pc s experiment a reduction in porosity hence likely in intrinsic permeability and in water saturation would be expected to yield higher rather than lower entry heads probably hg0 infiltrated thanks to the presence of locally larger pores but its migration through the upper layer of ms1 was possible because of the triggering of gravity induced instabilities like fingering homsy 1987 kueper and frind 1988 illangasekare et al 1995a 1995b mayer and hassanizadeh 2005 initially the static dnapl head available in the trench was sufficient to allow hg0 to overcome the entry head dictated by the locally present heterogeneities and the effect of gravity likely induced an infiltration through preferential pathways rather than through a uniform front visual observations further suggested this indicating that at least two fingers might have developed fig 3 integration of dual gamma ray measurements over the 2 cm below the reservoir may also help suggesting this hypothesis at the end of the first stage of the experiment only 2 of the total pore volume in the 2 cm below the reservoir was occupied by liquid mercury based on a measured average porosity of 0 345 and a liquid hg0 volume of about 0 08 ml therefore based on such a small volume it is likely that hg0 migration occurred through preferential pathways since lateral spreading occurred on top of ms2 elemental mercury was also likely continuous beneath the reservoir thus providing a connection with the dnapl source in the trench elemental mercury reached the top of the ms2 layer in about 9 min when a volume of 0 79 ml of liquid hg0 had infiltrated based on the measured inflow rate fig 2 the dual gamma ray measurements figs 4 and 8 performed at the end of the first stage of the experiment indicated that 0 69 ml of liquid hg0 infiltrated in the first 3 cm beneath the trench the comparison of the volume obtained by integration of the dual gamma ray measurements with that calculated based on the measured inflow rate suggests that in the first 3 cm below the dnapl reservoir most of the elemental mercury infiltrated in the first minutes of the experiment and that no significant changes were observed at later times therefore once mercury found a pathway from the dnapl source in the trench down to the bottom of the upper ms1 layer all the additional infiltrated hg0 probably migrated through this pathway before distributing on top of the ms2 layer including the 3 cm of dnapl head below the bottom of the trench fig 3 the total liquid hg0 head on top of the ms2 layer was at maximum 10 5 cm according to the mercury level in the reservoir fig 2 however this head was not sufficient to allow liquid hg0 to penetrate ms2 this is in keeping with the higher entry heads found under stable flow behaviour for hg0 in this sand table 3 d aniello et al 2018a in both fully 12 51 cm and partially water saturated conditions 15 74 cm no infiltration via fingers occurred in ms2 as its narrower particle size distribution and lower particles sizes than ms1 table 1 likely prevented mercury from invading even a single pore of this layer therefore elemental mercury found easier pathways to continue its infiltration into the upper ms1 layer thus distributing on top of the ms2 layer once mercury reached the top of ms2 it created a pool of about 1 cm height elemental mercury distribution over ms2 was not symmetric figs 6 and 7 and the infiltration front was initially faster on the left side because of the higher porosity hence higher intrinsic permeability found fig 4 since water saturation was practically the same in the first 6 7 cm on both sides of the lateral spreading zone above ms2 fig 5 this trend reversed after 30 min fig 7 because of the lower water saturation found at the left side fig 5 as a result of the higher porosity fig 4 the larger the pores the lower the entry head so air easily filled this part of the system thus locally dampening the infiltration as hg0 is nonwetting with respect to air and is

effect induced by the heterogeneity of the porous medium structure likely prevailed in determining a preferential pathway for liquid hg0 infiltration and distribution the inspection of fig 8 further suggests this thus showing a tendency of liquid hg0 to migrate towards the left side of the container where porosity was the highest 0 392 above the ms2 layer as well as the hg0 saturation 0 615 and the height of the dnapl pool increased to 2 cm 3 2 flow container experiment stage 2 rain event the second stage of the flow container experiment consisted of the simulation of a rain event to test whether redistribution of the liquid hg0 present within the system could be induced by local increases in water saturation the increase in water saturation of the system induced the infiltration of a significant additional volume of 4 7 ml of elemental mercury for a total of 21 ml infiltration stopped after 35 h 2100 min and the hg0 level in the trench reached the final value of 4 2 cm fig 9 the mobilization of the liquid hg0 present within the system occurred at the end of the rain event after 40 min when the additional water infiltrated from the top almost completely saturated the ms1 layer above ms2 fig 10 during stage 2 the infiltration of elemental mercury mostly occurred in the first 40 min following the end of the rain event fig 9 in this time interval the hg0 inflow rate reached its maximum value 0 592 10 1 ml min fig 9 of about half of the maximum rate measured during stage 1 0 116 ml min fig 2 but of about one order of magnitude higher than the average inflow rate of stage

layer increases moisture storage for subsequent release by runoff and or evapotranspiration e g hopp et al 2011 and provides an effective oxygen barrier due to the low diffusivity of oxygen in water yanful 1993 while multi layer covers have been used in all climatic regions they have been unable to maintain a high degree of saturation throughout the year the use of enhanced soil layers such as compacted clay liners has resulted in improved water retention capacities e g benson et al 1999 but they are strongly affected by desiccation and freeze thaw cycling e g othman and benson 1993 albrecht and benson 2001 geosynthetic materials are being increasingly used in one or more of the layers in multi layered wrp cover systems to increase performance with reduced water infiltration and oxygen influx mend 2012 geosynthetic clay liners gcls consisting of bentonite clay supported by geotextiles have been widely used e g cazaux and didier 2000 while they have performed well as a moisture barrier e g benson et al 2007 their effectiveness as an oxygen diffusion barrier remains questionable due to their short diffusion path length and susceptibility to desiccation e g meer and benson 2007 geomembranes used in mining or landfill related applications are usually high density polyethylene hdpe which provides a highly effective barrier to water and oxygen e g rowe 2005 while pristine hdpe liners exhibit excellent attributes in situ performance can be affected by various elements in both the short and long term in the short term on site hdpe installation has a significant impact on the development of wrinkles defects and deformations e g giroud et al 1992 rowe 2012 chappel et al 2012 demonstrated that wrinkles develop rapidly in hdpe exposed to solar heating suggesting that an overlying layer should only be placed over the hdpe at certain times temperatures rowe et al 2012 all installed hdpe liners have some level of defects due to improper seaming or puncturing during placement of overlying material numerous methods have been established for estimating leakage rates through wrinkles and defects e g giroud et al 1992 rowe 2012 site specific environmental elements including service temperature strongly influence long term hdpe ageing and performance the service life of covered unexposed hdpe was shown to be 450 265 and 70 years at 20 25 and 40 c respectively indicating that higher temperatures results in shorter service life sangam and rowe 2002 koerner et al 2011 rowe and ewais 2015 furthermore covered hdpe maintains performance for significantly longer than exposed hdpe rowe et al 2009 demonstrated that hdpe can maintain performance levels when exposed to leachates and high temperature extremes sangam and rowe 2002 indicated that the service life would be even greater when only exposed to unsaturated soil based on the aforementioned studies hdpe liners can provide an effective long term barrier in wrp cover systems containing an overlying soil layer and in climates where service temperatures are typically 30 c despite this potential hdpe liners are primarily used at mining sites for liquid containment and basal liners e g benson 2000 lupo and morrison 2007 with few hdpe lined cover systems installed at wrps the majority of studies assessing the performance of these cover systems have been limited to small

influx and water quality in environmental receptors across a wrp site reclaimed with an hdpe lined cover system significant reductions in oxygen water influx and improvements in water quality highlighted the effectiveness of cover performance while these field studies have been able to directly indicate hdpe cover performance they are limited to the short term 5 years no information is available on long term hdpe cover performance and associated amd evolution numerical models are widely used to predict the long term evolution of groundwater contaminants during and or following

air transport spatially and temporally dependent pyrite oxidation rates at full scale wrps e g lefebvre et al 2001 molson et al 2005 fala et al 2013 numerical studies have also been performed to simulate and assess the effects of wrp covers on oxygen and water influx to the waste rock e g kim and benson 2004 song and yanful 2008 while complex hydrological and geochemical processes within wrps have been simulated few if any studies have assessed the spatial and temporal evolution of amd at wrp sites including wrp and receiving environment following remediation although not used for wrp investigations numerical models have been used to simulate other contaminants in groundwater in analogous studies for example bordeleau et al 2008 modeled dissolved rdx and nitrate at an air weapons range site in alberta canada to predict whether the contaminants pose a threat to nearby surface water receptors while şengör and ünlü 2013 examined the extent of acrylonitrile plume migration at an industrial spill site in turkey in this study a numerical investigation is presented of a remediated mining site that includes a large wrp overlain with an hdpe lined cover system a three dimensional 3 d transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the study site was developed in feflow and then calibrated and verified with hydrogeological and geochemical data collected during five years of post remediation monitoring the model was then simulated for 100 years to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of amd and illustrate the long term effectiveness of hdpe cover systems installed at wrps 2 study site 2 1 site description 2 1 1 waste rock pile the sydney coalfield in nova scotia canada is the oldest coal field in north america with underground mining occurring from the early 1700s to the early 2000s these historic mining operations included 50 underground mines that produced over 500 million tonnes of coal power et al 2018a in 2001 enterprise cape breton corporation ecbc commenced a mine site closure program throughout the coal field which was managed by public works and government services canada pwgsc 2013 a number of wrp sites were remediated as part of this program including the scotchtown summit wrp located in scotchtown approximately 15 km north of sydney fig 1 presents a plan view of the wrp and surrounding area which is referred to as the scotchtown summit study area sssa the perimeter of the sssa which has an area of 12 km2 is indicated by the black dashed lines the sssa was used as a dump for the placement of waste rock from nearby mine collieries between 1911 and 1973 the waste rock was reprocessed from 1981 to 1987 to recover coal with this process expanding the wrp footprint to 44 ha extensive remediation that commenced in 2009 included reshaping and consolidation of the pile which reduced the footprint to 37 ha and the installation of a cover system the wrp contains approximately 1 5 million m3 of waste rock fill with slopes on the pile ranging between 1 and 10 on top and between 4 and 20 on the sides detailed surface topography was determined from light detection and ranging lidar with elevations in the sssa ranging from 6 masl to 59 masl 2 1 2 climate the study area experiences a humid continental climate experiencing large seasonal temperature variations with warm to hot summers and cold to severely cold winters based on long term data recorded at the nearby sydney airport mean annual precipitation ppt and potential evaporation pe are approximately 1500 mm and 650 mm respectively environment canada 2017 2 1 3 geology prior to remediation various investigations were performed to characterize geology hydrogeology and geochemistry a number of geologic units exist within the sssa which are listed in table 1 overburden material comprises waste rock peat and till the waste rock is characterized by grey silty clayey sand with gravel and ranges in thickness from approximately 1 4 m to 10 m with the thickest deposits at the center of the wrp it consists of iron stained shales sandstone and siltstone mixed with coal fines the wrp is underlain by a brown silty sandy till ranging in thickness from 2 m to 4 m in some areas the waste rock and till units are separated by an organic peat layer that represents the original ground surface prior to placement of the wrp the till is underlain by bedrock which constitutes the lower morien group comprising massive fine to medium grained sandstone with some interbedded mudstone conglomerate and thin coal seams bedrock strikes essentially from east to west and dips to the north at 30 to 40 a 1 5 m thick coal seam referred to as the mullins coal seam strikes roughly east to west beneath the southern portion of the wrp hydraulic conductivity values used in each geologic unit were obtained from geological investigations completed before and during remedial activities although geological logs for each unit were distributed across the sssa the range of measured hydraulic conductivities for each unit are within one to two orders of magnitude as shown in table 1 2 1 4 hydrogeology the sssa straddles a drainage divide between the irish brook watershed to the north and kilkenny lake brook watershed to the south this divide is indicated in fig 1 the west north and east north perimeter ditches of the wrp drain north into an alkaline treatment pond north pond and subsequently northwards into irish brook the east south perimeter ditch flows southwards to tributary 1 and tributary 2 before ultimately draining into kilkenny lake brook in terms of groundwater it has historically flown from the topographical high to the northeast of the wrp towards the wrp as it flows through the wrp it is deflected by a groundwater divide existing in the south of the wrp that is influenced by the presence of the mullins coal seam as a result groundwater flows predominantly from the wrp downgradient towards the west northwest and south 2 1 5 amd contamination extensive amd contamination was confirmed at the sssa prior to remediation geochemical analysis of groundwater collected from monitoring wells distributed across the sssa indicated amd impacted groundwater characterized by low ph and elevated concentrations of sulfate and dissolved metals as expected the amd contaminant plume coincides with the dominant groundwater flow directions with highest amd impacts observed within the pile footprint and in downgradient regions to the west northwest and south similarly surface water collected from the various water bodies in the sssa also confirmed the impacts of amd 2 2 site remediation and field monitoring the key site remedial objectives were the i protection of water quality in waterford lake ii protection of tributary 1 and tributary 2 to kilkenny lake brook with respect to fish habitat and iii improvement in the quality of surface water in irish brook 2 2 1 cover system a 0 15 m thick bedding sand layer was first placed over the exposed waste rock and then overlain with a 1 5 mm 60 mil thick hdpe geomembrane which is the most commonly used geomembrane at mine sites thiel and smith 2004 a protective layer of geotextile fabric was placed on top of the hdpe which in turn was overlain with a 0 5 m thick layer of imported till material the 0 5 m thickness was used to allow sufficient space for typical vegetation rooting above the hdpe liner this soil layer was then hydroseeded to promote vegetation growth and provide a geomorphically stable landform this cover type was installed to significantly reduce oxygen and water flux into the waste rock and eliminate contaminated surface water runoff from the previously exposed waste rock the limited amd generation and release would consequently improve groundwater and surface water quality and ensure remedial objectives are achieved 2 2 2 hydrogeochemical monitoring a comprehensive field monitoring program was performed at the sssa between 2012 and 2016 various instrumentation was installed to monitor key parameters in the atmosphere cover system waste rock groundwater and surface water fig 2 indicates the location of the field instrumentation a meteorological station automatically measures rainfall air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction barometric pressure and snowdepth an interflow collection system quantifies lateral flow throughout the cover while a weir measures surface runoff flows from the wrp four soil monitoring stations sms were located across the wrp to continuously monitor soil moisture suction and temperature at 9 depths within the cover and shallow waste rock ranging from 0 05 m to 2 37 m pore gas sampling ports were also installed at 3 depths 0 40 m to 0 90 m four continuous multi channel tubing cmt wells were installed through the waste rock and into the underlying shallow bedrock the cmt wells monitored soil temperature and differential pressure at larger depths within the waste rock 1 9 m to 9 5 m while also permitting pore gas sampling groundwater levels could be collected from the base of each cmt well along with water samples for geochemical analysis aside from pore gas and groundwater levels samples all aforementioned parameters were automatically monitored every hour between january 2012 and december 2016 manual collection of pore gas concentrations at each sms and cmt well and groundwater levels and geochemical analysis at each cmt well was conducted almost monthly between june 2012 and november 2016 see table 2 a full description of the field instrumentation and analysis of the measured parameters is presented by power et al 2017 a total of 42 monitoring wells are screened within the various geologic units within the sssa as shown in fig 1 3 wells are located upgradient to the northeast of the wrp 14 wells are located within the pile footprint and the remaining 25 wells are located in downgradient locations table 2 summarizes the sampling events for groundwater levels and geochemistry at the 42 monitoring wells the wells were sampled each spring summer and fall between august 2014 and july 2016 to monitor amd evolution following remediation amd conditions prior to the completion of remediation are available from sampling performed between february 2009 and november 2011 surface water sampling was also conducted at various locations along each watercourse in the sssa including the wrp perimeter ditches irish brook waterford lake tributary 1 and tributary 2 2 2 3 landform stability and vegetation vegetation surveys erosion surveys and aerial inspections were conducted annually to monitor the stability of the landform and evolution of the vegetation cover vegetation and changes in species composition on the wrp significantly influence the geomorphic stability and control erosion soil texture and water holding capacity furthermore root depth and densities need to be inspected to assess the risk of excessive root growth and penetration of the hdpe geomembrane 2 3 key field parameters the following subset of field parameters was required to develop calibrate and verify the transient flow and contaminant transport model i hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity values are available for each geologic unit in the sssa as shown in table 1 as evident the range of hydraulic conductivities for each unit is quite narrow and each unit is assumed to be homogeneous anisotropy is implemented using different values for horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity a horizontal vertical ratio kh kv of 10 is typically used in groundwater studies e g elango et al 2012 anderson et al 2015 and was assigned to the initial model domain ii hydraulic head the groundwater levels measured throughout the 5 year monitoring period are hereafter referred to as the observed hydraulic heads in the model iii groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is based on land use and or land cover three regions of differing land cover and recharge rates exist in the sssa forested urbanized and wrp as highlighted in fig 2 the recharge rates in forested and urbanized areas are established from previous studies in the sydney coalfield e g king et al 2003 based on various factors such as geology surface cover topography rainfall and snowfall recharge rates of 325 mm year and 175 mm year are assigned to the forested and urbanized regions respectively the recharge rate assigned to the wrp area is the net percolation np through the hdpe lined cover into the waste rock the primary mechanism for np to occur is leakage through defects that inevitably develop due to accidental punctures and improper seaming during installation e g rowe 2012 as a result the number and sizes of defects in the liner directly influence the leakage rate needham et al 2006 numerous studies at various landfills have demonstrated the mean defect density in hdpe liners ranges from 12 9 holes per hectare holes ha to 34 4 holes ha e g rollin et al 2002 nosko and touze foltz 2000 needham et al 2004 colucci and lavagnolo 1995 demonstrated that 50 of geomembrane holes had an area of 100 mm2 equivalent radius 5 64 mm numerous empirical and analytical equations have been established to estimate leakage rates through holes e g giroud et al 1992 touze foltz and giroud 2003 cartaud et al 2005 or defects coincident with or adjacent to wrinkles e g rowe et al 2012 for the study site it is assumed that the geomembrane was installed during adequate cooler temperatures to minimize wrinkle development e g take et al 2007 with only holes tears occuring touze foltz and giroud 2003 established the following solution for determining the leakage rate through circular defects with diameters ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm 1 q c a a 0 1 k s 0 74 h w 0 9 1 0 1 h w h s 0 95 where q is the leakage rate m3 s c a is the contact quality factor 0 21 for good and 1 15 for poor a is the area of the defect m2 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying material m s h w is the head of water above the liner m and h s is the thickness of the underlying material m eq 1 is widely used to estimate leakage rates through defective geomembranes e g li et al 2012 agbenyeku et al 2017 and is used to estimate recharge to the wrp in this study the head of water was determined by pore water pressure sensors at the smss the k s and h s for the bedding sand are 1 10 7 m s and 0 15 m respectively poor contact was assumed between the hdpe liner and the underlying bedding sand it was assumed that 20 holes ha exist with an area of 79 mm2 radius 5 mm which lies within the typical ranges reported in previous studies e g colucci and lavagnolo 1995 needham et al 2004 meiers and bradley 2017 annual water balances were developed to evaluate water dynamics in the cover system and were comprised of the following components e g meiers et al 2009 2 ppt r aet δ s lp np where δs is change in water storage within the cover material mm np was calculated as the residual of eq 2 with these water balance np rates similar to and thereby validating the np rates estimated in eq 1 a full description of the annual water balances developed for the site between 2012 and 2016 is provided in power et al 2017 table 3 presents the annual recharge rates for the differing land use regions in the study area in addition to the recharge rate for the covered wrp the rate that would exist with no cover is also presented this pre cover rate is based on the np ppt ratio of 34 demonstrated on similar waste rock fill material by king et al 2003 table 3 highlights the significant reduction in wrp recharge due to the cover system with a reduction in np from 34 to 3 of ppt monthly varying groundwater recharge was assigned to each recharge zone fig 2 of the transient model as a percentage of ppt the recharge and ppt measured each month throughout the 5 year monitoring period are used to develop a monthly recharge rate as a percentage of ppt to obtain long term predictions of recharge while accounting for climate change patterns a climate period of 30 or more years is used in this study the monthly recharge ppt is integrated with the monthly climate data recorded between january 1981 and december 2010 canadian climate normals to provide long term recharge for the predictive model iv amd contaminant source the geochemical source term for the wrp is taken from representative wells installed within the pile footprint the 4 monitoring wells screened in the waste rock sssa mw 101 sssa mw 104 sssa mw 108 and sssa mw 112 would normally provide the most representative water quality seeping from the wrp however each of the 4 wells were dry during all sampling events and wells screened below the waste rock are instead used of these 14 wells the sampling density at the 4 cmt wells 30 samples is much higher than at the 10 monitoring wells 9 samples between june 2012 and december 2016 and would provide improved calibration and verification as a result the geochemical data at the 4 cmt wells is used to represent the amd source sulfate is commonly used as a key amd indicator or geochemical tracer due to its high persistence in groundwater relative to other amd indicators such as iron and aluminum sulfate concentrations at the 4 cmt wells are used to represent the amd source in the wrp while sulfate concentrations at all 42 monitoring wells are used to represent the amd groundwater plume distributed across the sssa 3 model development a 3 d transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical model was developed using feflow 6 2 to analyze and predict long term groundwater flow and amd contaminant at the study site feflow is a 2 d and 3 d finite element modeling package that can simulate steady or transient state fluid density coupled flow and mass transport diersch 2014 it is widely used in hydrogeological studies e g bordeleau et al 2008 elango et al 2012 chopra et al 2013 3 1 model discretization the full sssa area of 12 km2 was discretized into a 3 d finite element mesh consisting of 297 108 triangular finite element cells the modeled domain integrates both the saturated zone corresponding to the till and underlying bedrock aquifers and the unsaturated zone corresponding to the upper part of the till and the wrp mesh discretization was optimized based on site information with finer discretization employed near the wrp and water bodies fig 3a presents the 3 d model domain while fig 3b and c present 2 d vertical cross sections the model domain was subdivided vertically into 18 layers with variable thickness to represent the various geologic units the top 5 layers represent the overburden within the pile footprint which comprises cover material waste rock and organic material peat layer 6 represents the till unit that both underlies the wrp and is the overburden outside the pile footprint the next 12 layers are used to represent the shallow intermediate and deep bedrock units table 1 lists each geologic unit and associated model layer 3 2 boundary and initial conditions the modeled area is based on the extent of the sssa which is delineated on all sides by specific hydrogeological and physical boundaries fig 3a indicates the boundary conditions used as the southwestern and eastern boundaries are watershed boundaries they are both considered as a no flow boundary the western boundary is also considered as a no flow boundary the northern boundary corresponds with irish brook as the streambed elevation of irish brook is assumed to coincide with the till shallow bedrock interface layers 6 and 7 in the northern boundary are considered as specified head boundary with all remaining layers considered as a no flow boundary the southern boundary corresponds with tributary 1 and is considered as a specified head boundary in all layers similarly the boundary along waterford lake is considered as a specified head boundary which corresponds to the measured surface water level in the lake i e 25 5 masl the base of the model domain where it is assumed that groundwater flow is near horizontal and water does not leave or enter is considered as a no flow boundary a river head boundary condition was applied to all surface water bodies inside the study area including ponds and drainage ditches the top boundary condition representing the land surface exposed to the atmosphere is expressed as a transient flux equal to seasonal variations of groundwater recharge the initial hydraulic head distribution for the model was based on groundwater elevations from the starting point of the 4 cmt wells june 2012 and 42 monitoring wells mean february 2009 to november 2011 3 3 groundwater flow model 3 3 1 model calibration the groundwater flow model was first calibrated in steady state conditions to achieve the best correlation between the simulated hydraulic heads and the observed hydraulic heads in each of the till shallow bedrock and intermediate bedrock units the primary variables that were adjusted within an allowable range for the trial and error calibration were boundary condition hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge for example the western boundary was initially assumed as a no flow boundary but was altered to a specified head boundary during model calibration the calibration was performed until the mean error of simulated versus observed heads was minimized as much as possible in all units in fig 4 a summary of the calibration is presented in the form of a scatter plot diagram of 46 simulated heads versus observed heads it is evident that the simulated heads correlate well with the observed heads with a root mean squared rms error of 2 1 m this is well within the acceptable range and is similar to other studies e g 2 9 m in orban et al 2010 3 3 2 model verification the calibrated steady state model was then verified against the time varying hydraulic heads the calibrated steady state conditions including hydraulic heads and hydraulic conductivity were used as initial conditions for the transient flow model the transient model was simulated for the time period between june 2012 and december 2016 which coincides with the field monitoring period and the availability of observed hydraulic heads see table 2 since a significant amount of the hydraulic heads at the cmt wells were measured monthly a 30 day time step was used while the transient model was mainly used for verification some minor trial and error adjustments calibration were made to fine tune some of the time varying input parameters such as variable head boundary and groundwater recharge table 4 presents the initial and calibrated horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities used in the model a comparative analysis between the temporal variation in simulated and observed hydraulic heads indicated a strong correlation fig 5 presents the simulated and observed heads versus time at selected wells in each geologic unit at key groundwater flow regions in the study area beneath the wrp downgradient west of the wrp and downgradient south of the wrp it is evident that the simulated heads correlate well with the observed heads in each region and unit over the 5 year time period for instance seasonal variations in observed heads are repeated in the simulated heads at all wells the cmt wells re a good indicator of correlation quality due to their high sampling density larger discrepancies are evident at some wells which can be expected since the calibrated steady state model assumed homogeneity in each geologic unit and does not account for local variations in geological conditions fig 6 presents a scatter plot diagram of simulated versus observed hydraulic heads at all 46 cmt and monitoring wells over time good agreement is evident between the simulated and observed heads at all locations and units the rms error was 2 m it is evident that the transient flow model has been well calibrated and verified to observed head values over the 5 year monitoring period 3 4 contaminant transport model 3 4 1 transport process sulfate transport in groundwater is assumed to follow an advection and dispersion diffusion process furthermore sulfate is assumed to be non reactive in groundwater and no retardation occurs transport parameters such as effective porosity molecular diffusion longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity that are necessary to consider in each geologic unit are presented in table 5 as site specific values are not available established literature values are used e g mcwhorter and sunada 1977 domenico and schwartz 1990 schulze makuch 2005 3 4 2 long term source function the sulfate concentrations measured at the 4 cmt wells between june 2012 and december 2016 are shown in fig 7a preliminary analysis identified a clear decreasing trend with seasonal variations at all wells with cmt 2 and cmt 4 displaying the most significant sulfate reductions over time the location of these wells corresponds to the prominent groundwater flow rates and pathways to the west and northwest cmt 2 and to the south cmt 4 of the wrp seasonal variations are related to the humid continental climate at the site for instance lower concentrations occur during high ppt periods i e spring melt in april and may and high rainfall in october and november which causes increased dilution by higher velocity upgradient groundwater to predict future sulfate concentrations for the long term source term the observed monitoring data can be combined with suitable time series analysis the multiplicative decomposition method is an analysis method that separates the time series into a trend component that is a smooth function of time a seasonal component that represents a pattern that is repeated annually and an error component that is independent for each data point e g worrall and burt 1998 sizirici and tansel 2010 laner et al 2012 sizirici and tansel 2010 applied the decomposition method to numerous collected leachate quality parameters from a landfill including total dissolved solids iron and quantity the method provided adequate predictions of the future conditions of the parameters and a forecast on the duration of the post closure period of the closed landfill in this study the statistics package minitab 18 minitab 15 statguide minitab inc 2007 was used to apply the time series decomposition method to the observed sulfate concentrations and generate future sulfate source term conditions fig 7b presents the observed and forecast sulfate concentrations for each cmt well the background concentration level bcl is 25 mg l which is based on the upgradient groundwater quality measured at the upgradient wells scms mw 01 02 and 03 a good fit is evident at all wells between the observed data and forecast data between june 2012 and december 2016 the accuracy of the time series analysis can be expressed by the mean absolute deviation mad and mean absolute percentage error mape which are expressed in mg l and respectively the mad for cmt 1 cmt 2 cmt 3 and cmt 4 are 98 1 14 1 7 4 and 71 5 respectively while the mape are 17 9 71 6 55 8 and 95 1 respectively these parameters confirmed the suitability of the selected time series model used and the adequacy of the future sulfate projections e g mape values 80 are considered an adequate fit e g sizirici and tansel 2010 from fig 7b it is estimated that sulfate concentrations at cmt 1 will gradually decrease to the bcl by the year 2023 the sulfate concentrations at cmt 2 cmt 3 and cmt 4 decreased to the bcl during the field monitoring period in 2014 2014 and 2016 respectively which was already observed in the field data in fig 7a the amd source in the wrp is represented by sulfate concentrations at sparsely distributed point locations to maintain the spatial and temporal variation in sulfate between all cmt wells the wrp was divided into separate polygons with each polygon representing the wrp volume and sulfate source for each cmt well see fig 2 the source distribution over the wrp was estimated from the cmt wells using the thiessen polygon method the sulfate concentrations were assigned to the appropriate polygon within the wrp footprint to the waste rock layers 2 3 and 4 table 1 the predicted sulfate concentrations from fig 7b are applied throughout the 50 year simulation period when the sulfate source at each cmt well reaches the bcl it attains the bcl value for the remainder of the simulation period 3 4 3 model calibration and verification the calibrated transient state flow model was used as the basis for the transient transport model some trial and error calibration was performed as a first step on the observed monitoring data between june 2012 and december 2016 the transport parameters in table 5 were slightly varied to improve the correlation as much as possible between the observed and simulated sulfate concentrations at all well locations fig 8 presents the simulated and observed sulfate concentrations over time at the same wells presented for the hydraulic heads in fig 5 a good correlation exists between observed and simulated sulfate concentrations in each region and geologic unit over the 5 year time period for instance seasonal variations in observed sulfate concentrations are repeated in the simulated concentrations at all wells the cmt wells have the highest sampling density and provide a strong indicator of correlation quality the maximum deviations occurred at wells beneath the wrp particularly in the till and intermediate bedrock this is likely related to the use of the 4 cmt wells in the shallow bedrock to represent the sulfate source in the wrp and therefore may not correlate with sulfate concentrations in the other geological units the geologic properties of each unit is homogeneous in the model and do not represent the heterogeneity of the sulfate distribution in the observed data furthermore the source for the entire wrp is represented by measured concentrations at 4 sparse locations despite these inherent simplifications in the model a strong correlation generally exists between observed and simulated sulfate concentrations fig 9 presents a scatter plot diagram of simulated versus observed sulfate concentrations at all cmt and monitoring wells over time good agreement is observed at all locations with an rms error of 2 m it is evident that the transient flow and transport model has been well calibrated and verified to observed head and sulfate values over the 5 year monitoring period the calibrated and verified transient groundwater flow and transport model was then used to simulate the evolution of amd distribution at the sssa the predictive simulations were run for 100 years using the final conditions established during the calibration and verification process the long term simulations provide an indication of remedial performance and or information on key milestones where concentrations are decreasing below specified guidelines values and or bcls 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater flow regime fig 10a presents the observed piezometric surface and flow directions in the till shallow bedrock and intermediate bedrock units in november 2016 which is the last field sampling event available in all units groundwater flows from the topographic high to the northeast of the wrp in the till and shallow bedrock a groundwater divide exists in an east west trend through the southern portion of the wrp which generally corresponds with the presence of the low permeability mullins coal seam and with the surface water divide between the irish brook and kilkenny lake brook watersheds therefore groundwater flowing through the wrp is deflected by the groundwater divide with groundwater in the northern portion flowing in a west to northwestern direction towards waterford lake and irish brook while groundwater in the southern portion flows in a south to southeastern direction towards tributary 1 and tributary 2 in the intermediate bedrock flow system all groundwater flows towards the south and southeast fig 10b also presents the simulated piezometric surface and flow directions in each geological unit it closely matches the observed groundwater flow regime of the 3 units the best correlations occur in the till and intermediate bedrock the model generally over estimates the hydraulic heads south of the wrp larger discrepancies occur in the shallow bedrock with simulated heads higher than observed heads in the southeast and lower than observed heads in the west 2 m difference 4 2 long term prediction of amd distribution 4 2 1 amd impacts to groundwater fig 11 presents the predicted long term spatial and temporal distribution of the sulfate contaminant plume at the sssa after 1 year the spatial variation of wrp source concentration is evident within the wrp footprint in each underlying geological unit with higher concentrations at cmt 1 and cmt 4 compared to cmt 2 and cmt 3 as sulfate seeps from the waste rock into the underlying groundwater it disperses due to differing flow directions and velocities as expected the plume follows the direction of groundwater flow indicated in fig 10 with highest downgradient concentrations existing in the west towards waterford lake and in the southeast towards tributary 1 and 2 although the highest sulfate concentrations occur in the till unit concentrations are also high in the shallow and intermediate bedrock units due to high vertical hydraulic gradients fig 11 indicates that the sulfate plume concentrations gradually reduces over time particularly during the first 10 years thereby highlighting the immediate effectiveness of remediation with an hdpe cover system at 20 years the sulfate concentrations have reached or are approaching bcls within all geological units to better analyze amd evolution and cover performance over time fig 12 presents the sulfate concentrations at the same downgradient wells selected for the transient sulfate calibrations in fig 8 in addition to the bcl black dotted line the canadian drinking water quality cdwq guideline for sulfate 500 mg l is used black dashed line to provide a reference for groundwater quality fig 12 confirms that sulfate concentrations at all wells in both downgradient regions were already below the cdwq guideline at the start of the simulation period as shown in fig 7 cmt 2 and cmt 3 exhibit relatively low sulfate concentrations compared to cmt 1 and cmt 4 as a result downgradient sulfate concentrations to the west of the wrp which interact with cleaner groundwater flowing from cmt 2 and cmt 3 decrease more rapidly and reach bcl within 20 years in contrast groundwater flowing to the south interacts with cmt 1 and cmt 4 resulting in a slower rate of reduction over time nevertheless all wells to the south reach bcl within 40 years it is evident from fig 12 that the evolution of sulfate concentrations corresponds to the sulfate reduction term shown in fig 7 4 2 2 amd impacts to surface water surface water sampling conducted during the 5 year field monitoring program confirmed significant decreases in sulfate concentrations in all watercourses within the sssa the surface water sampling locations indicated in fig 2 are associated with the three watercourses related to the key site remedial objectives sw 01 irish brook sw 02 waterford lake and sw 03 tributary 2 to kilkenny lake brook power et al 2017 demonstrated that the objectives were already being achieved i water quality in irish brook has significantly improved relative to the baseline sulfate concentration of 400 mg l sulfate equal to 31 mg l in november 2016 ii water quality in waterford lake is protected below the threshold of 17 mg l sulfate equal to 5 4 mg l in november 2016 and iii water quality in tributary 2 is protected within respect to fish habitat threshold of 500 mg l sulfate equal to 4 4 mg l in november 2016 significant reductions in amd impacts to surface water bodies is due to i reductions in amd loading from covered wrp to groundwater resulting in improved groundwater quality discharging to surface water and ii elimination of contaminated surface water runoff from previously exposed waste rock that is now overlain with the hdpe lined cover although detailed modeling of the surface water bodies is outside the scope of this study long term stability of the surface water quality with respect to the site remedial objectives can be indirectly obtained by the developed flow and transport model in addition to the monitoring well locations in fig 12 the evolution of sulfate concentrations at locations adjacent to sw 01 sw 02 and sw 03 is analyzed fig 13 confirms that groundwater quality improves continuously over time therefore it is evident that surface water quality and site remedial objectives will continue to meet specified performance criteria over the long term 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess key input parameters to the model np aquifer recharge and hydraulic conductivity an analysis of sulfate concentrations in groundwater adjacent to the key surface water sampling locations is utilized as shown in fig 14 np was varied from the base case value of 3 ppt to a minimum of 1 ppt representative of a near intact cover with limited defects and a maximum of 34 ppt representative of conditions with no cover e g king et al 2003 it is evident from fig 14a that decreasing or increasing np does not affect sulfate concentrations at irish brook which is expected as the sulfate plume does not flow northwards towards irish brook a decrease in np from 3 ppt to 1 ppt has very little change on sulfate concentrations at waterford lake and kilkenny lake brook increasing np to 34 ppt results in a decrease in sulfate concentration at waterford lake which is due to dilution of the low sulfate concentration source seeping from the wrp in this direction cmt 2 and cmt 3 by the increased seepage water volume resulting in a lower sulfate loading from the wrp in contrast an increase in np slightly increases the sulfate concentration observed at kilkenny lake brook the sulfate load seeping from the wrp in this direction cmt 1 and cmt 4 is much higher due to a combination of high concentration and high seepage rate to analyze the sensitivity of the model results to groundwater recharge the base case recharges i e forested cover 325 mm industrial cover 175 mm wrp cover 50 mm were varied by 10 fig 14b presents the variation in groundwater recharge and again shows little to no change in sulfate concentrations near irish brook at waterford lake an increase in recharge results in a significant decrease in sulfate while a decrease in recharge results in a significant increase in sulfate this highlights the sensitivity of the sulfate concentration at waterford lake to dilution by groundwater recharge particularly in the forested area between the wrp and waterford lake similar patterns occurred at kilkenny lake brook though the changes were much lower due to the increased distance and the observation point at sw 03 not being directly along the flow direction fig 14c presents the variation in sulfate concentration following changes to hydraulic conductivity at every location and geologic unit by 0 3 orders of magnitude while sulfate concentrations at irish brook show little change sulfate concentrations at waterford lake and kilkenny lake brook exhibit more significant changes an increase in hydraulic conductivity results in an increase in groundwater flow velocity and dilution and a corresponding decrease in sulfate concentration similarly a decrease in hydraulic conductivity results in a decrease in groundwater dilution and increased sulfate concentrations the magnitude of these changes in sulfate concentration are more significant at kilkenny lake brook due to the increased distance and flow volume from the wrp 4 3 landform stability and vegetation although the wrp has relatively low slopes some erosion was visible at sparse locations this is due to the absence of a drainage layer above the hdpe with the associated high pore water pressures and saturation and the loss in shear strength in the soil layer resulting in localized surface ponding and discharge areas vegetation surveys indicated that the vegetative composition is thriving with soil profiles showing that root depths do not exceed 20 cm and thereby do not provide a risk to hdpe liner integrity 4 4 limitations a number of simplifying assumptions were used in this numerical study it is acknowledged that wrps and geologic units can be complex and heterogeneous and the assumption of homogeneity at the presented study site is simplistic this assumption simplifies water flow and contaminant distribution in the wrp and receiving environment hydraulic conductivity is a critical parameter in groundwater flow and contaminant transport and poorly representative values can lead to significant underestimation or overestimation of hydraulic heads as evident during calibration of the study site model furthermore associated discrepancies in groundwater flow velocities can lead to inaccuracies in contaminant concentrations which is particularly important for long term predictions nevertheless it is common in large and complex study areas to assume representative mean values an extensive geological database was available for the study site and a narrow range of conductivity values existed the mean values used were carefully selected and subsequently adjusted during the model development to obtain a well calibrated and verified groundwater flow and contaminant transport model knowledge on the quality of amd water seeping from the base of the wrp is essential to accurately assess and predict amd release depletion rates within the wrp and loading to the receiving environment at the study site waste rock pore water samples could not be obtained so groundwater samples from the underlying shallow bedrock were used as a result amd loading is likely underestimated as it based on groundwater concentrations that may have already diminished due to dilution with upgradient groundwater to more accurately access the annual generation and release of amd to groundwater various kinetic and reactive aspects can be incorporated current work involves laboratory experiments with humidity cells and leaching columns on waste rock samples extracted from the wrp to assess various kinetic aspects such as the velocity of sulfide oxidation and metal leaching rates the contaminant transport component simulated advective and dispersive diffusive transport of sulfate in groundwater it was assumed that the sulfate was non reactive and no retardation occurs future work will couple the phreeqc geochemical reaction model charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the feflow model to include kinetic and multiphase transfer processes for improved predictions of long term amd generation release and transport from the wrp a challenging component of long term predictive modeling studies is incorporating future variations in climate which significantly impact key parameters such as groundwater recharge including np and acidity loading at the study site ppt and recharge were measured over a 5 year monitoring period and used to estimate monthly recharge as a percentage of ppt a 30 year climatic database 1981 to 2010 was then used to provide long term ppt that accounts for climatic variations and corresponding long term recharge using the monthly percentage of ppt additionally long term sulfate concentrations seeping from the wrp were estimated from time series analysis of the sulfate concentrations measured during the 5 year monitoring period soil atmosphere and seepage models calibrated to measured field data may improve future predictions of recharge and seepage rates in covered wrps while this study has demonstrated that hdpe lined cover systems can be highly effective for reducing long term amd impacts to the receiving environment the integrity and service life of the geomembrane need to be considered oxidative degradation of the hdpe over time will decrease properties such as strength and stress crack resistance rowe 2012 it should be noted that different hdpe liners will have different antioxidant packages and depletion times which directly influence service life for instance hdpe thickness has a significant effect on antioxidant depletion with 2 5 mm thick hdpe taking approximately 50 longer to deplete than 1 5 mm thick hdpe rowe et al 2010 service temperature has a significant effect on hdpe performance with higher temperatures resulting in shorter service life rowe and ewais 2015 while the wrp in this study lies within a humid continental climate with temperatures typically 30 c wrps in other climates such as semi arid or arid will experience much higher temperatures and shorter hdpe service life a detailed discussion on the service life of hdpe is provided by rowe 2012 5 conclusions in this study a numerical investigation was performed to investigate the long term effectiveness of hdpe lined cover systems installed over acid generating wrps a remediated former mining site in nova scotia canada contains a wrp that was overlain with an hdpe cover in 2011 a 3 d groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the study site including the wrp and environmental receptors was developed in feflow key hydrogeological and geochemical field data collected during extensive post remediation field monitoring between january 2012 and december 2016 were used to effectively calibrate and verify the model the cover system generated a 90 reduction in water flux into the wrp i e 512 to 50 mm year resulting in reduced amd generation and seepage from the wrp into groundwater the model was used to simulate the long term spatial and temporal evolution of amd over 100 years results indicated continual improvements in groundwater quality over time with groundwater quality reaching background water quality i e 25 mg l within 40 years although the model confirmed groundwater quality will improve over time key site remedial objectives were related to surface water quality since the 5 year field monitoring program confirmed that each remedial objective related to surface water quality was already being achieved the groundwater model was used to confirm that groundwater quality adjacent to the relevant surface water bodies will be maintained and or continue to improve over the long term therefore although surface water modeling was beyond the scope of this study the groundwater model was able to indirectly indicate that key remedial objectives will be achieved this study has demonstrated the long term effectiveness of remedial activities involving hdpe lined cover systems to significantly reduce the impacts of amd on a wrp receiving environment while the study focused on one field site the approach and findings are applicable to other wrp sites furthermore it should be noted that the performance of the cover system will evolve over time in response to climatic conditions and site specific physical chemical and biological processes that are extremely difficult to predict periodic in situ monitoring and physical studies of processes such as freeze thaw vegetation and erosion cycles are recommended to maintain a rigorous evaluation of long term remedial performance acknowledgements this work was conducted under the caps monitoring project and funded

1643,remediation at former mining sites containing waste rock piles wrps commonly involves the installation of a cover system over the waste rock to limit water and oxygen ingress and attenuate the impacts of acid mine drainage amd to the environment cover systems containing high density polyethylene hdpe liners have the attributes to be highly effective however their performance over the long term is unknown the objective of this study was to assess the long term effectiveness of an in service hdpe lined cover system for reducing amd contamination at wrp sites a numerical investigation of a former mining site containing a large wrp reclaimed with an hdpe cover is presented a 3 d groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the site was developed in feflow to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of amd over 100 years field parameters observed at 46 monitoring wells over a 5 year monitoring period including hydraulic head recharge hydraulic conductivity and water quality were used as key input and calibration parameters the hdpe cover significantly reduced both water recharge to the waste rock i e 512 to 50 mm year and amd seepage to groundwater both the groundwater flow and contaminant transport sulfate was used as an amd tracer components of the model were calibrated and verified to the observed field data with strong correlations evident between observed and simulated hydraulic heads and sulfate concentrations respectively long term model predictions of amd evolution indicated significant and continual reductions in sulfate concentrations over time at all well locations background concentration levels 25 mg l are expected to be reached within 40 years this study has demonstrated that hdpe lined cover systems can be highly effective in reducing amd loading from wrps and its impacts on the receiving environment keywords contaminant remediation cover system high density polyethylene hdpe numerical simulation feflow sulfate concentration 1 introduction environmental impacts associated with active and abandoned coal mine sites worldwide are well documented mining activities worldwide have left a legacy of contaminated sites that contain waste rock piles wrps wrps are large anthropogenic created landforms that typically range in height from 10 m to 30 m and can have surface areas up to several km2 blowes 1997 most wrps contain sulfidic minerals such as pyrite and pyrrhotite which when exposed to atmospheric conditions oxygen and water can initiate and sustain a process commonly referred to as acid mine drainage amd amd produces an acidic sulfate rich leachate that can then further dissolve other minerals in the host rock and become enriched with iron and other toxic metals inap 2014 nordstrom et al 2015 the formation of amd and its seepage into surrounding groundwater and surface watercourses can occur for extended periods i e centuries or even millenia resulting in a long term source of environmental contamination e g simate and ndlovu 2014 amos et al 2015 cover systems are commonly installed over the wrp to limit the influx of atmospheric oxygen and meteoric water to the reactive waste material thereby preventing and or controlling amd formation e g kefeni et al 2017 power et al 2018a cover systems can be simple or complex ranging from a single layer of earthen material to multiple individual layers of different material types including native soils oxygen consuming organic materials and geosynthetic materials mend 2004 power et al 2017 the design of a cover system is in most cases site specific and depends on the climatic conditions prevailing at a given site single layer covers act to minimize water influx by maximizing near surface storage of moisture with subsequent release by evapotranspiration e g power et al 2018a 2018b as a result they are most effective in arid or semi arid regions where potential evaporation exceeds precipitation scanlon et al 2005 o kane and ayres 2012 multi layer covers utilize the capillary barrier concept to maintain a high degree of saturation at least 85 in one or more of its layers e g yanful et al 1999 this high saturation layer increases moisture storage for subsequent release by runoff and or evapotranspiration e g hopp et al 2011 and provides an effective oxygen barrier due to the low diffusivity of oxygen in water yanful 1993 while multi layer covers have been used in all climatic regions they have been unable to maintain a high degree of saturation throughout the year the use of enhanced soil layers such as compacted clay liners has resulted in improved water retention capacities e g benson et al 1999 but they are strongly affected by desiccation and freeze thaw cycling e g othman and benson 1993 albrecht and benson 2001 geosynthetic materials are being increasingly used in one or more of the layers in multi layered wrp cover systems to increase performance with reduced water infiltration and

moisture barrier e g benson et al 2007 their effectiveness as an oxygen diffusion barrier remains questionable due to their short diffusion path length and susceptibility to desiccation e g meer and benson 2007 geomembranes used in mining or landfill related applications are usually high density polyethylene hdpe which provides a highly effective barrier to water and oxygen e g rowe 2005 while pristine hdpe liners exhibit excellent attributes in situ performance can be affected by various elements in both the short and long term in the short term on site hdpe installation has a significant impact on the development of wrinkles defects and deformations e g giroud et al 1992 rowe 2012 chappel et al 2012 demonstrated that wrinkles develop rapidly in hdpe exposed to solar heating suggesting that an overlying layer should only be placed over the hdpe at certain times temperatures rowe et al 2012 all installed hdpe liners have some level of defects due to improper seaming or puncturing during placement of overlying material numerous methods have been established for estimating leakage rates through wrinkles and defects e g giroud et al 1992 rowe 2012 site specific environmental elements including service temperature strongly influence long term hdpe ageing and performance the service life of covered unexposed hdpe was shown to be 450 265 and 70 years at 20 25 and 40 c respectively indicating that higher temperatures results in shorter service life sangam and rowe 2002 koerner et al 2011 rowe and ewais 2015 furthermore covered hdpe maintains performance for significantly longer than exposed hdpe rowe et al 2009 demonstrated that hdpe can maintain performance levels when exposed to leachates and high temperature extremes sangam and rowe 2002 indicated that the service life would be even greater when only exposed to unsaturated soil based on the aforementioned studies hdpe liners can provide an effective long term barrier in wrp cover systems containing an overlying soil layer and in climates where service temperatures are typically 30 c despite this potential hdpe liners are primarily used at mining sites for liquid containment and basal liners e g benson 2000 lupo and morrison 2007 with few hdpe lined cover systems installed at wrps the majority of studies assessing the performance of these cover systems have been limited to small scale test cover plots e g ayres et al 2003 adu wusu and yanful 2006 with only a handful performed at full scale in service wrps e g meiers et al 2011 power et al 2017 meiers et al 2011 monitored oxygen concentrations and water infiltration rates for one year and demonstrated limited atmospheric flux into the waste rock power et al 2017 monitored a range of parameters including oxygen water influx and water quality in environmental receptors across a wrp site reclaimed with an hdpe lined cover system significant reductions in oxygen water influx and improvements in water quality highlighted the effectiveness of cover performance while these field studies have been able to directly indicate hdpe cover performance they are limited to the short term 5 years no information is available on long term hdpe cover performance and associated amd evolution numerical models are widely used to predict the long term evolution of groundwater contaminants during and or following

air transport spatially and temporally dependent pyrite oxidation rates at full scale wrps e g lefebvre et al 2001 molson et al 2005 fala et al 2013 numerical studies have also been performed to simulate and assess the effects of wrp covers on oxygen and water influx to the waste rock e g kim and benson 2004 song and yanful 2008 while complex hydrological and geochemical processes within wrps have been simulated few if any studies have assessed the spatial and temporal evolution of amd at wrp sites including wrp and receiving environment following remediation although not used for wrp investigations numerical models have been used to simulate other contaminants in groundwater in analogous studies for example bordeleau et al 2008 modeled dissolved rdx and nitrate at an air weapons range site in alberta canada to predict whether the contaminants pose a threat to nearby surface water receptors while şengör and ünlü 2013 examined the extent of acrylonitrile plume migration at an industrial spill site in turkey in this study a numerical investigation is presented of a remediated mining site that includes a large wrp overlain with an hdpe lined cover system a three dimensional 3 d transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the study site was developed in feflow and then calibrated and verified with hydrogeological and geochemical data collected during five years of post remediation monitoring the model was then simulated for 100 years to predict the spatial and temporal evolution of amd and illustrate the long term effectiveness of hdpe cover systems installed at wrps 2 study site 2 1 site description 2 1 1 waste rock pile the sydney coalfield in nova scotia canada is the oldest coal field in north america with underground mining occurring from the early 1700s to the early 2000s these historic mining operations included 50 underground mines that produced over 500 million tonnes of coal power et al 2018a in 2001 enterprise cape breton corporation ecbc commenced a mine site closure program throughout the coal field which was managed by public works and government services canada pwgsc 2013 a number of wrp sites were remediated as part of this program including the scotchtown summit wrp located in scotchtown approximately 15 km north of sydney fig 1 presents a plan view of the wrp and surrounding area which is referred to as the scotchtown summit study area sssa the perimeter of the sssa which has an area of 12 km2 is indicated by the black dashed lines the sssa was used as a dump for the placement of waste rock from nearby mine collieries between 1911 and 1973 the waste rock was reprocessed from 1981 to 1987 to recover coal with this process expanding the wrp footprint to 44 ha extensive remediation that commenced in 2009 included reshaping and consolidation of the pile which reduced the footprint to 37 ha and the installation of a cover system the wrp contains approximately 1 5 million m3 of waste rock fill with slopes on the pile ranging between 1 and 10 on top and between 4 and 20 on the sides detailed surface topography was determined from light detection and ranging lidar with elevations in the sssa ranging from 6 masl to 59 masl 2 1 2 climate the study area experiences a humid continental climate experiencing large seasonal temperature variations with warm to hot summers and cold to severely cold winters based on long term data recorded at the nearby sydney airport mean annual precipitation ppt and potential evaporation pe are approximately 1500 mm and 650 mm respectively environment canada 2017 2 1 3 geology prior to remediation various investigations were performed to characterize geology hydrogeology and geochemistry a number of geologic units exist within the sssa which are listed in table 1 overburden material comprises waste rock peat and till the waste rock is characterized by grey silty clayey sand with gravel and ranges in thickness from approximately 1 4 m to 10 m with the thickest deposits at the center of the wrp it consists of iron stained shales sandstone and siltstone mixed with coal fines the wrp is underlain by a brown silty sandy till ranging in thickness from 2 m to 4 m in some areas the waste rock and till units are separated by an organic peat layer that represents the original ground surface prior to placement of the wrp the till is underlain by bedrock which constitutes the lower morien group comprising massive fine to medium grained sandstone with some interbedded mudstone conglomerate and thin coal seams bedrock strikes essentially from east to west and dips to the north at 30 to 40 a 1 5 m thick coal seam referred to as the mullins coal seam strikes roughly east to west beneath the southern portion of the wrp hydraulic conductivity values used in each geologic unit were obtained from geological investigations completed before and during remedial activities although geological logs for each unit were distributed across the sssa the range of measured hydraulic conductivities for each unit are within one to two orders of magnitude as shown in table 1 2 1 4 hydrogeology the sssa straddles a drainage divide between the irish brook watershed to the north and kilkenny lake brook watershed to the south this divide is indicated in fig 1 the west north and east north perimeter ditches of the wrp drain north into an alkaline treatment pond north pond and subsequently northwards into irish brook the east south perimeter ditch flows southwards to tributary 1 and tributary 2 before ultimately draining into kilkenny lake brook in terms of groundwater it has historically flown from the topographical high to the northeast of the wrp towards the wrp as it flows through the wrp it is deflected by a groundwater divide existing in the south of the wrp that is influenced by the presence of the mullins coal seam as a result groundwater flows predominantly from the wrp downgradient towards the west northwest and south 2 1 5 amd contamination extensive amd contamination was confirmed at the sssa prior to remediation geochemical analysis of groundwater collected from monitoring wells distributed across the sssa indicated amd impacted groundwater characterized by low ph and elevated concentrations of sulfate and dissolved metals as expected the amd contaminant plume coincides with the dominant groundwater flow directions with highest amd impacts observed within the pile footprint and in downgradient regions to the west northwest and south similarly surface water collected from the various water bodies in the sssa also confirmed the impacts of amd 2 2 site remediation and field monitoring the key site remedial objectives were the i protection of water quality in waterford lake ii protection of tributary 1 and tributary 2 to kilkenny lake brook with respect to fish habitat and iii improvement in the quality of surface water in irish brook 2 2 1 cover system a 0 15 m thick bedding sand layer was first placed over the exposed waste rock and then overlain with a 1 5 mm 60 mil thick hdpe geomembrane which is the most commonly used geomembrane at mine sites thiel and smith 2004 a protective layer of geotextile fabric was placed on top of the hdpe which in turn was overlain with a 0 5 m thick layer of imported till material the 0 5 m thickness was used to allow sufficient space for typical vegetation rooting above the hdpe liner this soil layer was then hydroseeded to promote vegetation growth and provide a geomorphically stable landform this cover type was installed to significantly reduce oxygen and water flux into the waste rock and eliminate contaminated surface water runoff from the previously exposed waste rock the limited amd generation and release would consequently improve groundwater and surface water quality and ensure remedial objectives are achieved 2 2 2 hydrogeochemical monitoring a comprehensive field monitoring program was performed at the sssa between 2012 and 2016 various instrumentation was installed to monitor key parameters in the atmosphere cover system waste rock groundwater and surface water fig 2 indicates the location of the field instrumentation a meteorological station automatically measures rainfall air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction barometric pressure and snowdepth an interflow collection system quantifies lateral flow throughout the cover while a weir measures surface runoff flows from the wrp four soil monitoring stations sms were located across the wrp to continuously monitor soil moisture suction and temperature at 9 depths within the cover and shallow waste rock ranging from 0 05 m to 2 37 m pore gas sampling ports were also installed at 3 depths 0 40 m to 0 90 m four continuous multi channel tubing cmt wells were installed through the waste rock and into the underlying shallow bedrock the cmt wells monitored soil temperature and differential pressure at larger depths within the waste rock 1 9 m to 9 5 m while also permitting pore gas sampling groundwater levels could be collected from the base of each cmt well along with water samples for geochemical analysis aside from pore gas and groundwater levels samples all aforementioned parameters were automatically monitored every hour between january 2012 and december 2016 manual collection of pore gas concentrations at each sms and cmt well and groundwater levels and geochemical analysis at each cmt well was conducted almost monthly between june 2012 and november 2016 see table 2 a full description of the field instrumentation and analysis of the measured parameters is presented by power et al 2017 a total of 42 monitoring wells are screened within the various geologic units within the sssa as shown in fig 1 3 wells are located upgradient to the northeast of the wrp 14 wells are located within the pile footprint and the remaining 25 wells are located in downgradient locations table 2 summarizes the sampling events for groundwater levels and geochemistry at the 42 monitoring wells the wells were sampled each spring summer and fall between august 2014 and july 2016 to monitor amd evolution following remediation amd conditions prior to the completion of remediation are available from sampling performed between february 2009 and november 2011 surface water sampling was also conducted at various locations along each watercourse in the sssa including the wrp perimeter ditches irish brook waterford lake tributary 1 and tributary 2 2 2 3 landform stability and vegetation vegetation surveys erosion surveys and aerial inspections were conducted annually to monitor the stability of the landform and evolution of the vegetation cover vegetation and changes in species composition on the wrp significantly influence the geomorphic stability and control erosion soil texture and water holding capacity furthermore root depth and densities need to be inspected to assess the risk of excessive root growth and penetration of the hdpe geomembrane 2 3 key field parameters the following subset of field parameters was required to develop calibrate and verify the transient flow and contaminant transport model i hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity values are available for each geologic unit in the sssa as shown in table 1 as evident the range of hydraulic conductivities for each unit is quite narrow and each unit is assumed to be homogeneous anisotropy is implemented using different values for horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity a horizontal vertical ratio kh kv of 10 is typically used in groundwater studies e g elango et al 2012 anderson et al 2015 and was assigned to the initial model domain ii hydraulic head the groundwater levels measured throughout the 5 year monitoring period are hereafter referred to as the observed hydraulic heads in the model iii groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is based on land use and or land cover three regions of differing land cover and recharge rates exist in the sssa forested urbanized and wrp as highlighted in fig 2 the recharge rates in forested and urbanized areas are established from previous studies in the sydney coalfield e g king et al 2003 based on various factors such as geology surface cover topography rainfall and snowfall recharge rates of 325 mm year and 175 mm year are assigned to the forested and urbanized regions respectively the recharge rate assigned to the wrp area is the net percolation np through the hdpe lined cover into the waste rock the primary mechanism for np to occur is leakage through defects that inevitably develop due to accidental punctures and improper seaming during installation e g rowe 2012 as a result the number and sizes of defects in the liner directly influence the leakage rate needham et al 2006 numerous studies at various landfills have demonstrated the mean defect density in hdpe liners ranges from 12 9 holes per hectare holes ha to 34 4 holes ha e g rollin et al 2002 nosko and touze foltz 2000 needham et al 2004 colucci and lavagnolo 1995 demonstrated that 50 of geomembrane holes had an area of 100 mm2 equivalent radius 5 64 mm numerous empirical and analytical equations have been established to estimate leakage rates through holes e g giroud et al 1992 touze foltz and giroud 2003 cartaud et al 2005 or defects coincident with or adjacent to wrinkles e g rowe et al 2012 for the study site it is assumed that the geomembrane was installed during adequate cooler temperatures to minimize wrinkle development e g take et al 2007 with only holes tears occuring touze foltz and giroud 2003 established the following solution for determining the leakage rate through circular defects with diameters ranging from 2 mm to 20 mm 1 q c a a 0 1 k s 0 74 h w 0 9 1 0 1 h w h s 0 95 where q is the leakage rate m3 s c a is the contact quality factor 0 21 for good and 1 15 for poor a is the area of the defect m2 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying material m s h w is the head of water above the liner m and h s is the thickness of the underlying material m eq 1 is widely used to estimate leakage rates through defective geomembranes e g li et al 2012 agbenyeku et al 2017 and is used to estimate recharge to the wrp in this study the head of water was determined by pore water pressure sensors at the smss the k s and h s for the bedding sand are 1 10 7 m s and 0 15 m respectively poor contact was assumed between the hdpe liner and the underlying bedding sand it was assumed that 20 holes ha exist with an area of 79 mm2 radius 5 mm which lies within the typical ranges reported in previous studies e g colucci and lavagnolo 1995 needham et al 2004 meiers and bradley 2017 annual water balances were developed to evaluate water dynamics in the cover system and were comprised of the following components e g meiers et al 2009 2 ppt r aet δ s lp np where δs is change in water storage within the cover material mm np was calculated as the residual of eq 2 with these water balance np rates similar to and thereby validating the np rates estimated in eq 1 a full description of the annual water balances developed for the site between 2012 and 2016 is provided in power et al 2017 table 3 presents the annual recharge rates for the differing land use regions in the study area in addition to the recharge rate for the covered wrp the rate that would exist with no cover is also presented this pre cover rate is based on the np ppt ratio of 34 demonstrated on similar waste rock fill material by king et al 2003 table 3 highlights the significant reduction in wrp recharge due to the cover system with a reduction in np from 34 to 3 of ppt monthly varying groundwater recharge was assigned to each recharge zone fig 2 of the transient model as a percentage of ppt the recharge and ppt measured each month throughout the 5 year monitoring period are used to develop a monthly recharge rate as a percentage of ppt to obtain long term predictions of recharge while accounting for climate change patterns a climate period of 30 or more years is used in this study the monthly recharge ppt is integrated with the monthly climate data recorded between january 1981 and december 2010 canadian climate normals to provide long term recharge for the predictive model iv amd contaminant source the geochemical source term for the wrp is taken from representative wells installed within the pile footprint the 4 monitoring wells screened in the waste rock sssa mw 101 sssa mw 104 sssa mw 108 and sssa mw 112 would normally provide the most representative water quality seeping from the wrp however each of the 4 wells were dry during all sampling events and wells screened below the waste rock are instead used of these 14 wells the sampling density at the 4 cmt wells 30 samples is much higher than at the 10 monitoring wells 9 samples between june 2012 and december 2016 and would provide improved calibration and verification as a result the geochemical data at the 4 cmt wells is used to represent the amd source sulfate is commonly used as a key amd indicator or geochemical tracer due to its high persistence in groundwater relative to other amd indicators such as iron and aluminum sulfate concentrations at the 4 cmt wells are used to represent the amd source in the wrp while sulfate concentrations at all 42 monitoring wells are used to represent the amd groundwater plume distributed across the sssa 3 model development a 3 d transient groundwater flow and contaminant transport numerical model was developed using feflow 6 2 to analyze and predict long term groundwater flow and amd contaminant at the study site feflow is a 2 d and 3 d finite element modeling package that can simulate steady or transient state fluid density coupled flow and mass transport diersch 2014 it is widely used in hydrogeological studies e g bordeleau et al 2008 elango et al 2012 chopra et al 2013 3 1 model discretization the full sssa area of 12 km2 was discretized into a 3 d finite element mesh consisting of 297 108 triangular finite element cells the modeled domain integrates both the saturated zone corresponding to the till and underlying bedrock aquifers and the unsaturated zone corresponding to the upper part of the till and the wrp mesh discretization was optimized based on site information with finer discretization employed near the wrp and water bodies fig 3a presents the 3 d model domain while fig 3b and c present 2 d vertical cross sections the model domain was subdivided vertically into 18 layers with variable thickness to represent the various geologic units the top 5 layers represent the overburden within the pile footprint which comprises cover material waste rock and organic material peat layer 6 represents the till unit that both underlies the wrp and is the overburden outside the pile footprint the next 12 layers are used to represent the shallow intermediate and deep bedrock units table 1 lists each geologic unit and associated model layer 3 2 boundary and initial conditions the modeled area is based on the extent of the sssa which is delineated on all sides by specific hydrogeological and physical boundaries fig 3a indicates the boundary conditions used as the southwestern and eastern boundaries are watershed boundaries they are both considered as a no flow boundary the western boundary is also considered as a no flow boundary the northern boundary corresponds with irish brook as the streambed elevation of irish brook is assumed to coincide with the till shallow bedrock interface layers 6 and 7 in the northern boundary are considered as specified head boundary with all remaining layers considered as a no flow boundary the southern boundary corresponds with tributary 1 and is considered as a specified head boundary in all layers similarly the boundary along waterford lake is considered as a specified head boundary which corresponds to the measured surface water level in the lake i e 25 5 masl the base of the model domain where it is assumed that groundwater flow is near horizontal and water does not leave or enter is considered as a no flow boundary a river head boundary condition was applied to all surface water bodies inside the study area including ponds and drainage ditches the top boundary condition representing the land surface exposed to the atmosphere is expressed as a transient flux equal to seasonal variations of groundwater recharge the initial hydraulic head distribution for the model was based on groundwater elevations from the starting point of the 4 cmt wells june 2012 and 42 monitoring wells mean february 2009 to november 2011 3 3 groundwater flow model 3 3 1 model calibration the groundwater flow model was first calibrated in steady state conditions to achieve the best correlation between the simulated hydraulic heads and the observed hydraulic heads in each of the till shallow bedrock and intermediate bedrock units the primary variables that were adjusted within an allowable range for the trial and error calibration were boundary condition hydraulic conductivity and groundwater recharge for example the western boundary was initially assumed as a no flow boundary but was altered to a specified head boundary during model calibration the calibration was performed until the mean error of simulated versus observed heads was minimized as much as possible in all units in fig 4 a summary of the calibration is presented in the form of a scatter plot diagram of 46 simulated heads versus observed heads it is evident that the simulated heads correlate well with the observed heads with a root mean squared rms error of 2 1 m this is well within the acceptable range and is similar to other studies e g 2 9 m in orban et al 2010 3 3 2 model verification the calibrated steady state model was then verified against the time varying hydraulic heads the calibrated steady state conditions including hydraulic heads and hydraulic conductivity were used as initial conditions for the transient flow model the transient model was simulated for the time period between june 2012 and december 2016 which coincides with the field monitoring period and the availability of observed hydraulic heads see table 2 since a significant amount of the hydraulic heads at the cmt wells were measured monthly a 30 day time step was used while the transient model was mainly used for verification some minor trial and error adjustments calibration were made to fine tune some of the time varying input parameters such as variable head boundary and groundwater recharge table 4 presents the initial and calibrated horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities used in the model a comparative analysis between the temporal variation in simulated and observed hydraulic heads indicated a strong correlation fig 5 presents the simulated and observed heads versus time at selected wells in each geologic unit at key groundwater flow regions in the study area beneath the wrp downgradient west of the wrp and downgradient south of the wrp it is evident that the simulated heads correlate well with the observed heads in each region and unit over the 5 year time period for instance seasonal variations in observed heads are repeated in the simulated heads at all wells the cmt wells re a good indicator of correlation quality due to their high sampling density larger discrepancies are evident at some wells which can be expected since the calibrated steady state model assumed homogeneity in each geologic unit and does not account for local variations in geological conditions fig 6 presents a scatter plot diagram of simulated versus observed hydraulic heads at all 46 cmt and monitoring wells over time good agreement is evident between the simulated and observed heads at all locations and units the rms error was 2 m it is evident that the transient flow model has been well calibrated and verified to observed head values over the 5 year monitoring period 3 4 contaminant transport model 3 4 1 transport process sulfate transport in groundwater is assumed to follow an advection and dispersion diffusion process furthermore sulfate is assumed to be non reactive in groundwater and no retardation occurs transport parameters such as effective porosity molecular diffusion longitudinal dispersivity and transverse dispersivity that are necessary to consider in each geologic unit are presented in table 5 as site specific values are not available established literature values are used e g mcwhorter and sunada 1977 domenico and schwartz 1990 schulze makuch 2005 3 4 2 long term source function the sulfate concentrations measured at the 4 cmt wells between june 2012 and december 2016 are shown in fig 7a preliminary analysis identified a clear decreasing trend with seasonal variations at all wells with cmt 2 and cmt 4 displaying the most significant sulfate reductions over time the location of these wells corresponds to the prominent groundwater flow rates and pathways to the west and northwest cmt 2 and to the south cmt 4 of the wrp seasonal variations are related to the humid continental climate at the site for instance lower concentrations occur during high ppt periods i e spring melt in april and may and high rainfall in october and november which causes increased dilution by higher velocity upgradient groundwater to predict future sulfate concentrations for the long term source term the observed monitoring data can be combined with suitable time series analysis the multiplicative decomposition method is an analysis method that separates the time series into a trend component that is a smooth function of time a seasonal component that represents a pattern that is repeated annually and an error component that is independent for each data point e g worrall and burt 1998 sizirici and tansel 2010 laner et al 2012 sizirici and tansel 2010 applied the decomposition method to numerous collected leachate quality parameters from a landfill including total dissolved solids iron and quantity the method provided adequate predictions of the future conditions of the parameters and a forecast on the duration of the post closure period of the closed landfill in this study the statistics package minitab 18 minitab 15 statguide minitab inc 2007 was used to apply the time series decomposition method to the observed sulfate concentrations and generate future sulfate source term conditions fig 7b presents the observed and forecast sulfate concentrations for each cmt well the background concentration level bcl is 25 mg l which is based on the upgradient groundwater quality measured at the upgradient wells scms mw 01 02 and 03 a good fit is evident at all wells between the observed data and forecast data between june 2012 and december 2016 the accuracy of the time series analysis can be expressed by the mean absolute deviation mad and mean absolute percentage error mape which are expressed in mg l and respectively the mad for cmt 1 cmt 2 cmt 3 and cmt 4 are 98 1 14 1 7 4 and 71 5 respectively while the mape are 17 9 71 6 55 8 and 95 1 respectively these parameters confirmed the suitability of the selected time series model used and the adequacy of the future sulfate projections e g mape values 80 are considered an adequate fit e g sizirici and tansel 2010 from fig 7b it is estimated that sulfate concentrations at cmt 1 will gradually decrease to the bcl by the year 2023 the sulfate concentrations at cmt 2 cmt 3 and cmt 4 decreased to the bcl during the field monitoring period in 2014 2014 and 2016 respectively which was already observed in the field data in fig 7a the amd source in the wrp is represented by sulfate concentrations at sparsely distributed point locations to maintain the spatial and temporal variation in sulfate between all cmt wells the wrp was divided into separate polygons with each polygon representing the wrp volume and sulfate source for each cmt well see fig 2 the source distribution over the wrp was estimated from the cmt wells using the thiessen polygon method the sulfate concentrations were assigned to the appropriate polygon within the wrp footprint to the waste rock layers 2 3 and 4 table 1 the predicted sulfate concentrations from fig 7b are applied throughout the 50 year simulation period when the sulfate source at each cmt well reaches the bcl it attains the bcl value for the remainder of the simulation period 3 4 3 model calibration and verification the calibrated transient state flow model was used as the basis for the transient transport model some trial and error calibration was performed as a first step on the observed monitoring data between june 2012 and december 2016 the transport parameters in table 5 were slightly varied to improve the correlation as much as possible between the observed and simulated sulfate concentrations at all well locations fig 8 presents the simulated and observed sulfate concentrations over time at the same wells presented for the hydraulic heads in fig 5 a good correlation exists between observed and simulated sulfate concentrations in each region and geologic unit over the 5 year time period for instance seasonal variations in observed sulfate concentrations are repeated in the simulated concentrations at all wells the cmt wells have the highest sampling density and provide a strong indicator of correlation quality the maximum deviations occurred at wells beneath the wrp particularly in the till and intermediate bedrock this is likely related to the use of the 4 cmt wells in the shallow bedrock to represent the sulfate source in the wrp and therefore may not correlate with sulfate concentrations in the other geological units the geologic properties of each unit is homogeneous in the model and do not represent the heterogeneity of the sulfate distribution in the observed data furthermore the source for the entire wrp is represented by measured concentrations at 4 sparse locations despite these inherent simplifications in the model a strong correlation generally exists between observed and simulated sulfate concentrations fig 9 presents a scatter plot diagram of simulated versus observed sulfate concentrations at all cmt and monitoring wells over time good agreement is observed at all locations with an rms error of 2 m it is evident that the transient flow and transport model has been well calibrated and verified to observed head and sulfate values over the 5 year monitoring period the calibrated and verified transient groundwater flow and transport model was then used to simulate the evolution of amd distribution at the sssa the predictive simulations were run for 100 years using the final conditions established during the calibration and verification process the long term simulations provide an indication of remedial performance and or information on key milestones where concentrations are decreasing below specified guidelines values and or bcls 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater flow regime fig 10a presents the observed piezometric surface and flow directions in the till shallow bedrock and intermediate bedrock units in november 2016 which is the last field sampling event available in all units groundwater flows from the topographic high to the northeast of the wrp in the till and shallow bedrock a groundwater divide exists in an east west trend through the southern portion of the wrp which generally corresponds with the presence of the low permeability mullins coal seam and with the surface water divide between the irish brook and kilkenny lake brook watersheds therefore groundwater flowing through the wrp is deflected by the groundwater divide with groundwater in the northern portion flowing in a west to northwestern direction towards waterford lake and irish brook while groundwater in the southern portion flows in a south to southeastern direction towards tributary 1 and tributary 2 in the intermediate bedrock flow system all groundwater flows towards the south and southeast fig 10b also presents the simulated piezometric surface and flow directions in each geological unit it closely matches the observed groundwater flow regime of the 3 units the best correlations occur in the till and intermediate bedrock the model generally over estimates the hydraulic heads south of the wrp larger discrepancies occur in the shallow bedrock with simulated heads higher than observed heads in the southeast and lower than observed heads in the west 2 m difference 4 2 long term prediction of amd distribution 4 2 1 amd impacts to groundwater fig 11 presents the predicted long term spatial and temporal distribution of the sulfate contaminant plume at the sssa after 1 year the spatial variation of wrp source concentration is evident within the wrp footprint in each underlying geological unit with higher concentrations at cmt 1 and cmt 4 compared to cmt 2 and cmt 3 as sulfate seeps from the waste rock into the underlying groundwater it disperses due to differing flow directions and velocities as expected the plume follows the direction of groundwater flow indicated in fig 10 with highest downgradient concentrations existing in the west towards waterford lake and in the southeast towards tributary 1 and 2 although the highest sulfate concentrations occur in the till unit concentrations are also high in the shallow and intermediate bedrock units due to high vertical hydraulic gradients fig 11 indicates that the sulfate plume concentrations gradually reduces over time particularly during the first 10 years thereby highlighting the immediate effectiveness of remediation with an hdpe cover system at 20 years the sulfate concentrations have reached or are approaching bcls within all geological units to better analyze amd evolution and cover performance over time fig 12 presents the sulfate concentrations at the same downgradient wells selected for the transient sulfate calibrations in fig 8 in addition to the bcl black dotted line the canadian drinking water quality cdwq guideline for sulfate 500 mg l is used black dashed line to provide a reference for groundwater quality fig 12 confirms that sulfate concentrations at all wells in both downgradient regions were already below the cdwq guideline at the start of the simulation period as shown in fig 7 cmt 2 and cmt 3 exhibit relatively low sulfate concentrations compared to cmt 1 and cmt 4 as a result downgradient sulfate concentrations to the west of the wrp which interact with cleaner groundwater flowing from cmt 2 and cmt 3 decrease more rapidly and reach bcl within 20 years in contrast groundwater flowing to the south interacts with cmt 1 and cmt 4 resulting in a slower rate of reduction over time nevertheless all wells to the south reach bcl within 40 years it is evident from fig 12 that the evolution of sulfate concentrations corresponds to the sulfate reduction term shown in fig 7 4 2 2 amd impacts to surface water surface water sampling conducted during the 5 year field monitoring program confirmed significant decreases in sulfate concentrations in all watercourses within the sssa the surface water sampling locations indicated in fig 2 are associated with the three watercourses related to the key site remedial objectives sw 01 irish brook sw 02 waterford lake and sw 03 tributary 2 to kilkenny lake brook power et al 2017 demonstrated that the objectives were already being achieved i water quality in irish brook has significantly improved relative to the baseline sulfate concentration of 400 mg l sulfate equal to 31 mg l in november 2016 ii water quality in waterford lake is protected below the threshold of 17 mg l sulfate equal to 5 4 mg l in november 2016 and iii water quality in tributary 2 is protected within respect to fish habitat threshold of 500 mg l sulfate equal to 4 4 mg l in november 2016 significant reductions in amd impacts to surface water bodies is due to i reductions in amd loading from covered wrp to groundwater resulting in improved groundwater quality discharging to surface water and ii elimination of contaminated surface water runoff from previously exposed waste rock that is now overlain with the hdpe lined cover although detailed modeling of the surface water bodies is outside the scope of this study long term stability of the surface water quality with respect to the site remedial objectives can be indirectly obtained by the developed flow and transport model in addition to the monitoring well locations in fig 12 the evolution of sulfate concentrations at locations adjacent to sw 01 sw 02 and sw 03 is analyzed fig 13 confirms that groundwater quality improves continuously over time therefore it is evident that surface water quality and site remedial objectives will continue to meet specified performance criteria over the long term 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess key input parameters to the model np aquifer recharge and hydraulic conductivity an analysis of sulfate concentrations in groundwater adjacent to the key surface water sampling locations is utilized as shown in fig 14 np was varied from the base case value of 3 ppt to a minimum of 1 ppt representative of a near intact cover with limited defects and a maximum of 34 ppt representative of conditions with no cover e g king et al 2003 it is evident from fig 14a that decreasing or increasing np does not affect sulfate concentrations at irish brook which is expected as the sulfate plume does not flow northwards towards irish brook a decrease in np from 3 ppt to 1 ppt has very little change on sulfate concentrations at waterford lake and kilkenny lake brook increasing np to 34 ppt results in a decrease in sulfate concentration at waterford lake which is due to dilution of the low sulfate concentration source seeping from the wrp in this direction cmt 2 and cmt 3 by the increased seepage water volume resulting in a lower sulfate loading from the wrp in contrast an increase in np slightly increases the sulfate concentration observed at kilkenny lake brook the sulfate load seeping from the wrp in this direction cmt 1 and cmt 4 is much higher due to a combination of high concentration and high seepage rate to analyze the sensitivity of the model results to groundwater recharge the base case recharges i e forested cover 325 mm industrial cover 175 mm wrp cover 50 mm were varied by 10 fig 14b presents the variation in groundwater recharge and again shows little to no change in sulfate concentrations near irish brook at waterford lake an increase in recharge results in a significant decrease in sulfate while a decrease in recharge results in a significant increase in sulfate this highlights the sensitivity of the sulfate concentration at waterford lake to dilution by groundwater recharge particularly in the forested area between the wrp and waterford lake similar patterns occurred at kilkenny lake brook though the changes were much lower due to the increased distance and the observation point at sw 03 not being directly along the flow direction fig 14c presents the variation in sulfate concentration following changes to hydraulic conductivity at every location and geologic unit by 0 3 orders of magnitude while sulfate concentrations at irish brook show little change sulfate concentrations at waterford lake and kilkenny lake brook exhibit more significant changes an increase in hydraulic conductivity results in an increase in groundwater flow velocity and dilution and a corresponding decrease in sulfate concentration similarly a decrease in hydraulic conductivity results in a decrease in groundwater dilution and increased sulfate concentrations the magnitude of these changes in sulfate concentration are more significant at kilkenny lake brook due to the increased distance and flow volume from the wrp 4 3 landform stability and vegetation although the wrp has relatively low slopes some erosion was visible at sparse locations this is due to the absence of a drainage layer above the hdpe with the associated high pore water pressures and saturation and the loss in shear strength in the soil layer resulting in localized surface ponding and discharge areas vegetation surveys indicated that the vegetative composition is thriving with soil profiles showing that root depths do not exceed 20 cm and thereby do not provide a risk to hdpe liner integrity 4 4 limitations a number of simplifying assumptions were used in this numerical study it is acknowledged that wrps and geologic units can be complex and heterogeneous and the assumption of homogeneity at the presented study site is simplistic this assumption simplifies water flow and contaminant distribution in the wrp and receiving environment hydraulic conductivity is a critical parameter in groundwater flow and contaminant transport and poorly representative values can lead to significant underestimation or overestimation of hydraulic heads as evident during calibration of the study site model furthermore associated discrepancies in groundwater flow velocities can lead to inaccuracies in contaminant concentrations which is particularly important for long term predictions nevertheless it is common in large and complex study areas to assume representative mean values an extensive geological database was available for the study site and a narrow range of conductivity values existed the mean values used were carefully selected and subsequently adjusted during the model development to obtain a well calibrated and verified groundwater flow and contaminant transport model knowledge on the quality of amd water seeping from the base of the wrp is essential to accurately assess and predict amd release depletion rates within the wrp and loading to the receiving environment at the study site waste rock pore water samples could not be obtained so groundwater samples from the underlying shallow bedrock were used as a result amd loading is likely underestimated as it based on groundwater concentrations that may have already diminished due to dilution with upgradient groundwater to more accurately access the annual generation and release of amd to groundwater various kinetic and reactive aspects can be incorporated current work involves laboratory experiments with humidity cells and leaching columns on waste rock samples extracted from the wrp to assess various kinetic aspects such as the velocity of sulfide oxidation and metal leaching rates the contaminant transport component simulated advective and dispersive diffusive transport of sulfate in groundwater it was assumed that the sulfate was non reactive and no retardation occurs future work will couple the phreeqc geochemical reaction model charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the feflow model to include kinetic and multiphase transfer processes for improved predictions of long term amd generation release and transport from the wrp a challenging component of long term predictive modeling studies is incorporating future variations in climate which significantly impact key parameters such as groundwater recharge including np and acidity loading at the study site ppt and recharge were measured over a 5 year monitoring period and used to estimate monthly recharge as a percentage of ppt a 30 year climatic database 1981 to 2010 was then used to provide long term ppt that accounts for climatic variations and corresponding long term recharge using the monthly percentage of ppt additionally long term sulfate concentrations seeping from the wrp were estimated from time series analysis of the sulfate concentrations measured during the 5 year monitoring period soil atmosphere and seepage models calibrated to measured field data may improve future predictions of recharge and seepage rates in covered wrps while this study has demonstrated that hdpe lined cover systems can be highly effective for reducing long term amd impacts to the receiving environment the integrity and service life of the geomembrane need to be considered oxidative degradation of the hdpe over time will decrease properties such as strength and stress crack resistance rowe 2012 it should be noted that different hdpe liners will have different antioxidant packages and depletion times which directly influence service life for instance hdpe thickness has a significant effect on antioxidant depletion with 2 5 mm thick hdpe taking approximately 50 longer to deplete than 1 5 mm thick hdpe rowe et al 2010 service temperature has a significant effect on hdpe performance with higher temperatures resulting in shorter service life rowe and ewais 2015 while the wrp in this study lies within a humid continental climate with temperatures typically 30 c wrps in other climates such as semi arid or arid will experience much higher temperatures and shorter hdpe service life a detailed discussion on the service life of hdpe is provided by rowe 2012 5 conclusions in this study a numerical investigation was performed to investigate the long term effectiveness of hdpe lined cover systems installed over acid generating wrps a remediated former mining site in nova scotia canada contains a wrp that was overlain with an hdpe cover in 2011 a 3 d groundwater flow and contaminant transport model of the study site including the wrp and environmental receptors was developed in feflow key hydrogeological and geochemical field data collected during extensive post remediation field monitoring between january 2012 and december 2016 were used to effectively calibrate and verify the model the cover system generated a 90 reduction in water flux into the wrp i e 512 to 50 mm year resulting in reduced amd generation and seepage from the wrp into groundwater the model was used to simulate the long term spatial and temporal evolution of amd over 100 years results indicated continual improvements in groundwater quality over time with groundwater quality reaching background water quality i e 25 mg l within 40 years although the model confirmed groundwater quality will improve over time key site remedial objectives were related to surface water quality since the 5 year field monitoring program confirmed that each remedial objective related to surface water quality was already being achieved the groundwater model was used to confirm that groundwater quality adjacent to the relevant surface water bodies will be maintained and or continue to improve over the long term therefore although surface water modeling was beyond the scope of this study the groundwater model was able to indirectly indicate that key remedial objectives will be achieved this study has demonstrated the long term effectiveness of remedial activities involving hdpe lined cover systems to significantly reduce the impacts of amd on a wrp receiving environment while the study focused on one field site the approach and findings are applicable to other wrp sites furthermore it should be noted that the performance of the cover system will evolve over time in response to climatic conditions and site specific physical chemical and biological processes that are extremely difficult to predict periodic in situ monitoring and physical studies of processes such as freeze thaw

1644,the effects of acidity and salinity on solute transport in porous media are important to a diverse range of fields from seawater intrusion to nuclear waste storage recent transport experiments in quartz sand show the difficulty in capturing the coupling of acidity and salinity under acidic conditions for this system here we study the ability of different surface complexation models to capture this coupling through an analysis of the reactive transport equations in the limit of no diffusion this chromatographic analysis leads to a graphical representation of the full set of solutions in the phase plane thus allowing a comprehensive comparison of the transport behavior arising from different scms the analysis shows that the predicted coupling is improved by including amphoteric behavior of the quartz surface the inclusion of a secondary proton sorption reaction increases the magnitude of surface charge under acidic conditions strengthening the acidity salinity coupling this suggests that even though the overall surface is negative above the point of zero charge positively charged sites play an important role in the reactive transport of acidity and salinity keywords reactive transport chromatography electric double layer hyperbolic theory surface complexation triple layer model 1 introduction to first order the surface charge and therefore chemical behavior of reactive media is determined by aqueous acidity and salinity these variables are coupled through the effects of ionic strength on the activity of aqueous species and the electrical properties of the diffuse layer as well as competitive sorption of ions for surface sites meeussen et al 1996 much work has been done in the development of surface chemistry models which can mechanistically capture this behavior so called surface complexation models scms sposito 2004 among the most advanced are the triple layer model tlm and the three plane model tpm these models have been used to successfully account for the acidity salinity coupling of many oxide surfaces in batch settings however current chemical model conventions for the quartz surface cannot quantitatively capture the coupling in reactive transport systems mcneece and hesse 2017 the error in predicted breakthrough curves is most noticeable in the acidic regime recent studies have shown that this failure is independent of parameterization suggesting that the functional form of the surface chemistry model is inadequate an understanding of the role of the surface chemistry model s formulation is therefore needed towards this effort we present a chromatographic analysis of the coupled acidity salinity transport system under conditions appropriate for reactive transport experiments of mcneece and hesse 2017 much scrutiny has been given to the surface behavior of quartz yet controversy exists as to the nature and abundance of surface sites spectroscopic and titration experiments of quartz suggest that the surface is negatively charged over a large range of ph values ahmed 1966 anderson and wickersheim 1964 bolt 1957 koretsky et al 1997 li and bruyn 1966 morrow and cody 1976 classic models of the quartz surface therefore consider a one site formulation such that the surface can be only negative or neutral via a single proton sorption reaction however it is fairly well established that the point of zero charge of the quartz surface is around ph 3 according to kosmulski 2001 therefore a positive charge is possible and it is reasonable to consider two protonation reactions in a minority of other studies a more complex behavior has been reported suggesting a further proton reaction on a second site duval et al 2002 leung et al 2009 ong et al 1992 pokrovsky et al 2006 zoback 2012 clearly controversy remains as to the proper formulation of the surface chemistry model of quartz here we explore the single site formulation through a parameter adjustment of the two step model and determine the role of surface reaction on transport behavior this example will serve as a template to encourage the further comparison of model formulation through chromatographic analysis the mathematical basis of multiple solute chromatography was developed for charged ions undergoing langmuir type sorption and ion exchange charbeneau 1981 1988 lake 1989 rhee et al 1970 temple 1983 more recently chromatographic analysis was conducted on ph dependent sorption prigiobbe et al 2012 and to the single component acidity system using scms mcneece and hesse 2016 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1994 here we extend chromatographic theory to the coupled acidity salinity transport system the analysis allows a graphical representation of transport behavior as a function of injected and initial composition this visual tool is known as the hodograph plane and facilitates a direct comparison of the transport behavior for a given surface complexation model and the concomitant parameterization below we introduce the reactive transport model being composed of the surface chemistry model and conservation law we then present the chromatographic analysis and hodograph plane finally we use the hodograph plane to explore the role of surface chemistry model formulation on predicted transport behavior by a comparison to column experiments 2 reactive transport model here we introduce the chemical model of the coupled acidity salinity system in quartz sand and show the resulting sorption isotherms we then introduce the transport equations of the conserved quantities 2 1 surface complexation model in order to capture the acidity salinity coupling in reactive media both aqueous and surface speciation must be considered in the simple system the auto ionization of water is the most relevant aqueous reaction 1 h2o h oh the surface speciation is characterized by the sorption of protons sodium and chloride below are the reactions and their associated equilibrium constants 2 sio h sioh k h 1 3 sioh h sioh 2 k h 2 4 sio n a sio n a k n a 5 sioh 2 c l sioh 2 c l k c l where denotes the quartz mineral structure the quartz surface has a point of zero charge near ph 3 kosmulski 2001 therefore in the literature it is often assumed that reactions 3 and 5 are negligible at higher ph values and are dropped for the mathematical analysis we will adopt this convention in the discussion section this assumption will be relaxed in order to explore the role of these reactions on the mathematical solution structure to determine the equilibrium distribution of the above species the chemical reactions are coupled to a given scm these models attempt to account for the contribution of electrostatic interactions at the mineral surface in determining the reactivity of surface sites among the most robust of these models is the triple layer model tlm westall and hohl 1980 offer a comprehensive summary of this model and others the tpm approximates the mineral water interface by three capacitors in series including the diffuse layer the inner layer capacitors are segmented by planes of charge accumulation the mineral surface charge is determined by the sorption of small ions i e h and oh which sorb directly to the surface sites such sorption reactions are known as inner sphere surface complexes in the case of protons the size is not such that a charge distribution is required larger ions such as sodium typically retain their solvation shell the volume of solvation waters geometrically inhibits direct binding to a surface site and limits the uptake to a discrete distance from the plane of the surface sites therefore such ions are considered to sorb at a distance of roughly the size of a water molecule plus the radius of the bare ion i e the radius of the hydrated ion from the mineral surface and are called outer sphere surface complexes this plane of adsorption is known as the inner helmholtz plane ihp because of the distance separating the mineral surface and the sorbed species outer sphere complexes when treated as point charges contribute their charge to the ihp at some distance beyond the ihp a diffuse ion cloud balances the cumulative charge of the mineral surface and ihp this plane is known as the outer helmholtz plane ohp the region between the mineral surface and the ohp is known as the stern layer the region beyond the ohp is known as the diffuse layer the charge of the mineral surface and ihp are mathematically defined as linear combinations of the charged species residing on each plane 6 σ 0 σ sio f s a sio

give mole fraction following the convention of sverjensky 2005 the inner and outer stern layers are modeled as capacitors with constant capacitance density the theoretical value of the capacitance density depends on surface geometry and the temperature of the system the diffuse layer is considered to have a variable capacitance density as determined by properties of the bulk fluid such as ionic strength and temperature as well as surface geometry these variables also influence the permittivity of the diffuse layer the charge potential relationships of these three layers within the tlm for a

the diffuse layer in a previous work we have demonstrated that this is not the case for the material studied here mcneece and hesse 2017 the present use of eq 10 is appropriate only for symmetrical 1

in the transport model it is convenient to consider the aqueous and surface concentrations of species separately as their transport behavior differs namely sorbed species are considered to be immobile and aqueous species move with the fluid therefore we introduce the variables 15 c na h oh c na c h 16 s σ sio sio na σ sio sioh s n a s h where c and s are the vectors of total aqueous and surface concentrations respectively the relationship between the total aqueous and sorbed concentrations determines transport behavior mcneece and hesse 2016 representative sorption isotherms are shown in fig 1 parameter values are presented in table 1 values of k h 1 k na c 1 and c 2 are taken from hiemstra et al 1989 the approach involves the music model to mechanistically determine the equilibrium constant k h 1 and optimizes the other parameters by minimizing the error between the model and batch titration data produced by bolt 1957 this model parameterization will be referred to as the reference model notably in the reference model the value of the second capacitor is very high which reduces a tlm or tpm to a basic stern version of the interface it can be seen from fig 1 that the sorption isotherms show typical competitive sorption behavior in that the sorbed concentration of an element increases with aqueous concentration while decreasing with an increase in competing ions the inflection point in both s h and s na is characteristic of ph dependent sorption processes and has interesting implications for transport behavior as will be discussed below 2 2 conservation laws here we consider the 1d reaction advection diffusion equation for the conserved quantities of acidity and salinity at local chemical equilibrium 17 i c s c c τ c z p e 1 c z z 0 where i is the identity matrix z x l and τ qt ϕal are dimensionless space and time respectively and p e ql ϕa d is the péclet number where q is the volumetric flow rate a is the column cross sectional area l is the column length and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor for each component appelo and postma 2005 the dimensionless time τ 1 is equivalent to the time required for the injection of one pore volume

péclet numbers are o 1 0 3 mcneece and hesse 2016 thus we consider the hyperbolic limit of eq 17 p e 19 i c s c c τ c z 0 a typical column flood experiment procedure can be represented as a riemann problem with a piece wise constant initial condition having a step about the origin 20 c z τ 0 c inj z 0 c ini z 0 where c ini and c inj are the initial and injected concentrations respectively 3 solution by method of characteristics here we detail the procedure for the semi analytic solution of the reactive transport model using the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws which is the equivalent to the theory of chromatography for reactive transport we are interested in predicting experimental effluent histories in reactive transport problems the effluent history is typically observed and the nonlinearity occurs in the accumulation term it is therefore natural to follow the chromatographic convention and describe the solution in terms of retardation rather than velocity rhee et al 2001a b 3 1 eigenvalue problem the form of the reactive transport model eq 19 and the initial condition eq 20 allows the introduction of the retardation as the similarity variable 21 η τ z substitution of η into eq 19 reduces the system of partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations in the form of an eigenvalue problem 22 i c s c θ p c r p 0 where θ p c η τ z are the eigenvalues and 23 r p c d c d η p are the eigenvectors here we consider a 2 2 system of coupled equations for the transport of acidity and salinity resulting in two sets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors p 1 2 below we demonstrate computationally that the eigenvalues are real and distinct 0 θ 1 θ 2 so that the system of equations is strictly hyperbolic leveque 1992 this results in a front structure composed of two waves w 1 and w 2 connecting the initial c ini and injected state c inj these waves are joined at an intermediate state c int and are ordered from the fastest to the slowest 24 c ini w 1 c int w 2 c inj the solution of the transport problem requires the determination of the intermediate state c int and the wave structures w 1 and w 2 the eigenvectors give the composition variation along these waves while eigenvalues give the retardation of their arrival time we will see that there are four possible wave structures a smooth variation in composition known as a rarefaction r a sharp variation known as a shock s and two composite waves which contain both a smooth and a discontinuous change in concentration r s and s r known as rarefaction shocks and shock rarefactions respectively here the symbol ordering corresponds to segment arrival order 3 2 eigenvalues and retardations a closed form solution to the eigenvalue problem is intractable because local chemical equilibrium involves the complex set of nonlinear equations eqs 6 16 therefore eq 22 is solved numerically and the two eigenvalues are plotted in fig 2 here a smaller eigenvalue is equivalent to a faster travel speed lower retardation the smallest eigenvalue θ 1 is approximately unity and is related to the breakthrough of the salinity front in contrast θ 2 is a strong function of both the acidity and salinity with a local maximum near neutral acidity fig 2 shows that over the composition space investigated here 1 θ 1 θ 2 this implies that the first wave never arrives before a tracer breaks through and that the second wave is always delayed such that an intermediate state exists from a previous analysis it is clear that the magnitude of the eigenvalue θ 2 is directly proportional to the derivative of the isotherm in fig 1a mcneece and hesse 2016 2017 prigiobbe et al 2013 scheidegger et al 1994 an inflection point in the sorption isotherm is typical of the proton sorption system prigiobbe et al 2012 and leads to the local maximum in θ 2 that is observed in fig 2b hence the hyperbolic system is non genuinely non linear leveque 1992 and allows the formation of composite waves the implications of the inflection point for transport will be considered below and have been discussed for a system with constant salinity mcneece and hesse 2016 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1994 3 3 eigenvectors and composition pathways eigenvectors give the variation of composition along the waves which compose the solution structure an integration of the eigenvectors gives the composition paths also known as integral curves γ p 25 γ p c o 0 η r p c d η where c o is a starting point in composition space the reactive transport model is a 2 2 system thus there are two sets of composition paths which are shown in fig 3 all rarefaction waves r p lie along these composition paths plots of the dependent variables c h and c na are referred to as phase or hodograph planes in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws leveque 1992 in chromatography and reactive transport fig 3 is called composition space rhee et al 2001b 3 4 shocks and hugoniot loci shocks form in the hyperbolic limit when the displacing composition has a lower retardation θ p than the composition being displaced this results in a triple valued problem which is replaced by a mass conserving shock according to the rankine hugoniot jump condition 26 θ p c c 1 s c s c c c where θ p c c is the retardation of the shock and superscripts and correspond to the composition on either side of the jump rhee et al 2001a b in the case where diffusive terms are also considered such waves will widen until an equilibrium width is achieved the width being determined by the hydrodynamic dispersion rhee et al 1971 the right hand side of eq 26 can be rewritten as the following non linear scalar algebraic equation 27 s h s h c h c h s n a s n a c n a c n a 0 given either c or c and solving for the other gives the locus of points that satisfy the conditions for a mass conserving shock known as the hugoniot loci ℋ p the form of eq 27 makes clear that the discontinuity in each composition arrives with the same retardation θ p the hugoniot loci for several points are shown in fig 4 the hugoniot loci must be tangent to the composition paths at the point under consideration in the system considered the hugoniot loci are approximately coincident with the composition paths throughout the hodograph plane and therefore only the integral curves are shown in the subsequent hodograph planes however in systems with highly curved composition paths integral curves and hugoniot loci often deviate johansen et al 2005 leveque 1992 prigiobbe et al 2013 3 5 composite waves and inflection loci the sorption isotherms shown in fig 1a and d have inflection points near neutral ph c h 0 this is due to the aqueous reaction 1 and marks the transition from c h h to c h oh mcneece and hesse 2016 this leads to the local maximum observed in θ 2 as seen in fig 2b equivalent inflection loci i p can be defined in the two component system as follows 28 θ p r p c 0 and are shown in fig 5 the inflection loci i 1 and i 2 along c h 0 are nearly coincident and mark a local maximum in both θ 1 and θ 2 a second branch of i 1 in the basic regime marks a small local minimum in θ 1 which is replotted in more detail in fig 6 a wave w p can be composite if the composition path crosses i p if the solution involves a composite wave an additional concentration corresponding to the transition in wave type must be determined this composition c is found by equating the eigenvalue θ p c along the rarefaction with the retardation of the connecting shock given by 29 θ p c 1 s c s c c c where c is the composition connected to c across the shock in problems with a single component this construction is equivalent to finding the cord that is tangent to the sorption isotherm mcneece and hesse 2016 scheidegger et al 1994 3 6 solution construction because integral curves and hugoniot loci coincide the hodograph plane is independent of initial and injected composition and therefore gives a universal representation of the solution structure this allows a determination of the transport solution by visual inspection of the hodograph plane such a construction and the accompanying breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 7 for two particular compositions for clarity we first consider examples without composite waves whose construction will be discussed afterwards the solution construction proceeds by tracing γ 1 from c ini and γ 2 from c inj the composition c int is given by the point where γ 1 and γ 2 intersect at the intermediate state the composition path of the solution switches from γ 1 to γ 2 the structure of the wave w p is determined by the evolution of θ p along γ p in particular if θ 1 decreases along γ 1 from c ini to c int then w 1 is a rarefaction otherwise it is a shock similarly if θ 2 decreases along γ 2 from c int to c inj then w 2 is a rarefaction the direction of increasing θ p is shown by arrows along γ p therefore for the particular c ini and c inj chosen in fig 7a the solution structure is 30 c ini s 1 c int r 2 c inj fig 7b and c shows the corresponding effluent profiles the coupling of acidity to salinity leads to a significant reduction of the acidity at the intermediate state after some time the acidity gradually increases to c inj as the second wave elutes note that the salinity remains constant along the second wave because salinity does not change along γ 2 in fig 7d we consider the case where c ini and c inj are switched from the geometry of the hodograph plane it is clear that the morphology of the waves is reversed and the intermediate state requires an increase in acidity the variation in θ 1 along γ 1 is negligible hence the rarefaction becomes very steep and is indistinguishable from a shock therefore the first wave arrives without retardation and is followed by a persistent intermediate state at a higher acidity the second wave is a shock with no change in salinity next we consider two cases which lead to the formation of composite waves first we consider the case of a composite wave during a constant salinity experiment as has been discussed by mcneece and hesse 2016 shown in burnt orange in fig 8 here the initial and injected condition lie on the same γ 2 so that there is no intermediate state and the solution is comprised of a single wave in this case a composite wave forms as c ini and c inj straddle the inflection loci i 2 along γ 2 the effluent profile shown in fig 8 b illustrates the morphological transition of w 2 from a rarefaction to a shock at c unlike a concatenation of simple waves in composite waves a shock and rarefaction are not separated by an intermediate state this composite wave structure has been observed experimentally and is a distinct feature of proton transport mcneece and hesse 2017 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1993 strictly a composite path also exits along γ 1 in the blue example of fig 8 as w 1 crosses i 1 however due to the near constant eigenvalue the composite wave is visually indistinguishable from a discontinuity 3 7 interpretation of the hodograph plane the hodograph plane shows that the acidity salinity coupling is one way i e changes in salinity affect acidity and not vice versa as much is evident from the eigenvalues as plotted in fig 2 the curved near vertical shape of γ 1 implies that any change in injected salinity is accompanied by a change in acidity in contrast γ 2 is horizontal so that changes in injected acidity do not affect salinity therefore the best measure of the acidity salinity coupling is the magnitude of displacement in acidity across the first wave w 1 which is measured by the intermediate state c int we will therefore refer to the first wave as the salinity wave and the second as the acidity wave in addition the hodograph plane implies the following set of general behaviors for the acidity salinity system an increase in salinity leads to an increase in acidity because the slope of γ 1 is positive across composition space the larger the change in salinity the larger the change in acidity the acidity salinity coupling never changes the sign of the acidity i e a basic solution cannot become acidic and vice versa across the salinity wave this is due to γ 1 never crossing c h 0 the hodograph plane may then be used to design targeted experimental efforts as stated previously there is negligible coupling of acidity and salinity transport along γ 2 therefore column experiments where salinity is held constant and ph is varied can inform the transport behavior of acidity directly but do not inform acidity salinity coupling mcneece and hesse 2016 similarly the hodograph plane shows that curvature of γ 1 is the distinguishing characteristic of the acidity salinity coupling mcneece and hesse 2017 used this observation to design a suit of column experiments which explore the acidity salinity coupling by holding acidity constant while varying injected salinity 4 transport experiments in this work we compare the analytic transport predictions to transport experiments presented in mcneece and hesse 2017 here we briefly summarize the surface characterization efforts and column flood experiment procedure of the aforementioned manuscript 4 1 surface characterization column experiments were performed through jurassic age beach sand composed of 99 9 quartz as confirmed by visual inspection in thin section and energy dispersivity spectroscopy the average grain size was 1 2 10 4 m as reported by the vendor the specific surface area s as determined by brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis is 5 10 2 m2 g prior to use the sand was washed in a ph 4 hcl solution rinsed and again washed in ph 10 naoh solution the sand was subsequently rinsed until a neutral ph was obtained and dried at 373 kelvin 4 2 column experiment procedure quartz sand was packed into a 0 37 0 015 m cylindrical glass column omnifit resulting in a porosity of 0 325 pore volume of 2 13 10 2 l and slurry density a of 5 5 103 g l solutions were pumped through the column at a constant volumetric flow rate q of 2 10 6 m3 min by hplc pumps jasco an in line ph probe endress hauser and ion chromatograph dionex measured the ph and sodium concentration of the effluent experiment solutions were prepared with ultrapure degassed water ionic strength and acidity were adjusted by the addition of nacl and naoh or hcl respectively solutions were stored in airtight hdpe vessels blanketed with n2 gas and stirred continuously solutions were pumped through an in line degasser jasco prior to injection into the column before each experiment the initial solution was pumped through the column for sufficient time to ensure that the surfaces were in chemical equilibrium with the flowing solution this was achieved by monitoring the effluent and influent chemistry until they were similar for 15 pore volumes further details on experimental techniques are provided in mcneece and hesse 2016 5 discussion despite the apparent simplicity of acidity salinity transport through quartz sand it has proven challenging to accurately capture the observed coupling in reactive transport models for example the reference model defined in section 2 1 predicts a stronger coupling in basic conditions than in acidic conditions as is evident from the hodograph plane in contrast experimental results by mcneece and hesse 2017 show that the magnitude of the coupling is comparable in both acidic and basic regimes most notably any adjustment that improves the fit of the reference model under acidic conditions leads to a deterioration of the fit in the basic regime and vice versa this implies that the model form rather than parameterization is responsible for the mismatch however many surface chemistry model formulations have been proposed for the interaction of acidity and salinity within the quartz water interface many of these models assume the basic structure of the triple layer model but vary in the type of reactive sites the number of reactions associated with each site as well as whether co ions form inner or outer sphere complexes the hodograph plane is a useful tool to explore the role of model formulation in the acidity salinity coupling the reference model considers only a single reactive site with a single protonation reaction and assumes that co ions form outer sphere complexes in an attempt to capture the observed behavior in the simplest expansion possible we include an additional proton uptake in the single site model eq 3 which then requires outer sphere surface complexation of the chloride ion eq 5 such a formulation for the quartz surface has been previously used to successfully model batch titration data duval et al 2002 we refer to this model formulation as the two step model we set the chloride binding constant equal to that of sodium to minimize the number of parameters k na k cl 10 1 9 as is done by hiemstra et al 1989 in the following analysis we consider the effect of the proton sorption reaction constants k h 1 and k h 2 on the transport behavior via the hodograph plane to limit the number of adjustable parameters we require that the point of zero charge p z c is fixed at ph 3 c h 10 3 m kosmulski 2001 with this constraint k h 1 and k h 2 are not independent and we can think of the overall surface protonation reaction combining reactions 2 and 3 31 sio 2 h sioh 2 with the law of mass action being 32 k sioh 2 sio h 2 at the p z c the mineral surface is neutral in the case that na and cl sorption is negligible fig 1 this implies that sioh 2 sio by incorporating these assumptions into eq 32 one obtains 33 k k h 1 k h 2 1 0 6 thus constraining the proton reaction constants relative to one another the surface charge as a function of ph is shown in fig 9 for a range of k h 1 and k h 2 values as the strength of the first proton sorption reaction decreases the charge of the quartz surface increases in magnitude the increase in charge allows a greater dependence of the electrostatic behavior of the diffuse layer on salinity see eq 10 as a result the composition paths of the fast wave become more deflected in the acidic regime as k h 1 decreases and k h 2 increases this trend is shown in fig 10 via the hodograph plane panel a shows a parameterization of the two step model which produces similar behavior to the reference model in this model the fast paths in the acidic regime are nearly vertical hence the predicted acidity salinity coupling is weak in panels b d the relative importance of the second proton reaction increases and the fast path is increasingly deflected leading to a more symmetrical hodograph plane therefore the acidity salinity coupling increases with the strength of the second proton sorption reaction column experiments are plotted on the hodograph plane as a reference for the model predictions the elution history of each experiment is plotted in panels e f of fig 10 with increasing k h 2 we see an improved fit to the intermediate states of all experiments particularly in the acidic regime fig 10f h the intermediate state in the basic regime remains unchanged though we see an increase in the second wave arrival time relative to the experimental results the disagreement in experiment 3 can presumably be explained through mixing as the experimental results are smoothed however the model predictions of experiment 1 consistently show an unrealistically slow arrival time of the second wave this implies the surface is less reactive in the basic regime than the model predicts though the quartz surface has an overall negative charge in the ph range studied here this does not exclude the secondary proton sorption reaction which leads to local positive charge on the surface the improved fit of the intermediate states suggests that such a reaction is important for acidity salinity coupling despite the low p z c the secondary proton sorption reaction should not be dropped for quartz sand in addition the lack of agreement in the second wave arrival time suggests further improvement is necessary an additional measure could include a second sorption site as suggested by ong et al 1992 and leung et al 2009 6 conclusion here we have extended the chromatographic analysis to geochemical surface complexation models and obtained the appropriate sorption isotherms that determine reactive transport behavior our analysis has shown that acidity salinity coupling in reactive transport models can be understood in the context of chromatographic theory this analysis provides a graphical representation of the overall transport behavior and allows comparison under varying chemical conditions by inspection further differing models can be compared directly allowing a rapid analysis of the effect of model form on predicted transport behavior given that this analysis can be applied to any chemical system at local chemical equilibrium it provides a powerful tool for reactive transport modeling where model formulations and parameters abound acknowledgments this work was funded as part of the center for frontiers of

1644,the effects of acidity and salinity on solute transport in porous media are important to a diverse range of fields from seawater intrusion to nuclear waste storage recent transport experiments in quartz sand show the difficulty in capturing the coupling of acidity and salinity under acidic conditions for this system here we study the ability of different surface complexation models to capture this coupling through an analysis of the reactive transport equations in the limit of no diffusion this chromatographic analysis leads to a graphical representation of the full set of solutions in the phase plane thus allowing a comprehensive comparison of the transport behavior arising from different scms the analysis shows that the predicted coupling is improved by including amphoteric behavior of the quartz surface the inclusion of a secondary proton sorption reaction increases the magnitude of surface charge under acidic conditions strengthening the acidity salinity coupling this suggests that even though the overall surface is negative above the point of zero charge positively charged sites play an important role in the reactive transport of acidity and salinity keywords reactive transport chromatography electric double layer hyperbolic theory surface complexation triple layer model 1 introduction to first order the surface charge and therefore chemical behavior of reactive media is determined by aqueous acidity and salinity these variables are coupled through the effects of ionic strength on the activity of aqueous species and the electrical properties of the diffuse layer as well as competitive sorption of ions for surface sites meeussen et al 1996 much work has been done in the development of surface chemistry models which can mechanistically capture this behavior so called surface complexation models scms sposito 2004 among the most advanced are the triple layer model tlm and the three plane model tpm these models have been used to successfully account for the acidity salinity coupling of many oxide surfaces in batch settings however current chemical model conventions for the quartz surface cannot quantitatively capture the coupling in reactive transport systems mcneece and hesse 2017 the error in predicted breakthrough curves is most noticeable in the acidic regime recent studies have shown that this failure is independent of parameterization suggesting that the functional form of the surface chemistry model is inadequate an understanding of the role of the surface chemistry model s formulation is therefore needed towards this effort we present a chromatographic analysis of the coupled acidity salinity transport system under conditions appropriate for reactive transport experiments of mcneece and hesse 2017 much scrutiny has been given to the surface behavior of quartz yet controversy exists as to the nature and abundance of surface sites spectroscopic and titration experiments of quartz suggest that the surface is negatively charged over a large range of ph values ahmed 1966 anderson and wickersheim 1964 bolt 1957 koretsky et al 1997 li and bruyn 1966 morrow and cody 1976 classic models of the quartz surface therefore consider a one site formulation such that the surface can be only negative or neutral via a single proton sorption reaction however it is fairly well established that the point of zero charge of the quartz surface is around ph 3 according to kosmulski 2001 therefore a positive charge is possible and it is reasonable to consider two protonation reactions in a minority of other studies a more complex behavior has been reported suggesting a further proton reaction on a second site duval et al 2002 leung et al 2009 ong et al 1992 pokrovsky et al 2006 zoback 2012 clearly controversy remains as to the proper formulation of the surface chemistry model of quartz here we explore the single site formulation through a parameter adjustment of the two step model and determine the role of surface reaction on transport behavior this example will serve as a template to encourage the further comparison of model formulation through chromatographic analysis the mathematical basis of multiple solute chromatography was developed for charged ions undergoing langmuir type sorption and ion exchange charbeneau 1981 1988 lake 1989 rhee et al 1970 temple 1983 more recently chromatographic analysis was conducted on ph dependent sorption prigiobbe et al 2012 and to the single component acidity system using scms mcneece and hesse 2016 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1994 here we extend chromatographic theory to the coupled acidity salinity transport system the analysis allows a graphical representation of transport behavior as a function of injected and initial composition this visual tool is known as the hodograph plane and facilitates a direct comparison of the transport behavior for a given surface complexation model and the concomitant parameterization below we introduce the reactive transport model being composed of the surface chemistry model and conservation law we then present the chromatographic analysis and hodograph plane finally we use the hodograph plane to explore the role of surface chemistry model formulation on predicted transport behavior by a comparison to column experiments 2 reactive transport model here we introduce the chemical model of the coupled acidity salinity system in quartz sand and show the resulting sorption isotherms we then introduce the transport equations of the conserved quantities 2 1 surface complexation model in order to capture the acidity salinity coupling in reactive media both aqueous and surface speciation must be considered in the simple system the auto ionization of water is the

kosmulski 2001 therefore in the literature it is often assumed that reactions 3 and 5 are negligible at higher ph values and are dropped for the mathematical analysis we will adopt this convention in the discussion section this assumption will be relaxed in order to explore the role of these reactions on the mathematical solution structure to determine the equilibrium distribution of the above species the chemical reactions are coupled to a given scm these models attempt to account for the contribution of electrostatic interactions at the mineral surface in determining the reactivity of surface sites among the most robust of these models is the triple layer model tlm westall and hohl 1980 offer a comprehensive summary of this model and others the tpm approximates the mineral water interface by three capacitors in series including the diffuse layer the inner layer capacitors are segmented by planes of charge accumulation the mineral surface charge is determined by the sorption of small ions i e h and oh which sorb directly to the surface sites such sorption reactions are known as inner sphere surface complexes in the case of protons the size is not such that a charge distribution is required larger ions such as sodium typically retain their solvation shell the volume of solvation waters geometrically inhibits direct binding to a surface site and limits the uptake to a discrete distance from the plane of the surface sites therefore such ions are considered to sorb at a distance of roughly the size of a water molecule plus the radius of the bare ion i e the radius of the hydrated ion from the mineral surface and are called outer sphere surface complexes this plane of adsorption is known as the inner helmholtz plane ihp because of the distance separating the mineral surface and the sorbed species outer sphere complexes when treated as point charges contribute their charge to the ihp at some distance beyond the ihp a diffuse ion cloud balances the cumulative charge of the mineral surface and ihp this plane is known as the outer helmholtz plane ohp the region between the mineral surface and the ohp is known as the stern layer the region beyond the ohp is known as the diffuse layer the charge of the mineral surface and ihp are mathematically defined as linear combinations of the charged species residing on each plane 6 σ 0 σ sio f s a sio

the diffuse layer in a previous work we have demonstrated that this is not the case for the material studied here mcneece and hesse 2017 the present use of eq 10 is appropriate only for symmetrical 1

in the transport model it is convenient to consider the aqueous and surface concentrations of species separately as their transport behavior differs namely sorbed species are considered to be immobile and aqueous species move with the fluid therefore we introduce the variables 15 c na h oh c na c h 16 s σ sio sio na σ sio sioh s n a s h where c and s are the vectors of total aqueous and surface concentrations respectively the relationship between the total aqueous and sorbed concentrations determines transport behavior mcneece and hesse 2016 representative sorption isotherms are shown in fig 1 parameter values are presented in table 1 values of k h 1 k na c 1 and c 2 are taken from hiemstra et al 1989 the approach involves the music model to mechanistically determine the equilibrium constant k h 1 and optimizes the other parameters by minimizing the error between the model and batch titration data produced by bolt 1957 this model parameterization will be referred to as the reference model notably in the reference model the value of the second capacitor is very high which reduces a tlm or tpm to a basic stern version of the interface it can be seen from fig 1 that the sorption isotherms show typical competitive sorption behavior in that the sorbed concentration of an element increases with aqueous concentration while decreasing with an increase in competing ions the inflection point in both s h and s na is characteristic of ph dependent sorption processes and has interesting implications for transport behavior as will be discussed below 2 2 conservation laws here we consider the 1d reaction advection diffusion equation for the conserved quantities of acidity and salinity at local chemical equilibrium 17 i c s c c τ c z p e 1 c z z 0 where i is the identity matrix z x l and τ qt ϕal are dimensionless space and time respectively and p e ql ϕa d is the péclet number where q is the volumetric flow rate a is the column cross sectional area l is the column length and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor for each component appelo and postma 2005 the dimensionless time τ 1 is equivalent to the time required for the injection of one pore volume in eq 17 the jacobian of the sorption isotherm with respect to the aqueous concentration is given by 18 c s c s n a c n a s n a c h s h c n a s h c h in the column experiments of interest the inferred péclet numbers are o 1 0 3 mcneece and hesse 2016 thus we consider the hyperbolic limit of eq 17 p e 19 i c s c c τ c z 0 a typical column flood experiment procedure can be represented as a riemann problem with a piece wise constant initial condition having a step about the origin 20 c z τ 0 c inj z 0 c ini z 0 where c ini and c inj are the initial and injected concentrations respectively 3 solution by method of characteristics here we detail the procedure for the semi analytic solution of the reactive transport model using the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws which is the equivalent to the theory of chromatography for reactive transport we are interested in predicting experimental effluent histories in reactive transport problems the effluent history is typically observed and the nonlinearity occurs in the accumulation term it is therefore natural to follow the chromatographic convention and describe the solution in terms of retardation rather than velocity rhee et al 2001a b 3 1 eigenvalue problem the form of the reactive transport model eq 19 and the initial condition eq 20 allows the introduction of the retardation as the similarity variable 21 η τ z substitution of η into eq 19 reduces the system of partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations in the form of an eigenvalue problem 22 i c s c θ p c r p 0 where θ p c η τ z are the eigenvalues and 23 r p c d c d η p are the eigenvectors here we consider a 2 2 system of coupled equations for the transport of acidity and salinity resulting in two sets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors p 1 2 below we demonstrate computationally that the eigenvalues are real and distinct 0 θ 1 θ 2 so that the system of equations is strictly hyperbolic leveque 1992 this results in a front structure composed of two waves w 1 and w 2 connecting the initial c ini and injected state c inj these waves are joined at an intermediate state c int and are ordered from the fastest to the slowest 24 c ini w 1 c int w 2 c inj the solution of the transport problem requires the determination of the intermediate state c int and the wave structures w 1 and w 2 the eigenvectors give the composition variation along these waves while eigenvalues give the retardation of their arrival time we will see that there are four possible wave structures a smooth variation in composition known as a rarefaction r a sharp variation known as a shock s and two composite waves which contain both a smooth and a discontinuous change in concentration r s and s r known as rarefaction shocks and shock rarefactions respectively here the symbol ordering corresponds to segment arrival order 3 2 eigenvalues and retardations a closed form solution to the eigenvalue problem is intractable because local chemical equilibrium involves the complex set of nonlinear equations eqs 6 16 therefore eq 22 is solved numerically and the two eigenvalues are plotted in fig 2 here a smaller eigenvalue is equivalent to a faster travel speed lower retardation the smallest eigenvalue θ 1 is approximately unity and is related to the breakthrough of the salinity front in contrast θ 2 is a strong function of both the acidity and salinity with a local maximum near neutral acidity fig 2 shows that over the composition space investigated here 1 θ 1 θ 2 this implies that the first wave never arrives before a tracer breaks through and that the second wave is always delayed such that an intermediate state exists from a previous analysis it is clear that the magnitude of the eigenvalue θ 2 is directly proportional to the derivative of the isotherm in fig 1a mcneece and hesse 2016 2017 prigiobbe et al 2013 scheidegger et al 1994 an inflection point in the sorption isotherm is typical of the proton sorption system prigiobbe et al 2012 and leads to the local maximum in θ 2 that is observed in fig 2b hence the hyperbolic system is non genuinely non linear leveque 1992 and allows the formation of composite waves the implications of the inflection point for transport will be considered below and have been discussed for a system with constant salinity mcneece and hesse 2016 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1994 3 3 eigenvectors and composition pathways eigenvectors give the variation of composition along the waves which compose the solution structure an integration of the eigenvectors gives the composition paths also known as integral curves γ p 25 γ p c o 0 η r p c d η where c o is a starting point in composition space the reactive transport model is a 2 2 system thus there are two sets of composition paths which are shown in fig 3 all rarefaction waves r p lie along these composition paths plots of the dependent variables c h and c na are referred to as phase or hodograph planes in the context of hyperbolic conservation laws leveque 1992 in chromatography and reactive transport fig 3 is called composition space rhee et al 2001b 3 4 shocks and hugoniot loci shocks form in the hyperbolic limit when the displacing composition has a lower retardation θ p than the composition being displaced this results in a triple valued problem which is replaced by a mass conserving shock according to the rankine hugoniot jump condition 26 θ p c c 1 s c s c c c where θ p c c is the retardation of the shock and superscripts and correspond to the composition on either side of the jump rhee et al 2001a b in the case where diffusive terms are also considered such waves will widen until an equilibrium width is achieved the width being determined by the hydrodynamic dispersion rhee et al 1971 the right hand side of eq 26 can be rewritten as the following non linear scalar algebraic equation 27 s h s h c h c h s n a s n a c n a c n a 0 given either c or c and solving for the other gives the locus of points that satisfy the conditions for a mass conserving shock known as the hugoniot loci ℋ p the form of eq 27 makes clear that the discontinuity in each composition arrives with the same retardation θ p the hugoniot loci for several points are shown in fig 4 the hugoniot loci must be tangent to the composition paths at the point under consideration in the system considered the hugoniot loci are approximately coincident with the composition paths throughout the hodograph plane and therefore only the integral curves are shown in the subsequent hodograph planes however in systems with highly curved composition paths integral curves and hugoniot loci often deviate johansen et al 2005 leveque 1992 prigiobbe et al 2013 3 5 composite waves and inflection loci the sorption isotherms shown in fig 1a and d have inflection points near neutral ph c h 0 this is due to the aqueous reaction 1 and marks the transition from c h h to c h oh mcneece and hesse 2016 this leads to the local maximum observed in θ 2 as seen in fig 2b equivalent inflection loci i p can be defined in the two component system as follows 28 θ p r p c 0 and are shown in fig 5 the inflection loci i 1 and i 2 along c h 0 are nearly coincident and mark a local maximum in both θ 1 and θ 2 a second branch of i 1 in the basic regime marks a small local minimum in θ 1 which is replotted in more detail in fig 6 a wave w p can be composite if the composition path crosses i p if the solution involves a composite wave an additional concentration corresponding to the transition in wave type must be determined this composition c is found by equating the eigenvalue θ p c along the rarefaction with the retardation of the connecting shock given by 29 θ p c 1 s c s c c c where c is the composition connected to c across the shock in problems with a single component this construction is equivalent to finding the cord that is tangent to the sorption isotherm mcneece and hesse 2016 scheidegger et al 1994 3 6 solution construction because integral curves and hugoniot loci coincide the hodograph plane is independent of initial and injected composition and therefore gives a universal representation of the solution structure this allows a determination of the transport solution by visual inspection of the hodograph plane such a construction and the accompanying breakthrough curves are illustrated in fig 7 for two particular compositions for clarity we first consider examples without composite waves whose construction will be discussed afterwards the solution construction proceeds by tracing γ 1 from c ini and γ 2 from c inj the composition c int is given by the point where γ 1 and γ 2 intersect at the intermediate state the composition path of the solution switches from γ 1 to γ 2 the structure of the wave w p is determined by the evolution of θ p along γ p in particular if θ 1 decreases along γ 1 from c ini to c int then w 1 is a rarefaction otherwise it is a shock similarly if θ 2 decreases along γ 2 from c int to c inj then w 2 is a rarefaction the direction of increasing θ p is shown by arrows along γ p therefore for the particular c ini and c inj chosen in fig 7a the solution structure is 30 c ini s 1 c int r 2 c inj fig 7b and c shows the corresponding effluent profiles the coupling of acidity to salinity leads to a significant reduction of the acidity at the intermediate state after some time the acidity gradually increases to c inj as the second wave elutes note that the salinity remains constant along the second wave because salinity does not change along γ 2 in fig 7d we consider the case where c ini and c inj are switched from the geometry of the hodograph plane it is clear that the morphology of the waves is reversed and the intermediate state requires an increase in acidity the variation in θ 1 along γ 1 is negligible hence the rarefaction becomes very steep and is indistinguishable from a shock therefore the first wave arrives without retardation and is followed by a persistent intermediate state at a higher acidity the second wave is a shock with no change in salinity next we consider two cases which lead to the formation of composite waves first we consider the case of a composite wave during a constant salinity experiment as has been discussed by mcneece and hesse 2016 shown in burnt orange in fig 8 here the initial and injected condition lie on the same γ 2 so that there is no intermediate state and the solution is comprised of a single wave in this case a composite wave forms as c ini and c inj straddle the inflection loci i 2 along γ 2 the effluent profile shown in fig 8 b illustrates the morphological transition of w 2 from a rarefaction to a shock at c unlike a concatenation of simple waves in composite waves a shock and rarefaction are not separated by an intermediate state this composite wave structure has been observed experimentally and is a distinct feature of proton transport mcneece and hesse 2017 meeussen et al 1999 scheidegger et al 1993 strictly a composite path also exits along γ 1 in the blue example of fig 8 as w 1 crosses i 1 however due to the near constant eigenvalue the composite wave is visually indistinguishable from a discontinuity 3 7 interpretation of the hodograph plane the hodograph plane shows that the acidity salinity coupling is one way i e changes in salinity affect acidity and not vice versa as much is evident from the eigenvalues as plotted in fig 2 the curved near vertical shape of γ 1 implies that any change in injected salinity is accompanied by a change in acidity in contrast γ 2 is horizontal so that changes in injected acidity do not affect salinity therefore the best measure of the acidity salinity coupling is the magnitude of displacement in acidity across the first wave w 1 which is measured by the intermediate state c int we will therefore refer to the first wave as the salinity wave and the second as the acidity wave in addition the hodograph plane implies the following set of general behaviors for the acidity salinity system an increase in salinity leads to an increase in acidity because the slope of γ 1 is positive across composition space the larger the change in salinity the larger the change in acidity the acidity salinity coupling never changes the sign of the acidity i e a basic solution cannot become acidic and vice versa across the salinity wave this is due to γ 1 never crossing c h 0 the hodograph plane may then be used to design targeted experimental efforts as stated previously there is negligible coupling of acidity and salinity transport along γ 2 therefore column experiments where salinity is held constant and ph is varied can inform the transport behavior of acidity directly but do not inform acidity salinity coupling mcneece and hesse 2016 similarly the hodograph plane shows that curvature of γ 1 is the distinguishing characteristic of the acidity salinity coupling mcneece and hesse 2017 used this observation to design a suit of column experiments which explore the acidity salinity coupling by holding acidity constant while varying injected salinity 4 transport experiments in this work we compare the analytic transport predictions to transport experiments presented in mcneece and hesse 2017 here we briefly summarize the surface characterization efforts and column flood experiment procedure of the aforementioned manuscript 4 1 surface characterization column experiments were performed through jurassic age beach sand composed of 99 9 quartz as confirmed by visual inspection in thin section and energy dispersivity spectroscopy the average grain size was 1 2 10 4 m as reported by the vendor the specific surface area s as determined by brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analysis is 5 10 2 m2 g prior to use the sand was washed in a ph 4 hcl solution rinsed and again washed in ph 10 naoh solution the sand was subsequently rinsed until a neutral ph was obtained and dried at 373 kelvin 4 2 column experiment procedure quartz sand was packed into a 0 37 0 015 m cylindrical glass column omnifit resulting in a porosity of 0 325 pore volume of 2 13 10 2 l and slurry density a of 5 5 103 g l solutions were pumped through the column at a constant volumetric flow rate q of 2 10 6 m3 min by hplc pumps jasco an in line ph probe endress hauser and ion chromatograph dionex measured the ph and sodium concentration of the effluent experiment solutions were prepared with ultrapure degassed water ionic strength and acidity were adjusted by the addition of nacl and naoh or hcl respectively solutions were stored in airtight hdpe vessels blanketed with n2 gas and stirred continuously solutions were pumped through an in line degasser jasco prior to injection into the column before each experiment the initial solution was pumped through the column for sufficient time to ensure that the surfaces were in chemical equilibrium with the flowing solution this was achieved by monitoring the effluent and influent chemistry until they were similar for 15 pore volumes further details on experimental techniques are provided in mcneece and hesse 2016 5 discussion despite the apparent simplicity of acidity salinity transport through quartz sand it has proven challenging to accurately capture the observed coupling in reactive transport models for example the reference model defined in section 2 1 predicts a stronger coupling in basic conditions than in acidic conditions as is evident from the hodograph plane in contrast experimental results by mcneece and hesse 2017 show that the magnitude of the coupling is comparable in both acidic and basic regimes most notably any adjustment that improves the fit of the reference model under acidic conditions leads to a deterioration of the fit in the basic regime and vice versa this implies that the model form rather than parameterization is responsible for the mismatch however many surface chemistry model formulations have been proposed for the interaction of acidity and salinity within the quartz water interface many of these models assume the basic structure of the triple layer model but vary in the type of reactive sites the number of reactions associated with each site as well as whether co ions form inner or outer sphere complexes the hodograph plane is a useful tool to explore the role of model formulation in the acidity salinity coupling the reference model considers only a single reactive site with a single protonation reaction and assumes that co ions form outer sphere complexes in an attempt to capture the observed behavior in the simplest expansion possible we include an additional proton uptake in the single site model eq 3 which then requires outer sphere surface complexation of the chloride ion eq 5 such a formulation for the quartz surface has been previously used to successfully model batch titration data duval et al 2002 we refer to this model formulation as the two step model we set the chloride binding constant equal to that of sodium to minimize the number of parameters k na k cl 10 1 9 as is done by hiemstra et al 1989 in the following analysis we consider the effect of the proton sorption reaction constants k h 1 and k h 2 on the transport behavior via the hodograph plane to limit the number of adjustable parameters we require that the point of zero charge p z c is fixed at ph 3 c h 10 3 m kosmulski 2001 with this constraint k h 1 and k h 2 are not independent and we can think of the overall surface protonation reaction combining reactions 2 and 3 31 sio 2 h sioh 2 with the law of mass action being 32 k sioh 2 sio h 2 at the p z c the mineral surface is neutral in the case that na and cl sorption is negligible fig 1 this implies that sioh 2 sio by incorporating these assumptions into eq 32 one obtains 33 k k h 1 k h 2 1 0 6 thus constraining the proton reaction constants relative to one another the surface charge as a function of ph is shown in fig 9 for a range of k h 1 and k h 2 values as the strength of the first proton sorption reaction decreases the charge of the quartz surface increases in magnitude the increase in charge allows a greater dependence of the electrostatic behavior of the diffuse layer on salinity see eq 10 as a result the composition paths of the fast wave become more deflected in the acidic regime as k h 1 decreases and k h 2 increases this trend is shown in fig 10 via the hodograph plane panel a shows a parameterization of the two step model which produces similar behavior to the reference model in this model the fast paths in the acidic regime are nearly vertical hence the predicted acidity salinity coupling is weak in panels b d the relative importance of the second proton reaction increases and the fast path is increasingly deflected leading to a more symmetrical hodograph plane therefore the acidity salinity coupling increases with the strength of the second proton sorption reaction column experiments are plotted on the hodograph plane as a reference for the model predictions the elution history of each experiment is plotted in panels e f of fig 10 with increasing k h 2 we see an improved fit to the intermediate states of all experiments particularly in the acidic regime fig 10f h the intermediate state in the basic regime remains unchanged though we see an increase in the second wave arrival time relative to the experimental results the disagreement in experiment 3 can presumably be explained through mixing as the experimental results are smoothed however the model predictions of experiment 1 consistently show an unrealistically slow arrival time of the second wave this implies the surface is less reactive in the basic regime than the model predicts though the quartz surface has an overall negative charge in the ph range studied here this does not exclude the secondary proton sorption reaction which leads to local positive charge on the surface the improved fit of the intermediate states suggests that such a reaction is important for acidity salinity coupling despite the low p z c the secondary proton sorption reaction should not be dropped for quartz sand in addition the lack of agreement in the second wave arrival time suggests further improvement is necessary an additional measure could include a second sorption site as suggested by ong et al 1992 and leung et al 2009 6 conclusion here we have extended the chromatographic analysis to geochemical surface complexation models and obtained the appropriate sorption isotherms that determine reactive transport behavior our analysis has shown that acidity salinity coupling in reactive transport models can be understood in the context of chromatographic theory this analysis provides a graphical representation of the overall transport behavior and allows comparison under varying chemical conditions by inspection further differing models can be compared directly allowing a rapid analysis of the effect of model form on predicted transport behavior given that this analysis can be applied to any chemical system at local chemical equilibrium it provides a powerful tool for reactive transport modeling where model formulations and parameters abound acknowledgments this work was funded as part of the center for frontiers of
