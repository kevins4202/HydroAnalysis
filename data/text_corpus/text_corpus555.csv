2775,in hydrology research how to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal changes of water resources in the ecosystem of a watershed is one of the focuses of attention especially in the strategically important dongjiang river basin which is the source of water for three world class cities of hong kong shenzhen and guangzhou hence it is important to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of water resources at the basin and ecosystem scale of dongjiang river basin the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in this study to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of typical ecosystem water resources in the dongjiang river basin over the last 50 years the objectives of the study were to 1 identify the distribution of water resources in typical ecosystems 2 determine the quantity of water in the forest ecosystem and 3 characterize the spatial and temporal changes the findings revealed that 1 the average water resources in the dongjiang river basin from 1971 to 2020 were 37 944 bm3 and there were obvious changes in the basin s total quantity of water resources the most important climatic factors influencing water resources were precipitation and temperature 2 from 1971 to 2020 the total water resources of typical donjiang river basin ecosystems exhibited a declining trend the total average water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 which first increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream the total quantity of water resources in the grassland ecosystem increases with the amount of water per unit area 3 the change in total water resources has been decreasing over the last decade which is consistent with the change in the water resources of the forest ecosystem in the dongjiang river basin changes in water resources were greater in the lower and middle reaches than in the upper reaches changes in land use were a significant factor in the evolution of water resources in typical ecosystems this study can provide theoretical support for the comprehensive management of typical ecosystems and water resources in the dongjiang river basin keywords dongjiang river basin swat model typical ecosystem forest ecosystem water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in hydrology research it is important to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of water resources at the basin and ecosystem scale xia et al 2020 wang et al 2021a there will be different ecosystems in various historical development periods and locations of the watershed resulting in changes in water resources meanwhile the development of the human economy and society will change the ecosystem affecting water resources through changes in vegetation biological community structure and other patterns xia et al 2020 cheng et al 2014 demonstrated that irrigation and groundwater influence the fluctuation and exchange of soil moisture in farmland and forest in the middle reaches of the heihe river abhishek et al 2021 analyzed water resources changes in the chao phraya river basin using grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data and demonstrated that human activities dominated water storage dynamics abhishek and kinouchi 2021 therefore the underlying surface climatic conditions and human activities have significant impacts on the stability and security of the watershed ecosystem guo et al 2020 the ecological and hydrological processes of terrestrial vegetation can be classified according to spatial scale into the plant vegetation group road ecosystem watershed and global scales wang et al 2021a studies on vegetation ecohydrological processes at various scales aim to address different problems watershed and continental scales are primarily concerned with the impact of land use change on specific hydrological processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater mcmillan 2020 the ecosystem scale is primarily concerned with changes in water resources within the terrestrial ecosystem as well as the ecosystem s effects on hydrological processes and underlying surface conditions goldsmith 2013 yang et al 2017 hao and sun 2021 however few studies on water resource characteristics at the ecosystem scale of paddy dryland and forest in entire basins have been conducted limiting systematic understanding of ecohydrology song et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2016 in the hydrological process rainfall is the only source of water resources in the watershed after rainfall reaches the surface the hydrological cycle in the basin is realized through surface runoff soil flow underground runoff evaporation and water vapour transport falkenmark and rockström 2006 to better manage river basin water resources ecological protection and restoration researchers have employed a variety of models and methods to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of water resources at the watershed scale zang and mao 2019 zhao et al 2016 rivas tabares et al 2019 used the swat model to assess the usability of water resources in sub arid mediterranean watersheds and discovered that crop rotation soil management and other related measures are critical for water resource management during dry periods zang and mao 2019 analyzed the distribution pattern of blue and green water flow in typical ecosystems of arid inland river basins in northwest china using the swat model blue water is primarily derived from rivers lakes and shallow groundwater whereas green water is primarily derived from soil water or atmospheric water falkenmark and rockström 2006 typical ecosystems are the main ecosystems in the basin which usually have a larger area proportion and play an irreplaceable role in the hydrological process of the watershed song et al 2019 discovered that the area quality structure and climate characteristics of the forest ecosystem have a direct impact on the water conservation capacity of the watershed yu et al 2020 zang et al 2020 high forest coverage is conducive to water resource utilization and ecological protection wang et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2016 discovered that the distribution of water resources in forest ecosystems is influenced by elevation and slope according to zhou et al 2020 inappropriate vegetation restoration may result in a reduction of water resources in the watershed however few studies on the comprehensive spatial and temporal evolution analysis of water resources in typical ecosystems have been conducted in the last 50 years making it impossible to answer the essential questions of watershed water resources management and ecological restoration therefore it is crucial to examine the spatial and temporal evolution of water resources at the ecosystem scale the dongjiang river is the source of water for three world class cities guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong and has strategic importance for the development of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area in the dongjiang river basin rapid economic development and population growth over the past few decades have caused water resource issues such as increased water utilization water pollution and saltwater intrusion deng and chen 2020 liu et al 2018 according to the statistics of annual average inflow the utilization rate of water resources in the dongjiang river basin is 26 29 3 huang et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the management of water resources zhou et al 2018 romano et al 2018 the dongjiang river basin is one of china s most forested areas with forest paddy fields dry cropland and grassland ecosystems accounting for more than 90 of the dongjiang river basin s most representative ecosystems therefore they were selected as typical ecosystems to investigate changes in water resources in the watershed the objectives of the study were to 1 identify the distribution of water resources in typical ecosystems 2 determine the quantity of water in the forest ecosystem and 3 characterize the spatial and temporal changes over the past 50 years the findings of this study can serve as a theoretical basis for the comprehensive management of water resources and typical ecosystems in the dongjiang river basin 2 study area located between 113 21 22 e 115 54 25 e and 22 23 40 n 25 12 10 n fig 1 the dongjiang river basin has an annual sunshine duration of 1700 2000 h an annual temperature of 21 and annual precipitation of 1500 2400 mm wu et al 2019 longchuan separates the upper and middle reaches whereas boluo separates the middle and lower reaches the total area of the river basin above the shiyang river estuary is 35 340 km2 of which 31 840 km2 and 35 00 km2 are in the provinces of guangdong and jiangxi respectively the largest reservoir in the dongjiang river basin is the xinfengjiang reservoir which is located in heyuan city and covers an area of 1600 km2 with a storage capacity of 13 9 billion m3 wu et al 2019 the dongjiang river provides water to nearly 40 million people in guangdong province and hong kong the dongjiang river basin has a per capita water resource of 800 m3 which is only 1 3rd of the national average chen et al 2022 despite not being in the dongjiang river basin hong kong receives more than 80 of its water from the dongjiang river via diversion projects wang and dai 2021 the dongjiang river plays a crucial role in the economic development of guangdong province contributing 4 17t yuan 39 of the gross domestic product gdp of guangdong province in 2019 wu et al 2021 3 data and methods 3 1 data sources the swat model is widely used to simulate the hydrological characteristics of watersheds under various land use and climate conditions zang et al 2012 li et al 2021 as shown in table 1 developing the swat model requires the use of various types of geographic data the digital elevation model dem was utilized to develop river networks and watersheds hydrology response units hrus can be generated using land use data harmony world soil database hwsd and dongjiangyuan national forest ecological station provided the soil data used to construct the soil database the attribute database was constructed using meteorological data runoff data was used to calibrate and validate the model wu et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 3 2 calculation of water resources a total water resources to better reveal the characteristics of water resources of typical ecosystems at a watershed scale the sum of the root zone seepage including shallow groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow was considered to represent the total water resources and was calculated for each sub basin zang et al 2016 according to the geographical and environmental characteristics of the dongjiang river basin and the research conducted in watersheds of the same type among these surface runoff is the volume of water that results from surface water converging and flowing without infiltration lateral flow is runoff that moves laterally through the soil rivas tabares et al 2019 1 w i 1 n p e r c s u r q l a t q s i 1000 in eq 1 w represents the total water resources m3 and perc surq and latq represent the seepage surface runoff and lateral flow of the hru over a specified period mm respectively si is the catchment area of the hru km2 and n is the number of hrus b water resources per unit area according to eq 1 the total water resources of a sub basin are influenced by its area therefore larger sub basins may contain more water resources the water resources per unit area reduce the influence of the sub basin area and can reflect the actual quantity of water in a basin zang et al 2012 2 r i i 1 n w i s i 1 n s i in eq 2 ri represents the water resource depth mm in sub basin i i e the water resources per unit area wi represents the water resource quantity in hydrological response unit i and si is the area of an hru c the relative change rate the relative change in water resources is the ratio of water resources in the later period to those in the earlier period which reflects the change in water resources in typical ecosystems zang et al 2012 3 rcr x 2 x 1 x 1 100 in eq 3 rcr is the relative rate of change in water resources x is the set of variables representing the water resources in a typical ecosystem and x1 and x2 are the water resources in the previous and later periods respectively 3 3 mechanism responsible for changes in water resources a the land use transfer matrix many studies have shown that the land use transfer matrix is a relatively mature and reliable method for investigating land use change zhang et al 2020b and the results obtained are also credible therefore the land use matrix was utilized in this study to investigate the change in land types over different periods 4 s ij s 11 s 21 s 12 s 22 s 1 n s 2 n s n 1 s n 2 s nn in eq 4 s is the land use area n is the land use type i and j are the land use types in the previous period and the later period respectively b correlation analysis the variation in runoff in the dongjiang river basin is primarily determined by climatic factors specifically precipitation and temperature yang et al 2018 greater precipitation can increase runoff whereas increased evaporation can decrease it consequently temperature and precipitation were selected as the primary determinants of water resource changes in typical ecosystems meanwhile different types of land use have an impact on the distribution of water resources in the basin correlation analysis can investigate the relationship between several random variables correlation analysis was chosen to examine the changes in water resources in various ecosystems and their underlying causes senthilnathan 2019 5 ρ x y n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 in eq 5 n is the number of random variables and and y are random variables 3 4 the swat model the swat model was developed in the 1980 s by the united states agricultural research center usda ars it is a basin scale distributed hydrological model that is physically based and highly computationally efficient allowing for long term simulation of a watershed zhang et al 2020a shrestha et al 2017 the underlying surface and climate factors of a basin often exhibit spatial and temporal differences therefore the soil conservation service scs runoff curve algorithm can be used in general to estimate surface runoff water that penetrates beneath the bottom of the root zone creates groundwater or causes reflux a river s flow was calculated using the variable storage coefficient method or the muskingum algorithm simulations of runoff generation slope confluence and river confluence are generated by the swat model zang et al 2016 the hydrological response unit of the swat model consisted of subbasins with identical land use soil type and slope the sub basins were divided into various combinations of land use and soil type resulting in multiple hydrological response units hrus reshmidevi et al 2018 based on the characteristics of the dongjiang river basin this study separated the basin into 53 sub basins and 1 038 hrus the land use data were manually categorized according to the interpretations of thematic mapper images based on the land use distribution map the results of the land use cover analysis at a scale of 1 1 million were based on urban renewal by the chinese academy of sciences lyu et al 2018 then the soil water characteristics program swcp software was used to compute soil moisture density water retention capacity saturated water conductivity and other soil parameters required to establish the swat model tudose et al 2021 finally the dongjiangyuan ecological station data were employed as auxiliary data for parameter localization when developing the swat model data from the china meteorological data network table 1 were used as inputs for temperature humidity rainfall wind speed and solar radiation senent aparicio et al 2021 the swat model also included a weather database the swat weather program calculated the average maximum and minimum monthly temperatures the standard deviation in daily maximum and minimum temperatures monthly average dew point temperature standard deviation and skewness coefficient of monthly average rainfall monthly dry day coefficient monthly wet day coefficient monthly average rainfall days and monthly average solar radiation among other parameters 3 5 model calibration and validation the uncertainty in parameter estimation can be minimized through parameter sensitivity analysis when conducting sensitivity analysis on the swat model parameters the suif 2 sequential uncertainty fitting process version 2 was a prevalent technique guo and su 2019 a t value and a p value were used to establish the swat model s sensitivity to each parameter the p and t values are both positively and negatively associated with the model s sensitivity to a parameter guo and su 2019 the ideal parameters and their value range were found using parameter sensitivity analysis and references to relevant literature li et al 2020 as shown in table 2 the calibration parameters were then substituted into the model during the validation period to ensure that the calibration findings were accurate the model s simulation period was from 1970 to 2020 the calibration period was from 1990 to 2004 while the validation period lasted from 2010 to 2020 on the one hand there was an appropriate time interval between the calibration and validation periods making the results more reliable however the two time periods selected for calibration and validation were representative of the dongjiang river basin s economic and social development one is the period of stable economic development meaning that the land cover changes were small and the other is the period of rapid economic development meaning that the land cover changes were large the nash sutcliff coefficient ens and the determination coefficient r2 were used in this study to evaluate the model s outcomes almeida et al 2018 li et al 2021 the nash sutcliff coefficient ens is a common hydrological model evaluation index the closer ens is to 1 the more representative the simulated flow is of observed flow however ens is more sensitive to high values and peak flow simulation has a significant impact on the coefficient li et al 2021 therefore the determination coefficient r2 is used as a supplementary index when r2 1 the larger the value the more consistent the model is with the actual situation generally r2 0 6 and ens 0 5 are regarded as reliable standards of runoff simulation zang et al 2012 almeida et al 2018 6 e ns 1 i 1 n q oi q mi 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 7 r 2 i 1 n q oi q o q mi q o 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 q mi q m 2 in eq 6 and eq 7 qoi and qmi are the measured and simulated values of the ith flow respectively n denotes the total number of observations zang et al 2012 4 results 4 1 results of calibration and validation of the swat model boluo station is an extremely important hydrological station of the dongjiang river accounting for 71 7 of the total watershed area of the dongjiang river basin therefore the optimized parameters obtained from the boluo station are critical in representing the entire watershed zang et al 2012 the calibrated ens and r2of the boluo hydrological station simulation of the swat model were 0 84 and 0 81 respectively while the validated ens and r2 were 0 79 and 0 72 which are satisfactory fig 2 it demonstrated that the model s outputs can better represent observation data and can provide assistance and a basis for calculating the reliability of water resources in various ecosystems in fig 2 the uncertainty zone is skewed to the side of the simulated value for specific periods the reason for this is that the model s uncertainty is influenced by numerous factors according to the study by lü et al 2014 the simulated runoff was much greater than the measured runoff in wet years and lower than the measured runoff in dry years due to the influence of water storage and recharge of xinfengjiang reservoir li et al 2009 in this study combined with the results of parameter sensitivity analysis cn2 alpha bf and gw dela had a significant impact on runoff table 2 in addition the impact of topography and soil water movement resulted in significant differences between the simulated and measured values 4 2 changes in the water resources of the dongjiang river basin over the past 50 years the water resources of the dongjiang river basin varied greatly from 1971 to 2020 fig 3 with an average of 37 944 bm3 the total water resources in 2016 were the most in the last 50 years reaching 62 102 bm3 while the total water resources in 1991 were the lowest at only 18 063 bm3 representing a 44 039 bm3 difference water resources increased in value from 1971 to 1983 with the value achieved in 1983 being the second highest in the last 50 years water resources changed significantly in the 1980 s total water resources varied around 39 bm3 from 1992 to 2001 and were low with a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2004 between 2005 and 2010 overall water resources recovered exceeding 40 bm3 in four years between 2011 and 2020 overall water resources increased followed by a decline with substantial variability the total water resources were less than 30 bm3 in 2011 2018 and 2020 4 3 changes in water resources of typical ecosystems of the dongjiang river basin over the last 50 years 4 3 1 changes to water resources in a typical ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 based on average total water resources the dongjiang river basin s ecosystems ranked as follows fig 4 a arbor forest ecosystem 23 157 bm3 paddy field ecosystem 7 084 bm3 other forest ecosystem shrub sparse forest unformed forest etc 3 3168 bm3 dry crop land ecosystem 1 9728 bm3 grassland ecosystem 1 502 bm3 the average total water resources of the arbor and forest land accounted for 62 4 of the total water resources of the watershed the total water resources of the paddy field and arbor forest ecosystems were decreasing with the latter changing the most the total water resources of the grassland ecosystem increased throughout time reaching a peak in the 2010s the rank of the ecosystems in terms of average water per unit area from 1971 to 2020 was fig 4b dry crop land ecosystem 125 99 mm grassland ecosystem 120 21 mm paddy field ecosystem 114 34 mm other forest ecosystem 88 43 mm arbor forest ecosystem 88 38 mm water per unit area was mainly influenced by rainfall but both rainfall and sub basin areas could impact total water therefore the changes depicted in fig 4 a and 4 b appear to be different the area of the grassland ecosystem 1006 18 km2 and dry cropland ecosystem 2035 18 km2 were substantially lower than that of the arbor forest ecosystem 20754 97 km2 but the amount of water influenced by rainfall per unit area was greater 4 3 2 changes in water resources of the forest ecosystem the average total water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 over the past 50 years accounting for 71 4 of the total water resources of the dongjiang river basin which increased and subsequently decreased from upstream to downstream fig 5 over the last 50 years the water resources of the forest ecosystem have become less spatially variable however several subbasins exhibited decreasing trends the total water resources of the forest ecosystems in the eastern sub basin in the middle reaches showed a decreasing trend from the 1980s to the 2010s the water resources of the forest ecosystem in the southeastern sub basin of the lower reaches first decreased then increased with turning points in the 2000s the water quantity per unit area of the forest ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 first increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream fig 6 the middle reaches had the most water per unit area averaging 200 mm while the upstream and downstream reaches had 100 150 mm water resources per unit area of the forest ecosystem in the upstream and downstream sub watersheds decreased and then increased from the 1970s to the 2010s with the lowest value occurring in the 2000s there was an increasing tendency in the water quantity per unit area of the downstream western sub basin ranging between 250 and 300 mm 4 4 spatial and temporal variation in the water resources of typical ecosystems and influencing factors the total water resources and forest ecosystem of the dongjiang river basin varied significantly between 1971 and 2020 with negative trends identified in the majority of areas fig 7 e the southeastern sub basin of the lower reaches experienced the greatest relative change in water resources from the 1970s to the 1980s with a definite decreasing trend fig 7a from the 1980s to the 1990s the total water resources of the western upper reaches and lower sub basins increased fig 7b from the 1990s to the 2000s only the upper and lower regions of the watershed exhibited a negative trend fig 7c from the 1900s to the 2010s there was a reduced relative change in total water resources with generally negative but slow trends in the eastern and southwestern subbasins fig 7d as shown in fig 7j the relative change in the water resources of the forest ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 was consistent with that of total water resources the relative change in the lower reaches was less than 20 from the 1970s to the 1980s fig 7f followed by a clear increasing trend in subsequent decades fig 7g h i and then exceeded 20 from 2000 to 2010 fig 7i from 1980 to 2020 as shown in fig 8 a the lower and upper reaches experienced more extreme land use changes in the lower reaches arable land and forest land were converted into urban land whereas forest land was converted into cultivated land in the upper reaches in 1990 forest land and cultivated land were changed to urban land in the lower reaches of the basin while forest land was converted to water bodies in the western portion the rate of land use change in the lower reaches slowed gradually from 1990 to 2000 and from 2010 to 2020 the trend of land use change in 2010 was toward urban land with a considerable portion of forest land being converted to cultivated land in the northern portion of the basin showing a decrease in the forest area according to fig 8b there was a strong positive correlation between land use change and the relative changes in the water resources of the dry cropland ecosystems agrc paddy field ecosystems agrl arbor forest ecosystems frse and other forest ecosystems frst in contrast a negative correlation was observed between the grassland ecosystem and changes in other land uses the temperature had a significant negative correlation with the dry crop land ecosystem paddy field ecosystem arbor forest ecosystem and other forest ecosystem the temperature increased in a changing trend from 1970 to 2020 as shown in fig 8c suggesting that the temperature rise was significantly associated with the decrease in the ecosystem s water resources precipitation was positively correlated with water resources in forest ecosystems while no relationships were found between precipitation and water resources in dry crop land and paddy ecosystems 5 discussion the present study applied the swat model to the dongjiang river basin to analyze the changes in water resources of the basin over the last 50 years this study distinguished the drivers of changes to water resources according to two broad categories climate change and human activities yang et al 2018 abhishek et al 2021 abhishek and kinouchi 2021 in terms of climate change precipitation in the dongjiang river basin was positively correlated with enso nio southern oscillation occurrences and exhibited a gradually decreasing trend over the previous 60 years wang et al 2021b but temperature exhibited a considerable rising trend zhou et al 2018 there was less rainfall during years of lower water resources in the basin it primarily demonstrated a 2 4 year cycle in the 1970 s and a 3 6 year cycle in the late 1990 s meteorological and hydrological droughts for example occurred in 1991 and 2004 respectively while a hydrological drought occurred in 2009 xie et al 2020 this could cause a reduction in water resources in the basin during this period yang et al 2018 since the 1970s the pearl river delta has experienced rapid population and economic growth which has increased the need for water consequently a series of water shortages and water contamination incidents developed liu et al 2018 as a result total water resources decreased between 1984 and 1991 the people s government of guangdong provincial developed a water resource allocation plan for the dongjiang river basin in 2008 water resources used in cities such as shenzhen and dongguan were limited under the system this was one of the reasons why the total amount of water in the dongjiang river slowed in the 2010s in many cases land management has a significant impact on water resources and basin hydrology is sensitive to dynamic changes in land use nkosi et al 2021 the average water resources of the forest ecosystem inside the basin comprised more than half of the overall water resources this is because forests cover more than 80 of the basin area and their water conservation capabilities which include maintaining precipitation and limiting runoff because of the water storage and irrigation requirements of agricultural production paddy fields demand more water resources than forests as a result the paddy field ecosystem required a comparatively significant amount of water per unit area farmland in the dongjiang river basin decreased by 55 91 km2 between 1990 and 2009 resulting in a decrease in the overall water resources of the paddy ecosystem lyu et al 2018 this reduced the amount of water resources in the ecosystem meanwhile grassland accounted for only 3 of land use types in the watershed however most grassland was distributed in the southern and central areas in which there was high precipitation consequently the quantity of water per unit area of the grassland ecosystem was relatively large over the previous 50 years the total water resources of the forest ecosystem have decreased in addition to climate variables it may be influenced by the rapid conversion of forests to urban areas in the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang river basin lü et al 2014 deng and chen 2020 zhou et al 2018 simultaneously the government implemented forest protection regulations such as suspending the cutting of natural broad leaved forests in the higher reaches of 2005 which was expected to boost the forest ecosystem s water resources in several sub basins in the 2010s in this paper the spatial and temporal change patterns of water resources were examined in conjunction with land use temperature and precipitation at the scale of a whole watershed s ecosystem in the meantime basins or locations around the world with similar physical and geographical circumstances can apply this method which provides a helpful reference for the research of water resources in typical ecosystem water resources according to lü et al 2014 total water resources in the entire watershed and forest ecosystem increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream the dongjiang river basin s precipitation gradually dropped from xinfengjiang in the middle reaches to the upper and lower reaches wang et al 2021b as a result the forest ecosystem has comparatively abundant water resources in the central and western subbasins with relatively high water per unit area the northern central western and central eastern sub basins have significant forest coverage rates and precipitation interception by plants improves rainfall infiltration into the soil as a result these areas water resources are relatively abundant the expansion of urban areas increased impervious surface coverage hence increasing surface runoff kumar et al 2017 in the 1990s the dongjiang river basin experienced minimal land use change which slowed the relative change rate of water resources due to urban development in the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang river arable land and forest have been extensively changed into the urban area resulting in an increase in water resources in the basin s lower reaches physical water diversion projects and virtual water flow deployment will put further demand on water resources in water deficient areas zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 for example in the 1990s shenzhen faced a severe lack of water resources thus a water diversion project was created upstream of huizhou city which had an impact on regional water resources this study did not investigate the specific impact of the water transfer project on the dongjiang river basin ecosystem water resources but additional research can be conducted in the future the present investigation included numerous limitations first the reservoir can moderate flow extremes lessen and delay floods during the flood season and replenish runoff during the dry season the greater the reservoir capacity the greater the impact on runoff liu et al 2019 as a result the operations of large reservoirs such as the xinfengjiang reservoir would reduce the model s accuracy second human groundwater extraction activities may result in a shortage of water resources in the watershed xiong et al 2022 although surface water is the primary source of water in the dongjiang river basin and groundwater supply in guangdong shenzhen dongguan and other cities accounts for less than 1 of the total water supply cao et al 2021 the development and utilization of groundwater in the dongjiang river basin have little influence on the model s simulation results there is still interest in broadening research in this area in the future finally the transition of land uses such as forests farmland grassland and urban land would affect not only the quantity of water resources but also the quality of water and the health of ecosystems scanlon et al 2007 future research can evaluate the influence of changes in typical ecosystems on the water environment to improve water resource administration and protection 6 conclusions the spatial and temporal dynamics of water resources in typical ecosystems of the dongjiang river basin were investigated using the swat model in this work the following are the current investigation s findings 1 the average quantity of water resources was 37 944 bm3 in the dongjiang river basin from 1971 to 2020 and there were noticeable changes in the basin s total quantity of water resources the most important climatic factors influencing water resources were precipitation and temperature 2 from 1971 to 2020 total water resources of typical ecosystems in the dongjiang river basin exhibited a decreasing trend the average total water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 which increased and subsequently dropped from upstream to downstream the total quantity of water resources in the grassland ecosystem increased with the amount of water per unit area 3 the change in total water resources has slowed over the previous decade which is consistent with the change in the water resources of the dongjiang river basin s forest ecosystem changes in water resources were more significant in the lower and middle reaches than in the upper reaches changes in land use were a significant factor in the evolution of water resources in typical ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement ke zhu data curation formal analysis investigation methodology resources

2775,in hydrology research how to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal changes of water resources in the ecosystem of a watershed is one of the focuses of attention especially in the strategically important dongjiang river basin which is the source of water for three world class cities of hong kong shenzhen and guangzhou hence it is important to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of water resources at the basin and ecosystem scale of dongjiang river basin the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in this study to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of typical ecosystem water resources in the dongjiang river basin over the last 50 years the objectives of the study were to 1 identify the distribution of water resources in typical ecosystems 2 determine the quantity of water in the forest ecosystem and 3 characterize the spatial and temporal changes the findings revealed that 1 the average water resources in the dongjiang river basin from 1971 to 2020 were 37 944 bm3 and there were obvious changes in the basin s total quantity of water resources the most important climatic factors influencing water resources were precipitation and temperature 2 from 1971 to 2020 the total water resources of typical donjiang river basin ecosystems exhibited a declining trend the total average water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 which first increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream the total quantity of water resources in the grassland ecosystem increases with the amount of water per unit area 3 the change in total water resources has been decreasing over the last decade which is consistent with the change in the water resources of the forest ecosystem in the dongjiang river basin changes in water resources were greater in the lower and middle reaches than in the upper reaches changes in land use were a significant factor in the evolution of water resources in typical ecosystems this study can provide theoretical support for the comprehensive management of typical ecosystems and water resources in the dongjiang river basin keywords dongjiang river basin swat model typical ecosystem forest ecosystem water resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in hydrology research it is important to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of water resources at the basin and ecosystem scale xia et al 2020 wang et al 2021a there will be different ecosystems in various historical development periods and locations of the watershed resulting in changes in water resources meanwhile the development of the human economy and society will change the ecosystem affecting water resources through changes in vegetation biological community structure and other patterns xia et al 2020 cheng et al 2014 demonstrated that irrigation and groundwater influence the fluctuation and exchange of soil moisture in farmland and forest in the middle reaches of the heihe river abhishek et al 2021 analyzed water resources changes in the chao phraya river basin using grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite data and demonstrated that human activities dominated water storage dynamics abhishek and kinouchi 2021 therefore the underlying surface climatic conditions and human activities have significant impacts on the stability and security of the watershed ecosystem guo et al 2020 the ecological and hydrological processes of terrestrial vegetation can be classified according to spatial scale into the plant vegetation group road ecosystem watershed and global scales wang et al 2021a studies on vegetation ecohydrological processes at various scales aim to address different problems watershed and continental scales are primarily concerned with the impact of land use change on specific hydrological processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater mcmillan 2020 the ecosystem scale is primarily concerned with changes in water resources within the terrestrial ecosystem as well as the ecosystem s effects on hydrological processes and underlying surface conditions goldsmith 2013 yang et al 2017 hao and sun 2021 however few studies on water resource characteristics at the ecosystem scale of paddy dryland and forest in entire basins have been conducted limiting systematic understanding of ecohydrology song et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2016 in the hydrological process rainfall is the only source of water resources in the watershed after rainfall reaches the surface the hydrological cycle in the basin is realized through surface runoff soil flow underground runoff evaporation and water vapour transport falkenmark and rockström 2006 to better manage river basin water resources ecological protection and restoration researchers have employed a variety of models and methods to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and driving mechanisms of water resources at the watershed scale zang and mao 2019 zhao et al 2016 rivas tabares et al 2019 used the swat model to assess the usability of water resources in sub arid mediterranean watersheds and discovered that crop rotation soil management and other related measures are critical for water resource management during dry periods zang and mao 2019 analyzed the distribution pattern of blue and green water flow in typical ecosystems of arid inland river basins in northwest china using the swat model blue water is primarily derived from rivers lakes and shallow groundwater whereas green water is primarily derived from soil water or atmospheric water falkenmark and rockström 2006 typical ecosystems are the main ecosystems in the basin which usually have a larger area proportion and play an irreplaceable role in the hydrological process of the watershed song et al 2019 discovered that the area quality structure and climate characteristics of the forest ecosystem have a direct impact on the water conservation capacity of the watershed yu et al 2020 zang et al 2020 high forest coverage is conducive to water resource utilization and ecological protection wang et al 2019 zhang and yuan 2016 discovered that the distribution of water resources in forest ecosystems is influenced by elevation and slope according to zhou et al 2020 inappropriate vegetation restoration may result in a reduction of water resources in the watershed however few studies on the comprehensive spatial and temporal evolution analysis of water resources in typical ecosystems have been conducted in the last 50 years making it impossible to answer the essential questions of watershed water resources management and ecological restoration therefore it is crucial to examine the spatial and temporal evolution of water resources at the ecosystem scale the dongjiang river is the source of water for three world class cities guangzhou shenzhen and hong kong and has strategic importance for the development of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area in the dongjiang river basin rapid economic development and population growth over the past few decades have caused water resource issues such as increased water utilization water pollution and saltwater intrusion deng and chen 2020 liu et al 2018 according to the statistics of annual average inflow the utilization rate of water resources in the dongjiang river basin is 26 29 3 huang et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the management of water resources zhou et al 2018 romano et al 2018 the dongjiang river basin is one of china s most forested areas with forest paddy fields dry cropland and grassland ecosystems accounting for more than 90 of the dongjiang river basin s most representative ecosystems therefore they were selected as typical ecosystems to investigate changes in water resources in the watershed the objectives of the study were to 1 identify the distribution of water resources in typical ecosystems 2 determine the quantity of water in the forest ecosystem and 3 characterize the spatial and temporal changes over the past 50 years the findings of this study can serve as a theoretical basis for the comprehensive management of water resources and typical ecosystems in the dongjiang river basin 2 study area located between 113 21 22 e 115 54 25 e and 22 23 40 n 25 12 10 n fig 1 the dongjiang river basin has an annual sunshine duration of 1700 2000 h an annual temperature of 21 and annual precipitation of 1500 2400 mm wu et al 2019 longchuan separates the upper and middle reaches whereas boluo separates the middle and lower reaches the total area of the river basin above the shiyang river estuary is 35 340 km2 of which 31 840 km2 and 35 00 km2 are in the provinces of guangdong and jiangxi respectively the largest reservoir in the dongjiang river basin is the xinfengjiang reservoir which is located in heyuan city and covers an area of 1600 km2 with a storage capacity of 13 9 billion m3 wu et al 2019 the dongjiang river provides water to nearly 40 million people in guangdong province and hong kong the dongjiang river basin has a per capita water resource of 800 m3 which is only 1 3rd of the national average chen et al 2022 despite not being in the dongjiang river basin hong kong receives more than 80 of its water from the dongjiang river via diversion projects wang and dai 2021 the dongjiang river plays a crucial role in the economic development of guangdong province contributing 4 17t yuan 39 of the gross domestic product gdp of guangdong province in 2019 wu et al 2021 3 data and methods 3 1 data sources the swat model is widely used to simulate the hydrological characteristics of watersheds under various land use and climate conditions zang et al 2012 li et al 2021 as shown in table 1 developing the swat model requires the use of various types of geographic data the digital elevation model dem was utilized to develop river networks and watersheds hydrology response units hrus can be generated using land use data harmony world soil database hwsd and dongjiangyuan national forest ecological station provided the soil data used to construct the soil database the attribute database was constructed using meteorological data runoff data was used to calibrate and validate the model wu et al 2019 kumar et al 2017 3 2 calculation of water resources a total water resources to better reveal the characteristics of water resources of typical ecosystems at a watershed scale the sum of the root zone seepage including shallow groundwater surface runoff and lateral flow was considered to represent the total water resources and was calculated for each sub basin zang et al 2016 according to the geographical and environmental characteristics of the dongjiang river basin and the research conducted in watersheds of the same type among these surface runoff is the volume of water that results from surface water converging and flowing without infiltration lateral flow is runoff that moves laterally through the soil rivas tabares et al 2019 1 w i 1 n p e r c s u r q l a t q s i 1000 in eq 1 w represents the total water resources m3 and perc surq and latq represent the seepage surface runoff and lateral flow of the hru over a specified period mm respectively si is the catchment area of the hru km2 and n is the number of hrus b water resources per unit area according to eq 1 the total water resources of a sub basin are influenced by its area therefore larger sub basins may contain more water resources the water resources per unit area reduce the influence of the sub basin area and can reflect the actual quantity of water in a basin zang et al 2012 2 r i i 1 n w i s i 1 n s i in eq 2 ri represents the water resource depth mm in sub basin i i e the water resources per unit area wi represents the water resource quantity in hydrological response unit i and si is the area of an hru c the relative change rate the relative change in water resources is the ratio of water resources in the later period to those in the earlier period which reflects the change in water resources in typical ecosystems zang et al 2012 3 rcr x 2 x 1 x 1 100 in eq 3 rcr is the relative rate of change in water resources x is the set of variables representing the water resources in a typical ecosystem and x1 and x2 are the water resources in the previous and later periods respectively 3 3 mechanism responsible for changes in water resources a the land use transfer matrix many studies have shown that the land use transfer matrix is a relatively mature and reliable method for investigating land use change zhang et al 2020b and the results obtained are also credible therefore the land use matrix was utilized in this study to investigate the change in land types over different periods 4 s ij s 11 s 21 s 12 s 22 s 1 n s 2 n s n 1 s n 2 s nn in eq 4 s is the land use area n is the land use type i and j are the land use types in the previous period and the later period respectively b correlation analysis the variation in runoff in the dongjiang river basin is primarily determined by climatic factors specifically precipitation and temperature yang et al 2018 greater precipitation can increase runoff whereas increased evaporation can decrease it consequently temperature and precipitation were selected as the primary determinants of water resource changes in typical ecosystems meanwhile different types of land use have an impact on the distribution of water resources in the basin correlation analysis can investigate the relationship between several random variables correlation analysis was chosen to examine the changes in water resources in various ecosystems and their underlying causes senthilnathan 2019 5 ρ x y n x y x y n x 2 x 2 n y 2 y 2 in eq 5 n is the number of random variables and and y are random variables 3 4 the swat model the swat model was developed in the 1980 s by the united states agricultural research center usda ars it is a basin scale distributed hydrological model that is physically based and highly computationally efficient allowing for long term simulation of a watershed zhang et al 2020a shrestha et al 2017 the underlying surface and climate factors of a basin often exhibit spatial and temporal differences therefore the soil conservation service scs runoff curve algorithm can be used in general to estimate surface runoff water that penetrates beneath the bottom of the root zone creates groundwater or causes reflux a river s flow was calculated using the variable storage coefficient method or the muskingum algorithm simulations of runoff generation slope confluence and river confluence are generated by the swat model zang et al 2016 the hydrological response unit of the swat model consisted of subbasins with identical land use soil type and slope the sub basins were divided into various combinations of land use and soil type resulting in multiple hydrological response units hrus reshmidevi et al 2018 based on the characteristics of the dongjiang river basin this study separated the basin into 53 sub basins and 1 038 hrus the land use data were manually categorized according to the interpretations of thematic mapper images based on the land use distribution map the results of the land use cover analysis at a scale of 1 1 million were based on urban renewal by the chinese academy of sciences lyu et al 2018 then the soil water characteristics program swcp software was used to compute soil moisture density water retention capacity saturated water conductivity and other soil parameters required to establish the swat model tudose et al 2021 finally the dongjiangyuan ecological station data were employed as auxiliary data for parameter localization when developing the swat model data from the china meteorological data network table 1 were used as inputs for temperature humidity rainfall wind speed and solar radiation senent aparicio et al 2021 the swat model also included a weather database the swat weather program calculated the average maximum and minimum monthly temperatures the standard deviation in daily maximum and minimum temperatures monthly average dew point temperature standard deviation and skewness coefficient of monthly average rainfall monthly dry day coefficient monthly wet day coefficient monthly average rainfall days and monthly average solar radiation among other parameters 3 5 model calibration and validation the uncertainty in parameter estimation can be minimized through parameter sensitivity analysis when conducting sensitivity analysis on the swat model parameters the suif 2 sequential uncertainty fitting process version 2 was a prevalent technique guo and su 2019 a t value and a p value were used to establish the swat model s sensitivity to each parameter the p and t values are both positively and negatively associated with the model s sensitivity to a parameter guo and su 2019 the ideal parameters and their value range were found using parameter sensitivity analysis and references to relevant literature li et al 2020 as shown in table 2 the calibration parameters were then substituted into the model during the validation period to ensure that the calibration findings were accurate the model s simulation period was from 1970 to 2020 the calibration period was from 1990 to 2004 while the validation period lasted from 2010 to 2020 on the one hand there was an appropriate time interval between the calibration and validation periods making the results more reliable however the two time periods selected for calibration and validation were representative of the dongjiang river basin s economic and social development one is the period of stable economic development meaning that the land cover changes were small and the other is the period of rapid economic development meaning that the land cover changes were large the nash sutcliff coefficient ens and the determination coefficient r2 were used in this study to evaluate the model s outcomes almeida et al 2018 li et al 2021 the nash sutcliff coefficient ens is a common hydrological model evaluation index the closer ens is to 1 the more representative the simulated flow is of observed flow however ens is more sensitive to high values and peak flow simulation has a significant impact on the coefficient li et al 2021 therefore the determination coefficient r2 is used as a supplementary index when r2 1 the larger the value the more consistent the model is with the actual situation generally r2 0 6 and ens 0 5 are regarded as reliable standards of runoff simulation zang et al 2012 almeida et al 2018 6 e ns 1 i 1 n q oi q mi 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 7 r 2 i 1 n q oi q o q mi q o 2 i 1 n q oi q o 2 q mi q m 2 in eq 6 and eq 7 qoi and qmi are the measured and simulated values of the ith flow respectively n denotes the total number of observations zang et al 2012 4 results 4 1 results of calibration and validation of the swat model boluo station is an extremely important hydrological station of the dongjiang river accounting for 71 7 of the total watershed area of the dongjiang river basin therefore the optimized parameters obtained from the boluo station are critical in representing the entire watershed zang et al 2012 the calibrated ens and r2of the boluo hydrological station simulation of the swat model were 0 84 and 0 81 respectively while the validated ens and r2 were 0 79 and 0 72 which are satisfactory fig 2 it demonstrated that the model s outputs can better represent observation data and can provide assistance and a basis for calculating the reliability of water resources in various ecosystems in fig 2 the uncertainty zone is skewed to the side of the simulated value for specific periods the reason for this is that the model s uncertainty is influenced by numerous factors according to the study by lü et al 2014 the simulated runoff was much greater than the measured runoff in wet years and lower than the measured runoff in dry years due to the influence of water storage and recharge of xinfengjiang reservoir li et al 2009 in this study combined with the results of parameter sensitivity analysis cn2 alpha bf and gw dela had a significant impact on runoff table 2 in addition the impact of topography and soil water movement resulted in significant differences between the simulated and measured values 4 2 changes in the water resources of the dongjiang river basin over the past 50 years the water resources of the dongjiang river basin varied greatly from 1971 to 2020 fig 3 with an average of 37 944 bm3 the total water resources in 2016 were the most in the last 50 years reaching 62 102 bm3 while the total water resources in 1991 were the lowest at only 18 063 bm3 representing a 44 039 bm3 difference water resources increased in value from 1971 to 1983 with the value achieved in 1983 being the second highest in the last 50 years water resources changed significantly in the 1980 s total water resources varied around 39 bm3 from 1992 to 2001 and were low with a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2004 between 2005 and 2010 overall water resources recovered exceeding 40 bm3 in four years between 2011 and 2020 overall water resources increased followed by a decline with substantial variability the total water resources were less than 30 bm3 in 2011 2018 and 2020 4 3 changes in water resources of typical ecosystems of the dongjiang river basin over the last 50 years 4 3 1 changes to water resources in a typical ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 based on average total water resources the dongjiang river basin s ecosystems ranked as follows fig 4 a arbor forest ecosystem 23 157 bm3 paddy field ecosystem 7 084 bm3 other forest ecosystem shrub sparse forest unformed forest etc 3 3168 bm3 dry crop land ecosystem 1 9728 bm3 grassland ecosystem 1 502 bm3 the average total water resources of the arbor and forest land accounted for 62 4 of the total water resources of the watershed the total water resources of the paddy field and arbor forest ecosystems were decreasing with the latter changing the most the total water resources of the grassland ecosystem increased throughout time reaching a peak in the 2010s the rank of the ecosystems in terms of average water per unit area from 1971 to 2020 was fig 4b dry crop land ecosystem 125 99 mm grassland ecosystem 120 21 mm paddy field ecosystem 114 34 mm other forest ecosystem 88 43 mm arbor forest ecosystem 88 38 mm water per unit area was mainly influenced by rainfall but both rainfall and sub basin areas could impact total water therefore the changes depicted in fig 4 a and 4 b appear to be different the area of the grassland ecosystem 1006 18 km2 and dry cropland ecosystem 2035 18 km2 were substantially lower than that of the arbor forest ecosystem 20754 97 km2 but the amount of water influenced by rainfall per unit area was greater 4 3 2 changes in water resources of the forest ecosystem the average total water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 over the past 50 years accounting for 71 4 of the total water resources of the dongjiang river basin which increased and subsequently decreased from upstream to downstream fig 5 over the last 50 years the water resources of the forest ecosystem have become less spatially variable however several subbasins exhibited decreasing trends the total water resources of the forest ecosystems in the eastern sub basin in the middle reaches showed a decreasing trend from the 1980s to the 2010s the water resources of the forest ecosystem in the southeastern sub basin of the lower reaches first decreased then increased with turning points in the 2000s the water quantity per unit area of the forest ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 first increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream fig 6 the middle reaches had the most water per unit area averaging 200 mm while the upstream and downstream reaches had 100 150 mm water resources per unit area of the forest ecosystem in the upstream and downstream sub watersheds decreased and then increased from the 1970s to the 2010s with the lowest value occurring in the 2000s there was an increasing tendency in the water quantity per unit area of the downstream western sub basin ranging between 250 and 300 mm 4 4 spatial and temporal variation in the water resources of typical ecosystems and influencing factors the total water resources and forest ecosystem of the dongjiang river basin varied significantly between 1971 and 2020 with negative trends identified in the majority of areas fig 7 e the southeastern sub basin of the lower reaches experienced the greatest relative change in water resources from the 1970s to the 1980s with a definite decreasing trend fig 7a from the 1980s to the 1990s the total water resources of the western upper reaches and lower sub basins increased fig 7b from the 1990s to the 2000s only the upper and lower regions of the watershed exhibited a negative trend fig 7c from the 1900s to the 2010s there was a reduced relative change in total water resources with generally negative but slow trends in the eastern and southwestern subbasins fig 7d as shown in fig 7j the relative change in the water resources of the forest ecosystem from 1971 to 2020 was consistent with that of total water resources the relative change in the lower reaches was less than 20 from the 1970s to the 1980s fig 7f followed by a clear increasing trend in subsequent decades fig 7g h i and then exceeded 20 from 2000 to 2010 fig 7i from 1980 to 2020 as shown in fig 8 a the lower and upper reaches experienced more extreme land use changes in the lower reaches arable land and forest land were converted into urban land whereas forest land was converted into cultivated land in the upper reaches in 1990 forest land and cultivated land were changed to urban land in the lower reaches of the basin while forest land was converted to water bodies in the western portion the rate of land use change in the lower reaches slowed gradually from 1990 to 2000 and from 2010 to 2020 the trend of land use change in 2010 was toward urban land with a considerable portion of forest land being converted to cultivated land in the northern portion of the basin showing a decrease in the forest area according to fig 8b there was a strong positive correlation between land use change and the relative changes in the water resources of the dry cropland ecosystems agrc paddy field ecosystems agrl arbor forest ecosystems frse and other forest ecosystems frst in contrast a negative correlation was observed between the grassland ecosystem and changes in other land uses the temperature had a significant negative correlation with the dry crop land ecosystem paddy field ecosystem arbor forest ecosystem and other forest ecosystem the temperature increased in a changing trend from 1970 to 2020 as shown in fig 8c suggesting that the temperature rise was significantly associated with the decrease in the ecosystem s water resources precipitation was positively correlated with water resources in forest ecosystems while no relationships were found between precipitation and water resources in dry crop land and paddy ecosystems 5 discussion the present study applied the swat model to the dongjiang river basin to analyze the changes in water resources of the basin over the last 50 years this study distinguished the drivers of changes to water resources according to two broad categories climate change and human activities yang et al 2018 abhishek et al 2021 abhishek and kinouchi 2021 in terms of climate change precipitation in the dongjiang river basin was positively correlated with enso nio southern oscillation occurrences and exhibited a gradually decreasing trend over the previous 60 years wang et al 2021b but temperature exhibited a considerable rising trend zhou et al 2018 there was less rainfall during years of lower water resources in the basin it primarily demonstrated a 2 4 year cycle in the 1970 s and a 3 6 year cycle in the late 1990 s meteorological and hydrological droughts for example occurred in 1991 and 2004 respectively while a hydrological drought occurred in 2009 xie et al 2020 this could cause a reduction in water resources in the basin during this period yang et al 2018 since the 1970s the pearl river delta has experienced rapid population and economic growth which has increased the need for water consequently a series of water shortages and water contamination incidents developed liu et al 2018 as a result total water resources decreased between 1984 and 1991 the people s government of guangdong provincial developed a water resource allocation plan for the dongjiang river basin in 2008 water resources used in cities such as shenzhen and dongguan were limited under the system this was one of the reasons why the total amount of water in the dongjiang river slowed in the 2010s in many cases land management has a significant impact on water resources and basin hydrology is sensitive to dynamic changes in land use nkosi et al 2021 the average water resources of the forest ecosystem inside the basin comprised more than half of the overall water resources this is because forests cover more than 80 of the basin area and their water conservation capabilities which include maintaining precipitation and limiting runoff because of the water storage and irrigation requirements of agricultural production paddy fields demand more water resources than forests as a result the paddy field ecosystem required a comparatively significant amount of water per unit area farmland in the dongjiang river basin decreased by 55 91 km2 between 1990 and 2009 resulting in a decrease in the overall water resources of the paddy ecosystem lyu et al 2018 this reduced the amount of water resources in the ecosystem meanwhile grassland accounted for only 3 of land use types in the watershed however most grassland was distributed in the southern and central areas in which there was high precipitation consequently the quantity of water per unit area of the grassland ecosystem was relatively large over the previous 50 years the total water resources of the forest ecosystem have decreased in addition to climate variables it may be influenced by the rapid conversion of forests to urban areas in the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang river basin lü et al 2014 deng and chen 2020 zhou et al 2018 simultaneously the government implemented forest protection regulations such as suspending the cutting of natural broad leaved forests in the higher reaches of 2005 which was expected to boost the forest ecosystem s water resources in several sub basins in the 2010s in this paper the spatial and temporal change patterns of water resources were examined in conjunction with land use temperature and precipitation at the scale of a whole watershed s ecosystem in the meantime basins or locations around the world with similar physical and geographical circumstances can apply this method which provides a helpful reference for the research of water resources in typical ecosystem water resources according to lü et al 2014 total water resources in the entire watershed and forest ecosystem increased and then decreased from upstream to downstream the dongjiang river basin s precipitation gradually dropped from xinfengjiang in the middle reaches to the upper and lower reaches wang et al 2021b as a result the forest ecosystem has comparatively abundant water resources in the central and western subbasins with relatively high water per unit area the northern central western and central eastern sub basins have significant forest coverage rates and precipitation interception by plants improves rainfall infiltration into the soil as a result these areas water resources are relatively abundant the expansion of urban areas increased impervious surface coverage hence increasing surface runoff kumar et al 2017 in the 1990s the dongjiang river basin experienced minimal land use change which slowed the relative change rate of water resources due to urban development in the middle and lower reaches of the dongjiang river arable land and forest have been extensively changed into the urban area resulting in an increase in water resources in the basin s lower reaches physical water diversion projects and virtual water flow deployment will put further demand on water resources in water deficient areas zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 for example in the 1990s shenzhen faced a severe lack of water resources thus a water diversion project was created upstream of huizhou city which had an impact on regional water resources this study did not investigate the specific impact of the water transfer project on the dongjiang river basin ecosystem water resources but additional research can be conducted in the future the present investigation included numerous limitations first the reservoir can moderate flow extremes lessen and delay floods during the flood season and replenish runoff during the dry season the greater the reservoir capacity the greater the impact on runoff liu et al 2019 as a result the operations of large reservoirs such as the xinfengjiang reservoir would reduce the model s accuracy second human groundwater extraction activities may result in a shortage of water resources in the watershed xiong et al 2022 although surface water is the primary source of water in the dongjiang river basin and groundwater supply in guangdong shenzhen dongguan and other cities accounts for less than 1 of the total water supply cao et al 2021 the development and utilization of groundwater in the dongjiang river basin have little influence on the model s simulation results there is still interest in broadening research in this area in the future finally the transition of land uses such as forests farmland grassland and urban land would affect not only the quantity of water resources but also the quality of water and the health of ecosystems scanlon et al 2007 future research can evaluate the influence of changes in typical ecosystems on the water environment to improve water resource administration and protection 6 conclusions the spatial and temporal dynamics of water resources in typical ecosystems of the dongjiang river basin were investigated using the swat model in this work the following are the current investigation s findings 1 the average quantity of water resources was 37 944 bm3 in the dongjiang river basin from 1971 to 2020 and there were noticeable changes in the basin s total quantity of water resources the most important climatic factors influencing water resources were precipitation and temperature 2 from 1971 to 2020 total water resources of typical ecosystems in the dongjiang river basin exhibited a decreasing trend the average total water resources of the forest ecosystem were 27 532 bm3 which increased and subsequently dropped from upstream to downstream the total quantity of water resources in the grassland ecosystem increased with the amount of water per unit area 3 the change in total water resources has slowed over the previous decade which is consistent with the change in the water resources of the dongjiang river basin s forest ecosystem changes in water resources were more significant in the lower and middle reaches than in the upper reaches changes in land use were a significant factor in the evolution of water resources in typical ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement ke zhu data curation formal analysis investigation methodology resources

are compared in this study the effect of flow and sediment conditions on the incremental benefit of cooperation is examined which shows that the systematic incremental benefit is larger when the yrb is dryer and sediment concentration is higher basin wide cooperation is especially beneficial when the inflow peak comes earlier and the streamflow process is more fluctuating cooperation of reservoir stakeholders in a normal year 2019 can bring more incremental benefit i e 22 57 million in contrast to the non cooperation scenario longyangxia liujiaxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs contribute most to the grand cooperation by implementing optimal operation for downstream stakeholders three cooperative game theory methods shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution are employed to find possible benefit sharing solutions based on cooperative game theory the results demonstrate the core of basin wide cooperation in the yellow river is negligible due to the negative externality effect implying more measures are needed by the government or non profit organization to maintain the stability of grand coalition i e water resources utilization control and external compensation the results also show that shapley value could be used to reallocate the incremental benefits in the grand cooperation abbreviations yrb yellow river basin fc flood control ws water supply hp hydropower

second longest river is relatively scarce in water resources but rich in sediment load omer et al 2020a omer et al 2020b ringler et al 2010 big reservoirs have been built on the mainstream for multiple purposes serving as the major facilities for basin wide regulation of water and sediment hou et al 2013 ming et al 2019 dong et al 2015 li et al 2007 yuan et al 2021 recently the issue of environmental protection and high quality development of the yrb has been raised as a national strategy of china xi 2019 chen et al 2020 ren and dou 2021 gao et al 2020 which calls for joint operation of these big reservoirs to meet demands from both natural and human dimensions yao et al 2017 li et al 2016 these mainstream reservoirs are designed and operated for multiple objectives including flood control fc water supply ws hydropower generation sediment management and environmental flow among these objectives fc always has the highest priority in flood seasons and a key design principle of these reservoirs fc storage must be reserved for flood seasons zhou et al 2014 ning et al 2021 xue et al 2022 after that ws is immediately guaranteed according to the rules of unified flow regulation of the yrb zhao et al 2009 following the water resources allocation scheme issued by the state council of china in 1987 environmental flow regulation has been partially implemented in the yrb for instance in 2020 ecological regulation was applied in the mainstream and important tributaries to ensure the minimum environmental flow and maintain the ecological function of rivers according to the published ecological regulation scheme of the yellow river in 2020 yellow river conservancy commission 2020 the environmental flow regulation will be enforced with high priority for the whole yrb in near future yellow river conservancy commission 2013 2021 liu and hu 2021 apart from the objectives mentioned above maintaining a trade off between hydropower generation hp and sediment transport st is a major concern for mainstream reservoir stakeholders hydropower is a low cost renewable energy source that plays an important role in the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb chen et al 2020 gilbert 2010 wada et al 2018 zhou 2020 si et al 2018 meanwhile reservoir sedimentation complicates reservoir management by reducing active storage thus impacting the long term benefits of reservoirs zheng et al 2015 ren et al 2018 guo et al 2020 the trade off between the above issues lies in st needing high flows negatively impacting hydropower generation in the short term in the yrb sediment is mostly from the middle reach area milliman et al 1987 gao et al 2017 wang and sun 2021 stevens et al 2013 and sediment fills the downstream reservoirs rapidly if no sediment management operation is applied designed high flows can help st and make the reservoirs work efficiently for a longer time in a process called flow and sediment regulation fsr in the yrb however applying fsr downstream requires more water release from upstream reservoirs which reduces the hydropower generation of those upstream reservoirs basin scale joint operation may yield more long term benefits but upstream reservoirs need to give up some short term hydropower generation theoretically if upstream stakeholders cannot get extra gains from the cooperation or even get fewer benefits for the improvement of other stakeholders they will certainly depart from the cooperation this potential issue calls for an approach to find cooperative solutions to make all the reservoir stakeholders prefer a basin scale joint operation where the reallocation of incremental benefit from cooperation is crucial cooperative game theory cgt studies how stakeholders can achieve a stable cooperation and reallocate the incremental benefits from cooperation in the sense that no one has an incentive to depart from the cooperation cgt provides a useful tool to analyze the opportunities and conditions of cooperation in a game with multiple stakeholders benefit sharing solutions based on cgt have been proposed in many water resources management cases especially in transboundary river basins dombrowsky 2009 dombrowsky et al 2014 janjua et al 2020 li et al 2019 rahaman and abdullah al mamun 2020 jalilov et al 2015 some researchers have analyzed the gains from the joint optimal operation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb focusing on fc hp and ws bai et al 2015 however given the priorities of these objectives seeking basin scale solutions for optimizing hp and transports remains a crucial challenge this problem becomes more complicated when hydrologic conditions are engaged dinar 2002 streamflow and st vary in different hydrologic conditions primarily determining the stakeholders interests in cooperation therefore the effects of hydrologic conditions on cooperation need to be explored considering the yrb as a case study we propose an integrated model that couples the optimization of basin scale benefits and benefit sharing solution analysis to address the concerns raised above the rest of this paper is arranged as follows first research area and data are described then the integrated model is proposed by coupling optimization model and cooperative game theory model to calculate the benefits of different scenarios next the results of different scenarios are analyzed to discover benefit sharing solutions policy implications of the results are also discussed finally the conclusions are presented 2 research area and data originating from bayan har mountains in qinghai province the yellow river flows 5464 km into the bohai sea fig 1 with the yrb covering an area of 795000 km2 the upper yellow river flowing from the source to the togtoh county in inner mongolia is the major water source of the big river contributing more than 60 of the total annual runoff of the yellow river zhao et al 2009 su et al 2021 the middle yellow river flowing from togtoh county to huayuankou hydrologic gauge station is the major sediment source of the river due to the presence of loose soil in the loess plateau smalley et al 2009 stevens et al 2013 the lower yellow river flowing from huayuankou to the sea is mostly an overhanging river because of long term sediment deposition chu 2014 liu et al 2022 the yellow river provides hydropower irrigation and navigation for the riparian cities and counties it flows through water and sediment conflicts in the yrb have been discussed for decades there are approximately 752 irrigated areas in the yrb with 3963 103 ha of cultivated land ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 the irrigation areas in the yrb mainly include inner mongolia irrigation district 6243 12 km2 ningxia irrigation district 2114 39 km2 fenhe irrigation district 997 00 km2 and henan irrigation district 6120 00 km2 therefore irrigation water withdrawal is a major component of the total water use in the yrb especially in the densely populated lower yellow river increasing energy demand in the yrb has also led to extensive hydropower development on the mainstream and tributaries thousands of reservoirs were built in the whole basin by 2017 with a total storage capacity of 84 5 billion m3 longyangxia reservoir lyx liujiaxia reservoir ljx wanjiazhai reservoir wjz sanmenxia reservoir smx and xiaolangdi reservoir xld are the five biggest reservoirs on mainstream contributing to more than half of the total storage capacity of the basin the hp by these reservoirs supports the local economic development and residential life unlike other rivers a certain quantity of water in the yrb must be reserved for st in the middle and lower yellow river walling and fang 2003 hu et al 2012 sediment deposition occupies the utilization storage capacity of reservoirs wjz smx and xld have serious sedimentation problems li and feng 2003 lin et al 2011 jia et al 2020 due to a wide and flat terrain and small slope the lower yellow river has a large amount of suspended sediment deposited on the riverbed exposing the downstream channel to a higher flooding risk hou et al 2021 therefore water withdrawal hydropower and sedimentation should be considered in the joint operation of cascade reservoirs the conflicts between water usage and st in the yrb remains a crucial problem in this paper the five biggest reservoirs on mainstream namely lyx ljx wjz smx and xld are chosen for study these five reservoirs are important parts of the water and sediment regulation system in the yrb jiang et al 2021 as shown in table 1 lyx ljx and xld have big storage thus play important roles in water and sediment regulation in the yrb while wjz and smx have relatively small storage which may be less important in water regulation however the sedimentation of wjz and smx is of great importance to xld and downstream river channel li and feng 2003 lin et al 2011 thus these five reservoirs are chosen to study water and sediment regulation issue in the yrb the detailed parameters of the five reservoirs are shown in table 1 these five reservoirs are located in different provinces and administrated by different organizations table 1 according to the published measures for the management of the yellow river in henan province and channel management regulations of yellow river in shandong province yellow river conservancy commission yrcc is responsible for the channel management of yellow river which is the agent of the downstream channel dc thus the administrators of the five reservoirs and yrcc are the six stakeholders in practice for simplicity we use lyx ljx wjz smx xld and dc to represent the six stakeholders in this study respectively these six stakeholders have different interests resulting in challenges to basin scale cooperation yrcc is also responsible for the fc and ensures the safety of the yrb by sending operating instructions to each reservoir administrator in flood seasons the daily flow and sediment data used in this paper are obtained from yrcc gauge stations the monthly water withdrawal data are sourced from the yellow river water supply report published by yrcc 3 methodology 3 1 model framework description as shown in fig 2 the proposed model framework and analysis process include five steps 1 establishing the optimization model of cascade reservoirs for water sediment regulation in the yrb 2 analyzing the hydrological conditions of yellow river and setting the cooperation scenarios 3 calculating the direct water benefit and st under different scenarios using the optimization model 4 analyzing the incremental benefits from cooperation by comparing scenarios 5 applying cgt to reallocate the incremental benefits from coalitions ensuring benefit of each stakeholder and group better 6 results and discussion 3 2 integrated optimization model the integrated optimization model considers fc ws hp and st the node link map of the model is shown in fig 3 3 2 1 objectives as mentioned above fc and ws have higher priorities in the yrb therefore these two objectives are transformed into constraints in this study and hp and st benefits are set as the two objectives for optimization as follows 1 b 1 n max t 1 t hp t n 2 b 2 n max t 1 t v s t n where b 1 n and b 2 n are the hp benefit and the st benefit of the n th reservoir respectively hp t n is the hydropower production the larger the hp the more hydropower benefits the reservoirs create vs t n is the sediment volume deposited in the reservoir the larger the vs t n is the lesser st benefit the stakeholder gets the benefit of hp is defined as follows 3 hp t n k n δ t q pr t n h t n h 0 t n where kn is the output coefficient qpr t n is the average powerrelease h t n is the average water level before the dam h0 t n is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant and t is the length of the time period the st benefit is defined as the volume of sediment deposition the benefit function of the reservoir gets weakened due to reservoir silting it needs efforts and resources to recover the capacity in contrast when the reservoir is scoured the reservoir capacity expands bringing more benefits to stakeholders 4 w sin t n s in t n q in t n 5 w sout t n η w sin t n 6 v s t n w sin t n w sout t n ρ s where sin t n is the sediment concentration of inflow sout t n is the sediment concentration of release qin t n is the average inflow qout t n is the average release wsin t n is the sediment quantity of inflow wsout t n is the sediment quantity of release ρs is the density of the sediment in the reservoir η is the sediment delivery ratio of reservoirs in equations 1 and 2 the two objectives hp and the st have different units we integrate the two objectives into an overall benefit for each stakeholder measured by money to apply the game theory methods in benefit analysis as follows 7 b n c 1 n b 1 n c 2 n b 2 n where b n is the total benefit of the n th reservoir c 1 n is the unit price the hydropwer c 2 n is the unit cost of reservoir capacity recovery if the satakeholder is the downstream channel in the lower yrb then c 1 n is 0 and c 2 n is the unit cost of channel desilting tan et al 2018 3 2 2 constraints constraints of the optimization model are as follows 1 reservoir water balance constraints 8 w 1 n w 0 n q in 1 n q out 1 n δ t 9 w t n w t 1 n q in t n q out t n δ t 2 t t where w0 n is the initial storage of the n th reservoir and wt n is the storage of the reservoirs at the end of time period t 2 river channel water balance constraints 10 q in t n 1 q out t n q qujian t n 1 q div t n 1 where qin t n 1 is the average inflow of the n 1 th reservoir qqujian t n 1 is the inflow of the reaches beween two adjacent reservoirs qdiv t n is the water diversion from inner river channel 3 hydropower release constraints 11 q out t n q pr t n q npr t n 12 0 q pr t n q pr max t n where qnpr t n is the spill to the downstream channel qpr t n is the release for hp and qpr max t n is the maximum of reservoir power release limited by turbine characteristics 4 water release capacity constraints 13 q out min t n q out t n q out max t n where q out min t n and q out max t n are respectively the minimum and maximum water release q out min t n depends on the ecological basic flow and water withdrawals q out max t n mainly considers the discharge capacity of the downstream channel 5 power output constraints 14 0 p t n p max t n where p t n is the output of the hydropower station p max t n is the maximum of power output mainly depending on the highest capacity of the installed power plant 6 reservoir water level constraints 15 z min t n z t n z max t n 16 z 0 n z beg n z t n z end n z 0 n f w 0 n where z min t n and z max t n are the minimum and maximum water level of the n th reservoir in the t th period respectively zt n is the water level after operation of the n th reservoir in the t th period zbeg n is the initial water level and zend n is the target final water level after t periods operation in particular the upstream reservoirs lyx and ljx have no sedimentation problem gao and feng 2002 thus the st benefit of these two reservoirs can be ignored due to the incoming sediment in lanzhou toudaoguai region the active storage of wjz gets reduced significantly lu et al 2013 in recent years wjz is mainly focused on the scouring silting balance during the flood season to maintain current storage capacity lin et al 2011 the st benefits of smx and xld are necessary to be considered because of significant sedimentation these two reservoirs together undertake water and sediment regulation for the downstream channel the calculation methods of the sediment discharge of smx and xld have been proposed in previous papers lin 1997 zhang and zhang 1982 17 η smx a lg v q in q out 2 b where ηsmx is sediment delivery ratio of smx reservoir qin is the inflow of smx reservoir qout is the release of smx reservoir v is the storage of smx reservoir a and b are empirical coefficients 18 η xld a lg v q in b where ηxld is sediment delivery ratio of xld reservoir qin is the inflow of xld reservoir v is the storage of xld reservoir a and b are empirical coefficients only st benefit is considered for the agent of dc stakeholder fei et al 2009 have given the formula to calculate the sedimentation amount in downstream channel 19 η dc 0 108 s q in 0 53 where ηdc is sediment delivery ratio of dc s is the concentration of the inflow at xld gauge station q is the flow at xld gauge station in this paper linear interactive and general optimizer lingo is applied to find the solution to the optimization model cunningham and schrage 2004 this integrated model can provide optimized solutions under different cooperative scenarios which are generally more beneficial than non cooperative scenarios at basin level however if a stakeholder obtains fewer benefits in a coalition than it operates independently it would certainly break away from the coalition when a stakeholder chooses to operate independently it will maximize its own benefits regardless of other stakeholders demands therefore reallocating the incremental benefit generated by cooperation is essential for stakeholders to maintain a stable cooperation for this purpose cgt methods are employed to find the feasible schemes of benefit reallocation 3 3 cooperative game theory when the direct benefits to the stakeholders under different scenarios are established from the optimization model the cgt method can be applied to analyze the cooperation opportunities cgt method mainly focuses on reallocating the incremental benefits from coalition among stakeholders the reallocation results determine the possibility of cooperation among the stakeholders through a gaming process three conditions are essential to be incentive compatible in a cooperative game madani and hooshyar 2014 thus the set of all allocations are likely to be accepted by involved stakeholders 20 v i v i i n 21 i s v i v s s n 22 i n v i v n where v i is the gain of stakeholder i under cooperation vi is the non cooperative gain of stakeholder i n represents the set of all stakeholders n 1 2 i n v s represents the total gain of coalition s v n is the total gain of the grand coalition involving all stakeholders equations 20 22 set the individual rationality condition individual group condition and efficiency condition respectively equations 20 and 21 require the gains of involved stakeholders from the grand coalition to be greater than their possible gains from partial or singleton coalitions equation 22 requires the total gain under grand cooperation fully allocated to all the stakeholders in the grand coalition these three conditions form the core of cooperative game i e a set of all allocations potentially accepted by stakeholders in a coalition significant efforts have been made in the reallocation of incremental benefits from cooperation shapley 1953 harsanyi 1959 schmeidler 1969 gately 1974 madani and hooshyar 2014 three commonly used cgt solution methods are employed in this study the shapley value shapley 1953 the gately point gately 1974 and the nash harsanyi solution harsanyi 1959 shapley value is based on the contributions of each stakeholder shapley 1953 the fair gain of the stakeholders from the grand coalition is calculated as follows 23 v i s n i s n s s 1 n v s v s i where n is the total number of stakeholders s is the number of stakeholders in coalition s and v s i is the gain of coalition s without player i the gately point is based on the quit propensity of each stakeholder gately 1974 if stakeholder i decides to quit the coalition the quit propensity of stakeholder i is defined by the ratio of the joint loss to the rest stakeholders except stakeholder i di and the loss of stakeholder i as follows 24 d i j i v j v n i v i v i the higher is the value of di the larger loss of the rest stakeholders in the grand coalition does the absence of stakeholder i cause thus the stakeholder i has larger bargaining ability the gately point defined that every stakeholder has equal quit propensity nash harsanyni solution transformed the cooperative game problem into a linear programming problem harsanyi 1959 as follows 25 max i 1 n v i v i where v i vi represents the incremental benefit of player i the incremental benefit reallocations of three cgt solution methods comply with the individual rationality condition individual group condition and efficiency condition however the reallocation results of different cgt solution methods vary therefore the involved stakeholders have different preferences for the cgt solution method 4 results 4 1 cooperation scenarios a joint operation is commonly employed by a series of adjacent reservoirs for the natural hydraulic connection the cooperation of non adjacent reservoirs is easily disturbed by the interval reservoirs thus reducing the benefits of their cooperation lyx and ljx have been assigned to jointly operate since 1986 significantly changing the annual runoff distribution tian et al 2013 usually lyx cooperates with ljx to undertake fc irrigation and ice prevention for downstream due to its large capacity therefore the cooperation between lyx and ljx should be considered as a link between wjz and xld smx provides the appropriate water and sediment process for xld with active storage below 318 m zhai 2004 hence xld is jointly operated with smx to fully utilize its fsr function on this basis eleven coalition scenarios are selected as shown in fig 4 scenario 1 is the baseline without any cooperation among these six stakeholders i e running independently the grand coalition scenario 2 implies the basin scale cooperation with all stakeholders involved coalition 3 and coalition 4 analyze the cooperation among the upstream and downstream reservoirs respectively coalition 5 represents the currently adopted operation mode in this scenario the upstream reservoirs lyx and ljx jointly operate while the downstream reservoirs smx and xld cooperate coalitions 6 11 further investigate the impacts of wjz and dc based on the previous five scenarios 4 2 effects of hydrologic conditions on systematic incremental benefits of cooperation comparing scenarios 1 and 2 the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation based on the historical streamflow in 2006 2019 are all positive ranging from 15 44 to 44 55 million per year are shown in fig 5 with different streamflow and sediment conditions the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation vary for different years implying that basin scale grand cooperation is always beneficial but the benefits are impacted by hydrologic conditions thus we employ the flow duration curve fdc and sediment duration curve sdc to represent the hydrologic conditions fdc is obtained from historical streamflow in 1961 2019 at the tongguan station located upstream from smx sdc gauges the sediment from the middle yellow river fig 6 considering the complex relationship between flow and sediment the sdc at the tongguan station is built in a high flow year normal flow year and low flow year fig 6 fig 7 shows the relationship between the systematic incremental benefits b and fdc at the tongguan station the sediment condition is set as normal to quantitively assess the effect of streamflow on the systematic incremental benefit the value of b increases according to the increase of exceedance percentage p 1 in normal flow years i e 25 p 1 75 implying that the grand cooperation brings more incremental benefits when the basin is dryer in normal flow years in normal flow years some water is present to conduct fsr after necessary ws the upstream reservoirs preferentially store water to ensure a higher water level when the yrb is dryer the higher the water level the more hydropower the reservoir generates the basin wide cooperation can bring more incremental benefits to the involved stakeholders especially the st benefit of the downstream stakeholders however the value of b and p 1 are not clearly correlated in high flow years i e p 1 25 and low flow years i e p 1 75 reservoirs may implement special operation in extreme hydrological condition which complicates the relation between b and p 1 in low flow years and high flow years wu et al 2018 chang et al 2019 when the lyx is operated independently without cooperation with ljx in dryer years p 1 0 85 ljx even could not meet the water supply demand in ljx wjz region with its available water of 10 31 108m3 fig 8 similarly the active storage of ljx is not large enough to deal with the flood in wetter years p 1 0 15 fig 9 in addition water supply is guaranteed first in low flow years resulting in insufficient extra water to conduct flow and sediment regulation the value of b is relatively small mainly from the hp benefit generated by the upstream reservoirs flood control operation dominates reservoir operations in the wet season of high flow years thus the incremental benefits from hp and st cooperation are limited at a certain level the relation between b and sdc is shown in fig 10 b declines with the increase of p 2 when the yrb is sandy the st benefit improves significantly through basin scale cooperation fsr is vital in high sediment years to remit the sedimentation of downstream reservoirs and channels in this model the st benefit is calculated by sediment delivery ratio η lin 1997 zhang and zhang 1982 fei et al 2009 determined by the inflow release and storage of reservoirs with this method the more the incoming sediment the more the discharge sediment with the corresponding increase of sediment delivery ratio therefore reservoirs with serious sedimentation problems tend to discharge sand more in high sediment years via grand cooperation nine representative years are chosen to explore the variation of incremental benefits of grand cooperation under different hydrologic conditions a high flow and high sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 75 a high flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 50 a high flow and low sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 50 a normal flow and high sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 75 a normal flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 50 a normal flow and low sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 25 a low flow and high sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 75 a low flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 50 a low flow and low sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 25 twenty series of streamflow and sediment processes are stochastically generated in these nine representative years to obtain the range of b under different hydrologic conditions fig 11 shows that b varies with different streamflow and sediment processes although the total annual runoff and sediment are the same therefore the beneficial streamflow and sediment processes in the same representative year should be further explored in fig 11 b varies in the highest range in the normal flow and high sediment years hence the normal flow and high sediment year is considered to explore the effects of different streamflow and sediment process on the b from grand cooperation fig 12 a shows b is not correlated with occurrence time of one day maximum flow q 1 day max obviously defined by t 1 t t 1 is the period from beginning to the occurrence of q 1 day max t is the total regulation period fig 12b fig 12c and fig 12d show that b increases with the increase of q 1 day max q 10 day max q 50 day max respectively significance test is conducted with f distribution proposed by ronald a fisher cornish fisher 1937 the relations between the b and q1 day max q10 day max q50 day max pass the significance test respectively with α is 0 05 0 025 and 0 05 whereas the significance level of the relation between the b and the location of q1 day max is smaller than 0 1 these results imply that joint reservoir operation is more beneficial after conducting fsr under basin scale cooperation when the streamflow processes are more fluctuating 4 3 stakeholders direct benefits in different scenarios according to hydrologic data sediment load in the yrb has dramatically reduced in the past few decades by over 81 he 2016 fu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 therefore a recent year 2019 is considered to analyze the incremental benefits of the stakeholders under different cooperation scenarios the results are summarized in table 2 the best benefit of all scenarios is coalition 2 with 717 59 million coalition 1 is the worst with 695 02 million to demonstrate how the reservoirs run in each year under different collations the operation processes of all the reservoirs in coalition 1 and coalition 2 are compared as shown in fig 13 it is found that the release processes in coalition 2 are generally more fluctuating and complicated comparing with those in coalition 1 this is because cooperative operation under coalition 2 requires the upstream reservoirs to consider the flow conditions and objectives of downstream reservoirs leading to more variable release processes than those in coalition 1 this result indicates that cooperative operation needs more real time interactions among reservoirs and detailed release rules comparing coalitions 5 and 6 wjz cooperating with upstream reservoirs will reduce the systematic benefit indicating a conflict between hp and st benefits the incremental benefit of grand cooperation coalition 2 is up to 22 57 million while the benefit of dc decreases compared with non cooperation if dc departs from the grand cooperation it will incur a loss of 20 78 million coalition 9 therefore dc still passively has no desire to escape the grand cooperation comparing coalitions 1 and 3 the cooperation of lyx and ljx brings 11 44 million to all stakeholders approximately 50 70 of the systematic incremental benefit of grand cooperation lyx provides appropriate release to ljy thus the hp benefit of ljx can be significantly improved while the lyx benefit is always maintained at 131 17 million due to its huge storage capacity when lyx coordinates with the midstream reservoirs and the downstream channel its available water is still rich enough for hydropower generation in the wet 2019 p 1 0 32 comparing coalitions 1 and 4 the cooperation of smx and xld brings 4 83 million to all stakeholders lesser than the cooperation of lyx and ljx comparing coalitions 5 and 7 when wjz joins the cooperation of smx and xld its benefit decreases from 81 78 million in scenario 5 to 77 24 million in scenario 7 while the benefits of smx from 115 24 million in scenario 5 to 122 60 million in scenario 7 and xld from 391 77 million in scenario 5 to 411 31 million in scenario 7 significantly improve the participation of wjz increases the st benefits of smx and xld therefore incremental benefit reallocation is necessary to achieve fair and stable cooperation comparisons between the optimized joint operations with the real operations in 2019 are shown in table 3 overall the benefit of joint operation i e grand cooperation is more than that of real operation up to 53 90 million in 2019 which means the operation of cascade reservoirs still have some potential to be explored basin wide cooperation is necessary for the whole river basin interest the key point is how to inspire the reservoirs join the basin wide cooperation it can be seen that the benefits in grand coalition and real operation of lyx are the same the reasons are twofold one is that cooperative operation was partially implemented leading by yrcc in the real operation of 2019 mainly focusing on the sediment transportation of xld the other is that 2019 is a wet year p 1 0 32 with plenty of water resources thus the release through the hydraulic turbine for hydropower generation of lyx was not impacted by the release through the spillway for downstream needs 4 4 benefit reallocation under grand coalition when all reservoirs are jointly operated under grand cooperation scenario 2 the total benefit of all stakeholders is the greatest however some reservoirs do not get positive incremental benefits under this scenario lyx is located at the most upstream site thus it has operational priority however lyx does not get positive incremental benefit from the grand cooperation consequently lyx may break out of the grand coalition without compensation three cgt methods are applied in this case to reallocate the incremental benefits to maintain the stability of the grand coalition i e shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution cooperative game model solving by shapley value according to the contribution of each stakeholder which could always give a unique solution gately point method is an equation solving problem constituted by equal quit propensity while nash harsanyni solution method is essentially a multivariate linear programming problem the constraints of these two methods both include the core of cgt base on the calculation results we found gately point and nash harsanyni solution method both have no feasible solution in this case table 4 gives the final gains of stakeholders based on the shapley value lyx ljx wjz and dc get compensation of 9 49 million 140 66 131 17 9 49 0 77 million 157 67 156 90 0 77 6 19 million 87 03 80 84 6 19 and 7 97 million 171 61 179 58 7 97 respectively in contrast downstream xld and smx need to offer compensation to others 5 discussions 5 1 negative environmental externality in basin wide cooperation of yellow river the joint operation of cascade reservoir is a special game theory problem the upstream reservoirs greatly influence the benefits of downstream reservoirs through their release processes while the downstream reservoirs have no bargaining ability with upstream reservoirs in this case study shapley value gives a possible solution to reallocate the incremental benefit from cooperation the scenario 9 in table 2 indicates the harm to the benefit of dc by cooperation of all reservoirs even smaller than that of non cooperation nevertheless this can be seen as a negative environmental externality of cooperation buchanan and stubblebine 1962 baumol and blinder 2015 which calls for environmental responsibility of reservoir stakeholders in their operation therefore negative externality on the environment should be further considered in operation policy design measures need to be taken to help maintain the stability of the grand coalition i e joint operation rules compensation rules and environmental externality control rules these measures need the engagement of government and non profit organizations 5 2 effect of the initial water levels of multi year regulated reservoirs as an upstream reservoir with multi year storage lyx plays a significant role in the whole cascade reservoir system analysis shows that the initial water level of lyx influences the reallocation result taking the year 2019 as an example when the initial water level of lyx varies from 2588 5 m to 2593 5 m the increment benefit of grand cooperation changes accordingly table 5 as well as the compensation to lyx the relationship between the incremental benefit and beginning water level is nonlinear which can be attributed to the nonlinearity of hydropower generation and sediment transport 5 3 application of cgt model in the updated water and sediment condition the basin wide cooperation of reservoirs and dc is more beneficial when the yrb is wetter and sandier in normal flow years it should be noted that the water and sediment conditions have been changing induced by climate change and human activities fig 14 shows the decreasing water and sediment at tongguan station during 1961 2021 in the past 10 years the total annual streamflow in 7 years is more than 224 4 108m3 thus the cgt model is appropriate for the current water condition however the incremental benefit brought by the basin wide cooperation would be smaller when the coming sediment continue to decline the allocation solution by shapley value method is given in table 4 since the sedimentation reduction cannot bring direct economic benefits how to share the benefits of sediment transportation among other stakeholders is still a question in practice sedimentation in reservoirs and channels threatens the economy society and environment in sediment laden yellow river chen et al 2015 juracek 2015 mohammad et al 2020 however sedimentation reduction could not bring short term benefits to reservoirs thereby commonly ignored by the reservoirs yrcc manages the water and sediment resources to maintain the long term benefits of reservoirs and channels which has conducted water and sediment regulation for 21 years to prevent and control sediment disasters li 2003 chen et al 2009 therefore it is necessary for yrcc to implement compensation policy to improve long term basin wide cooperation according to the results of cgt model we recommend that yrcc implement sedimentation management and compensation policy as follows 1 yrcc charges a reservoir for desilting when its sedimentation increases in the reservoir 2 yrcc subsidizes a reservoir when its sedimentation decreases in the reservoir and 3 yrcc subsidizes involved reservoirs for cooperation when the sedimentation of dc decreases and charges them verse vice these recommended rules can reallocate benefit among stakeholders thus promote the basin wide cooperation table 4 offers a demonstrate for calculating the rates of charge and subsidy based on the year 2019 more detailed results can be further calculated for different water and sediment conditions in future to help the policy come true in yrb 6 conclusion an integrated model is proposed to analyze the benefits sharing of water and sediment among the reservoirs and downstream channels along the yellow river considering flood control fc hydropower generation hp water supply ws and sediment transport st coalition scenarios are analyzed to explore the opportunities for joint operation of reservoirs in the yrb the results show that the grand cooperation scenario is always the most beneficial the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation vary with different streamflow and sediment conditions it brings more incremental benefits when the basin is dryer in a normal flow year however the systematic incremental benefit and streamflow conditions are not clearly related in high flow years and low flow years when the yrb is sandy the systematic incremental benefit can be improved significantly through basin wide cooperation fsr is vital in high sediment years to remit the sedimentation of downstream reservoirs and channels the systematic incremental benefit of the grand coalition also depends on the characteristics of the streamflow process the basin scale cooperation is appropriately employed when the streamflow process is uneven upstream reservoirs cooperate to improve the benefits of downstream reservoirs and channels in the grand cooperation correspondingly these reservoirs need to get compensation from downstream reservoirs to maintain the stability of the grand cooperation three cgt methods were applied to reallocate the incremental benefits in grand cooperation shapley value gives a possible method to reallocate the increment benefits in the grand coalition lxy ljx and wjz should be compensated in most cases these three reservoirs have priority for water resources utilization due to their upstream location they provide an appropriate water process for the sediment regulation of downstream reservoirs and channels this integrated framework and results can provide references for the reservoir administrators to operate reservoirs more efficiently and rationally presenting a possible method to reallocate the incremental benefits in the grand coalition rational benefit sharing is favorable for different stakeholders to join the grand coalition fully utilize the water and sediment resources negative externality should be further considered to maintain the stability of the grand coalition meanwhile the yrb is a complex system with thousands of dams spread across the whole watershed this study only chooses five large mainstream reservoirs to analyze cooperative operation in the yrb more reservoirs and scenarios should be considered in future work credit authorship contribution statement yuanjian wang conceptualization methodology funding

2776,the complicated relationship between water and sediment in the yellow river basin yrb makes it imperative for reservoir stakeholders to game with each other to balance the short term and long term benefits this paper proposes an integrated model to analyze the cooperation opportunities for major reservoir stakeholders engaged with the longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs on the yrb mainstream multiple benefits are considered including flood control water supply hydropower generation and sediment trapping non cooperation and cooperation scenarios are compared in this study the effect of flow and sediment conditions on the incremental benefit of cooperation is examined which shows that the systematic incremental benefit is larger when the yrb is dryer and sediment concentration is higher basin wide cooperation is especially beneficial when the inflow peak comes earlier and the streamflow process is more fluctuating cooperation of reservoir stakeholders in a normal year 2019 can bring more incremental benefit i e 22 57 million in contrast to the non cooperation scenario longyangxia liujiaxia and wanjiazhai reservoirs contribute most to the grand cooperation by implementing optimal operation for downstream stakeholders three cooperative game theory methods shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution are employed to find possible benefit sharing solutions based on cooperative game theory the results demonstrate the core of basin wide cooperation in the yellow river is negligible due to the negative externality effect implying more measures are needed by the government or non profit organization to maintain the stability of grand coalition i e water resources utilization control and external compensation the results also show that shapley value could be used to reallocate the incremental benefits in the grand cooperation abbreviations yrb yellow river basin fc flood control ws water supply hp hydropower

second longest river is relatively scarce in water resources but rich in sediment load omer et al 2020a omer et al 2020b ringler et al 2010 big reservoirs have been built on the mainstream for multiple purposes serving as the major facilities for basin wide regulation of water and sediment hou et al 2013 ming et al 2019 dong et al 2015 li et al 2007 yuan et al 2021 recently the issue of environmental protection and high quality development of the yrb has been raised as a national strategy of china xi 2019 chen et al 2020 ren and dou 2021 gao et al 2020 which calls for joint operation of these big reservoirs to meet demands from both natural and human dimensions yao et al 2017 li et al 2016 these mainstream reservoirs are designed and operated for multiple objectives including flood control fc water supply ws hydropower generation sediment management and environmental flow among these objectives fc always has the highest priority in flood seasons and a key design principle of these reservoirs fc storage must be reserved for flood seasons zhou et al 2014 ning et al 2021 xue et al 2022 after that ws is immediately guaranteed according to the rules of unified flow regulation of the yrb zhao et al 2009 following the water resources allocation scheme issued by the state council of china in 1987 environmental flow regulation has been partially implemented in the yrb for instance in 2020 ecological regulation was applied in the mainstream and important tributaries to ensure the minimum environmental flow and maintain the ecological function of rivers according to the published ecological regulation scheme of the yellow river in 2020 yellow river conservancy commission 2020 the environmental flow regulation will be enforced with high priority for the whole yrb in near future yellow river conservancy commission 2013 2021 liu and hu 2021 apart from the objectives mentioned above maintaining a trade off between hydropower generation hp and sediment transport st is a major concern for mainstream reservoir stakeholders hydropower is a low cost renewable energy source that plays an important role in the ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb chen et al 2020 gilbert 2010 wada et al 2018 zhou 2020 si et al 2018 meanwhile reservoir sedimentation complicates reservoir management by reducing active storage thus impacting the long term benefits of reservoirs zheng et al 2015 ren et al 2018 guo et al 2020 the trade off between the above issues lies in st needing high flows negatively impacting hydropower generation in the short term in the yrb sediment is mostly from the middle reach area milliman et al 1987 gao et al 2017 wang and sun 2021 stevens et al 2013 and sediment fills the downstream reservoirs rapidly if no sediment management operation is applied designed high flows can help st and make the reservoirs work efficiently for a longer time in a process called flow and sediment regulation fsr in the yrb however applying fsr downstream requires more water release from upstream reservoirs which reduces the hydropower generation of those upstream reservoirs basin scale joint operation may yield more long term benefits but upstream reservoirs need to give up some short term hydropower generation theoretically if upstream stakeholders cannot get extra gains from the cooperation or even get fewer benefits for the improvement of other stakeholders they will certainly depart from the cooperation this potential issue calls for an approach to find cooperative solutions to make all the reservoir stakeholders prefer a basin scale joint operation where the reallocation of incremental benefit from cooperation is crucial cooperative game theory cgt studies how stakeholders can achieve a stable cooperation and reallocate the incremental benefits from cooperation in the sense that no one has an incentive to depart from the cooperation cgt provides a useful tool to analyze the opportunities and conditions of cooperation in a game with multiple stakeholders benefit sharing solutions based on cgt have been proposed in many water resources management cases especially in transboundary river basins dombrowsky 2009 dombrowsky et al 2014 janjua et al 2020 li et al 2019 rahaman and abdullah al mamun 2020 jalilov et al 2015 some researchers have analyzed the gains from the joint optimal operation of the cascade reservoirs in the upper yrb focusing on fc hp and ws bai et al 2015 however given the priorities of these objectives seeking basin scale solutions for optimizing hp and transports remains a crucial challenge this problem becomes more complicated when hydrologic conditions are engaged dinar 2002 streamflow and st vary in different hydrologic conditions primarily determining the stakeholders interests in cooperation therefore the effects of hydrologic conditions on cooperation need to be explored considering the yrb as a case study we propose an integrated model that couples the optimization of basin scale benefits and benefit sharing solution analysis to address the concerns raised above the rest of this paper is arranged as follows first research area and data are described then the integrated model is proposed by coupling optimization model and cooperative game theory model to calculate the benefits of different scenarios next the results of different scenarios are analyzed to discover benefit sharing solutions policy implications of the results are also discussed finally the conclusions are presented 2 research area and data originating from bayan har mountains in qinghai province the yellow river flows 5464 km into the bohai sea fig 1 with the yrb covering an area of 795000 km2 the upper yellow river flowing from the source to the togtoh county in inner mongolia is the major water source of the big river contributing more than 60 of the total annual runoff of the yellow river zhao et al 2009 su et al 2021 the middle yellow river flowing from togtoh county to huayuankou hydrologic gauge station is the major sediment source of the river due to the presence of loose soil in the loess plateau smalley et al 2009 stevens et al 2013 the lower yellow river flowing from huayuankou to the sea is mostly an overhanging river because of long term sediment deposition chu 2014 liu et al 2022 the yellow river provides hydropower irrigation and navigation for the riparian cities and counties it flows through water and sediment conflicts in the yrb have been discussed for decades there are approximately 752 irrigated areas in the yrb with 3963 103 ha of cultivated land ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 the irrigation areas in the yrb mainly include inner mongolia irrigation district 6243 12 km2 ningxia irrigation district 2114 39 km2 fenhe irrigation district 997 00 km2 and henan irrigation district 6120 00 km2 therefore irrigation water withdrawal is a major component of the total water use in the yrb especially in the densely populated lower yellow river increasing energy demand in the yrb has also led to extensive hydropower development on the mainstream and tributaries thousands of reservoirs were built in the whole basin by 2017 with a total storage capacity of 84 5 billion m3 longyangxia reservoir lyx liujiaxia reservoir ljx wanjiazhai reservoir wjz sanmenxia reservoir smx and xiaolangdi reservoir xld are the five biggest reservoirs on mainstream contributing to more than half of the total storage capacity of the basin the hp by these reservoirs supports the local economic development and residential life unlike other rivers a certain quantity of water in the yrb must be reserved for st in the middle and lower yellow river walling and fang 2003 hu et al 2012 sediment deposition occupies the utilization storage capacity of reservoirs wjz smx and xld have serious sedimentation problems li and feng 2003 lin et al 2011 jia et al 2020 due to a wide and flat terrain and small slope the lower yellow river has a large amount of suspended sediment deposited on the riverbed exposing the downstream channel to a higher flooding risk hou et al 2021 therefore water withdrawal hydropower and sedimentation should be considered in the joint operation of cascade reservoirs the conflicts between water usage and st in the yrb remains a crucial problem in this paper the five biggest reservoirs on mainstream namely lyx ljx wjz smx and xld are chosen for study these five reservoirs are important parts of the water and sediment regulation system in the yrb jiang et al 2021 as shown in table 1 lyx ljx and xld have big storage thus play important roles in water and sediment regulation in the yrb while wjz and smx have relatively small storage which may be less important in water regulation however the sedimentation of wjz and smx is of great importance to xld and downstream river channel li and feng 2003 lin et al 2011 thus these five reservoirs are chosen to study water and sediment regulation issue in the yrb the detailed parameters of the five reservoirs are shown in table 1 these five reservoirs are located in different provinces and administrated by different organizations table 1 according to the published measures for the management of the yellow river in henan province and channel management regulations of yellow river in shandong province yellow river conservancy commission yrcc is responsible for the channel management of yellow river which is the agent of the downstream channel dc thus the administrators of the five reservoirs and yrcc are the six stakeholders in practice for simplicity we use lyx ljx wjz smx xld and dc to represent the six stakeholders in this study respectively these six stakeholders have different interests resulting in challenges to basin scale cooperation yrcc is also responsible for the fc and ensures the safety of the yrb by sending operating instructions to each reservoir administrator in flood seasons the daily flow and sediment data used in this paper are obtained from yrcc gauge stations the monthly water withdrawal data are sourced from the yellow river water supply report published by yrcc 3 methodology 3 1 model framework description as shown in fig 2 the proposed model framework and analysis process include five steps 1 establishing the optimization model of cascade reservoirs for water sediment regulation in the yrb 2 analyzing the hydrological conditions of yellow river and setting the cooperation scenarios 3 calculating the direct water benefit and st under different scenarios using the optimization model 4 analyzing the incremental benefits from cooperation by comparing scenarios 5 applying cgt to reallocate the incremental benefits from coalitions ensuring benefit of each stakeholder and group better 6 results and discussion 3 2 integrated optimization model the integrated optimization model considers fc ws hp and st the node link map of the model is shown in fig 3 3 2 1 objectives as mentioned above fc and ws have higher priorities in the yrb therefore these two objectives are transformed into constraints in this study and hp and st benefits are set as the two objectives for optimization as follows 1 b 1 n max t 1 t hp t n 2 b 2 n max t 1 t v s t n where b 1 n and b 2 n are the hp benefit and the st benefit of the n th reservoir respectively hp t n is the hydropower production the larger the hp the more hydropower benefits the reservoirs create vs t n is the sediment volume deposited in the reservoir the larger the vs t n is the lesser st benefit the stakeholder gets the benefit of hp is defined as follows 3 hp t n k n δ t q pr t n h t n h 0 t n where kn is the output coefficient qpr t n is the average powerrelease h t n is the average water level before the dam h0 t n is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant and t is the length of the time period the st benefit is defined as the volume of sediment deposition the benefit function of the reservoir gets weakened due to reservoir silting it needs efforts and resources to recover the capacity in contrast when the reservoir is scoured the reservoir capacity expands bringing more benefits to stakeholders 4 w sin t n s in t n q in t n 5 w sout t n η w sin t n 6 v s t n w sin t n w sout t n ρ s where sin t n is the sediment concentration of inflow sout t n is the sediment concentration of release qin t n is the average inflow qout t n is the average release wsin t n is the sediment quantity of inflow wsout t n is the sediment quantity of release ρs is the density of the sediment in the reservoir η is the sediment delivery ratio of reservoirs in equations 1 and 2 the two objectives hp and the st have different units we integrate the two objectives into an overall benefit for each stakeholder measured by money to apply the game theory methods in benefit analysis as follows 7 b n c 1 n b 1 n c 2 n b 2 n where b n is the total benefit of the n th reservoir c 1 n is the unit price the hydropwer c 2 n is the unit cost of reservoir capacity recovery if the satakeholder is the downstream channel in the lower yrb then c 1 n is 0 and c 2 n is the unit cost of channel desilting tan et al 2018 3 2 2 constraints constraints of the optimization model are as follows 1 reservoir water balance constraints 8 w 1 n w 0 n q in 1 n q out 1 n δ t 9 w t n w t 1 n q in t n q out t n δ t 2 t t where w0 n is the initial storage of the n th reservoir and wt n is the storage of the reservoirs at the end of time period t 2 river channel water balance constraints 10 q in t n 1 q out t n q qujian t n 1 q div t n 1 where qin t n 1 is the average inflow of the n 1 th reservoir qqujian t n 1 is the inflow of the reaches beween two adjacent reservoirs qdiv t n is the water diversion from inner river channel 3 hydropower release constraints 11 q out t n q pr t n q npr t n 12 0 q pr t n q pr max t n where qnpr t n is the spill to the downstream channel qpr t n is the release for hp and qpr max t n is the maximum of reservoir power release limited by turbine characteristics 4 water release capacity constraints 13 q out min t n q out t n q out max t n where q out min t n and q out max t n are respectively the minimum and maximum water release q out min t n depends on the ecological basic flow and water withdrawals q out max t n mainly considers the discharge capacity of the downstream channel 5 power output constraints 14 0 p t n p max t n where p t n is the output of the hydropower station p max t n is the maximum of power output mainly depending on the highest capacity of the installed power plant 6 reservoir water level constraints 15 z min t n z t n z max t n 16 z 0 n z beg n z t n z end n z 0 n f w 0 n where z min t n and z max t n are the minimum and maximum water level of the n th reservoir in the t th period respectively zt n is the water level after operation of the n th reservoir in the t th period zbeg n is the initial water level and zend n is the target final water level after t periods operation in particular the upstream reservoirs lyx and ljx have no sedimentation problem gao and feng 2002 thus the st benefit of these two reservoirs can be ignored due to the incoming sediment in lanzhou toudaoguai region the active storage of wjz gets reduced significantly lu et al 2013 in recent years wjz is mainly focused on the scouring silting balance during the flood season to maintain current storage capacity lin et al 2011 the st benefits of smx and xld are necessary to be considered because of significant sedimentation these two reservoirs together undertake water and sediment regulation for the downstream channel the calculation methods of the sediment discharge of smx and xld have been proposed in previous papers lin 1997 zhang and zhang 1982 17 η smx a lg v q in q out 2 b where ηsmx is sediment delivery ratio of smx reservoir qin is the inflow of smx reservoir qout is the release of smx reservoir v is the storage of smx reservoir a and b are empirical coefficients 18 η xld a lg v q in b where ηxld is sediment delivery ratio of xld reservoir qin is the inflow of xld reservoir v is the storage of xld reservoir a and b are empirical coefficients only st benefit is considered for the agent of dc stakeholder fei et al 2009 have given the formula to calculate the sedimentation amount in downstream channel 19 η dc 0 108 s q in 0 53 where ηdc is sediment delivery ratio of dc s is the concentration of the inflow at xld gauge station q is the flow at xld gauge station in this paper linear interactive and general optimizer lingo is applied to find the solution to the optimization model cunningham and schrage 2004 this integrated model can provide optimized solutions under different cooperative scenarios which are generally more beneficial than non cooperative scenarios at basin level however if a stakeholder obtains fewer benefits in a coalition than it operates independently it would certainly break away from the coalition when a stakeholder chooses to operate independently it will maximize its own benefits regardless of other stakeholders demands therefore reallocating the incremental benefit generated by cooperation is essential for stakeholders to maintain a stable cooperation for this purpose cgt methods are employed to find the feasible schemes of benefit reallocation 3 3 cooperative game theory when the direct benefits to the stakeholders under different scenarios are established from the optimization model the cgt method can be applied to analyze the cooperation opportunities cgt method mainly focuses on reallocating the incremental benefits from coalition among stakeholders the reallocation results determine the possibility of cooperation among the stakeholders through a gaming process three conditions are essential to be incentive compatible in a cooperative game madani and hooshyar 2014 thus the set of all allocations are likely to be accepted by involved stakeholders 20 v i v i i n 21 i s v i v s s n 22 i n v i v n where v i is the gain of stakeholder i under cooperation vi is the non cooperative gain of stakeholder i n represents the set of all stakeholders n 1 2 i n v s represents the total gain of coalition s v n is the total gain of the grand coalition involving all stakeholders equations 20 22 set the individual rationality condition individual group condition and efficiency condition respectively equations 20 and 21 require the gains of involved stakeholders from the grand coalition to be greater than their possible gains from partial or singleton coalitions equation 22 requires the total gain under grand cooperation fully allocated to all the stakeholders in the grand coalition these three conditions form the core of cooperative game i e a set of all allocations potentially accepted by stakeholders in a coalition significant efforts have been made in the reallocation of incremental benefits from cooperation shapley 1953 harsanyi 1959 schmeidler 1969 gately 1974 madani and hooshyar 2014 three commonly used cgt solution methods are employed in this study the shapley value shapley 1953 the gately point gately 1974 and the nash harsanyi solution harsanyi 1959 shapley value is based on the contributions of each stakeholder shapley 1953 the fair gain of the stakeholders from the grand coalition is calculated as follows 23 v i s n i s n s s 1 n v s v s i where n is the total number of stakeholders s is the number of stakeholders in coalition s and v s i is the gain of coalition s without player i the gately point is based on the quit propensity of each stakeholder gately 1974 if stakeholder i decides to quit the coalition the quit propensity of stakeholder i is defined by the ratio of the joint loss to the rest stakeholders except stakeholder i di and the loss of stakeholder i as follows 24 d i j i v j v n i v i v i the higher is the value of di the larger loss of the rest stakeholders in the grand coalition does the absence of stakeholder i cause thus the stakeholder i has larger bargaining ability the gately point defined that every stakeholder has equal quit propensity nash harsanyni solution transformed the cooperative game problem into a linear programming problem harsanyi 1959 as follows 25 max i 1 n v i v i where v i vi represents the incremental benefit of player i the incremental benefit reallocations of three cgt solution methods comply with the individual rationality condition individual group condition and efficiency condition however the reallocation results of different cgt solution methods vary therefore the involved stakeholders have different preferences for the cgt solution method 4 results 4 1 cooperation scenarios a joint operation is commonly employed by a series of adjacent reservoirs for the natural hydraulic connection the cooperation of non adjacent reservoirs is easily disturbed by the interval reservoirs thus reducing the benefits of their cooperation lyx and ljx have been assigned to jointly operate since 1986 significantly changing the annual runoff distribution tian et al 2013 usually lyx cooperates with ljx to undertake fc irrigation and ice prevention for downstream due to its large capacity therefore the cooperation between lyx and ljx should be considered as a link between wjz and xld smx provides the appropriate water and sediment process for xld with active storage below 318 m zhai 2004 hence xld is jointly operated with smx to fully utilize its fsr function on this basis eleven coalition scenarios are selected as shown in fig 4 scenario 1 is the baseline without any cooperation among these six stakeholders i e running independently the grand coalition scenario 2 implies the basin scale cooperation with all stakeholders involved coalition 3 and coalition 4 analyze the cooperation among the upstream and downstream reservoirs respectively coalition 5 represents the currently adopted operation mode in this scenario the upstream reservoirs lyx and ljx jointly operate while the downstream reservoirs smx and xld cooperate coalitions 6 11 further investigate the impacts of wjz and dc based on the previous five scenarios 4 2 effects of hydrologic conditions on systematic incremental benefits of cooperation comparing scenarios 1 and 2 the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation based on the historical streamflow in 2006 2019 are all positive ranging from 15 44 to 44 55 million per year are shown in fig 5 with different streamflow and sediment conditions the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation vary for different years implying that basin scale grand cooperation is always beneficial but the benefits are impacted by hydrologic conditions thus we employ the flow duration curve fdc and sediment duration curve sdc to represent the hydrologic conditions fdc is obtained from historical streamflow in 1961 2019 at the tongguan station located upstream from smx sdc gauges the sediment from the middle yellow river fig 6 considering the complex relationship between flow and sediment the sdc at the tongguan station is built in a high flow year normal flow year and low flow year fig 6 fig 7 shows the relationship between the systematic incremental benefits b and fdc at the tongguan station the sediment condition is set as normal to quantitively assess the effect of streamflow on the systematic incremental benefit the value of b increases according to the increase of exceedance percentage p 1 in normal flow years i e 25 p 1 75 implying that the grand cooperation brings more incremental benefits when the basin is dryer in normal flow years in normal flow years some water is present to conduct fsr after necessary ws the upstream reservoirs preferentially store water to ensure a higher water level when the yrb is dryer the higher the water level the more hydropower the reservoir generates the basin wide cooperation can bring more incremental benefits to the involved stakeholders especially the st benefit of the downstream stakeholders however the value of b and p 1 are not clearly correlated in high flow years i e p 1 25 and low flow years i e p 1 75 reservoirs may implement special operation in extreme hydrological condition which complicates the relation between b and p 1 in low flow years and high flow years wu et al 2018 chang et al 2019 when the lyx is operated independently without cooperation with ljx in dryer years p 1 0 85 ljx even could not meet the water supply demand in ljx wjz region with its available water of 10 31 108m3 fig 8 similarly the active storage of ljx is not large enough to deal with the flood in wetter years p 1 0 15 fig 9 in addition water supply is guaranteed first in low flow years resulting in insufficient extra water to conduct flow and sediment regulation the value of b is relatively small mainly from the hp benefit generated by the upstream reservoirs flood control operation dominates reservoir operations in the wet season of high flow years thus the incremental benefits from hp and st cooperation are limited at a certain level the relation between b and sdc is shown in fig 10 b declines with the increase of p 2 when the yrb is sandy the st benefit improves significantly through basin scale cooperation fsr is vital in high sediment years to remit the sedimentation of downstream reservoirs and channels in this model the st benefit is calculated by sediment delivery ratio η lin 1997 zhang and zhang 1982 fei et al 2009 determined by the inflow release and storage of reservoirs with this method the more the incoming sediment the more the discharge sediment with the corresponding increase of sediment delivery ratio therefore reservoirs with serious sedimentation problems tend to discharge sand more in high sediment years via grand cooperation nine representative years are chosen to explore the variation of incremental benefits of grand cooperation under different hydrologic conditions a high flow and high sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 75 a high flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 50 a high flow and low sediment year p 1 0 75 p 2 0 50 a normal flow and high sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 75 a normal flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 50 a normal flow and low sediment year p 1 0 50 p 2 0 25 a low flow and high sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 75 a low flow and normal sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 50 a low flow and low sediment year p 1 0 25 p 2 0 25 twenty series of streamflow and sediment processes are stochastically generated in these nine representative years to obtain the range of b under different hydrologic conditions fig 11 shows that b varies with different streamflow and sediment processes although the total annual runoff and sediment are the same therefore the beneficial streamflow and sediment processes in the same representative year should be further explored in fig 11 b varies in the highest range in the normal flow and high sediment years hence the normal flow and high sediment year is considered to explore the effects of different streamflow and sediment process on the b from grand cooperation fig 12 a shows b is not correlated with occurrence time of one day maximum flow q 1 day max obviously defined by t 1 t t 1 is the period from beginning to the occurrence of q 1 day max t is the total regulation period fig 12b fig 12c and fig 12d show that b increases with the increase of q 1 day max q 10 day max q 50 day max respectively significance test is conducted with f distribution proposed by ronald a fisher cornish fisher 1937 the relations between the b and q1 day max q10 day max q50 day max pass the significance test respectively with α is 0 05 0 025 and 0 05 whereas the significance level of the relation between the b and the location of q1 day max is smaller than 0 1 these results imply that joint reservoir operation is more beneficial after conducting fsr under basin scale cooperation when the streamflow processes are more fluctuating 4 3 stakeholders direct benefits in different scenarios according to hydrologic data sediment load in the yrb has dramatically reduced in the past few decades by over 81 he 2016 fu et al 2011 wang et al 2016 therefore a recent year 2019 is considered to analyze the incremental benefits of the stakeholders under different cooperation scenarios the results are summarized in table 2 the best benefit of all scenarios is coalition 2 with 717 59 million coalition 1 is the worst with 695 02 million to demonstrate how the reservoirs run in each year under different collations the operation processes of all the reservoirs in coalition 1 and coalition 2 are compared as shown in fig 13 it is found that the release processes in coalition 2 are generally more fluctuating and complicated comparing with those in coalition 1 this is because cooperative operation under coalition 2 requires the upstream reservoirs to consider the flow conditions and objectives of downstream reservoirs leading to more variable release processes than those in coalition 1 this result indicates that cooperative operation needs more real time interactions among reservoirs and detailed release rules comparing coalitions 5 and 6 wjz cooperating with upstream reservoirs will reduce the systematic benefit indicating a conflict between hp and st benefits the incremental benefit of grand cooperation coalition 2 is up to 22 57 million while the benefit of dc decreases compared with non cooperation if dc departs from the grand cooperation it will incur a loss of 20 78 million coalition 9 therefore dc still passively has no desire to escape the grand cooperation comparing coalitions 1 and 3 the cooperation of lyx and ljx brings 11 44 million to all stakeholders approximately 50 70 of the systematic incremental benefit of grand cooperation lyx provides appropriate release to ljy thus the hp benefit of ljx can be significantly improved while the lyx benefit is always maintained at 131 17 million due to its huge storage capacity when lyx coordinates with the midstream reservoirs and the downstream channel its available water is still rich enough for hydropower generation in the wet 2019 p 1 0 32 comparing coalitions 1 and 4 the cooperation of smx and xld brings 4 83 million to all stakeholders lesser than the cooperation of lyx and ljx comparing coalitions 5 and 7 when wjz joins the cooperation of smx and xld its benefit decreases from 81 78 million in scenario 5 to 77 24 million in scenario 7 while the benefits of smx from 115 24 million in scenario 5 to 122 60 million in scenario 7 and xld from 391 77 million in scenario 5 to 411 31 million in scenario 7 significantly improve the participation of wjz increases the st benefits of smx and xld therefore incremental benefit reallocation is necessary to achieve fair and stable cooperation comparisons between the optimized joint operations with the real operations in 2019 are shown in table 3 overall the benefit of joint operation i e grand cooperation is more than that of real operation up to 53 90 million in 2019 which means the operation of cascade reservoirs still have some potential to be explored basin wide cooperation is necessary for the whole river basin interest the key point is how to inspire the reservoirs join the basin wide cooperation it can be seen that the benefits in grand coalition and real operation of lyx are the same the reasons are twofold one is that cooperative operation was partially implemented leading by yrcc in the real operation of 2019 mainly focusing on the sediment transportation of xld the other is that 2019 is a wet year p 1 0 32 with plenty of water resources thus the release through the hydraulic turbine for hydropower generation of lyx was not impacted by the release through the spillway for downstream needs 4 4 benefit reallocation under grand coalition when all reservoirs are jointly operated under grand cooperation scenario 2 the total benefit of all stakeholders is the greatest however some reservoirs do not get positive incremental benefits under this scenario lyx is located at the most upstream site thus it has operational priority however lyx does not get positive incremental benefit from the grand cooperation consequently lyx may break out of the grand coalition without compensation three cgt methods are applied in this case to reallocate the incremental benefits to maintain the stability of the grand coalition i e shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution cooperative game model solving by shapley value according to the contribution of each stakeholder which could always give a unique solution gately point method is an equation solving problem constituted by equal quit propensity while nash harsanyni solution method is essentially a multivariate linear programming problem the constraints of these two methods both include the core of cgt base on the calculation results we found gately point and nash harsanyni solution method both have no feasible solution in this case table 4 gives the final gains of stakeholders based on the shapley value lyx ljx wjz and dc get compensation of 9 49 million 140 66 131 17 9 49 0 77 million 157 67 156 90 0 77 6 19 million 87 03 80 84 6 19 and 7 97 million 171 61 179 58 7 97 respectively in contrast downstream xld and smx need to offer compensation to others 5 discussions 5 1 negative environmental externality in basin wide cooperation of yellow river the joint operation of cascade reservoir is a special game theory problem the upstream reservoirs greatly influence the benefits of downstream reservoirs through their release processes while the downstream reservoirs have no bargaining ability with upstream reservoirs in this case study shapley value gives a possible solution to reallocate the incremental benefit from cooperation the scenario 9 in table 2 indicates the harm to the benefit of dc by cooperation of all reservoirs even smaller than that of non cooperation nevertheless this can be seen as a negative environmental externality of cooperation buchanan and stubblebine 1962 baumol and blinder 2015 which calls for environmental responsibility of reservoir stakeholders in their operation therefore negative externality on the environment should be further considered in operation policy design measures need to be taken to help maintain the stability of the grand coalition i e joint operation rules compensation rules and environmental externality control rules these measures need the engagement of government and non profit organizations 5 2 effect of the initial water levels of multi year regulated reservoirs as an upstream reservoir with multi year storage lyx plays a significant role in the whole cascade reservoir system analysis shows that the initial water level of lyx influences the reallocation result taking the year 2019 as an example when the initial water level of lyx varies from 2588 5 m to 2593 5 m the increment benefit of grand cooperation changes accordingly table 5 as well as the compensation to lyx the relationship between the incremental benefit and beginning water level is nonlinear which can be attributed to the nonlinearity of hydropower generation and sediment transport 5 3 application of cgt model in the updated water and sediment condition the basin wide cooperation of reservoirs and dc is more beneficial when the yrb is wetter and sandier in normal flow years it should be noted that the water and sediment conditions have been changing induced by climate change and human activities fig 14 shows the decreasing water and sediment at tongguan station during 1961 2021 in the past 10 years the total annual streamflow in 7 years is more than 224 4 108m3 thus the cgt model is appropriate for the current water condition however the incremental benefit brought by the basin wide cooperation would be smaller when the coming sediment continue to decline the allocation solution by shapley value method is given in table 4 since the sedimentation reduction cannot bring direct economic benefits how to share the benefits of sediment transportation among other stakeholders is still a question in practice sedimentation in reservoirs and channels threatens the economy society and environment in sediment laden yellow river chen et al 2015 juracek 2015 mohammad et al 2020 however sedimentation reduction could not bring short term benefits to reservoirs thereby commonly ignored by the reservoirs yrcc manages the water and sediment resources to maintain the long term benefits of reservoirs and channels which has conducted water and sediment regulation for 21 years to prevent and control sediment disasters li 2003 chen et al 2009 therefore it is necessary for yrcc to implement compensation policy to improve long term basin wide cooperation according to the results of cgt model we recommend that yrcc implement sedimentation management and compensation policy as follows 1 yrcc charges a reservoir for desilting when its sedimentation increases in the reservoir 2 yrcc subsidizes a reservoir when its sedimentation decreases in the reservoir and 3 yrcc subsidizes involved reservoirs for cooperation when the sedimentation of dc decreases and charges them verse vice these recommended rules can reallocate benefit among stakeholders thus promote the basin wide cooperation table 4 offers a demonstrate for calculating the rates of charge and subsidy based on the year 2019 more detailed results can be further calculated for different water and sediment conditions in future to help the policy come true in yrb 6 conclusion an integrated model is proposed to analyze the benefits sharing of water and sediment among the reservoirs and downstream channels along the yellow river considering flood control fc hydropower generation hp water supply ws and sediment transport st coalition scenarios are analyzed to explore the opportunities for joint operation of reservoirs in the yrb the results show that the grand cooperation scenario is always the most beneficial the systematic incremental benefits of grand cooperation vary with different streamflow and sediment conditions it brings more incremental benefits when the basin is dryer in a normal flow year however the systematic incremental benefit and streamflow conditions are not clearly related in high flow years and low flow years when the yrb is sandy the systematic incremental benefit can be improved significantly through basin wide cooperation fsr is vital in high sediment years to remit the sedimentation of downstream reservoirs and channels the systematic incremental benefit of the grand coalition also depends on the characteristics of the streamflow process the basin scale cooperation is appropriately employed when the streamflow process is uneven upstream reservoirs cooperate to improve the benefits of downstream reservoirs and channels in the grand cooperation correspondingly these reservoirs need to get compensation from downstream reservoirs to maintain the stability of the grand cooperation three cgt methods were applied to reallocate the incremental benefits in grand cooperation shapley value gives a possible method to reallocate the increment benefits in the grand coalition lxy ljx and wjz should be compensated in most cases these three reservoirs have priority for water resources utilization due to their upstream location they provide an appropriate water process for the sediment regulation of downstream reservoirs and channels this integrated framework and results can provide references for the reservoir administrators to operate reservoirs more efficiently and rationally presenting a possible method to reallocate the incremental benefits in the grand coalition rational benefit sharing is favorable for different stakeholders to join the grand coalition fully utilize the water and sediment resources negative externality should be further considered to maintain the stability of the grand coalition meanwhile the yrb is a complex system with thousands of dams spread across the whole watershed this study only chooses five large mainstream reservoirs to analyze cooperative operation in the yrb more reservoirs and scenarios should be considered in future work credit authorship contribution statement yuanjian wang conceptualization methodology funding

2777,the recession of the south aral sea over the last few decades has become a great environmental challenge in central asia due to declining inflow and irrigation exhaustion the amu darya river vanishes before reaching the south aral sea therefore groundwater gw has become the vital water source for the south aral sea surface water and the local ecosystem to develop feasible adaptation strategies for water resource management it is necessary to quantify the gw flux into the south aral sea under ongoing climate change based on numerical models modflow and swat and with the support of observed data remote sensing data reanalysis data and the output of global circulation models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the hydraulic connection between a shallow aquifer and the lake was investigated and projected for future change the gw model was calibrated by one in situ gw well and six gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived gw heads the root mean square error rmse of the gw flow field simulation modflow was lower than 0 21 m from 2005 to 2016 under three shared socioeconomic pathways sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development the gcms indicate that the evapotranspiration et experiences the greatest change and will potentially rise to 602 6 mm yr by 2100 in fossil fueled development while the precipitation and the runoff of the amu darya river will both rise slightly and with the range of 146 4 163 3 mm yr and 107 8 118 4 m3 s from 2021 to 2100 separately and the increase is mainly during winter with climate change signals forcing on the historical hydrometeorological data the simulation result revealed that the gw contributes to more than 78 of the total influx of water into the lake during 2021 2100 and the predicted gw flux into the lake will slightly rise over time however the et will also increase due to rising temperatures and may gradually outpace the recharge growth the simulation results indicate that the south aral sea may maintain a surface area of 4 47 10 3 km 2 in fossil fueled development which means it will continue to shrink if there is no human intervention therefore a set of sustainable water resource management methods is urgently needed to preserve the ecological environment of the south aral sea and prevent ecological disasters keywords south aral sea integrated modeling climate change groundwater data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the aral sea was once the fourth largest inland lake on the earth with a surface area of 67 499 km2 in 1960 micklin 2010 the lake lies in the semi arid to the arid region of western central asia located in kazakhstan and uzbekistan as a terminal lake the water balance of the aral sea is fundamentally determined by two tributaries the amu darya river and the syr darya river together with the groundwater gw recharge and net evaporation i e evaporation from the lake surface minus precipitation micklin 2016 over the past six decades the expansion of irrigation has led to a significant decrease in river discharge causing a sharp shrinkage and salinization of the aral sea alekseeva et al 2009 ferrari et al 1999 gaybullaev et al 2012 hu et al 2021 keefe et al 2019 micklin et al 2014 the construction of the dike kokaral was completed in august 2005 which restored the water level and salinity of the north aral sea while the south aral sea continued to deteriorate micklin et al 2018 2014 in 2019 the water salinity decreased to 5 8 g l in the north aral sea while the salinity of the south aral sea was 193 5 g l duan et al 2022 the desiccation of the south aral sea has caused severe damage to the region s ecological environment economy and human habitation and is considered to be one of the greatest ecological disasters caused by human activity micklin 2010 2007 climate change may influence critical hydrological processes thereby affecting basin characteristics and available water resources persaud et al 2020 global warming has exacerbated the water resource crisis in arid regions it is therefore necessary to consider the uncertainty triggered by future climate change and formulate adequate coping strategies numerical modeling and statistical analysis have been used to estimate the potential influence of climate change on the hydrological processes in the aral sea region aus der beek et al 2011 berdimbetov et al 2020 hamidov et al 2020 massakbayeva et al 2019 mcdermid and winter 2017 wang et al 2020 the above mentioned studies have confirmed that since 1960 the mean air temperature potential evapotranspiration et and precipitation have drastically increased in the aral sea area while the total water storage has continued to decrease additionally the dried up lake beds cause frequent sand salt storms and the exposed bare land causes a local temperature increase gw is a critical component of the water cycle in arid regions tweed et al 2011 supporting the ecosystem lubczynski 2009 and providing available water resources for agricultural and domestic use al katheeri 2008 tang et al 2004 several studies have evaluated the hydraulic exchange of gw and surface water in the aral sea based on numerical modeling and water balance methods but the results vary greatly alekseeva et al 2009 benduhn and renard 2004 crétaux et al 2005 jarsjö and destouni 2004 simonov and altman 1991a simonov and altman 1991b the gw flux into the aral sea was once considered an insignificant part of the water balance simonov and altman 1991a simonov and altman 1991b the gw flux was approximately 12 of the amu darya river discharge into the lake in 1960 to approximately 100 in 2004 jarsjö and destouni 2004 the above mentioned studies show a great variation range from one study to another 1 3 to 30 km3 year this illustrates the great uncertainty in quantification and large deviation led by data availability and research methods however it is important to note that since the completion of the dike kokaral in 2005 and the intermittent recharge from the amu darya river to the south aral sea the local water balance condition may now be completely different with a diminishing contribution from the surface water gw may shoulder a larger weight as the water source therefore clarifying the current local water balance condition and quantifying the possible impact of climate change are both essential to ensure sustainability and reduce the potential negative impacts such as continuously shrinking water bodies and deteriorating water quality the main aim of this study was to analyze the potential response of the water balance in the south aral sea area to climate change using an integrated modeling method via i quantification of the exchange flux between gw and the south aral sea and ii estimation of the range of the lake surface area under different climate scenarios based on the storage capacity curve it is expected that the results of this study will provide insight into the response of the south aral sea to climate change and may also lead to improved water management practices furthermore as a typical case study it may enhance the understanding of results led by climate change in arid regions 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the south aral sea is a part of the former aral sea basin over the last century the inflow into the aral sea continued to decrease due to the growing agricultural consumption leading to the retreat of the lake border in 1987 the lake body was finally divided into two main parts the south aral sea and the north aral sea by the beginning of this century the south aral sea further split into an eastern and a western part barely connected by a narrow channel that balanced the water levels the south aral sea fig 1 is an almost dry lake basin together with its catchment covering an area of 72 772 4 km2 located between uzbekistan and kazakhstan in the center of the kyzylkum desert the south aral sea aquifer is primarily an unconfined aquifer constituted of clay silt and sand of different grain sizes dating back to the late pleistocene burr et al 2019 the land cover within the area is mostly bare land and the surface elevation varies from 3 to 162 m a s l meters above sea level the amu darya river is the dominant waterway within the area and is fed by the precipitation and snowmelt of tian shan and pamir 2 2 data collection to apply the modflow model in the study area a series of meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological information was gathered and categorized table 1 the monthly regional average gw head was used as the gw model hydraulic head and the station data were used to calibrate the gw model the study domain topography was generated from the ziyuan 3 imagery and the spatial resolution of the processed dem data is 5 m tang et al 2015 we estimated the et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod09ga and mod11a1 products provided by the united states distributed data center for land processes https ipdaac usgs gov using the surface energy balance system model su 2002 due to the slightly spatial variation of precipitation and et over the study area the input climate parameters of the model are the monthly mean value per unit area 2 3 future climate projections to understand the simulated hydrological response to climate change conditions and to compare different scenarios the climate projections captured from the coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 were applied to the model domain the three projected climate scenarios sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development and four global circulation models gcms for each climate parameter are summarized in table 2 the projected scenarios were applied to build the numerical models modflow and swat in the south aral sea 2 3 1 cmip6 data ten cmip6 gcms from six different modeling institutes were considered based on the assessment of the data regarding the arid area cook et al 2020 guo et al 2021 li et al 2020 su et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the selected gcms historical 1995 2014 monthly climate outputs were retrieved from the earth system grid federation esgf data portal https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 to consider a range of possible future options we used the simulations of three ssps from tier 1 of scenariomip ssp1 2 6 with 2 6 w m2 by the year 2100 sustainable pathway ssp2 4 5 with 4 5 w m2 by the year 2100 medium pathway and ssp5 8 5 with 8 5 w m2 by the year 2100 fossil fueled development the three future periods selected for this study are the 2030 s 2021 2040 which is referred to as the near future the 2060 s 2051 2070 as the intermediate future and the 2090 s 2081 2100 as the far future the period from 2005 to 2017 was selected as the reference period 2 3 2 synthetic scenario to capture a range of possible future climate conditions and to reduce the model uncertainty the bayes model average bma was applied for the combination of the gcms the bma method is a common statistical technique that is generally applied to the gcm ensemble luo et al 2019 this is a probabilistic method that adopts the weighted probability density function of the gcms the bma weights indicate the contribution of the component model to the predictive ability of the training samples huang et al 2014 that is by comparing the measurements of the homologous period the bma weights were calibrated using the training samples under the historical emission scenarios if the training samples demonstrate better performance in reproducing the current climate conditions the model will receive larger weights and may represent future climate conditions more accurately yang et al 2011 the probability density function of the projected climatic parameter can be written as 1 p y i 1 n p i y m i w i where n represents the number of the used gcms in this study n 4 p i y m i illustrates the projected probability density function of y based on the m i w i stands for the posterior probability of m i being given the correct training sample raftery et al 2005 and i 1 n w i 1 the more m i fits the observations during the training period the larger w i is 2 4 model setup 2 4 1 hydrological model to assess the impact of climate change on the runoff dynamics of the amu darya river a well calibrated swat model was adopted ayetiguli 2017 swat is a semi distributed hydrological model which can simulate continuous and long term runoff based on the physical mechanism arnold et al 2013 in this investigation the swat model was built to simulate the flow regime in the amu darya river basin while four hydrometeorological measurement stations kelif kerki tuyamuyun and kiziljar were selected as the target for model calibration from 1950 to 2014 2 4 2 groundwater simulation in this study modflow 2005 was applied to simulate the gw flow modflow is a fully distributed physics based model that uses finite difference methods to solve the differential equations of the gw flow in three dimensions harbaugh 2005 the governing equation for gw flow is as below 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where k x k y k z represents hydraulic conductivity along the y z coordinate axes l t 1 h represent the gw level l w represents the source sink terms with w 0 for flow out of the gw system and w 0 for flow into the gw system t 1 s s represent the specific storage l 1 t is time t the modflow modeling area was gridded to 200 200 cells with 1 682 m on the x axis and 1 947 m on the y axis fig 2 to apply the simulation the following packages were utilized the layer property flow lpf with the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver time variant specified head chd evapotranspiration evt recharge rch lake lak3 and river riv the gw model reaches a depth of 100 m which is a shallow unconfined aquifer dominated by semi consolidated coarse middle quaternary sediments rakhmatullaev et al 2010 according to schettler et al 2013 the stratum at 100 m a s l is a poorly water conducting horizon lower middle eocene dominated by marl limestone and mudstone therefore the gw model has one layer with a bottom elevation of 100 m and the bottom of the aquifer is a no flux boundary the et of the bare land is around 20 of the potential et and over the water surface it is set to 100 of the potential et liu et al 2020 and we adopted this ratio in the gw model the hydrogeological parameters according to hydrogeological type are listed in table 3 the initial heads were obtained from a steady state simulation using the mean annual precipitation et and the amu darya river runoff from 2005 the interaction of lake aquifer was simulated by the lake package lak3 merritt and konikow 2000 according to observations the lake initial stage min stage and max stage were set to 30 7 m 29 7 m and 30 7 m respectively the elevation of the bathymetry was obtained from dem data and imported as a tin in the model the lake leakance was set to 50 the gw table height is relative to the m a s l and varies from 30 6 m in the center to 59 7 m on the west side of the study area with gw flowing towards the lake the time step of the simulation is one month with 155 stress periods from january 2005 to december 2017 2 5 calibration of modflow limited by the scarcity of monitoring data the monthly gw head derived from the grace satellite data was also taken into consideration for the gw model calibration in total the average monthly water heads of one in situ gw observation well and six grace derived gw heads within the period of 2006 2016 were set as calibration targets the calibration of the model was conducted considering horizontal hydraulic conductivity as a major calibration parameter while specific yield specific storage recharge rate and et extinction depth were spatially constant based on the hydrogeological condition of the study area the parameters range was mainly adopted from the empirical values in the arid area table 3 the grace derived gw heads were achieved from the changes in gw storage gws referenced by the monthly mean gw head the gws was calculated based on the water balance equation as below 2 gws t w s s m s w s s w e where the terrestrial water storage tws includes the surface water storage sws gw storage gws soil moisture sm and snow water equivalent swe the grace derived tws anomaly data represent the tws anomaly for a given month relative to the baseline average from january 2004 to december 2009 save et al 2016 since the south aral sea area is located in the arid region the gws is dominant in tws while the sm and swe are almost negligible within the study area six grace data grids with no surface water or with only a slight change in the surface water g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 and g8 were included in the investigation the gw head h g of the grid is further converted from the monthly gws anomaly δ g w s as shown in eq 3 3 h g h avg δ g w s s y where h g represents the gw head converted from the grace data h avg represents the mean gw head from january 2004 to december 2009 the δ g w s s y illustrate the variation of the gw head of the grid among them h avg is regional mean data obtained from the centre of hydrometeorological service of uzbekistan and the s y specific yield was set as 0 23 referenced by the empirical value of domenico and schwartz 1998 the gw heads calculated by eq 3 is used as the observed gw head at the center of the grid to calibrate the gw model by changing the hydraulic conductivity the calibration process was achieved by pest doherty and hunt 2010 3 results 3 1 model performance the model simulation period was between january 2006 and december 2016 fig 3 with the automatic calibration by pest the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is 1 10 3 m s with the rmse between the simulations and observations is respectively 0 21 m ob1 0 20 m g1 0 03 m g2 0 02 m g3 0 16 m g4 0 04 m g5 and 0 01 m g8 furthermore according to the previous study pan et al 2020 the gw level is highly correlated to river runoff and the gw level around the river is greatly affected by the river water level in the gw model with a close distance to the amu darya river the trend in ob1 was captured well by the model results in addition the gw head fluctuations and the decreasing trend were consistent with the results of our previous study regarding other modeling areas pan et al 2020 the pearson correlation analysis revealed that the dynamics of the gw level were closely related to those of the south aral sea level within the study area pan et al 2020 the calibration results are acceptable and can be applied for further investigation of climate change scenarios fig 4 3 2 the variation of hydrometeorological factors to reveal the impact of future climate change fig 5 on the south aral sea especially the water balance condition a dataset was developed to forecast various future scenarios climate change can be predicted using diverse meteorological forcing variables the parameters were calculated from four gcms and three scenarios sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development to account for the uncertainty of the simulation outputs with the in situ measurements the bma was applied to combine different models in order to obtain reasonable results achieng and zhu 2019 raftery et al 2005 sidike et al 2016 during the study period we calculated the average value of each month to match the modflow and swat meteorological parameters and we extracted the monthly variation signals of the averaged model results of which the maximum and minimum temperatures are the anomalies relative to the historical data of the gcm and the precipitation and et indicate the anomaly ratios 3 2 1 precipitation as the amu darya river vanished before reaching the south aral sea precipitation and gw became vital water source components for the south aral sea from 2005 to 2017 the average annual precipitation was 146 3 mm while the seasonal distribution was uneven in the summer the extent of precipitation is limited only measuring 5 6 mm monthly we evaluated the variation in precipitation under different scenarios table 4 depending on the amount of precipitation the three scenarios resulted in a slight increase in the mean annual precipitation strong variations will exist in different months within the year of three scenarios compared with the historical data an anomaly ratio of 0 88 1 47 will be visible in the 2030 s 0 61 1 28 in the 2060 s and 0 54 1 38 in the 2090 s meanwhile the projected precipitation increases during winter while in the 2060 s and the 2090 s the projected precipitation will reduce in june september and october with a varying degree 3 2 2 evapotranspiration et is an important factor influencing surface water and gw consumption in arid regions however the et data acquired from the gcms of cmip6 in central asia have previously been overestimated in this study the et fluctuation was limited to a reasonable range by matching the variation signal to the historical data the mean annual et of bare land was 429 mm from 2005 to 2017 most of which occurred during summer accounting for approximately 46 of the year and the et in winter was 11 generally due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming intensification the et of the south aral sea region appears to be rising at the end of the 21st century the et will have increased by 40 compared to the beginning of the century table 5 seasonally the predicted et increase will be a peak from december to april of the next year and over time a higher greenhouse gas emission will have a more intense impact on the et even with mitigation measures sustainable pathway the temperature and et will inevitably increase 3 2 3 runoff dynamics of the amu darya river to evaluate the runoff of the amu darya river under climate change conditions the predicted climate change signals were substituted for the model s original hydrometeorological data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the predicted downstream runoff was evaluated based on the kiziljar station in the study area fig 1 the mean annual runoff of the kiziljar station varied from 4 to 470 m3 s with an average of 116 m3 s during 2005 2016 water consumption by irrigation in the middle downstream region has greatly affected river discharge the impact of climate change on the downstream runoff was small and as the emission concentration increased the runoff increased slowly with a range of 100 3 105 0 table 6 seasonally the runoff remains consistent with the historical level from april to november and rises from december onwards and falls back to the historical level in march of the following year fig 6 the outflow of the runoff from december to march of the following year is low accounting for only 12 3 of the mean monthly runoff from april to november from march to may and june to august the snow and glacier melt separately in the upstream high mountain area and further lead to the water level rising the lowest water level occurs in winter when sub zero temperatures sometimes result in no runoff 3 3 water balance of the south aral sea according to the corrected data from the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography the south aral sea achieved a dynamic water balance volume between 2015 and 2017 table 7 the south aral sea split into the east and the west and the two parts still maintain a weak connection the water level of the shallower eastern part fluctuated annually from 2009 to 2017 in alternately dry and wet years mainly following a round of spring snow melting as a terminal lake the south aral sea is recharged by the gw flow and precipitation on the lake water leaves the lake mainly by et the water balance is 4 v q in p e a where v is the south aral sea volume q in is surface and subsurface flow into the lake p is precipitation on the lake e is et from the lake surface a is the area of the south aral sea tanino 2012 the variation signal of the predicted hydrometeorological parameters the amu darya river downstream runoff precipitation and et was matched with the historical data of the gw model the results show the impact of the changing trends of the three scenarios in the 2030 s 2060 s and 2090 s on the water balance during 2005 2017 fig 7 the captured changing trends were directly applied to the historical data of 2005 2017 with different periods the 2030 s 2060 s and 2090 s the results indicate that gw flux into the south aral sea and et on the lake surface control the morphology of the lake the volume of the annual gw flux into the lake lies between 5 53 km3 and 7 66 km3 per year accounting to approximately 78 to 92 of the total recharge and is slightly affected by climate change the annual et on the lake surface measures between 6 46 km3 and 25 45 km3 the lake surface area had a remarkable effect on the et meanwhile the et increases with the period of greenhouse gas emissions compared with sustainable pathway and fossil fueled development the et will grow by 27 5 under the 2090 s climate conditions during 2005 2017 the precipitation provides a limited replenishment to the lake estimated to be between 0 63 km3 and 2 23 km3 which also depends on the lake surface area as described by eq 4 according to the eq 4 and level area storage capacity relationship curve the surface area of the lake in different climate change scenarios could also be predicted compared with the status of the lake in 2017 7 62 10 3 km 2 the lake surface area that was projected to continuously shrinking table 8 under the sustainable pathway the lake surface area decreased by 24 in the 2060 s and kept relatively constant from then on while for the medium pathway and the fossil fueled development the lake surface area is predicted to shrink separately by 30 and 41 at 2100 4 discussion 4 1 hydrometeorological predictions climate change in the south aral sea basin is expected to have a tremendous impact on the hydrological processes intensive water resource consumption combined with rising atmospheric greenhouse gas has a critical impact on the regional climate mcdermid and winter 2017 one of the primary challenges triggered by rising greenhouse gas emissions is the consequent increase in et mcdermid and winter 2017 in 2020 liu et al 2020 estimated that the current potential et of the south aral sea could reach 1 100 1 500 mm yr during the growing season while in this study we assess that the potential et could rise to 1 270 1 687 mm yr during the next few decades making it 1 12 times larger than before functioning as the main water source sink increased et leads to an escalated drought level and an increase in irrigation water consumption moreover it causes shrinkage in the lake surface area enlarging the exposed lakebed which augments the surface air temperature during summer small et al 2001 another challenge caused by climate change especially global warming is the shrinking of the glaciers and snowfields in the tian shan mountains which serve as the major water source of the amu darya river micklin 2016 although our results demonstrate that the precipitation and runoff of the amu darya river will increase slightly within this century the regional ecological environment may still be threatened in the long run however the rise may be offset or even outpaced by human consumption as stated by aus der beek et al 2011 implying that anthropogenic water utilization may have a much larger influence on the local environment than climate change therefore climate change and human activities are two factors that affect each other and it is thus crucial to develop strategies adapted to various climate scenarios 4 2 hydraulic interaction between gw and south aral sea as a terminal lake the water balance of the south aral sea is fundamentally determined by the inflow from the amu darya river and net evaporation table 9 lists the estimated gw flux into the lake from previous studies the estimated gw flux in this study is approximately equal to the median level estimated by benduhn and renard 2004 reaching the maximum value reported by crétaux et al 2005 and alekseeva et al 2009 by means of numerical simulation the gw recharge result range in this study 5 5 to 7 7 km3 yr is much smaller than the range presented in the aforementioned studies 4 7 to 25 km3 yr it should be noted however that these study periods were before 2005 when the dike kokaral was not completed meanwhile the research topic of the above mentioned studies covered the entire aral sea the south aral sea is about 2 5 times larger than the north aral sea during the study period after building the dike kokaral in august 2005 and the split off of the north aral sea from the south aral sea the replenishment characteristics for the aral sea have completely changed as the amu darya river vanished before reaching the south aral sea the relative importance of the gw recharge increased dramatically by comparing the water balance of the south aral sea with the runoff of the amu darya river kiziljar station and the variation in storage from 2005 to 2017 the gw flux into the lake appears to be greater than the input from the river in most years fig 8 the downstream runoff is affected by climate change in the mountainous regions and is severely restricted by irrigation water consumption in the middle downstream hu et al 2021 compared with other components the gw flux into the lake was larger than the precipitation on the lake surface and more stable than the river inflow to the lake the gw flux is an important factor preventing the lake from drying up based on the south aral sea digital bottom model and remote sensing data chanjuan et al 2021 determined the south aral sea level area storage capacity relationship curve the variation in the lake storage capacity implies replenishments that were approximately equivalent to the consumption in 2013 which means the volume of inflow from precipitation and gw flux is almost equal to et consumption as shown in fig 8 in 2010 a heavy flow from the amu darya river partially refilled the western dry lakebed and in 2017 a heavier flow occurred on the syr darya river the excess water from the north aral sea extends sufficiently far south to release into the lake micklin et al 2018 when such extreme events happen the scarcity of measurements restricts the accuracy of estimating water balance meanwhile the uncertainty in cmip6 climate change projections will affect the accuracy of future gw flow estimation furthermore the reliability of calibration approach is controlled by the spatial resolution of grace data although the current grace data have a spatial resolution of 0 25 the huge geographic area that the grace data represents make this approach more suitable for large scale gw simulations moreover the rapid change of the lake surface area will affect the water flux between gw and the lake which requests simulating the dynamic evolution of the lake boundary in the modflow model in addition the high salinity of the lake will lead to the regional variable density flow and an estimation on possible deviation is required according to previous investigations the salinity in the south aral sea and the aquifer could separately reach 193 5 g l duan et al 2022 and 23 g l johansson et al 2009 by converting them into the water pressure it will decrease the hydraulic gradient by 25 in between comparing with the freshwater condition and accordingly lead to a 25 decrease in the gw flux into the lake therefore in the future a better understanding of the local salinity along the groundwater flow path may strongly improve the accuracy of the estimation the partial restoration of the north aral sea proves that artificial intervention can improve the ecological environment micklin et al 2018 the eastern part of the south aral sea is a shallow lake that covers a large surface area together with a broad growth of reeds which contributes to a high et rate resulting in the water loss in the south aral sea extremely large micklin 2016 in the absence of compensation from surface runoff the eastern lake has become non perennial while the western part still exists because of the gw inflow because the volume of the precipitation and et were positively related to the surface area of the lake we can assess the largest area the gw recharge could maintain in different scenarios although gw can maintain a part of the lake surface water directly inflow into the lake is necessary to restore the lake to its 1960 status unfortunately a full restoration of the aral sea is not realistic in the foreseeable future but it is still possible to improve the local environment uzbekistan has been promoting a drip irrigation system under mulch to increase the water use efficiency and seed cotton yield the reduced water use could sufficiently supply the amu darya river inflow back to the south aral sea but it would also cause a drop in the gw level due to the less recharge to the aquifer from irrigation therefore long term measurements are required to quantify this impact it is unrealistic to resolve the aral sea crisis in the short term since sustainable solutions require vast investments as well as fundamental policy and social and economic adjustments that take time 5 conclusions to evaluate the water resource balance and the interaction of the gw surface water a gw numerical model was constructed for the south aral sea area and applied to simulate the potential hydrological response to future climate conditions under different scenarios the applied hydrological scenarios were based on a combination of the gcms of cmip6 and the modflow simulation the gw model was calibrated using in situ measurements and grace derived data to reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions we used bma to perform a weighted average of the gcms and to extract variation signals to match the historical data the combination of modflow and swat simulated the gw surface exchange flux and the amu darya river runoff furthermore the lake area of the south aral sea was predicted based on the water balance method under different climate scenarios despite the scarcity of observational data several conclusions can be drawn the precipitation will slightly increase in the future with a range of 146 4 163 3 mm yr the exacerbated global warming will contribute to a rise in the et the bare land et will range from 453 8 to 602 6 mm yr and the et of the water body will fluctuate from 1 270 6 1 687 3 mm yr the runoff of the amu darya river determined by the snowmelt and glacier melt contributions in the upper mountainous area will also increase slightly with a range of 107 8 118 4 km3 yr the critical factor affecting the south aral sea is the et increase which potentially influences the lake surface area and water consumption for irrigation in the future based on the numerical simulation and water balance method the gw recharge to the south aral sea is situated between 5 5 and 7 7 km3 yr micklin 2016 drew similar conclusions when comparing the et to the gw recharge capacity and predicted that the deeper western parts of the south aral sea will not dry up we estimated that in the end of the 21st century the south aral sea may maintain a surface area of 4 47 10 3 k m 2 which means the shallow lake on the eastern part will disappear completely based on the three greenhouse gas emission scenarios we predicted the volume of the gw flux into the south aral sea and future variations in the surface area of the south aral sea in the long run alleviating the aral sea crisis still requires a vast investment and fundamental political social and economic changes this study could contribute to the formulation of water resource management policies for different climate scenarios future studies will be devoted to quantifying the changes in irrigation methods to the amu darya river runoff hypothetical modeling scenarios can explore practical ways of human intervention by combining the latter this study provides a further summary of the response of the south aral sea to climate change and human activities it should be noted that a systematic observation is a key to quantifying the effectiveness of the measures and might further address the

2777,the recession of the south aral sea over the last few decades has become a great environmental challenge in central asia due to declining inflow and irrigation exhaustion the amu darya river vanishes before reaching the south aral sea therefore groundwater gw has become the vital water source for the south aral sea surface water and the local ecosystem to develop feasible adaptation strategies for water resource management it is necessary to quantify the gw flux into the south aral sea under ongoing climate change based on numerical models modflow and swat and with the support of observed data remote sensing data reanalysis data and the output of global circulation models gcms of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 the hydraulic connection between a shallow aquifer and the lake was investigated and projected for future change the gw model was calibrated by one in situ gw well and six gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived gw heads the root mean square error rmse of the gw flow field simulation modflow was lower than 0 21 m from 2005 to 2016 under three shared socioeconomic pathways sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development the gcms indicate that the evapotranspiration et experiences the greatest change and will potentially rise to 602 6 mm yr by 2100 in fossil fueled development while the precipitation and the runoff of the amu darya river will both rise slightly and with the range of 146 4 163 3 mm yr and 107 8 118 4 m3 s from 2021 to 2100 separately and the increase is mainly during winter with climate change signals forcing on the historical hydrometeorological data the simulation result revealed that the gw contributes to more than 78 of the total influx of water into the lake during 2021 2100 and the predicted gw flux into the lake will slightly rise over time however the et will also increase due to rising temperatures and may gradually outpace the recharge growth the simulation results indicate that the south aral sea may maintain a surface area of 4 47 10 3 km 2 in fossil fueled development which means it will continue to shrink if there is no human intervention therefore a set of sustainable water resource management methods is urgently needed to preserve the ecological environment of the south aral sea and prevent ecological disasters keywords south aral sea integrated modeling climate change groundwater data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the aral sea was once the fourth largest inland lake on the earth with a surface area of 67 499 km2 in 1960 micklin 2010 the lake lies in the semi arid to the arid region of western central asia located in kazakhstan and uzbekistan as a terminal lake the water balance of the aral sea is fundamentally determined by two tributaries the amu darya river and the syr darya river together with the groundwater gw recharge and net evaporation i e evaporation from the lake surface minus precipitation micklin 2016 over the past six decades the expansion of irrigation has led to a significant decrease in river discharge causing a sharp shrinkage and salinization of the aral sea alekseeva et al 2009 ferrari et al 1999 gaybullaev et al 2012 hu et al 2021 keefe et al 2019 micklin et al 2014 the construction of the dike kokaral was completed in august 2005 which restored the water level and salinity of the north aral sea while the south aral sea continued to deteriorate micklin et al 2018 2014 in 2019 the water salinity decreased to 5 8 g l in the north aral sea while the salinity of the south aral sea was 193 5 g l duan et al 2022 the desiccation of the south aral sea has caused severe damage to the region s ecological environment economy and human habitation and is considered to be one of the greatest ecological disasters caused by human activity micklin 2010 2007 climate change may influence critical hydrological processes thereby affecting basin characteristics and available water resources persaud et al 2020 global warming has exacerbated the water resource crisis in arid regions it is therefore necessary to consider the uncertainty triggered by future climate change and formulate adequate coping strategies numerical modeling and statistical analysis have been used to estimate the potential influence of climate change on the hydrological processes in the aral sea region aus der beek et al 2011 berdimbetov et al 2020 hamidov et al 2020 massakbayeva et al 2019 mcdermid and winter 2017 wang et al 2020 the above mentioned studies have confirmed that since 1960 the mean air temperature potential evapotranspiration et and precipitation have drastically increased in the aral sea area while the total water storage has continued to decrease additionally the dried up lake beds cause frequent sand salt storms and the exposed bare land causes a local temperature increase gw is a critical component of the water cycle in arid regions tweed et al 2011 supporting the ecosystem lubczynski 2009 and providing available water resources for agricultural and domestic use al katheeri 2008 tang et al 2004 several studies have evaluated the hydraulic exchange of gw and surface water in the aral sea based on numerical modeling and water balance methods but the results vary greatly alekseeva et al 2009 benduhn and renard 2004 crétaux et al 2005 jarsjö and destouni 2004 simonov and altman 1991a simonov and altman 1991b the gw flux into the aral sea was once considered an insignificant part of the water balance simonov and altman 1991a simonov and altman 1991b the gw flux was approximately 12 of the amu darya river discharge into the lake in 1960 to approximately 100 in 2004 jarsjö and destouni 2004 the above mentioned studies show a great variation range from one study to another 1 3 to 30 km3 year this illustrates the great uncertainty in quantification and large deviation led by data availability and research methods however it is important to note that since the completion of the dike kokaral in 2005 and the intermittent recharge from the amu darya river to the south aral sea the local water balance condition may now be completely different with a diminishing contribution from the surface water gw may shoulder a larger weight as the water source therefore clarifying the current local water balance condition and quantifying the possible impact of climate change are both essential to ensure sustainability and reduce the potential negative impacts such as continuously shrinking water bodies and deteriorating water quality the main aim of this study was to analyze the potential response of the water balance in the south aral sea area to climate change using an integrated modeling method via i quantification of the exchange flux between gw and the south aral sea and ii estimation of the range of the lake surface area under different climate scenarios based on the storage capacity curve it is expected that the results of this study will provide insight into the response of the south aral sea to climate change and may also lead to improved water management practices furthermore as a typical case study it may enhance the understanding of results led by climate change in arid regions 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the south aral sea is a part of the former aral sea basin over the last century the inflow into the aral sea continued to decrease due to the growing agricultural consumption leading to the retreat of the lake border in 1987 the lake body was finally divided into two main parts the south aral sea and the north aral sea by the beginning of this century the south aral sea further split into an eastern and a western part barely connected by a narrow channel that balanced the water levels the south aral sea fig 1 is an almost dry lake basin together with its catchment covering an area of 72 772 4 km2 located between uzbekistan and kazakhstan in the center of the kyzylkum desert the south aral sea aquifer is primarily an unconfined aquifer constituted of clay silt and sand of different grain sizes dating back to the late pleistocene burr et al 2019 the land cover within the area is mostly bare land and the surface elevation varies from 3 to 162 m a s l meters above sea level the amu darya river is the dominant waterway within the area and is fed by the precipitation and snowmelt of tian shan and pamir 2 2 data collection to apply the modflow model in the study area a series of meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological information was gathered and categorized table 1 the monthly regional average gw head was used as the gw model hydraulic head and the station data were used to calibrate the gw model the study domain topography was generated from the ziyuan 3 imagery and the spatial resolution of the processed dem data is 5 m tang et al 2015 we estimated the et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mod09ga and mod11a1 products provided by the united states distributed data center for land processes https ipdaac usgs gov using the surface energy balance system model su 2002 due to the slightly spatial variation of precipitation and et over the study area the input climate parameters of the model are the monthly mean value per unit area 2 3 future climate projections to understand the simulated hydrological response to climate change conditions and to compare different scenarios the climate projections captured from the coupled model intercomparison project 6 cmip6 were applied to the model domain the three projected climate scenarios sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development and four global circulation models gcms for each climate parameter are summarized in table 2 the projected scenarios were applied to build the numerical models modflow and swat in the south aral sea 2 3 1 cmip6 data ten cmip6 gcms from six different modeling institutes were considered based on the assessment of the data regarding the arid area cook et al 2020 guo et al 2021 li et al 2020 su et al 2021 wang et al 2021 the selected gcms historical 1995 2014 monthly climate outputs were retrieved from the earth system grid federation esgf data portal https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 to consider a range of possible future options we used the simulations of three ssps from tier 1 of scenariomip ssp1 2 6 with 2 6 w m2 by the year 2100 sustainable pathway ssp2 4 5 with 4 5 w m2 by the year 2100 medium pathway and ssp5 8 5 with 8 5 w m2 by the year 2100 fossil fueled development the three future periods selected for this study are the 2030 s 2021 2040 which is referred to as the near future the 2060 s 2051 2070 as the intermediate future and the 2090 s 2081 2100 as the far future the period from 2005 to 2017 was selected as the reference period 2 3 2 synthetic scenario to capture a range of possible future climate conditions and to reduce the model uncertainty the bayes model average bma was applied for the combination of the gcms the bma method is a common statistical technique that is generally applied to the gcm ensemble luo et al 2019 this is a probabilistic method that adopts the weighted probability density function of the gcms the bma weights indicate the contribution of the component model to the predictive ability of the training samples huang et al 2014 that is by comparing the measurements of the homologous period the bma weights were calibrated using the training samples under the historical emission scenarios if the training samples demonstrate better performance in reproducing the current climate conditions the model will receive larger weights and may represent future climate conditions more accurately yang et al 2011 the probability density function of the projected climatic parameter can be written as 1 p y i 1 n p i y m i w i where n represents the number of the used gcms in this study n 4 p i y m i illustrates the projected probability density function of y based on the m i w i stands for the posterior probability of m i being given the correct training sample raftery et al 2005 and i 1 n w i 1 the more m i fits the observations during the training period the larger w i is 2 4 model setup 2 4 1 hydrological model to assess the impact of climate change on the runoff dynamics of the amu darya river a well calibrated swat model was adopted ayetiguli 2017 swat is a semi distributed hydrological model which can simulate continuous and long term runoff based on the physical mechanism arnold et al 2013 in this investigation the swat model was built to simulate the flow regime in the amu darya river basin while four hydrometeorological measurement stations kelif kerki tuyamuyun and kiziljar were selected as the target for model calibration from 1950 to 2014 2 4 2 groundwater simulation in this study modflow 2005 was applied to simulate the gw flow modflow is a fully distributed physics based model that uses finite difference methods to solve the differential equations of the gw flow in three dimensions harbaugh 2005 the governing equation for gw flow is as below 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where k x k y k z represents hydraulic conductivity along the y z coordinate axes l t 1 h represent the gw level l w represents the source sink terms with w 0 for flow out of the gw system and w 0 for flow into the gw system t 1 s s represent the specific storage l 1 t is time t the modflow modeling area was gridded to 200 200 cells with 1 682 m on the x axis and 1 947 m on the y axis fig 2 to apply the simulation the following packages were utilized the layer property flow lpf with the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg solver time variant specified head chd evapotranspiration evt recharge rch lake lak3 and river riv the gw model reaches a depth of 100 m which is a shallow unconfined aquifer dominated by semi consolidated coarse middle quaternary sediments rakhmatullaev et al 2010 according to schettler et al 2013 the stratum at 100 m a s l is a poorly water conducting horizon lower middle eocene dominated by marl limestone and mudstone therefore the gw model has one layer with a bottom elevation of 100 m and the bottom of the aquifer is a no flux boundary the et of the bare land is around 20 of the potential et and over the water surface it is set to 100 of the potential et liu et al 2020 and we adopted this ratio in the gw model the hydrogeological parameters according to hydrogeological type are listed in table 3 the initial heads were obtained from a steady state simulation using the mean annual precipitation et and the amu darya river runoff from 2005 the interaction of lake aquifer was simulated by the lake package lak3 merritt and konikow 2000 according to observations the lake initial stage min stage and max stage were set to 30 7 m 29 7 m and 30 7 m respectively the elevation of the bathymetry was obtained from dem data and imported as a tin in the model the lake leakance was set to 50 the gw table height is relative to the m a s l and varies from 30 6 m in the center to 59 7 m on the west side of the study area with gw flowing towards the lake the time step of the simulation is one month with 155 stress periods from january 2005 to december 2017 2 5 calibration of modflow limited by the scarcity of monitoring data the monthly gw head derived from the grace satellite data was also taken into consideration for the gw model calibration in total the average monthly water heads of one in situ gw observation well and six grace derived gw heads within the period of 2006 2016 were set as calibration targets the calibration of the model was conducted considering horizontal hydraulic conductivity as a major calibration parameter while specific yield specific storage recharge rate and et extinction depth were spatially constant based on the hydrogeological condition of the study area the parameters range was mainly adopted from the empirical values in the arid area table 3 the grace derived gw heads were achieved from the changes in gw storage gws referenced by the monthly mean gw head the gws was calculated based on the water balance equation as below 2 gws t w s s m s w s s w e where the terrestrial water storage tws includes the surface water storage sws gw storage gws soil moisture sm and snow water equivalent swe the grace derived tws anomaly data represent the tws anomaly for a given month relative to the baseline average from january 2004 to december 2009 save et al 2016 since the south aral sea area is located in the arid region the gws is dominant in tws while the sm and swe are almost negligible within the study area six grace data grids with no surface water or with only a slight change in the surface water g1 g2 g3 g4 g5 and g8 were included in the investigation the gw head h g of the grid is further converted from the monthly gws anomaly δ g w s as shown in eq 3 3 h g h avg δ g w s s y where h g represents the gw head converted from the grace data h avg represents the mean gw head from january 2004 to december 2009 the δ g w s s y illustrate the variation of the gw head of the grid among them h avg is regional mean data obtained from the centre of hydrometeorological service of uzbekistan and the s y specific yield was set as 0 23 referenced by the empirical value of domenico and schwartz 1998 the gw heads calculated by eq 3 is used as the observed gw head at the center of the grid to calibrate the gw model by changing the hydraulic conductivity the calibration process was achieved by pest doherty and hunt 2010 3 results 3 1 model performance the model simulation period was between january 2006 and december 2016 fig 3 with the automatic calibration by pest the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is 1 10 3 m s with the rmse between the simulations and observations is respectively 0 21 m ob1 0 20 m g1 0 03 m g2 0 02 m g3 0 16 m g4 0 04 m g5 and 0 01 m g8 furthermore according to the previous study pan et al 2020 the gw level is highly correlated to river runoff and the gw level around the river is greatly affected by the river water level in the gw model with a close distance to the amu darya river the trend in ob1 was captured well by the model results in addition the gw head fluctuations and the decreasing trend were consistent with the results of our previous study regarding other modeling areas pan et al 2020 the pearson correlation analysis revealed that the dynamics of the gw level were closely related to those of the south aral sea level within the study area pan et al 2020 the calibration results are acceptable and can be applied for further investigation of climate change scenarios fig 4 3 2 the variation of hydrometeorological factors to reveal the impact of future climate change fig 5 on the south aral sea especially the water balance condition a dataset was developed to forecast various future scenarios climate change can be predicted using diverse meteorological forcing variables the parameters were calculated from four gcms and three scenarios sustainable pathway medium pathway and fossil fueled development to account for the uncertainty of the simulation outputs with the in situ measurements the bma was applied to combine different models in order to obtain reasonable results achieng and zhu 2019 raftery et al 2005 sidike et al 2016 during the study period we calculated the average value of each month to match the modflow and swat meteorological parameters and we extracted the monthly variation signals of the averaged model results of which the maximum and minimum temperatures are the anomalies relative to the historical data of the gcm and the precipitation and et indicate the anomaly ratios 3 2 1 precipitation as the amu darya river vanished before reaching the south aral sea precipitation and gw became vital water source components for the south aral sea from 2005 to 2017 the average annual precipitation was 146 3 mm while the seasonal distribution was uneven in the summer the extent of precipitation is limited only measuring 5 6 mm monthly we evaluated the variation in precipitation under different scenarios table 4 depending on the amount of precipitation the three scenarios resulted in a slight increase in the mean annual precipitation strong variations will exist in different months within the year of three scenarios compared with the historical data an anomaly ratio of 0 88 1 47 will be visible in the 2030 s 0 61 1 28 in the 2060 s and 0 54 1 38 in the 2090 s meanwhile the projected precipitation increases during winter while in the 2060 s and the 2090 s the projected precipitation will reduce in june september and october with a varying degree 3 2 2 evapotranspiration et is an important factor influencing surface water and gw consumption in arid regions however the et data acquired from the gcms of cmip6 in central asia have previously been overestimated in this study the et fluctuation was limited to a reasonable range by matching the variation signal to the historical data the mean annual et of bare land was 429 mm from 2005 to 2017 most of which occurred during summer accounting for approximately 46 of the year and the et in winter was 11 generally due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming intensification the et of the south aral sea region appears to be rising at the end of the 21st century the et will have increased by 40 compared to the beginning of the century table 5 seasonally the predicted et increase will be a peak from december to april of the next year and over time a higher greenhouse gas emission will have a more intense impact on the et even with mitigation measures sustainable pathway the temperature and et will inevitably increase 3 2 3 runoff dynamics of the amu darya river to evaluate the runoff of the amu darya river under climate change conditions the predicted climate change signals were substituted for the model s original hydrometeorological data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the predicted downstream runoff was evaluated based on the kiziljar station in the study area fig 1 the mean annual runoff of the kiziljar station varied from 4 to 470 m3 s with an average of 116 m3 s during 2005 2016 water consumption by irrigation in the middle downstream region has greatly affected river discharge the impact of climate change on the downstream runoff was small and as the emission concentration increased the runoff increased slowly with a range of 100 3 105 0 table 6 seasonally the runoff remains consistent with the historical level from april to november and rises from december onwards and falls back to the historical level in march of the following year fig 6 the outflow of the runoff from december to march of the following year is low accounting for only 12 3 of the mean monthly runoff from april to november from march to may and june to august the snow and glacier melt separately in the upstream high mountain area and further lead to the water level rising the lowest water level occurs in winter when sub zero temperatures sometimes result in no runoff 3 3 water balance of the south aral sea according to the corrected data from the xinjiang institute of ecology and geography the south aral sea achieved a dynamic water balance volume between 2015 and 2017 table 7 the south aral sea split into the east and the west and the two parts still maintain a weak connection the water level of the shallower eastern part fluctuated annually from 2009 to 2017 in alternately dry and wet years mainly following a round of spring snow melting as a terminal lake the south aral sea is recharged by the gw flow and precipitation on the lake water leaves the lake mainly by et the water balance is 4 v q in p e a where v is the south aral sea volume q in is surface and subsurface flow into the lake p is precipitation on the lake e is et from the lake surface a is the area of the south aral sea tanino 2012 the variation signal of the predicted hydrometeorological parameters the amu darya river downstream runoff precipitation and et was matched with the historical data of the gw model the results show the impact of the changing trends of the three scenarios in the 2030 s 2060 s and 2090 s on the water balance during 2005 2017 fig 7 the captured changing trends were directly applied to the historical data of 2005 2017 with different periods the 2030 s 2060 s and 2090 s the results indicate that gw flux into the south aral sea and et on the lake surface control the morphology of the lake the volume of the annual gw flux into the lake lies between 5 53 km3 and 7 66 km3 per year accounting to approximately 78 to 92 of the total recharge and is slightly affected by climate change the annual et on the lake surface measures between 6 46 km3 and 25 45 km3 the lake surface area had a remarkable effect on the et meanwhile the et increases with the period of greenhouse gas emissions compared with sustainable pathway and fossil fueled development the et will grow by 27 5 under the 2090 s climate conditions during 2005 2017 the precipitation provides a limited replenishment to the lake estimated to be between 0 63 km3 and 2 23 km3 which also depends on the lake surface area as described by eq 4 according to the eq 4 and level area storage capacity relationship curve the surface area of the lake in different climate change scenarios could also be predicted compared with the status of the lake in 2017 7 62 10 3 km 2 the lake surface area that was projected to continuously shrinking table 8 under the sustainable pathway the lake surface area decreased by 24 in the 2060 s and kept relatively constant from then on while for the medium pathway and the fossil fueled development the lake surface area is predicted to shrink separately by 30 and 41 at 2100 4 discussion 4 1 hydrometeorological predictions climate change in the south aral sea basin is expected to have a tremendous impact on the hydrological processes intensive water resource consumption combined with rising atmospheric greenhouse gas has a critical impact on the regional climate mcdermid and winter 2017 one of the primary challenges triggered by rising greenhouse gas emissions is the consequent increase in et mcdermid and winter 2017 in 2020 liu et al 2020 estimated that the current potential et of the south aral sea could reach 1 100 1 500 mm yr during the growing season while in this study we assess that the potential et could rise to 1 270 1 687 mm yr during the next few decades making it 1 12 times larger than before functioning as the main water source sink increased et leads to an escalated drought level and an increase in irrigation water consumption moreover it causes shrinkage in the lake surface area enlarging the exposed lakebed which augments the surface air temperature during summer small et al 2001 another challenge caused by climate change especially global warming is the shrinking of the glaciers and snowfields in the tian shan mountains which serve as the major water source of the amu darya river micklin 2016 although our results demonstrate that the precipitation and runoff of the amu darya river will increase slightly within this century the regional ecological environment may still be threatened in the long run however the rise may be offset or even outpaced by human consumption as stated by aus der beek et al 2011 implying that anthropogenic water utilization may have a much larger influence on the local environment than climate change therefore climate change and human activities are two factors that affect each other and it is thus crucial to develop strategies adapted to various climate scenarios 4 2 hydraulic interaction between gw and south aral sea as a terminal lake the water balance of the south aral sea is fundamentally determined by the inflow from the amu darya river and net evaporation table 9 lists the estimated gw flux into the lake from previous studies the estimated gw flux in this study is approximately equal to the median level estimated by benduhn and renard 2004 reaching the maximum value reported by crétaux et al 2005 and alekseeva et al 2009 by means of numerical simulation the gw recharge result range in this study 5 5 to 7 7 km3 yr is much smaller than the range presented in the aforementioned studies 4 7 to 25 km3 yr it should be noted however that these study periods were before 2005 when the dike kokaral was not completed meanwhile the research topic of the above mentioned studies covered the entire aral sea the south aral sea is about 2 5 times larger than the north aral sea during the study period after building the dike kokaral in august 2005 and the split off of the north aral sea from the south aral sea the replenishment characteristics for the aral sea have completely changed as the amu darya river vanished before reaching the south aral sea the relative importance of the gw recharge increased dramatically by comparing the water balance of the south aral sea with the runoff of the amu darya river kiziljar station and the variation in storage from 2005 to 2017 the gw flux into the lake appears to be greater than the input from the river in most years fig 8 the downstream runoff is affected by climate change in the mountainous regions and is severely restricted by irrigation water consumption in the middle downstream hu et al 2021 compared with other components the gw flux into the lake was larger than the precipitation on the lake surface and more stable than the river inflow to the lake the gw flux is an important factor preventing the lake from drying up based on the south aral sea digital bottom model and remote sensing data chanjuan et al 2021 determined the south aral sea level area storage capacity relationship curve the variation in the lake storage capacity implies replenishments that were approximately equivalent to the consumption in 2013 which means the volume of inflow from precipitation and gw flux is almost equal to et consumption as shown in fig 8 in 2010 a heavy flow from the amu darya river partially refilled the western dry lakebed and in 2017 a heavier flow occurred on the syr darya river the excess water from the north aral sea extends sufficiently far south to release into the lake micklin et al 2018 when such extreme events happen the scarcity of measurements restricts the accuracy of estimating water balance meanwhile the uncertainty in cmip6 climate change projections will affect the accuracy of future gw flow estimation furthermore the reliability of calibration approach is controlled by the spatial resolution of grace data although the current grace data have a spatial resolution of 0 25 the huge geographic area that the grace data represents make this approach more suitable for large scale gw simulations moreover the rapid change of the lake surface area will affect the water flux between gw and the lake which requests simulating the dynamic evolution of the lake boundary in the modflow model in addition the high salinity of the lake will lead to the regional variable density flow and an estimation on possible deviation is required according to previous investigations the salinity in the south aral sea and the aquifer could separately reach 193 5 g l duan et al 2022 and 23 g l johansson et al 2009 by converting them into the water pressure it will decrease the hydraulic gradient by 25 in between comparing with the freshwater condition and accordingly lead to a 25 decrease in the gw flux into the lake therefore in the future a better understanding of the local salinity along the groundwater flow path may strongly improve the accuracy of the estimation the partial restoration of the north aral sea proves that artificial intervention can improve the ecological environment micklin et al 2018 the eastern part of the south aral sea is a shallow lake that covers a large surface area together with a broad growth of reeds which contributes to a high et rate resulting in the water loss in the south aral sea extremely large micklin 2016 in the absence of compensation from surface runoff the eastern lake has become non perennial while the western part still exists because of the gw inflow because the volume of the precipitation and et were positively related to the surface area of the lake we can assess the largest area the gw recharge could maintain in different scenarios although gw can maintain a part of the lake surface water directly inflow into the lake is necessary to restore the lake to its 1960 status unfortunately a full restoration of the aral sea is not realistic in the foreseeable future but it is still possible to improve the local environment uzbekistan has been promoting a drip irrigation system under mulch to increase the water use efficiency and seed cotton yield the reduced water use could sufficiently supply the amu darya river inflow back to the south aral sea but it would also cause a drop in the gw level due to the less recharge to the aquifer from irrigation therefore long term measurements are required to quantify this impact it is unrealistic to resolve the aral sea crisis in the short term since sustainable solutions require vast investments as well as fundamental policy and social and economic adjustments that take time 5 conclusions to evaluate the water resource balance and the interaction of the gw surface water a gw numerical model was constructed for the south aral sea area and applied to simulate the potential hydrological response to future climate conditions under different scenarios the applied hydrological scenarios were based on a combination of the gcms of cmip6 and the modflow simulation the gw model was calibrated using in situ measurements and grace derived data to reduce the uncertainty in climate change predictions we used bma to perform a weighted average of the gcms and to extract variation signals to match the historical data the combination of modflow and swat simulated the gw surface exchange flux and the amu darya river runoff furthermore the lake area of the south aral sea was predicted based on the water balance method under different climate scenarios despite the scarcity of observational data several conclusions can be drawn the precipitation will slightly increase in the future with a range of 146 4 163 3 mm yr the exacerbated global warming will contribute to a rise in the et the bare land et will range from 453 8 to 602 6 mm yr and the et of the water body will fluctuate from 1 270 6 1 687 3 mm yr the runoff of the amu darya river determined by the snowmelt and glacier melt contributions in the upper mountainous area will also increase slightly with a range of 107 8 118 4 km3 yr the critical factor affecting the south aral sea is the et increase which potentially influences the lake surface area and water consumption for irrigation in the future based on the numerical simulation and water balance method the gw recharge to the south aral sea is situated between 5 5 and 7 7 km3 yr micklin 2016 drew similar conclusions when comparing the et to the gw recharge capacity and predicted that the deeper western parts of the south aral sea will not dry up we estimated that in the end of the 21st century the south aral sea may maintain a surface area of 4 47 10 3 k m 2 which means the shallow lake on the eastern part will disappear completely based on the three greenhouse gas emission scenarios we predicted the volume of the gw flux into the south aral sea and future variations in the surface area of the south aral sea in the long run alleviating the aral sea crisis still requires a vast investment and fundamental political social and economic changes this study could contribute to the formulation of water resource management policies for different climate scenarios future studies will be devoted to quantifying the changes in irrigation methods to the amu darya river runoff hypothetical modeling scenarios can explore practical ways of human intervention by combining the latter this study provides a further summary of the response of the south aral sea to climate change and human activities it should be noted that a systematic observation is a key to quantifying the effectiveness of the measures and might further address the

2778,an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is vital for understanding the global hydrological cycle however large uncertainties in the present global et products originate from the distinct model structures assumptions and inputs the maximum entropy production mep model provides a novel method for modeling et based on parsimonious inputs and energy conservation in this study an r package for mep rmep was presented to facilitate mep model implementation based on rmep a global et analysis was conducted using inputs from the global land data assimilation system gldas and global land surface satellite glass products during 1978 2018 and the mann kendall and theil sen s methods were employed to detect the et trends the mep estimated average annual global land et was 517 mm yr 1 during 1978 2018 and showed a close agreement with eddy covariance ec measurements from 475 flux sites with a correlation coefficient of 0 74 and root mean square error of 26 99 mm mon 1 the overall performance of mep was evaluated across various land covers and a higher et accuracy was revealed for forestlands wetlands and cropland land covers the mep derived et trend corresponded well with the ec observed et trend and the results indicated that the global land et declined continuously during 1999 2018 overall the mep model provided an accurate et estimate with parsimonious inputs which outperformed the gldas noah et product and can serve as a global analytical method for the hydrological cycle and climate change keywords evapotranspiration maximum entropy production et trend eddy covariance r package data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a significant component of the global hydrological and energy cycle reflecting water exchange between land and atmosphere pascolini campbell et al 2021 an accurate estimation of et is required in numerous engineering applications such as agriculture and water resource management fisher et al 2017 sun et al 2022 yang et al 2021 et is also important for predicting species richness and plant productivity fisher et al 2011 however it is the most difficult component to measure in the hydrological cycle lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 progress has been made in monitoring techniques over the past decades including lysimeters neutron scattering eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometers however direct observations of et are temporally discontinuous and horizontally inhomogeneous farahani et al 2007 pastorello et al 2020 therefore et modeling is required at both on site and regional scales in recent years a variety of remote sensing based et products have been developed such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mu et al 2011 global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress fisher et al 2020 however substantial uncertainty exists among these products owing to the different model algorithms model structures and inputs elnashar et al 2021 weerasinghe et al 2020 traditional methods such as bulk transfer energy balance based models and combination methods i e penman monteith still face challenges in accurately estimating et across a range of spatiotemporal scales allen et al 2013 gao et al 2012 rigden and salvucci 2015 salvucci and gentine 2013 sun et al 2019 these methods require several variables and model parameters including wind speed temperature humidity profiles vegetation characteristics and aerodynamic resistance which may induce large uncertainties in et estimation therefore an efficient et model with fewer variable inputs is required to fulfill the demands of diverse applications in recent years a novel approach based on the maximum entropy production mep theory has provided a new solution for et modeling wang and bras 2009 2011 the mep model was formulated by combining non equilibrium thermodynamics bayesian probability information theory and boundary layer turbulence theory the mep model parameterizes turbulent heat fluxes for a complete range of soil moisture contents and land cover conditions without relying on temperature humidity gradients wind speed and surface resistance el sharif et al 2019 the model has been successfully applied to estimate et at the site level hajji et al 2018 maheu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these applications demonstrated the efficiency of mep in estimating et over specific land surfaces however the model performance varied in different studies nevertheless studies focusing on evaluating the overall et across various land covers are lacking especially at a global scale the only attempt at a global study using the mep model was conducted by huang et al 2017 wherein the surface energy budgets were revisited however the study failed to verify the et because of the coarse spatial resolution and the 10 year temporal coverage that was insufficient to reveal long term et variations since currently derived global et estimates for the past decades vary in absolute values and trends brutsaert et al 2020 jung et al 2010 pascolini campbell et al 2021 rodell et al 2015 establishing a highly accurate long term global et product with finer spatial resolution is essential for understanding et variability the mep model offers a more efficient way to estimate et compared to classical methods such as penman penman monteith p m and iterative surface energy balance models which require more inputs el sharif et al 2019 owing to its advantages over traditional methods wider application of the mep model should be promoted which may be realized through an efficient and convenient new tool in recent years the open source r language has demonstrated significant skill in data processing statistical analysis mathematical modeling and visualization with the rapid rise in the use of r language in hydrology several r packages for modeling et have been developed guo et al 2016 silva et al 2019 slater et al 2019 therefore developing a new r package for the mep model will facilitate its implementation in this study we present an open source r package of the mep model named rmep to conduct a long term global analysis of et during 1978 2018 the framework of the rmep package and method descriptions are presented in section 2 followed by the data materials in section 3 multiple et datasets were utilized for evaluation including ec measurements gldas et products and satellite derived et products section 4 presents the mep derived global terrestrial et data validated using flux measurements under multiple land covers from which the long term et trend is analyzed section 5 discusses the et results followed by the conclusions presented in section 6 section 7 describes the availability and vignette of the rmep package 2 methodology 2 1 maximum entropy production mep method for estimating energy budgets the mep surface heat fluxes were solved by minimizing the dissipation function expressed in terms of latent sensible and ground heat fluxes under the constraint of the surface energy balance wang and bras 2009 2011 the dissipation function may be interpreted as a quantitative measure of the irreversibility of the non equilibrium land atmosphere interactive system based on the mep principle dewar and maritan 2014 it is an explicit function of the surface heat fluxes without referring to the temperature and moisture gradient the extremum solution of the monin obukhov similarity theory most formulates the thermal inertia parameters in dissipation as an analytical function of turbulent sensible heat flux without using the surface to air temperature gradient wang and bras 2009 unlike the traditional physical methods which calculate et merely using physical laws and processes the mep method predicts et from the perspective of what is the best prediction of energy partitioning of surface radiation based on the available information huang et al 2017 unlike the p m method which requires six input variables net radiation ground heat flux air temperature relative humidity wind speed and crop coefficients and surface resistance parameters the mep model is an input parsimonious method that requires only three input variables net radiation surface temperature and specific humidity and two simple parameters thermal inertia and the parameter z represents the reference height with robust values the latent heat le sensible heat h and ground heat g flux of the mep model over the land surface were derived as follows wang and bras 2011 1 1 b σ b σ σ i s i 0 h 1 6 h r n 2 le b σ h 3 g r n l e h 4 b σ 6 1 11 36 σ 1 5 σ λ 2 c p r v q s t s 2 where r n is the net radiation w m 2 q s is the surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and t s is the skin surface temperature k the downward and upward radiation fluxes were defined as positive and negative respectively the signs of le h and g were opposite to those of the radiation fluxes b σ is the reciprocal bowen ratio and σ is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the phase change at the evaporation surface other physical parameters include the latent heat

2009 parameter z in eq 5 represents the distance above the surface based on the most equation we determined and reclassified the z values for 20 different land covers according to the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification scheme the z values for different land cover types worldwide are provided in supplement s2 table s1 and fig s1 considering the heterogeneity of the land surface two versions of the mep model have been developed for modeling evaporation e s from the bare soil surface and transpiration e t from completely vegetated surfaces hajji et al 2018 isabelle et al 2021 e s was obtained by combining eqs 1 5 thus e s le λ b σ h λ over a completely vegetated surface the ground heat g in eq 3 is negligible at the leaf surface and the energy balance equation becomes r n h l e thus e t is calculated as follows 7 e t r n 1 b 1 σ s 1 λ 8 σ s η s λ 2 c p r v q s t s 2 effects of soil water stress on the stomata is considered in the mep transpiration version to correct the e t estimations under water limiting conditions hajji et al 2018 a water stress factor η s is included in σ of eq 5 which can be derived by the following empirical function 9 η s θ min 1 10 θ θ min 3 θ max θ min where θ max and θ min are the soil moisture at field capacity and wilting point respectively they were estimated by taking the 99th and 1st percentile of the long term soil water content time series ershadi et al 2014 η s represents the water availability for plants and varies from 0 to 1 thus the total et was obtained by combining the e s and e t through a vegetation index f veg hajji et al 2018 10 et 1 f veg e s f veg e t where the f veg index characterizes the fractional vegetation cover at the heterogeneous land surface and varies between 0 bare soil and 1 fully vegetated apart from the non transparent soil and vegetation covered surface other surfaces such as water ice and snow absorb solar radiation within a finite depth layer which is considered transparent to sunlight solar radiation entering the media vanishes over the land surface leading to the elimination of shortwave radiation on transparent surfaces the energy balance equation of the adjusted surface is as follows wang et al 2014 11 le h q r nl where r nl is the net longwave radiation difference between the downward and upward longwave radiation and q is the surface thermal energy flux of the water snow ice media the mep model predicted the le h and q according to eqs 1 5 by replacing g with q over the water snow ice surface 2 2 r package for facilitating mep model rmep the structure and main functions of the rmep package are illustrated in fig 1 it includes preprocessing mep calculation statistical analysis and visualization fig 1 direct measurements of surface specific humidity are rarely available and are approximated at different evaporating surfaces hajji et al 2018 isabelle et al 2021 for the bare soil surface the soil surface specific humidity was approximated as near surface air specific humidity q sa and the soil surface temperature was the surface skin temperature t ss for vegetation covered surfaces the leaf surface temperature was approximated as the near canopy air temperature t air and the specific humidity at the leaf surface was the near canopy air specific humidity the specific humidity was saturated for the water snow ice surface and was obtained as a function of t ss according to the clausius clapeyron equation wang et al 2014 in this study the specific humidity in the soil and vegetated surface was assumed to be equal to the q sa because of data unavailability site level analysis based on ec observation inputs showed that rmep modeling of et was highly consistent with the flux measurements in field research supplements s3 s4 fig s2 s4 and table s2 s3 therefore the rmep package was utilized to estimate the global et and heat fluxes in this study 2 3 trend analysis the widely applied nonparametric mann kendall mk method kendall 1975 mann 1945 is used to analyze the et trend in this study the mk method has the advantages of being distribution free robust to outliers and suitable for sequential variables with abnormal distributions encountered in hydrology and meteorology hess et al 2001 the slope of the et time series was estimated using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1950 which has been proven to be a robust method for estimating the slope magnitude of a trend jung et al 2010 detailed descriptions of the mk and theil sen methods can be found in dinpashoh 2011 the slopes of et trends are estimated using the theil sen estimator and tested at the 5 significance level p 0 05 using the mk method 2 4 model evaluation criteria model performance was quantified using the following

indicate the smaller error 3 data 3 1 mep forcing data the gldas dataset https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas combines satellite and ground based observations to generate reanalysis data for land surface state variables and surface heat fluxes li et al 2019 rodell et al 2004 previous studies on the assessment of gldas products have proven that global land surface temperature specific humidity and soil moisture variables are highly reliable dorigo et al 2012 ji et al 2015 qi et al 2015 the monthly dataset of nasa gldas version 2 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and was selected as the input for the mep model the dataset contains 36 variables with a 41 year temporal coverage from january 1978 to december 2018 the variables of net shortwave radiation flux net longwave radiation flux surface skin temperature air temperature at 2 m air specific humidity at 2 m and soil moisture 0 10 cm depth were used to drive the mep model the gldas noah land surface model lsm is a processed based model that computes the heat fluxes over soil and vegetation surfaces and has been used in the models of the national centers for environmental prediction and national center for atmospheric research rodell et al 2004 wang et al 2010b niu et al 2011 gldas noah has been widely used in previous studies and has shown promising results with surface flux measurements jaksa et al 2013 et sensible heat flux and ground heat flux data from the gldas noah product have been compared with the mep estimates of this study the gldas noah vegetation type data were used for land cover classification in this study rodell et al 2004 hansen et al 2000 it was obtained based on the 1 km resolution modis vegetation data mcd12q1 that uses a modified igbp classification scheme which includes 20 categories of classifications with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 fig s1 the long term glass fractional vegetation coverage fvc product available at https www glass umd edu download html was used to obtain the fractional vegetation cover jia et al 2016 the product was generated from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data and its reliability was extensively validated using high resolution satellite data and ground measurements jia et al 2019 the glass avhrr fvc data has a spatial resolution of 0 05 with a temporal resolution 8 days from to 1982 2018 to conform to gldas forcing the fvc data were resampled to 0 25 spatial resolution and averaged to the monthly temporal resolution the missing data before 1982 were assumed to be the same as in 1982 the specific input variables used to drive the mep model are presented in table 1 3 2 in situ ec data a monthly eddy covariance observed et dataset collected from ameriflux asiaflux euroflux and fluxnet flux systems has recently become available elnashar et al 2021 in this study a total of 475 different ec sites with monthly measurements are utilized for global et validations of mep estimates and the gldas product table 2 the monthly ec measurements temporally range from 1994 to 2018 and are spatially distributed globally including 14 land cover types according to igbp types it is noted that 431 out of 475 sites with measurement periods exceeds 10 months minimum time series length required by theil sen method are employed for validating et trends in section 4 3 4 results 4 1 estimating global terrestrial et during 1978 2018 performance of the rmep package in estimating long term et on a global scale was evaluated the mep estimate of global terrestrial without antarctica annual mean et is shown in fig 2 a using gldas and glass monthly inputs during 1978 2018 the mep estimated global terrestrial average annual et weighted by area is 517 9 mm yr 1 approximately 4 lower than 537 37 mm yr 1 of the gldas product fig 2b during 1978 2018 the global land average et estimated by mep is close to the estimates of ma et al 2021 500 mm yr 1 with antarctica by the complementary relationship method zhang et al 2016 538 mm yr 1 by the penman monteith leuning method and wang et al 2021 541 mm yr 1 by the budyko method and comparable to previous studies as listed in table 3 moreover the average annual global land et during 1982 2016 calculated from this study was 518 mm yr 1 and fell within the range of 365 700 mm yr 1 estimated from 12 mainstream et products for the same duration ma et al 2021 the latitudinal distribution of global et fig 3 showed that the mep estimated et was spatially consistent with the gldas et et of the gldas product was higher than the mep et at low latitude areas figs 2 and 3 especially in the tropical rainforests such as the amazon in south america african rainforest and indo malaysian rainforest formation fig s5 additionally the mep et is higher than that of the gldas at mid latitudes 10 40 and lower at low 0 10 and high 40 latitudes this inconsistency in spatial et patterns may be mainly due to the underestimation of et by the gldas noah land surface model in major deserts of the world e g sahara desert in northern africa at mid latitudes li et al 2022 while the low mep et at high latitudes is a consequence of low solar radiation and freezing surface temperature overall the mep showed a spatial pattern similar to that of the gldas and the differences mainly occurred in mid lower latitude areas likewise the mep estimated average annual global land et also displayed a spatial distribution similar to other studies brutsaert et al 2020 jung et al 2010 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 the global evaporation and transpiration were derived using the fvc to divide et by the mep model fig s6 the global terrestrial annual average evaporation during 1978 2018 was 270 mm yr 1 which is 9 greater than that for transpiration 247 mm yr 1 evaporation was relatively evenly distributed in space with higher values observed in eastern africa eastern south america and australia higher transpiration was mainly detected in the humid tropical rainforests such as the amazon and african rainforests fig 4 shows the monthly global land et variations fig 4a and table s4 for different land covers fig 4b and table s5 during the past four decades the decade 1999 2008 showed a lower et magnitude than the previous two decades suggesting that et decreased significantly during 1999 2008 across all land covers et was highest in evergreen broadleaf forest 1045 mm yr 1 savannas 902 mm yr 1 and woody savannas 899 mm yr 1 followed by dbf cnvm and cs and lower in the bgt and si during 1978 2018 the magnitudes of et over different land covers were generally comparable with those in previous studies ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2010 elnashar et al 2021 in which et was higher over evergreen broadleaf forest and savannas and lower over snow ice and bare ground the mep model generally provided reasonable et estimates for different land covers during 1978 2018 a new long term global land surface energy budget analysis for 1978 2018 was also provided by the mep model the mep estimated global annual mean terrestrial sensible heat and ground heat flux were comparable with the gldas product fig s7 and s8 the mep global terrestrial annual mean h during 1978 2018 was 33 w m 2 comparable to 37 w m 2 from the gldas product for the same duration the spatial pattern in fig s7 shows that the mep h was lower in north america africa mainland asia and australia but higher in northern south america and southeast asia compared to gldas the mep estimated global annual mean g was 15 w m 2 more than the value of 0 4 w m 2 from the gldas product fig s8 and the difference was significant in northern africa western asia and australia 4 2 validation of mep estimates with ec sites fig 5 shows the performances of the mep model and gldas products in estimating global et which were validated by 475 ec flux sites under 14 different land cover types during the study period the mep model generally outperformed the gldas product for the globally distributed ec values the mep model obtained a more accurate et estimate with smaller rmse 26 99 mm me 5 30 mm pbias 11 80 and higher correlation r 0 73 compared to that of gldas rmse 31 87 mm me 6 00 mm pbias 13 30 and r 0 69 validated using ec measurements based on the me sign mep underestimated et while gldas overestimated it fig 5 elnashar et al 2021 evaluated the performance of 12 mainstream global et products including pml gleam mod16a2 ssebop sebs gldas and fldas etc against monthly observations from extensive ec sites and showed that the me of all 12 products was 9 48 11 43 mm rmse was 26 03 35 36 mm r was 0 59 0 76 and regression slope was 0 54 0 84 therefore the mep model was able to produce accurate et estimations compared with other mainstream global et products the performance of mep et across different land covers was evaluated against ec measurements fig 6 where r was 0 53 0 82 and rmse was 17 87 41 17 mm mon 1 specifically mep showed the highest r value in dbf and ws and lowest in os land covers the lowest rmse was observed in dnf and the highest in pw to further compare the mep and gldas estimated et for each land cover type the gldas performance against ec fig s9 and their rmse values were calculated fig s10 where r was 0 48 0 82 and rmse was 19 99 45 79 mm mon 1 for all land covers by gldas based on the rmse values it is evident that the mep model outperformed gldas for enf ebf dnf dbf mf pw and cro land covers especially across forestland biomes a comparable performance was shown for cs ws sav and gra land covers between mep and gldas whereas mep showed a higher rmse for the os land cover no single et method is believed to provide the best results for all land covers ma et al 2021 however the mep model performs better at densely vegetated surfaces such as tropical rainforests xu et al 2019 and well watered wetland surfaces while showing greater deviation at short vegetation surfaces such as shrublands this is possibly due to the underestimation of the leaf surface temperature in short vegetation surfaces which is performed by approximating the air temperature that leads to an underestimation of et mep showed better et performance in the cropland compared to that of gldas indicating that the former can better adapt to changing crop types and extents cai et al 2014 with the expansion of cropland area owing to the increasing population the mep model was shown to be capable of characterizing the water consumption of crops under impact of human activity 4 3 trend of global terrestrial et over the past 41 years the global annual terrestrial et trend by mep and gldas during 1978 2018 was calculated using theil sen s method combined with the mk method p 0 05 fig 7 approximately 76 of global areas showed a significant et trend by the mep of which 35 were positive and 65 were negative spatially et increased mostly in humid regions such as south america especially northern amazon africa especially southern region southeast asia india australia and northeast america while the majority of decreasing trends were detected in the mainland asia north america and mid africa a similar pattern of global land et trends has also been reported in previous studies zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2021 from 1978 to 2018 the global land et calculated by mep declined slightly at a rate of 0 15 mm yr 2 area weighted average of all grid cells with no significant trend however gldas et displayed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 2 78 mm yr 2 fig 7b compared with zhang et al 2016 and zeng et al 2014 a significantly higher positive trend in south america australia mainland asia and north america was observed using gldas additionally small changes in et at high latitude areas of the northern hemisphere jung et al 2010 zeng et al 2012 ma et al 2021 were consistent with the values obtained from mep fig 7a however a significantly larger trend was revealed by gldas in the northern hemisphere which may have been highly overestimated the spatial pattern of seasonal et changes was similar to that of the annual change fig s11 the summer season showed a greater positive trend than the other seasons especially in the northern amazon eastern north america and australia et trends derived from mep were evaluated using monthly flux et trends at 431 ec sites within the same measurement period a good linear relationship was observed between mep and observed et trends with r 0 71 and rmse 0 84 mm mon 2 fig 8 which outperformed the trend derived by gldas r 0 64 and rmse 1 07 mm mon 2 a total of 213 49 ec sites and 224 52 grids of mep results showed spatially positive et trends fig s12 the pattern of increased and decreased et trends obtained by mep was in close agreement with the observed spatial trends in quantity and direction especially for sites located in north america africa and europe 5 discussion 5 1 change in the global terrestrial et trends trends in global terrestrial et have been ambiguous over the past few decades and no consistent conclusion has been reached most studies have reported an increasing trend pascolini campbell et al 2021 brutsaert 2017 zhang et al 2015 miralles et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 while others have reported a decreasing trend jung et al 2010 yang et al 2019 the mep derived global land et showed an insignificant decreasing trend 0 15 mm yr 2 during 1978 2018 and a prominently declining trend was observed in the past two decades the mep derived global et increased by 0 09 mm yr 2 during 1978 1998 after which it declined by 0 36 mm yr 2 during 1999 2018 fig s13 this decreasing trend is consistent with the results of previous studies jung et al 2010 bosilovich et al 2011 zeng et al 2014 jung et al 2010 indicated that the global terrestrial et stopped increasing after 1998 due to limited moisture supply sharing a similar pattern with the mep et trends during the same period furthermore bosilovich et al 2011 concluded that global et increased slightly from 1979 to 1998 but a decreasing trend was observed during 1998 2008 by the merra product based on an estimate of the wb mte model zeng et al 2014 also showed that the increase in global terrestrial et stopped since 1998 therefore the et trend obtained by the mep supports the result that global et growth has stalled in the past two decades which was mainly due to decreasing evaporation over the past 41 years fig s14 transpiration showed a notable increase at a rate of 0 43 mm yr 2 p 0 01 during 1978 2018 which is consistent with the theory that transpiration would increase with increasing vegetation over the past decades wang et al 2021 however the significantly decreasing trend of evaporation at a rate of 0 55 mm yr 2 p 0 01 counteracted the effect of increasing transpiration and led to an insignificant trend of et interestingly the continents with higher lower et values generally displayed a larger increasing decreasing trend across global land fig s15 for example south america with the highest average et 918 mm yr 1 showed the largest increasing trend 1 26 mm yr 2 while asia and north america with lower et values showed a larger decreasing trend this phenomenon was also reflected in the spatial patterns figs 2 and 7 it was projected that by the end of the century south america and africa will become risk hotspot regions with increasing droughts and floods owing to an increase in et and decrease in precipitation tabari et al 2021 meanwhile the drought risk mainly decreased in high latitude areas which was consistent with the decreased et trend obtained by mep for the northern hemisphere e g canada russia therefore since the amplitude of changes in et would strongly impact the risk of drought and flood mep et could provide evidence for global risk analysis under future global warming 5 2 advantages and further applications of rmep the traditional p m method requires at least six input variables to estimate et however the mep requires fewer inputs and ground heat flux wind speed and surface resistance parameters which are rarely accessible in remote or data sparse regions are not required el sharif et al 2019 the gldas noah et is derived based on the p m method cai et al 2014 niu et al 2011 wang et al 2010b whereas the mep provided a more accurate actual et estimation as validated with extensive ec measurements fig 5 using more parsimonious inputs than the contemporary p m based methods in summary the mep model accurately estimated et under a wide range of land covers and required fewer inputs than the highly parameterized gldas lsm which can reduce the uncertainties in the model input the presented rmep package facilitated the implementation of the mep model as it simulated et and surface heat fluxes simultaneously the rmep package can be used to retrieve regional et by combining remote sensing data and enabling more comparisons with other global et products for example further et assessments can be implemented by comparison with other mainstream et products such as modis gleam and ecostress across different land cover types the rmep provides a new global tool for the agricultural community as only two highly available remote sensing inputs net radiation and surface temperature are required to model potential et which can be applied to irrigation scheduling and water saving technologies sun et al 2021 moreover rmep can also be used to characterize crop growth with the produced et which can be incorporated into crop models such as aquacrop heng et al 2007 further research should focus on the calculation of et in the rmep package during the snowmelt process 5 3 uncertainties the mep estimated h 33 7 w m 2 during 2001 2010 was similar to that of huang et al 2017 within the same period 33 w m 2 who concluded an interval ranging from 27 to 51 w m 2 with eight different products for a longer temporal coverage the mep h 31 7 w m 2 in this study during 1979 2008 was slightly lower than the estimate of 33 5 w m 2 by merra during the same period bosilovich et al 2011 reflecting that the mep h estimate was consistent with previous studies the ground heat flux g calculated by mep was estimated to be 16 w m 2 during 2001 2010 which can be compared with the value of 12 10 w m 2 reported by huang et al 2017 for the same period and the exclusion of antarctica may account for the overestimation in this study because studies have indicated that the global near zero g value was underestimated and may not represent the realistic thermal energy budget koster et al 2000 the new estimate of g in this study may serve as a reference in the global terrestrial surface energy budget scheme this study used the near surface air specific humidity to approximate the leaf surface specific humidity which was limited by the unavailability of measurements within the canopy given that the air specific humidity would be underestimated compared to that of the leaf surface the et may have been be slightly underestimated for vegetated surfaces additionally the distinct discrepancy in spatial scales between the ec towers and gridded et estimates can also introduce uncertainties and biases in validating et and associated trends the ec flux tower domain areas range from hundreds of meters to kilometers while the area represented by gridded et is much larger than the flux tower footprint consequently the disagreement between the estimates and measurements may be explained by the land cover heterogeneity around the ec sites although attempts have been made to upscale from the site level to the regional scale jung et al 2009 uncertainties in et still remain therefore developing a global et dataset with finer spatial resolution based on mep may be a satisfactory solution to address this dilemma moreover the ratio of transpiration to total et t et at the global scale has long been debated with large uncertainties coenders gerrits et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 reported that t et ranges between 35 and 90 based on different approaches i e isotopes sap flow measurements satellite data and land surface models transpiration estimated by mep accounts for 47 of et in the section 4 1 falls in the uncertainty range reported by miralles et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 i e 42 9 74 9 however our estimate is close to the lower bound of these uncertainty ranges after applying an emergent constraint approach lian et al 2018 found that the ensemble mean of t et in the cmip5 earth system models esms increased from 0 41 0 11 to 0 62 0 06 therefore one of our central focus to further improve the mep et in the future can be to apply the isotope approach to constrain t et this will help further increase our confidence in estimating the global et trend 6 conclusions this study verified the capability of the mep model to estimate global land et across a wide range of land cover types fractional vegetation and water stress were coupled into the mep model to estimate a new long term global terrestrial et during 1978 2018 with monthly inputs from the gldas dataset the mep derived global terrestrial et was 517 9 mm yr 1 which was validated from 475 ec flux sites showing that mep estimated et was in good agreement with monthly observations me 5 30 mm rmse 26 99 mm and r 0 74 and outperformed that of gldas et especially across all forestlands wetlands and cropland land covers the global land mep et showed an insignificant decrease 0 15 mm yr 2 during 1978 2018 and kept declining at a rate of 0 36 mm yr 2 during 1999 2018 the mep derived et trends agreed well with the observed et trends from 431 flux sites indicating the reliability of the former with respect to the spatial pattern of et changes terrestrial et increased significantly in south america africa india and australia and decreased in asia north america and mid africa this study provided a long term 41 years global terrestrial et estimate the mep modeled results were validated through abundant ec measurements under a variety of land covers and the application of the mep model on a global scale was verified the seasonal decadal and annual global et changes during 1978 2018 were derived based on the mep et product and a decreasing trend was observed over the past two decades which was contrary to the theory that et will increase due to the warming climate the newly developed rmep package accurately modeled the global et and more widespread applications may include estimating regional actual and potential et simulating crop growth by incorporating rmep into crop models and coupling with land surface models or hydrological models for water cycle research in summary the mep based et product improved global et accuracy compared to the gldas product and can be used for water resource management drought assessment water use efficiency evaluation and global climate change analysis 7 software

2778,an accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is vital for understanding the global hydrological cycle however large uncertainties in the present global et products originate from the distinct model structures assumptions and inputs the maximum entropy production mep model provides a novel method for modeling et based on parsimonious inputs and energy conservation in this study an r package for mep rmep was presented to facilitate mep model implementation based on rmep a global et analysis was conducted using inputs from the global land data assimilation system gldas and global land surface satellite glass products during 1978 2018 and the mann kendall and theil sen s methods were employed to detect the et trends the mep estimated average annual global land et was 517 mm yr 1 during 1978 2018 and showed a close agreement with eddy covariance ec measurements from 475 flux sites with a correlation coefficient of 0 74 and root mean square error of 26 99 mm mon 1 the overall performance of mep was evaluated across various land covers and a higher et accuracy was revealed for forestlands wetlands and cropland land covers the mep derived et trend corresponded well with the ec observed et trend and the results indicated that the global land et declined continuously during 1999 2018 overall the mep model provided an accurate et estimate with parsimonious inputs which outperformed the gldas noah et product and can serve as a global analytical method for the hydrological cycle and climate change keywords evapotranspiration maximum entropy production et trend eddy covariance r package data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a significant component of the global hydrological and energy cycle reflecting water exchange between land and atmosphere pascolini campbell et al 2021 an accurate estimation of et is required in numerous engineering applications such as agriculture and water resource management fisher et al 2017 sun et al 2022 yang et al 2021 et is also important for predicting species richness and plant productivity fisher et al 2011 however it is the most difficult component to measure in the hydrological cycle lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 progress has been made in monitoring techniques over the past decades including lysimeters neutron scattering eddy covariance ec and large aperture scintillometers however direct observations of et are temporally discontinuous and horizontally inhomogeneous farahani et al 2007 pastorello et al 2020 therefore et modeling is required at both on site and regional scales in recent years a variety of remote sensing based et products have been developed such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis mu et al 2011 global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress fisher et al 2020 however substantial uncertainty exists among these products owing to the different model algorithms model structures and inputs elnashar et al 2021 weerasinghe et al 2020 traditional methods such as bulk transfer energy balance based models and combination methods i e penman monteith still face challenges in accurately estimating et across a range of spatiotemporal scales allen et al 2013 gao et al 2012 rigden and salvucci 2015 salvucci and gentine 2013 sun et al 2019 these methods require several variables and model parameters including wind speed temperature humidity profiles vegetation characteristics and aerodynamic resistance which may induce large uncertainties in et estimation therefore an efficient et model with fewer variable inputs is required to fulfill the demands of diverse applications in recent years a novel approach based on the maximum entropy production mep theory has provided a new solution for et modeling wang and bras 2009 2011 the mep model was formulated by combining non equilibrium thermodynamics bayesian probability information theory and boundary layer turbulence theory the mep model parameterizes turbulent heat fluxes for a complete range of soil moisture contents and land cover conditions without relying on temperature humidity gradients wind speed and surface resistance el sharif et al 2019 the model has been successfully applied to estimate et at the site level hajji et al 2018 maheu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these applications demonstrated the efficiency of mep in estimating et over specific land surfaces however the model performance varied in different studies nevertheless studies focusing on evaluating the overall et across various land covers are lacking especially at a global scale the only attempt at a global study using the mep model was conducted by huang et al 2017 wherein the surface energy budgets were revisited however the study failed to verify the et because of the coarse spatial resolution and the 10 year temporal coverage that was insufficient to reveal long term et variations since currently derived global et estimates for the past decades vary in absolute values and trends brutsaert et al 2020 jung et al 2010 pascolini campbell et al 2021 rodell et al 2015 establishing a highly accurate long term global et product with finer spatial resolution is essential for understanding et variability the mep model offers a more efficient way to estimate et compared to classical methods such as penman penman monteith p m and iterative surface energy balance models which require more inputs el sharif et al 2019 owing to its advantages over traditional methods wider application of the mep model should be promoted which may be realized through an efficient and convenient new tool in recent years the open source r language has demonstrated significant skill in data processing statistical analysis mathematical modeling and visualization with the rapid rise in the use of r language in hydrology several r packages for modeling et have been developed guo et al 2016 silva et al 2019 slater et al 2019 therefore developing a new r package for the mep model will facilitate its implementation in this study we present an open source r package of the mep model named rmep to conduct a long term global analysis of et during 1978 2018 the framework of the rmep package and method descriptions are presented in section 2 followed by the data materials in section 3 multiple et datasets were utilized for evaluation including ec measurements gldas et products and satellite derived et products section 4 presents the mep derived global terrestrial et data validated using flux measurements under multiple land covers from which the long term et trend is analyzed section 5 discusses the et results followed by the conclusions presented in section 6 section 7 describes the availability and vignette of the rmep package 2 methodology 2 1 maximum entropy production mep method for estimating energy budgets the mep surface heat fluxes were solved by minimizing the dissipation function expressed in terms of latent sensible and ground heat fluxes under the constraint of the surface energy balance wang and bras 2009 2011 the dissipation function may be interpreted as a quantitative measure of the irreversibility of the non equilibrium land atmosphere interactive system based on the mep principle dewar and maritan 2014 it is an explicit function of the surface heat fluxes without referring to the temperature and moisture gradient the extremum solution of the monin obukhov similarity theory most formulates the thermal inertia parameters in dissipation as an analytical function of turbulent sensible heat flux without using the surface to air temperature gradient wang and bras 2009 unlike the traditional physical methods which calculate et merely using physical laws and processes the mep method predicts et from the perspective of what is the best prediction of energy partitioning of surface radiation based on the available information huang et al 2017 unlike the p m method which requires six input variables net radiation ground heat flux air temperature relative humidity wind speed and crop coefficients and surface resistance parameters the mep model is an input parsimonious method that requires only three input variables net radiation surface temperature and specific humidity and two simple parameters thermal inertia and the parameter z represents the reference height with robust values the latent heat le sensible heat h and ground heat g flux of the mep model over the land surface were derived as follows wang and bras 2011 1 1 b σ b σ σ i s i 0 h 1 6 h r n 2 le b σ h 3 g r n l e h 4 b σ 6 1 11 36 σ 1 5 σ λ 2 c p r v q s t s 2 where r n is the net radiation w m 2 q s is the surface specific humidity kg kg 1 and t s is the skin surface temperature k the downward and upward radiation fluxes were defined as positive and negative respectively the signs of le h and g were opposite to those of the radiation fluxes b σ is the reciprocal bowen ratio and σ is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the phase change at the evaporation surface other physical parameters include the latent heat

above the surface according to vegetation cover m and c 1 and c 2 are two empirical constants representing the stability of the wind speed and temperature profiles in the surface layer wang and bras 2009 parameter z in eq 5 represents the distance above the surface based on the most equation we determined and reclassified the z values for 20 different land covers according to the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification scheme the z values for different land cover types worldwide are provided in supplement s2 table s1 and fig s1 considering the heterogeneity of the land surface two versions of the mep model have been developed for modeling evaporation e s from the bare soil surface and transpiration e t from completely vegetated surfaces hajji et al 2018 isabelle et al 2021 e s was obtained by combining eqs 1 5 thus e s le λ b σ h λ over a completely vegetated surface the ground heat g in eq 3 is negligible at the leaf surface and the energy balance equation becomes r n h l e thus e t is calculated as follows 7 e t r n 1 b 1 σ s 1 λ 8 σ s η s λ 2 c p r v q s t s 2 effects of soil water stress on the stomata is considered in the mep transpiration version to correct the e t estimations under water limiting conditions hajji et al 2018 a water stress factor η s is included in σ of eq 5 which can be derived by the following empirical function 9 η s θ min 1 10 θ θ min 3 θ max θ min where θ max and θ min are the soil moisture at field capacity and wilting point respectively they were estimated by taking the 99th and 1st percentile of the long term soil water content time series ershadi et al 2014 η s represents the water availability for plants and varies from 0 to 1 thus the total et was obtained by combining the e s and e t through a vegetation index f veg hajji et al 2018 10 et 1 f veg e s f veg e t where the f veg index characterizes the fractional vegetation cover at the heterogeneous land surface and varies between 0 bare soil and 1 fully vegetated apart from the non transparent soil and vegetation covered surface other surfaces such as water ice and snow absorb solar radiation within a finite depth layer which is considered transparent to sunlight solar radiation entering the media vanishes over the land surface leading to the elimination of shortwave radiation on transparent surfaces the energy balance equation of the adjusted surface is as follows wang et al 2014 11 le h q r nl where r nl is the net longwave radiation difference between the downward and upward longwave radiation and q is the surface thermal energy flux of the water snow ice media the mep model predicted the le h and q according to eqs 1 5 by replacing g with q over the water snow ice surface 2 2 r package for facilitating mep model rmep the structure and main functions of the rmep package are illustrated in fig 1 it includes preprocessing mep calculation statistical analysis and visualization fig 1 direct measurements of surface specific humidity are rarely available and are approximated at different evaporating surfaces hajji et al 2018 isabelle et al 2021 for the bare soil surface the soil surface specific humidity was approximated as near surface air specific humidity q sa and the soil surface temperature was the surface skin temperature t ss for vegetation covered surfaces the leaf surface temperature was approximated as the near canopy air temperature t air and the specific humidity at the leaf surface was the near canopy air specific humidity the specific humidity was saturated for the water snow ice surface and was obtained as a function of t ss according to the clausius clapeyron equation wang et al 2014 in this study the specific humidity in the soil and vegetated surface was assumed to be equal to the q sa because of data unavailability site level analysis based on ec observation inputs showed that rmep modeling of et was highly consistent with the flux measurements in field research supplements s3 s4 fig s2 s4 and table s2 s3 therefore the rmep package was utilized to estimate the global et and heat fluxes in this study 2 3 trend analysis the widely applied nonparametric mann kendall mk method kendall 1975 mann 1945 is used to analyze the et trend in this study the mk method has the advantages of being distribution free robust to outliers and suitable for sequential variables with abnormal distributions encountered in hydrology and meteorology hess et al 2001 the slope of the et time series was estimated using the theil sen method sen 1968 theil 1950 which has been proven to be a robust method for estimating the slope magnitude of a trend jung et al 2010 detailed descriptions of the mk and theil sen methods can be found in dinpashoh 2011 the slopes of et trends are estimated using the theil sen estimator and tested at the 5 significance level p 0 05 using the mk method 2 4 model evaluation criteria model performance was quantified using the following

state variables and surface heat fluxes li et al 2019 rodell et al 2004 previous studies on the assessment of gldas products have proven that global land surface temperature specific humidity and soil moisture variables are highly reliable dorigo et al 2012 ji et al 2015 qi et al 2015 the monthly dataset of nasa gldas version 2 gldas 2 0 and gldas 2 1 has a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 and was selected as the input for the mep model the dataset contains 36 variables with a 41 year temporal coverage from january 1978 to december 2018 the variables of net shortwave radiation flux net longwave radiation flux surface skin temperature air temperature at 2 m air specific humidity at 2 m and soil moisture 0 10 cm depth were used to drive the mep model the gldas noah land surface model lsm is a processed based model that computes the heat fluxes over soil and vegetation surfaces and has been used in the models of the national centers for environmental prediction and national center for atmospheric research rodell et al 2004 wang et al 2010b niu et al 2011 gldas noah has been widely used in previous studies and has shown promising results with surface flux measurements jaksa et al 2013 et sensible heat flux and ground heat flux data from the gldas noah product have been compared with the mep estimates of this study the gldas noah vegetation type data were used for land cover classification in this study rodell et al 2004 hansen et al 2000 it was obtained based on the 1 km resolution modis vegetation data mcd12q1 that uses a modified igbp classification scheme which includes 20 categories of classifications with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 fig s1 the long term glass fractional vegetation coverage fvc product available at https www glass umd edu download html was used to obtain the fractional vegetation cover jia et al 2016 the product was generated from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data and its reliability was extensively validated using high resolution satellite data and ground measurements jia et al 2019 the glass avhrr fvc data has a spatial resolution of 0 05 with a temporal resolution 8 days from to 1982 2018 to conform to gldas forcing the fvc data were resampled to 0 25 spatial resolution and averaged to the monthly temporal resolution the missing data before 1982 were assumed to be the same as in 1982 the specific input variables used to drive the mep model are presented in table 1 3 2 in situ ec data a monthly eddy covariance observed et dataset collected from ameriflux asiaflux euroflux and fluxnet flux systems has recently become available elnashar et al 2021 in this study a total of 475 different ec sites with monthly measurements are utilized for global et validations of mep estimates and the gldas product table 2 the monthly ec measurements temporally range from 1994 to 2018 and are spatially distributed globally including 14 land cover types according to igbp types it is noted that 431 out of 475 sites with measurement periods exceeds 10 months minimum time series length required by theil sen method are employed for validating et trends in section 4 3 4 results 4 1 estimating global terrestrial et during 1978 2018 performance of the rmep package in estimating long term et on a global scale was evaluated the mep estimate of global terrestrial without antarctica annual mean et is shown in fig 2 a using gldas and glass monthly inputs during 1978 2018 the mep estimated global terrestrial average annual et weighted by area is 517 9 mm yr 1 approximately 4 lower than 537 37 mm yr 1 of the gldas product fig 2b during 1978 2018 the global land average et estimated by mep is close to the estimates of ma et al 2021 500 mm yr 1 with antarctica by the complementary relationship method zhang et al 2016 538 mm yr 1 by the penman monteith leuning method and wang et al 2021 541 mm yr 1 by the budyko method and comparable to previous studies as listed in table 3 moreover the average annual global land et during 1982 2016 calculated from this study was 518 mm yr 1 and fell within the range of 365 700 mm yr 1 estimated from 12 mainstream et products for the same duration ma et al 2021 the latitudinal distribution of global et fig 3 showed that the mep estimated et was spatially consistent with the gldas et et of the gldas product was higher than the mep et at low latitude areas figs 2 and 3 especially in the tropical rainforests such as the amazon in south america african rainforest and indo malaysian rainforest formation fig s5 additionally the mep et is higher than that of the gldas at mid latitudes 10 40 and lower at low 0 10 and high 40 latitudes this inconsistency in spatial et patterns may be mainly due to the underestimation of et by the gldas noah land surface model in major deserts of the world e g sahara desert in northern africa at mid latitudes li et al 2022 while the low mep et at high latitudes is a consequence of low solar radiation and freezing surface temperature overall the mep showed a spatial pattern similar to that of the gldas and the differences mainly occurred in mid lower latitude areas likewise the mep estimated average annual global land et also displayed a spatial distribution similar to other studies brutsaert et al 2020 jung et al 2010 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 the global evaporation and transpiration were derived using the fvc to divide et by the mep model fig s6 the global terrestrial annual average evaporation during 1978 2018 was 270 mm yr 1 which is 9 greater than that for transpiration 247 mm yr 1 evaporation was relatively evenly distributed in space with higher values observed in eastern africa eastern south america and australia higher transpiration was mainly detected in the humid tropical rainforests such as the amazon and african rainforests fig 4 shows the monthly global land et variations fig 4a and table s4 for different land covers fig 4b and table s5 during the past four decades the decade 1999 2008 showed a lower et magnitude than the previous two decades suggesting that et decreased significantly during 1999 2008 across all land covers et was highest in evergreen broadleaf forest 1045 mm yr 1 savannas 902 mm yr 1 and woody savannas 899 mm yr 1 followed by dbf cnvm and cs and lower in the bgt and si during 1978 2018 the magnitudes of et over different land covers were generally comparable with those in previous studies ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2010 elnashar et al 2021 in which et was higher over evergreen broadleaf forest and savannas and lower over snow ice and bare ground the mep model generally provided reasonable et estimates for different land covers during 1978 2018 a new long term global land surface energy budget analysis for 1978 2018 was also provided by the mep model the mep estimated global annual mean terrestrial sensible heat and ground heat flux were comparable with the gldas product fig s7 and s8 the mep global terrestrial annual mean h during 1978 2018 was 33 w m 2 comparable to 37 w m 2 from the gldas product for the same duration the spatial pattern in fig s7 shows that the mep h was lower in north america africa mainland asia and australia but higher in northern south america and southeast asia compared to gldas the mep estimated global annual mean g was 15 w m 2 more than the value of 0 4 w m 2 from the gldas product fig s8 and the difference was significant in northern africa western asia and australia 4 2 validation of mep estimates with ec sites fig 5 shows the performances of the mep model and gldas products in estimating global et which were validated by 475 ec flux sites under 14 different land cover types during the study period the mep model generally outperformed the gldas product for the globally distributed ec values the mep model obtained a more accurate et estimate with smaller rmse 26 99 mm me 5 30 mm pbias 11 80 and higher correlation r 0 73 compared to that of gldas rmse 31 87 mm me 6 00 mm pbias 13 30 and r 0 69 validated using ec measurements based on the me sign mep underestimated et while gldas overestimated it fig 5 elnashar et al 2021 evaluated the performance of 12 mainstream global et products including pml gleam mod16a2 ssebop sebs gldas and fldas etc against monthly observations from extensive ec sites and showed that the me of all 12 products was 9 48 11 43 mm rmse was 26 03 35 36 mm r was 0 59 0 76 and regression slope was 0 54 0 84 therefore the mep model was able to produce accurate et estimations compared with other mainstream global et products the performance of mep et across different land covers was evaluated against ec measurements fig 6 where r was 0 53 0 82 and rmse was 17 87 41 17 mm mon 1 specifically mep showed the highest r value in dbf and ws and lowest in os land covers the lowest rmse was observed in dnf and the highest in pw to further compare the mep and gldas estimated et for each land cover type the gldas performance against ec fig s9 and their rmse values were calculated fig s10 where r was 0 48 0 82 and rmse was 19 99 45 79 mm mon 1 for all land covers by gldas based on the rmse values it is evident that the mep model outperformed gldas for enf ebf dnf dbf mf pw and cro land covers especially across forestland biomes a comparable performance was shown for cs ws sav and gra land covers between mep and gldas whereas mep showed a higher rmse for the os land cover no single et method is believed to provide the best results for all land covers ma et al 2021 however the mep model performs better at densely vegetated surfaces such as tropical rainforests xu et al 2019 and well watered wetland surfaces while showing greater deviation at short vegetation surfaces such as shrublands this is possibly due to the underestimation of the leaf surface temperature in short vegetation surfaces which is performed by approximating the air temperature that leads to an underestimation of et mep showed better et performance in the cropland compared to that of gldas indicating that the former can better adapt to changing crop types and extents cai et al 2014 with the expansion of cropland area owing to the increasing population the mep model was shown to be capable of characterizing the water consumption of crops under impact of human activity 4 3 trend of global terrestrial et over the past 41 years the global annual terrestrial et trend by mep and gldas during 1978 2018 was calculated using theil sen s method combined with the mk method p 0 05 fig 7 approximately 76 of global areas showed a significant et trend by the mep of which 35 were positive and 65 were negative spatially et increased mostly in humid regions such as south america especially northern amazon africa especially southern region southeast asia india australia and northeast america while the majority of decreasing trends were detected in the mainland asia north america and mid africa a similar pattern of global land et trends has also been reported in previous studies zeng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2021 from 1978 to 2018 the global land et calculated by mep declined slightly at a rate of 0 15 mm yr 2 area weighted average of all grid cells with no significant trend however gldas et displayed a significant increasing trend at a rate of 2 78 mm yr 2 fig 7b compared with zhang et al 2016 and zeng et al 2014 a significantly higher positive trend in south america australia mainland asia and north america was observed using gldas additionally small changes in et at high latitude areas of the northern hemisphere jung et al 2010 zeng et al 2012 ma et al 2021 were consistent with the values obtained from mep fig 7a however a significantly larger trend was revealed by gldas in the northern hemisphere which may have been highly overestimated the spatial pattern of seasonal et changes was similar to that of the annual change fig s11 the summer season showed a greater positive trend than the other seasons especially in the northern amazon eastern north america and australia et trends derived from mep were evaluated using monthly flux et trends at 431 ec sites within the same measurement period a good linear relationship was observed between mep and observed et trends with r 0 71 and rmse 0 84 mm mon 2 fig 8 which outperformed the trend derived by gldas r 0 64 and rmse 1 07 mm mon 2 a total of 213 49 ec sites and 224 52 grids of mep results showed spatially positive et trends fig s12 the pattern of increased and decreased et trends obtained by mep was in close agreement with the observed spatial trends in quantity and direction especially for sites located in north america africa and europe 5 discussion 5 1 change in the global terrestrial et trends trends in global terrestrial et have been ambiguous over the past few decades and no consistent conclusion has been reached most studies have reported an increasing trend pascolini campbell et al 2021 brutsaert 2017 zhang et al 2015 miralles et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 while others have reported a decreasing trend jung et al 2010 yang et al 2019 the mep derived global land et showed an insignificant decreasing trend 0 15 mm yr 2 during 1978 2018 and a prominently declining trend was observed in the past two decades the mep derived global et increased by 0 09 mm yr 2 during 1978 1998 after which it declined by 0 36 mm yr 2 during 1999 2018 fig s13 this decreasing trend is consistent with the results of previous studies jung et al 2010 bosilovich et al 2011 zeng et al 2014 jung et al 2010 indicated that the global terrestrial et stopped increasing after 1998 due to limited moisture supply sharing a similar pattern with the mep et trends during the same period furthermore bosilovich et al 2011 concluded that global et increased slightly from 1979 to 1998 but a decreasing trend was observed during 1998 2008 by the merra product based on an estimate of the wb mte model zeng et al 2014 also showed that the increase in global terrestrial et stopped since 1998 therefore the et trend obtained by the mep supports the result that global et growth has stalled in the past two decades which was mainly due to decreasing evaporation over the past 41 years fig s14 transpiration showed a notable increase at a rate of 0 43 mm yr 2 p 0 01 during 1978 2018 which is consistent with the theory that transpiration would increase with increasing vegetation over the past decades wang et al 2021 however the significantly decreasing trend of evaporation at a rate of 0 55 mm yr 2 p 0 01 counteracted the effect of increasing transpiration and led to an insignificant trend of et interestingly the continents with higher lower et values generally displayed a larger increasing decreasing trend across global land fig s15 for example south america with the highest average et 918 mm yr 1 showed the largest increasing trend 1 26 mm yr 2 while asia and north america with lower et values showed a larger decreasing trend this phenomenon was also reflected in the spatial patterns figs 2 and 7 it was projected that by the end of the century south america and africa will become risk hotspot regions with increasing droughts and floods owing to an increase in et and decrease in precipitation tabari et al 2021 meanwhile the drought risk mainly decreased in high latitude areas which was consistent with the decreased et trend obtained by mep for the northern hemisphere e g canada russia therefore since the amplitude of changes in et would strongly impact the risk of drought and flood mep et could provide evidence for global risk analysis under future global warming 5 2 advantages and further applications of rmep the traditional p m method requires at least six input variables to estimate et however the mep requires fewer inputs and ground heat flux wind speed and surface resistance parameters which are rarely accessible in remote or data sparse regions are not required el sharif et al 2019 the gldas noah et is derived based on the p m method cai et al 2014 niu et al 2011 wang et al 2010b whereas the mep provided a more accurate actual et estimation as validated with extensive ec measurements fig 5 using more parsimonious inputs than the contemporary p m based methods in summary the mep model accurately estimated et under a wide range of land covers and required fewer inputs than the highly parameterized gldas lsm which can reduce the uncertainties in the model input the presented rmep package facilitated the implementation of the mep model as it simulated et and surface heat fluxes simultaneously the rmep package can be used to retrieve regional et by combining remote sensing data and enabling more comparisons with other global et products for example further et assessments can be implemented by comparison with other mainstream et products such as modis gleam and ecostress across different land cover types the rmep provides a new global tool for the agricultural community as only two highly available remote sensing inputs net radiation and surface temperature are required to model potential et which can be applied to irrigation scheduling and water saving technologies sun et al 2021 moreover rmep can also be used to characterize crop growth with the produced et which can be incorporated into crop models such as aquacrop heng et al 2007 further research should focus on the calculation of et in the rmep package during the snowmelt process 5 3 uncertainties the mep estimated h 33 7 w m 2 during 2001 2010 was similar to that of huang et al 2017 within the same period 33 w m 2 who concluded an interval ranging from 27 to 51 w m 2 with eight different products for a longer temporal coverage the mep h 31 7 w m 2 in this study during 1979 2008 was slightly lower than the estimate of 33 5 w m 2 by merra during the same period bosilovich et al 2011 reflecting that the mep h estimate was consistent with previous studies the ground heat flux g calculated by mep was estimated to be 16 w m 2 during 2001 2010 which can be compared with the value of 12 10 w m 2 reported by huang et al 2017 for the same period and the exclusion of antarctica may account for the overestimation in this study because studies have indicated that the global near zero g value was underestimated and may not represent the realistic thermal energy budget koster et al 2000 the new estimate of g in this study may serve as a reference in the global terrestrial surface energy budget scheme this study used the near surface air specific humidity to approximate the leaf surface specific humidity which was limited by the unavailability of measurements within the canopy given that the air specific humidity would be underestimated compared to that of the leaf surface the et may have been be slightly underestimated for vegetated surfaces additionally the distinct discrepancy in spatial scales between the ec towers and gridded et estimates can also introduce uncertainties and biases in validating et and associated trends the ec flux tower domain areas range from hundreds of meters to kilometers while the area represented by gridded et is much larger than the flux tower footprint consequently the disagreement between the estimates and measurements may be explained by the land cover heterogeneity around the ec sites although attempts have been made to upscale from the site level to the regional scale jung et al 2009 uncertainties in et still remain therefore developing a global et dataset with finer spatial resolution based on mep may be a satisfactory solution to address this dilemma moreover the ratio of transpiration to total et t et at the global scale has long been debated with large uncertainties coenders gerrits et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 reported that t et ranges between 35 and 90 based on different approaches i e isotopes sap flow measurements satellite data and land surface models transpiration estimated by mep accounts for 47 of et in the section 4 1 falls in the uncertainty range reported by miralles et al 2016 and wei et al 2017 i e 42 9 74 9 however our estimate is close to the lower bound of these uncertainty ranges after applying an emergent constraint approach lian et al 2018 found that the ensemble mean of t et in the cmip5 earth system models esms increased from 0 41 0 11 to 0 62 0 06 therefore one of our central focus to further improve the mep et in the future can be to apply the isotope approach to constrain t et this will help further increase our confidence in estimating the global et trend 6 conclusions this study verified the capability of the mep model to estimate global land et across a wide range of land cover types fractional vegetation and water stress were coupled into the mep model to estimate a new long term global terrestrial et during 1978 2018 with monthly inputs from the gldas dataset the mep derived global terrestrial et was 517 9 mm yr 1 which was validated from 475 ec flux sites showing that mep estimated et was in good agreement with monthly observations me 5 30 mm rmse 26 99 mm and r 0 74 and outperformed that of gldas et especially across all forestlands wetlands and cropland land covers the global land mep et showed an insignificant decrease 0 15 mm yr 2 during 1978 2018 and kept declining at a rate of 0 36 mm yr 2 during 1999 2018 the mep derived et trends agreed well with the observed et trends from 431 flux sites indicating the reliability of the former with respect to the spatial pattern of et changes terrestrial et increased significantly in south america africa india and australia and decreased in asia north america and mid africa this study provided a long term 41 years global terrestrial et estimate the mep modeled results were validated through abundant ec measurements under a variety of land covers and the application of the mep model on a global scale was verified the seasonal decadal and annual global et changes during 1978 2018 were derived based on the mep et product and a decreasing trend was observed over the past two decades which was contrary to the theory that et will increase due to the warming climate the newly developed rmep package accurately modeled the global et and more widespread applications may include estimating regional actual and potential et simulating crop growth by incorporating rmep into crop models and coupling with land surface models or hydrological models for water cycle research in summary the mep based et product improved global et accuracy compared to the gldas product and can be used for water resource management drought assessment water use efficiency evaluation and global climate change analysis 7 software

2779,understanding the variation and magnitude of crop coefficient kc is important to accurate determine crop evapotranspiration etc and optimal irrigation scheduling sensible heat advection is expected to increase kc by providing additional energy while its effect on kc over paddy field is rarely featured a three year experiment was conducted over a paddy field to develop local kc using the eddy covariance technique ec in the poyang river basin southern china the local kc curve the characteristics of advection and its contribution to kc were investigated the three year average local kc values during the initial mid season and late season stages were 1 12 1 29 and 1 13 for the early rice and 1 11 1 39 and 1 02 for the late rice respectively the advection was more likely to occur during the late rice season than the early rice season the three year average advective days were 8 0 d for the early rice season and 29 7 d for the late rice season respectively the contribution of advection to daily kc ranged from 0 6 to 13 2 for the early rice season and 1 1 to 37 7 for the late rice season respectively the upwind city was found to be a possible energy source for advection the occurrence of advection was closely related to air temperature gradients δt between the city and paddy field and wind speed u2 our study indicated advection also existed in the humid paddy field and had considerable effects on kc these results are helpful for decision makers to quantify crop water consumption and improve irrigation water efficiency keywords advection crop coefficient eddy

2012 qiu et al 2021a and one fifth of the global rice planting area is in china fao 2021 the poyang lake basin located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is one of the major rice production regions in southern china with the intensification of global climate change the poyang lake basin has experienced increasingly frequent drought over the past decades ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 meanwhile irrigation water for rice production is also facing competition from industrial municipal and environmental sectors alberto et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the above factors cause an increasing scarcity of irrigation water which challenges rice production and food security therefore there is an urgent need for reducing irrigation water and improving agricultural water use efficiency for paddy fields in the poyang lake basin qiu et al 2019 liu et al 2020a crop evapotranspiration etc which is regulated by crop phenology environmental conditions and management practices

ratio eddy covariance ec or stable isotope method allen et al 2011 liu et al 2019a b gong et al 2021 while these methods are difficult to be spatially replicated due to the high equipment cost and technical complexities alternately the single crop coefficient kc method proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao is mostly adopted to acquire etc across different crops and regions allen et al 1998 this method is also known as the fao 56 method where etc can be estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 with the corresponding kc paço et al 2014 medina et al 2018 liu et

ini kc mid and kc end are tabulated in the fao 56 paper for different crops across various regions allen et al 1998 since the kc values are affected by environmental and field management conditions jiang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 it is necessary and highly suggested to calibrate local kc kc loc to supplement kc datasets and improve local accuracy of etc estimation facchi et al 2013 guo et al 2020 for paddy fields reported kc values were quite variable across different regions mao et al 2004 found the average kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 04 1 27 and 1 16 for paddy fields in ningxia upper yellow river basin china in southern brazil the average measured kc ini kc mid and kc end was 0 97 1 16 and 1 08 for paddy field diaz et al 2019 choudhury and singh 2016 indicated the local kc for flooded paddy field in india were 1 08 1 80 and 1 41 for the initial mid season and late season stage qiu et al 2022 found the local kc values were 0 65 1 04 0 91 1 29 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 at the initial crop development middle and late season stages for a flooded paddy field in eastern china different rice irrigation management also resulted in different kc lv et al 2018 reported the average kc were 1 10 1 50 1 56 and 1 28 for flooded paddy field while 1 10 1 34 1 48 and 1 23 for paddy field with controlled irrigation during the initial crop development mid season and late season stages respectively in southeast china in the philippines the kc values were 1 04 1 11 1 04 and 0 93 for flooded rice and 0 95 1 00 0 97 and 0 88 for aerobic rice during the vegetative reproductive ripening and fallow stages respectively alberto et al 2011 for the flooded rice with dry seeding the kc ini was usually lower compared to the transplanted rice alberto et al 2014 diaz et al 2019 however there is limited knowledge of kc in the poyang lake basin in southern china despite the environmental and field management conditions advection is another important factor influencing kc which has been rarely considered pereira et al 2021a pereira et al 2021b advection indicated horizontal transport of sensible heat h brought by hot dry air between a field and its surroundings lang et al 1974 lang et al 1983 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 advective h provided additional energy to the field and would enhance the et when the field water supply was ample li and yu 2007 lei and yang 2010 however this additional energy was not directly measured and included in the et0 calculation process and thus would lead to a larger kc negative h was usually considered as a sign of advection ham et al 1991 alfieri et al 2012 kool et al 2018 which can be directly measured by the energy balance or ec method many studies have indicated the occurrence of advection over irrigated croplands in arid or semi arid regions ding et al 2015 reported the advection increased daily kc by 4 4 28 0 after the irrigation events in the upper yellow river region strong advection occurrence was observed in a maize field wang et al 2020 in an oasis vineyard in northwest china the advection contribution to vineyards kc was as high as 57 4 wang et al 2019 advection also occurred in paddy fields while it was rarely reported lourence and pruitt 1971 applied the bowen ratio method to a paddy field and the weighing lysimeter to a grassland in california and further confirmed the occurrence of the advection over paddy field lang et al 1974 studied advection in paddy rice and defined a linear relationship between advection and the distance to the upwind edge of the field tomar and o toole 1979 and peterschmitt and perrier 1991 also referred the occurrence of advection over paddy fields with the development of ec technique more and more studies reported negative h over paddy fields tsai et al 2007 alberto et al 2011 hossen et al 2012 baldocchi et al 2016 liu et al 2019a however few studies quantified the effect of advection on kc over paddy fields investigating the role of advection on kc is important for better understanding the water consumption of paddy fields given the above considerations three year ec data were collected over a paddy field in the poyang lake basin we desire to address the following questions 1 what are the local kc values kc ini kc mid and kc end of paddy fields in the poyang lake basin 2 what is the frequency and intensity of advection as well as its contribution to kc 3 what is the possible energy source for advection and what regulates the occurrence of advection over the studying paddy field 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted from 2016 to 2018 at the jiangxi provincial irrigation experiment station in nanchang jiangxi province china n 28 26 27 e 116 00 03 the study site is in the poyang lake basin with a typical subtropical humid and monsoonal climate the mean annual temperature is 18 1 c and mean annual precipitation is 1634 mm the soil texture is clay loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 34 g cm 3 the saturated volumetric soil water content is 0 49 cm3 cm 3 and the wilting point is 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the wind direction is predominantly from the north and northeast double cropping rice namely the early rice and the late rice is cultivated in the study site the early rice was transplanted at 28 25 and 27 april and harvested at july 12 16 and 16 for 2016 2018 respectively the late rice was transplanted at 24 24 and 26 july and harvested at 26 31 and 31 october for 2016 2018 respectively the hill space was 13 3 cm 23 3 cm for the early rice and 13 3 cm 26 7 cm for the late rice with 3 4 seedlings a hill respectively the irrigation method was alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation our previous studies have indicated that the field drying caused by awd irrigation only had limited affection on mid day etc because of mild intensity of awd irrigation liu et al 2019a reavis et al 2021 also indicated applying awd irrigation showed no significant effect on etc when the rice plants did not experience drought stress therefore the effect of awd irrigation on etc was not considered in this study 2 2 etc measurement an open path ec system was installed at the south central portion of the paddy field three dimensional wind speed was measured using a fast response sonic anemometer r3 50 gill instruments inc uk and vapor density using an open path co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7500a li

typically the observed turbulence fluxes sensible heat flux h plus latent heat flux le are 10 30 lower than the available energy net radiation rn minus soil heat flux g wilson et al 2002 in this study the slopes of the fitted linear regression between rn g and h le were 0 71 and 0 77 intercepts were 36 2 w m 2 and 32 1 w m 2 for the early rice and the late rice season respectively fig 1 the degree of the energy balance closure was comparable to the fluxnet wilson et al 2002 and chinaflux li et al 2005 results indicating ec system provided good quality of turbulent fluxes over the paddy field however the calculation of kc requires the energy balance to be closed french et al 2020 pereira et al 2021a pereira et al 2021b the observed le was then corrected using the bowen ratio closure method as suggested by wohlfahrt et al 2009 the flux footprint was estimated using the kljun et al 2004 model and processed by the eddypro software as shown in fig 2 90 of the flux footprint was within the paddy field within one single day most of the half hour wind directions were from the prevailing wind direction data not shown however there were still several days when most of the half hour wind directions were from west and southwest we excluded these data 90 315 for wind direction from the following analysis since the greenhouse and small wetlands in the west and southwest may result in less accurate etc estimation 2 4 parameter calculation and data analysis daily et0 was calculated following the penman monteith equation recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 this method has been considered as the standard method of et0 estimation and many studies have demonstrated its accuracy and universality in different climate zones jiang et al 2019 reavis et al 2021 the fao 56 pm

curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the daily kc can be estimated as the ratio of daily etc and et0 2 k c e t c e t 0 daily etc was converted from le as follows 3 e t c 24 3600 l

advection can be quantified by comparing the etc to the equilibrium evaporation eteq kool et al 2018 the ratio of etc eteq also known as priestley taylor coefficient α was considered to exceed 1 when advection occurred ding et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however the threshold α values may vary greatly under different climate regions for example α 1 26 was usually used to define advection over wet surface priestley and taylor 1972 baldocchi et al 2016 in some cases this threshold value can reach 1 4 1 5 diaz espejo et al 2005 li and yu 2007 in this study the relationship between half hour h and α indicated that α 1 26 can be used a good indicator for negative h fig 3 to avoid data instability caused by gap filling only the days with over 80 coverage of daytime data were used to quantify the contribution of advection to kc the advective days were defined when advection lasted for over 1 h in daytime 9 00 17 00 the contribution to kc from advection was quantified as follows mcnaughton 1976 kool et al 2018 wang et al 2019 4 k c a d k ad k c e t ad e t 0 e t c e t 0 e t c 1 26 e t eq e t c where kc ad is the ratio of contribution by the advection to kc etad is the contribution by the advection to etc eteq is the equilibrium evaporation which was calculated by the following equation priestley and taylor 1972 5 e t eq δ δ γ r n g 2 5 fao 56 kc curve a segmented kc curve was proposed by the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 to describe the time variation of kc the kc curve consists of four linear segments representing four crop stages identified as initial crop development mid season and late season stage by acquiring the duration and kc values of each segment the etc can be easily obtained and applied for irrigation scheduling in this study the duration of the four stages was determined following the procedure recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 based on rice growth observation to be specific the initial stage lasted from the transplanting day until the 10 of ground was covered by vegetation the crop development stage then lasted until lai reached 3 m2 m 2 the mid season stage lasted from the threshold lai until the rice started to mature at last the late season stage lasted until the field was harvested the kc values were considered constant during the initial kc ini and mid season stages kc mid linearly increased from kc ini to kc mid during the crop development stage and linearly decreased from kc mid to a lower threshold value kc end before harvest during the late season stage tabulated kc values kc tab were listed in the fao 56 paper for different crops under standard conditions for paddy field the tabulated kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 05 1 20 and 0 9 0 6 respectively table 12 in fao 56 in addition the fao 56 paper suggested adjustments to the tabulated kc values according to local environmental and field management conditions supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and crop phenology a summary of meteorological factors including net radiation rn air temperature ta daily mean relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m u2 as well as crop phonology for different growth stages in 2016 2018 are listed in table 1 the overall light and thermal conditions were better for the late rice season especially during the crop development and mid season stages the seasonal average rn was 7 5 4 1 8 0 4 8 and 9 2 4 5 mj m 2 d 1 for the early rice and 9 7 5 1 9 1 4 3 and 9 9 3 5 mj m 2 d 1 for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the seasonal average ta was 25 4 3 8 24 9 3 1 and 27 3 3 3 c for the early rice and 26 2 4 7 25 8 5 3 and 25 6 4 8 c for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the stage variation of rh showed no clearly trend ranging from 61 0 to 88 3 the u2 during the late rice season 1 8 m s 1 was higher than the early rice season 1 4 m s 1 the mid season stage lai was higher for the late rice season than the early rice season due to the better light and thermal conditions 3 2 tabulated adjusted and local developed kc daily and stage average kc of the early rice and the late rice season in 2016 2018 are shown in fig 4 and table 2 the seasonal variations of daily kc for both the early rice and the late rice were consistent with the kc curve presented by the fao 56 paper daily kc stayed lower values after the rice was transplanted the local kc ini ranged from 1 10 to 1 14 for the early rice and 1 07 to 1 15 for the late rice respectively during this period surface water evaporation was the main component of etc so the local kc ini showed stable values across different rice seasons and years with the growth of the rice plant daily kc gradually increased until the mid season stage the local kc mid was 1 30 1 29 and 1 27 for the early rice and 1 43 1 38 and 1 36 for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the higher kc mid for the late rice may be attributed to two reasons first the thermal and light conditions during the late rice season were much better than that during the early rice season resulting in higher lai table 1 second more negative h in the daytime was found indicating more sensible heat advection occurred during the late rice season the advected sensible heat brought more energy towards the paddy field and was expected to resulted in higher le than the local available energy rn g it can be seen that more extraordinarily high kc values occurred during the late rice season six typical days were selected to show the diurnal pattern of energy fluxes to investigate the possibility of sensible heat advection as shown in fig 5 for the days without advection h showed the same diurnal pattern with available energy and stayed positive during daytime however for the days with advection h dropped below zero and le exceeded available energy in the afternoon suggesting that h acted as an energy source for paddy field to evaporate additional water during the late season stage the daily kc values gradually decreased to the kc end before harvest the local kc end was 1 10 1 18 for the early rice which was higher than the kc end for the late rice 0 95 1 05 the kc end is closely related to the leaf senescence and field water condition before harvest allen et al 1998 for the double cropping paddy field to ensure the best transplanting time for the late rice the late season stage of the early rice was usually shorter than that of the late rice and thus lead to a higher kc end 3 3 frequency and magnitude of advection to investigate the frequency and magnitude of sensible heat advection the rice growth season was defined as days with and without advection according to the sign of h table 3 showed statistics of advective days in 2016 2018 the three year average advective days were 8 0 and 29 7 d for the early rice and the late rice season respectively indicating the late rice season was more likely to be affected by sensible heat advection for the early rice season most of the advective days occurred in the mid season and late season stages for the late rice season the average advective days were 4 0 22 3 and 4 3 d for crop development mid season and late season stages respectively it should be noted that no advective days occurred during the initial stage suggesting the initial stage of the late rice was not affected by advection while we have established the distribution of advective days in different growth stages fig 6 shows the duration and magnitude of advection in 2016 2018 for the early rice season the advection was weak with average duration hours of 4 8 1 7 h and negative h of 25 3 11 2 w m 2 considering the fewer advective days we suspected the advection may have limited effect on kc during the early rice season as for the late rice season the year 2017 had the weakest advection activity during the mid season stage which had the most advective days the duration of advection was 6 0 1 6 5 9 1 6 and 5 0 1 7 h while the magnitude of negative h was 31 4 14 1 17 2 7 3 and 35 0 12 3 w m 2 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 4 contribution of advection to kc fig 7 showed the dynamics of daily kc ad from 2016 to 2018 the contribution of advection to daily kc ranged from 0 6 to 13 2 for the early rice season and 1 1 to 37 7 for the late rice season most of the kc ad was less than 10 indicating most of the advection had moderate effect on kc over paddy field however there were still considerable days with kc ad higher than 10 especially during the late rice season on stage basis the stage wise kc ad ranged from 0 to 4 8 fig 8 the stage wise kc ad was lower during the early rice season 0 02 the highest stage wise kc ad occurred during the mid season stage of the late rice in 2016 and 2018 in general our results suggested the advection also existed over a paddy field in humid regions and could increase kc the effect of advection was mostly mild and had limited effect on kc on seasonal scale but cannot be ignored on daily or shorter time scale 4 discussions the effect of advection on etc or kc has received more and more attention in recent years ding et al 2015 kool et al 2018 pereira et al 2021a b in this study the contribution to daily kc by advection over paddy field was smaller than those in a semi arid wheat field in north china plain li and yu 2007 arid maize field ding et al 2015 and an oasis vineyard wang et al 2019 in northwest china the low advection contribution may be caused by the more humid climate but should not be ignored on daily scale after subtracting the effect of advection on kc the higher daily kc was greatly reduced fig 7 although we have identified the occurrence and intensity of advection over paddy field there remains a question that where does the advection originate as previous studies indicated the heterogeneity of temperature of the land surface would cause advection both locally and regionally tsai et al 2007 ringgaard et al 2014 kool et al 2018 under such conditions advection is more likely to occur when wind speed and air temperature gradients between the field and its surroundings are high fig 9 shows the land use of the study region the croplands paddy field occupied most of the area where small villages white dots were distributed as patches and the nanchang city was located in the upwind direction north of the study site considering the little area compared to the paddy field the villages was not deemed to be the primary energy sources for advection another possible energy source may be the nanchang city where hot and dry air can be transported by the prevailing wind and further induce sensible heat advection to its downwind cropland to test this hypothesis we collected the meteorological data of the nanchang city site from the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and then compared the air temperature between the nanchang site and the study site fig 10 shows the seasonal variations of the difference between daily mean air temperature δt of nanchang city and the ec site as well as the wind speed considering the few advective days during the early rice season only the late rice season data was analyzed advection usually occurred at high δt and u2 the δt indicated a higher potential for the occurrence of advection taking 0 5 c as a threshold value for δt it can be clearly seen that nearly no advection occurred when δt 0 5 c when δt 0 5 c larger kc ad was commonly accompanied with higher δt and u2 there were several exceptions that no advection occurred when δt 0 5 c this may be related to the lower u2 which resulted in weaker turbulence mixing for example on 16 17 september of 2017 the δt values were 1 96 and 1 16 c while u2 was only 1 6 and 1 4 m s 1 respectively indicating moderate turbulence mixing the friction wind speed u values from the ec system also support this hypothesis daytime average u values were only 0 25 and 0 24 m s 1 for 16 17 sep of 2017 respectively in addition advection hardly occurred during the initial and before harvest even the δt and u2 was high which may be attributed by the low surface conductance baldocchi et al 2016 despite the additional energy from the upper wind area the low surface conductance limited the paddy field to freely evaporate liu et al 2019a given the above results we suspected three factors should be met for increased kc by advection first temperature gradients between paddy field and its surroundings are prerequisites to provide potential energy source then enough wind speed is needed to transport the energy to field and ensure vigorous turbulent mixing finally the surface conductance determined whether this advective energy can be partitioned into latent heat and drive more evaporation it should be noted the mechanism of advection were still not fully understood in theory any heterogeneity of temperature of the land surface may cause advection accurate distinguishing where advection is originated is difficult and not straight forward kool et al 2018 in this study limited by the observed data we only considered the nanchang city as the major energy source our results showed the occurrence of advection was closely related with δt and u2 while there still remained several exceptions which might be caused by other sources of advection the effects of advection on kc have great implications on short term irrigation scheduling in this study although the poyang lake basin was located in a humid climate with massive precipitation the precipitation was distributed unevenly throughout the year during the late rice season the annual mean precipitation is only 243 mm which is much less than the water loss through etc and percolation in paddy field therefore proper short term irrigation scheduling is important to save irrigation water and maintain crop yield for the late rice chen et al 2021 ignoring the influence of advection may underestimate short term kc as well as etc and may result in drought for rice crop in the meantime with the intensification of global warming significant ta increases have been found in southern china ye et al 2015 ding et al 2020 the increasing ta combined with the accelerated urbanization implies that more frequent and intense advection may occur in the future resulting in the increase of etc over paddy field advection was also worth noting when estimating kc using remote sensing data due to the instantaneous remote sensing data temporal upscaling algorithms should be applied to upscale etc from instantaneous to longer time scale ryu et al 2012 liu et al 2020a jiang et al 2021 our results suggested upscaling methods such as the evaporative fraction ef method shuttleworth et al 1989 zhang and lemeur 1995 modified ef method ryu et al 2012 crop coefficient method allen et al 2007 should also be carefully considered or corrected even for humid paddy field jiang et al 2021 pointed the optimal modified coefficients of the modified ef method were significantly higher for croplands and wetlands due to atmospheric advection in a shorter time scale the effect of advection on etc was much larger taking this study for example the half hour kc ad can be as high as 67 7 and will significantly influence the accuracy of upscaling methods after subtracting the effect of advection on kc the kc for the early rice and kc ini and kc end data not shown for the late rice was nearly unchanged while the kc mid for the late rice was reduced to 1 35 1 36 and 1 31 in 2016 2018 respectively table 4 our results of the stage average values of kc were higher than the fao 56 tabulated and adjusted kc values especially for the kc mid of the late rice season due to various climate crops and field management conditions the kc values of paddy fields showed a large variation many studies reported close kc mid values compared to the fao 56 tabulated and adjusted kc values tyagi et al 2000 vu et al 2005 kadiyala et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 diaz et al 2019 allen et al 2011 suggested that under humid conditions the kc generally cannot exceed about 1 2 1 3 while some other studies reported much higher local kc mid values over 1 5 shah and edling 2000 choudhury and singh 2016 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 indicated high kc may be ascribed to the high yield rice variety other reasons such as field cultivation and climatic conditions may also result in higher kc values choudhury and singh 2016 in this study after removing the influence of advection the kc mid was slightly higher than the threshold value of 1 3 in addition to the effects of advection on kc the uncertainty of kc should be also noted kc is a comprehensive coefficient describing different characteristics between the crops and the reference surface to produce accurate kc values the et0 must be calculated using the meteorological data over the reference surface while this premise is not often mentioned in previous literatures pereira et al 2021a in this study since we did not have the meteorological data over the reference surface the meteorological data from the ec system was used to calculate et0 which may cause uncertainty to kc assuming there is a reference surface near our study site the differences in ta vpd and u2 between the reference surface and the paddy field should be minor since the two surfaces were close and both have sufficient water supply the radiation term was the major difference for paddy field and the reference surface due to different surface albedo for most croplands the canopy albedo was very close to the reference value of 0 23 takeshi 1987 higuchi et al 2000 monteith and unsworth 2013 sieber et al 2022 however for the initial stage of paddy rice the field surface was mostly covered by water with lower albedo indicating the paddy field received more rn than the reference surface substituting rn from the paddy field for the radiation term of et0 may result in larger et0 estimation and thus lower kc ini montazar et al 2017 indicated that for the paddy field in california the lower albedo during the early season stage led to a higher kc value in this study the underestimation of kc ini was not much because the albedo of shallow water with some vegetation was unlikely lower than 0 1 considering the short duration and flooded field condition of the initial stage the lower kc ini had limited impact on seasonal etc or irrigation scheduling in summary our use of the meteorological data from ec system only has small underestimation on early season kc in addition the uncertainty in kc did not influence our conclusions about advection nevertheless we highlight the importance of meteorological sources for kc estimation and the consistency of these data with the reference surface should be referred 5 conclusions advection has been deemed to increase available energy and lead to increased etc and kc while the effect of advection on kc over paddy field has been rarely considered in this study three year 2016 2018 energy fluxes were observed based on the ec technique over a double cropping rice field in the poyang lake basin southern china the local kc curve as well as the role of advection on kc was further investigated the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the three year average local kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 12 1 29 and 1 13 for the early rice and 1 11 1 39 and 1 02 for the late rice respectively extraordinarily higher daily kc values were observed due to sensible heat advection which may be originated from upwind nanchang city advection described by negative h was more likely to appear during the late rice season than the early rice season there were more advective days longer duration and larger magnitude of negative h during the late rice season the contribution of advection on kc was generally lower than that in arid and semi arid croplands but cannot be neglected on shorter time scale hourly to daily the occurrence advection was closely related to the temperature gradients δt between the upwind nanchang city and the study site and u2 higher δt and u2 can serve as good indicators of advection and help modify suitable irrigation practices credit

2779,understanding the variation and magnitude of crop coefficient kc is important to accurate determine crop evapotranspiration etc and optimal irrigation scheduling sensible heat advection is expected to increase kc by providing additional energy while its effect on kc over paddy field is rarely featured a three year experiment was conducted over a paddy field to develop local kc using the eddy covariance technique ec in the poyang river basin southern china the local kc curve the characteristics of advection and its contribution to kc were investigated the three year average local kc values during the initial mid season and late season stages were 1 12 1 29 and 1 13 for the early rice and 1 11 1 39 and 1 02 for the late rice respectively the advection was more likely to occur during the late rice season than the early rice season the three year average advective days were 8 0 d for the early rice season and 29 7 d for the late rice season respectively the contribution of advection to daily kc ranged from 0 6 to 13 2 for the early rice season and 1 1 to 37 7 for the late rice season respectively the upwind city was found to be a possible energy source for advection the occurrence of advection was closely related to air temperature gradients δt between the city and paddy field and wind speed u2 our study indicated advection also existed in the humid paddy field and had considerable effects on kc these results are helpful for decision makers to quantify crop water consumption and improve irrigation water efficiency keywords advection crop coefficient eddy

2012 qiu et al 2021a and one fifth of the global rice planting area is in china fao 2021 the poyang lake basin located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is one of the major rice production regions in southern china with the intensification of global climate change the poyang lake basin has experienced increasingly frequent drought over the past decades ye et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 xu et al 2020 meanwhile irrigation water for rice production is also facing competition from industrial municipal and environmental sectors alberto et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the above factors cause an increasing scarcity of irrigation water which challenges rice production and food security therefore there is an urgent need for reducing irrigation water and improving agricultural water use efficiency for paddy fields in the poyang lake basin qiu et al 2019 liu et al 2020a crop evapotranspiration etc which is regulated by crop phenology environmental conditions and management practices

ratio eddy covariance ec or stable isotope method allen et al 2011 liu et al 2019a b gong et al 2021 while these methods are difficult to be spatially replicated due to the high equipment cost and technical complexities alternately the single crop coefficient kc method proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao is mostly adopted to acquire etc across different crops and regions allen et al 1998 this method is also known as the fao 56 method where etc can be estimated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et0 with the corresponding kc paço et al 2014 medina et al 2018 liu et

ini kc mid and kc end are tabulated in the fao 56 paper for different crops across various regions allen et al 1998 since the kc values are affected by environmental and field management conditions jiang et al 2014 xu et al 2018 zhao et al 2021 it is necessary and highly suggested to calibrate local kc kc loc to supplement kc datasets and improve local accuracy of etc estimation facchi et al 2013 guo et al 2020 for paddy fields reported kc values were quite variable across different regions mao et al 2004 found the average kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 04 1 27 and 1 16 for paddy fields in ningxia upper yellow river basin china in southern brazil the average measured kc ini kc mid and kc end was 0 97 1 16 and 1 08 for paddy field diaz et al 2019 choudhury and singh 2016 indicated the local kc for flooded paddy field in india were 1 08 1 80 and 1 41 for the initial mid season and late season stage qiu et al 2022 found the local kc values were 0 65 1 04 0 91 1 29 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 at the initial crop development middle and late season stages for a flooded paddy field in eastern china different rice irrigation management also resulted in different kc lv et al 2018 reported the average kc were 1 10 1 50 1 56 and 1 28 for flooded paddy field while 1 10 1 34 1 48 and 1 23 for paddy field with controlled irrigation during the initial crop development mid season and late season stages respectively in southeast china in the philippines the kc values were 1 04 1 11 1 04 and 0 93 for flooded rice and 0 95 1 00 0 97 and 0 88 for aerobic rice during the vegetative reproductive ripening and fallow stages respectively alberto et al 2011 for the flooded rice with dry seeding the kc ini was usually lower compared to the transplanted rice alberto et al 2014 diaz et al 2019 however there is limited knowledge of kc in the poyang lake basin in southern china despite the environmental and field management conditions advection is another important factor influencing kc which has been rarely considered pereira et al 2021a pereira et al 2021b advection indicated horizontal transport of sensible heat h brought by hot dry air between a field and its surroundings lang et al 1974 lang et al 1983 mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 advective h provided additional energy to the field and would enhance the et when the field water supply was ample li and yu 2007 lei and yang 2010 however this additional energy was not directly measured and included in the et0 calculation process and thus would lead to a larger kc negative h was usually considered as a sign of advection ham et al 1991 alfieri et al 2012 kool et al 2018 which can be directly measured by the energy balance or ec method many studies have indicated the occurrence of advection over irrigated croplands in arid or semi arid regions ding et al 2015 reported the advection increased daily kc by 4 4 28 0 after the irrigation events in the upper yellow river region strong advection occurrence was observed in a maize field wang et al 2020 in an oasis vineyard in northwest china the advection contribution to vineyards kc was as high as 57 4 wang et al 2019 advection also occurred in paddy fields while it was rarely reported lourence and pruitt 1971 applied the bowen ratio method to a paddy field and the weighing lysimeter to a grassland in california and further confirmed the occurrence of the advection over paddy field lang et al 1974 studied advection in paddy rice and defined a linear relationship between advection and the distance to the upwind edge of the field tomar and o toole 1979 and peterschmitt and perrier 1991 also referred the occurrence of advection over paddy fields with the development of ec technique more and more studies reported negative h over paddy fields tsai et al 2007 alberto et al 2011 hossen et al 2012 baldocchi et al 2016 liu et al 2019a however few studies quantified the effect of advection on kc over paddy fields investigating the role of advection on kc is important for better understanding the water consumption of paddy fields given the above considerations three year ec data were collected over a paddy field in the poyang lake basin we desire to address the following questions 1 what are the local kc values kc ini kc mid and kc end of paddy fields in the poyang lake basin 2 what is the frequency and intensity of advection as well as its contribution to kc 3 what is the possible energy source for advection and what regulates the occurrence of advection over the studying paddy field 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted from 2016 to 2018 at the jiangxi provincial irrigation experiment station in nanchang jiangxi province china n 28 26 27 e 116 00 03 the study site is in the poyang lake basin with a typical subtropical humid and monsoonal climate the mean annual temperature is 18 1 c and mean annual precipitation is 1634 mm the soil texture is clay loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 34 g cm 3 the saturated volumetric soil water content is 0 49 cm3 cm 3 and the wilting point is 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the wind direction is predominantly from the north and northeast double cropping rice namely the early rice and the late rice is cultivated in the study site the early rice was transplanted at 28 25 and 27 april and harvested at july 12 16 and 16 for 2016 2018 respectively the late rice was transplanted at 24 24 and 26 july and harvested at 26 31 and 31 october for 2016 2018 respectively the hill space was 13 3 cm 23 3 cm for the early rice and 13 3 cm 26 7 cm for the late rice with 3 4 seedlings a hill respectively the irrigation method was alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation our previous studies have indicated that the field drying caused by awd irrigation only had limited affection on mid day etc because of mild intensity of awd irrigation liu et al 2019a reavis et al 2021 also indicated applying awd irrigation showed no significant effect on etc when the rice plants did not experience drought stress therefore the effect of awd irrigation on etc was not considered in this study 2 2 etc measurement an open path ec system was installed at the south central portion of the paddy field three dimensional wind speed was measured using a fast response sonic anemometer r3 50 gill instruments inc uk and vapor density using an open path co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7500a li

typically the observed turbulence fluxes sensible heat flux h plus latent heat flux le are 10 30 lower than the available energy net radiation rn minus soil heat flux g wilson et al 2002 in this study the slopes of the fitted linear regression between rn g and h le were 0 71 and 0 77 intercepts were 36 2 w m 2 and 32 1 w m 2 for the early rice and the late rice season respectively fig 1 the degree of the energy balance closure was comparable to the fluxnet wilson et al 2002 and chinaflux li et al 2005 results indicating ec system provided good quality of turbulent fluxes over the paddy field however the calculation of kc requires the energy balance to be closed french et al 2020 pereira et al 2021a pereira et al 2021b the observed le was then corrected using the bowen ratio closure method as suggested by wohlfahrt et al 2009 the flux footprint was estimated using the kljun et al 2004 model and processed by the eddypro software as shown in fig 2 90 of the flux footprint was within the paddy field within one single day most of the half hour wind directions were from the prevailing wind direction data not shown however there were still several days when most of the half hour wind directions were from west and southwest we excluded these data 90 315 for wind direction from the following analysis since the greenhouse and small wetlands in the west and southwest may result in less accurate etc estimation 2 4 parameter calculation and data analysis daily et0 was calculated following the penman monteith equation recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 this method has been considered as the standard method of et0 estimation and many studies have demonstrated its accuracy and universality in different climate zones jiang et al 2019 reavis et al 2021 the fao 56 pm equation is described as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the surface net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 t is the mean air

curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the daily kc can be estimated as the ratio of daily etc and et0 2 k c e t c e t 0 daily etc was converted from le as follows 3 e t c 24 3600 l

advection can be quantified by comparing the etc to the equilibrium evaporation eteq kool et al 2018 the ratio of etc eteq also known as priestley taylor coefficient α was considered to exceed 1 when advection occurred ding et al 2015 wang et al 2019 however the threshold α values may vary greatly under different climate regions for example α 1 26 was usually used to define advection over wet surface priestley and taylor 1972 baldocchi et al 2016 in some cases this threshold value can reach 1 4 1 5 diaz espejo et al 2005 li and yu 2007 in this study the relationship between half hour h and α indicated that α 1 26 can be used a good indicator for negative h fig 3 to avoid data instability caused by gap filling only the days with over 80 coverage of daytime data were used to quantify the contribution of advection to kc the advective days were defined when advection lasted for over 1 h in daytime 9 00 17 00 the contribution to kc from advection was quantified as follows mcnaughton 1976 kool et al 2018 wang et al 2019 4 k c a d k ad k c e t ad e t 0 e t c e t 0 e t c 1 26 e t eq e t c where kc ad is the ratio of contribution by the advection to kc etad is the contribution by the advection to etc eteq is the equilibrium evaporation which was calculated by the following equation priestley and taylor 1972 5 e t eq δ δ γ r n g 2 5 fao 56 kc curve a segmented kc curve was proposed by the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 to describe the time variation of kc the kc curve consists of four linear segments representing four crop stages identified as initial crop development mid season and late season stage by acquiring the duration and kc values of each segment the etc can be easily obtained and applied for irrigation scheduling in this study the duration of the four stages was determined following the procedure recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 based on rice growth observation to be specific the initial stage lasted from the transplanting day until the 10 of ground was covered by vegetation the crop development stage then lasted until lai reached 3 m2 m 2 the mid season stage lasted from the threshold lai until the rice started to mature at last the late season stage lasted until the field was harvested the kc values were considered constant during the initial kc ini and mid season stages kc mid linearly increased from kc ini to kc mid during the crop development stage and linearly decreased from kc mid to a lower threshold value kc end before harvest during the late season stage tabulated kc values kc tab were listed in the fao 56 paper for different crops under standard conditions for paddy field the tabulated kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 05 1 20 and 0 9 0 6 respectively table 12 in fao 56 in addition the fao 56 paper suggested adjustments to the tabulated kc values according to local environmental and field management conditions supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and crop phenology a summary of meteorological factors including net radiation rn air temperature ta daily mean relative humidity rh and wind speed at 2 m u2 as well as crop phonology for different growth stages in 2016 2018 are listed in table 1 the overall light and thermal conditions were better for the late rice season especially during the crop development and mid season stages the seasonal average rn was 7 5 4 1 8 0 4 8 and 9 2 4 5 mj m 2 d 1 for the early rice and 9 7 5 1 9 1 4 3 and 9 9 3 5 mj m 2 d 1 for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the seasonal average ta was 25 4 3 8 24 9 3 1 and 27 3 3 3 c for the early rice and 26 2 4 7 25 8 5 3 and 25 6 4 8 c for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the stage variation of rh showed no clearly trend ranging from 61 0 to 88 3 the u2 during the late rice season 1 8 m s 1 was higher than the early rice season 1 4 m s 1 the mid season stage lai was higher for the late rice season than the early rice season due to the better light and thermal conditions 3 2 tabulated adjusted and local developed kc daily and stage average kc of the early rice and the late rice season in 2016 2018 are shown in fig 4 and table 2 the seasonal variations of daily kc for both the early rice and the late rice were consistent with the kc curve presented by the fao 56 paper daily kc stayed lower values after the rice was transplanted the local kc ini ranged from 1 10 to 1 14 for the early rice and 1 07 to 1 15 for the late rice respectively during this period surface water evaporation was the main component of etc so the local kc ini showed stable values across different rice seasons and years with the growth of the rice plant daily kc gradually increased until the mid season stage the local kc mid was 1 30 1 29 and 1 27 for the early rice and 1 43 1 38 and 1 36 for the late rice in 2016 2018 respectively the higher kc mid for the late rice may be attributed to two reasons first the thermal and light conditions during the late rice season were much better than that during the early rice season resulting in higher lai table 1 second more negative h in the daytime was found indicating more sensible heat advection occurred during the late rice season the advected sensible heat brought more energy towards the paddy field and was expected to resulted in higher le than the local available energy rn g it can be seen that more extraordinarily high kc values occurred during the late rice season six typical days were selected to show the diurnal pattern of energy fluxes to investigate the possibility of sensible heat advection as shown in fig 5 for the days without advection h showed the same diurnal pattern with available energy and stayed positive during daytime however for the days with advection h dropped below zero and le exceeded available energy in the afternoon suggesting that h acted as an energy source for paddy field to evaporate additional water during the late season stage the daily kc values gradually decreased to the kc end before harvest the local kc end was 1 10 1 18 for the early rice which was higher than the kc end for the late rice 0 95 1 05 the kc end is closely related to the leaf senescence and field water condition before harvest allen et al 1998 for the double cropping paddy field to ensure the best transplanting time for the late rice the late season stage of the early rice was usually shorter than that of the late rice and thus lead to a higher kc end 3 3 frequency and magnitude of advection to investigate the frequency and magnitude of sensible heat advection the rice growth season was defined as days with and without advection according to the sign of h table 3 showed statistics of advective days in 2016 2018 the three year average advective days were 8 0 and 29 7 d for the early rice and the late rice season respectively indicating the late rice season was more likely to be affected by sensible heat advection for the early rice season most of the advective days occurred in the mid season and late season stages for the late rice season the average advective days were 4 0 22 3 and 4 3 d for crop development mid season and late season stages respectively it should be noted that no advective days occurred during the initial stage suggesting the initial stage of the late rice was not affected by advection while we have established the distribution of advective days in different growth stages fig 6 shows the duration and magnitude of advection in 2016 2018 for the early rice season the advection was weak with average duration hours of 4 8 1 7 h and negative h of 25 3 11 2 w m 2 considering the fewer advective days we suspected the advection may have limited effect on kc during the early rice season as for the late rice season the year 2017 had the weakest advection activity during the mid season stage which had the most advective days the duration of advection was 6 0 1 6 5 9 1 6 and 5 0 1 7 h while the magnitude of negative h was 31 4 14 1 17 2 7 3 and 35 0 12 3 w m 2 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 4 contribution of advection to kc fig 7 showed the dynamics of daily kc ad from 2016 to 2018 the contribution of advection to daily kc ranged from 0 6 to 13 2 for the early rice season and 1 1 to 37 7 for the late rice season most of the kc ad was less than 10 indicating most of the advection had moderate effect on kc over paddy field however there were still considerable days with kc ad higher than 10 especially during the late rice season on stage basis the stage wise kc ad ranged from 0 to 4 8 fig 8 the stage wise kc ad was lower during the early rice season 0 02 the highest stage wise kc ad occurred during the mid season stage of the late rice in 2016 and 2018 in general our results suggested the advection also existed over a paddy field in humid regions and could increase kc the effect of advection was mostly mild and had limited effect on kc on seasonal scale but cannot be ignored on daily or shorter time scale 4 discussions the effect of advection on etc or kc has received more and more attention in recent years ding et al 2015 kool et al 2018 pereira et al 2021a b in this study the contribution to daily kc by advection over paddy field was smaller than those in a semi arid wheat field in north china plain li and yu 2007 arid maize field ding et al 2015 and an oasis vineyard wang et al 2019 in northwest china the low advection contribution may be caused by the more humid climate but should not be ignored on daily scale after subtracting the effect of advection on kc the higher daily kc was greatly reduced fig 7 although we have identified the occurrence and intensity of advection over paddy field there remains a question that where does the advection originate as previous studies indicated the heterogeneity of temperature of the land surface would cause advection both locally and regionally tsai et al 2007 ringgaard et al 2014 kool et al 2018 under such conditions advection is more likely to occur when wind speed and air temperature gradients between the field and its surroundings are high fig 9 shows the land use of the study region the croplands paddy field occupied most of the area where small villages white dots were distributed as patches and the nanchang city was located in the upwind direction north of the study site considering the little area compared to the paddy field the villages was not deemed to be the primary energy sources for advection another possible energy source may be the nanchang city where hot and dry air can be transported by the prevailing wind and further induce sensible heat advection to its downwind cropland to test this hypothesis we collected the meteorological data of the nanchang city site from the china meteorological data network https data cma cn and then compared the air temperature between the nanchang site and the study site fig 10 shows the seasonal variations of the difference between daily mean air temperature δt of nanchang city and the ec site as well as the wind speed considering the few advective days during the early rice season only the late rice season data was analyzed advection usually occurred at high δt and u2 the δt indicated a higher potential for the occurrence of advection taking 0 5 c as a threshold value for δt it can be clearly seen that nearly no advection occurred when δt 0 5 c when δt 0 5 c larger kc ad was commonly accompanied with higher δt and u2 there were several exceptions that no advection occurred when δt 0 5 c this may be related to the lower u2 which resulted in weaker turbulence mixing for example on 16 17 september of 2017 the δt values were 1 96 and 1 16 c while u2 was only 1 6 and 1 4 m s 1 respectively indicating moderate turbulence mixing the friction wind speed u values from the ec system also support this hypothesis daytime average u values were only 0 25 and 0 24 m s 1 for 16 17 sep of 2017 respectively in addition advection hardly occurred during the initial and before harvest even the δt and u2 was high which may be attributed by the low surface conductance baldocchi et al 2016 despite the additional energy from the upper wind area the low surface conductance limited the paddy field to freely evaporate liu et al 2019a given the above results we suspected three factors should be met for increased kc by advection first temperature gradients between paddy field and its surroundings are prerequisites to provide potential energy source then enough wind speed is needed to transport the energy to field and ensure vigorous turbulent mixing finally the surface conductance determined whether this advective energy can be partitioned into latent heat and drive more evaporation it should be noted the mechanism of advection were still not fully understood in theory any heterogeneity of temperature of the land surface may cause advection accurate distinguishing where advection is originated is difficult and not straight forward kool et al 2018 in this study limited by the observed data we only considered the nanchang city as the major energy source our results showed the occurrence of advection was closely related with δt and u2 while there still remained several exceptions which might be caused by other sources of advection the effects of advection on kc have great implications on short term irrigation scheduling in this study although the poyang lake basin was located in a humid climate with massive precipitation the precipitation was distributed unevenly throughout the year during the late rice season the annual mean precipitation is only 243 mm which is much less than the water loss through etc and percolation in paddy field therefore proper short term irrigation scheduling is important to save irrigation water and maintain crop yield for the late rice chen et al 2021 ignoring the influence of advection may underestimate short term kc as well as etc and may result in drought for rice crop in the meantime with the intensification of global warming significant ta increases have been found in southern china ye et al 2015 ding et al 2020 the increasing ta combined with the accelerated urbanization implies that more frequent and intense advection may occur in the future resulting in the increase of etc over paddy field advection was also worth noting when estimating kc using remote sensing data due to the instantaneous remote sensing data temporal upscaling algorithms should be applied to upscale etc from instantaneous to longer time scale ryu et al 2012 liu et al 2020a jiang et al 2021 our results suggested upscaling methods such as the evaporative fraction ef method shuttleworth et al 1989 zhang and lemeur 1995 modified ef method ryu et al 2012 crop coefficient method allen et al 2007 should also be carefully considered or corrected even for humid paddy field jiang et al 2021 pointed the optimal modified coefficients of the modified ef method were significantly higher for croplands and wetlands due to atmospheric advection in a shorter time scale the effect of advection on etc was much larger taking this study for example the half hour kc ad can be as high as 67 7 and will significantly influence the accuracy of upscaling methods after subtracting the effect of advection on kc the kc for the early rice and kc ini and kc end data not shown for the late rice was nearly unchanged while the kc mid for the late rice was reduced to 1 35 1 36 and 1 31 in 2016 2018 respectively table 4 our results of the stage average values of kc were higher than the fao 56 tabulated and adjusted kc values especially for the kc mid of the late rice season due to various climate crops and field management conditions the kc values of paddy fields showed a large variation many studies reported close kc mid values compared to the fao 56 tabulated and adjusted kc values tyagi et al 2000 vu et al 2005 kadiyala et al 2012 hatiye et al 2015 diaz et al 2019 allen et al 2011 suggested that under humid conditions the kc generally cannot exceed about 1 2 1 3 while some other studies reported much higher local kc mid values over 1 5 shah and edling 2000 choudhury and singh 2016 xu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 indicated high kc may be ascribed to the high yield rice variety other reasons such as field cultivation and climatic conditions may also result in higher kc values choudhury and singh 2016 in this study after removing the influence of advection the kc mid was slightly higher than the threshold value of 1 3 in addition to the effects of advection on kc the uncertainty of kc should be also noted kc is a comprehensive coefficient describing different characteristics between the crops and the reference surface to produce accurate kc values the et0 must be calculated using the meteorological data over the reference surface while this premise is not often mentioned in previous literatures pereira et al 2021a in this study since we did not have the meteorological data over the reference surface the meteorological data from the ec system was used to calculate et0 which may cause uncertainty to kc assuming there is a reference surface near our study site the differences in ta vpd and u2 between the reference surface and the paddy field should be minor since the two surfaces were close and both have sufficient water supply the radiation term was the major difference for paddy field and the reference surface due to different surface albedo for most croplands the canopy albedo was very close to the reference value of 0 23 takeshi 1987 higuchi et al 2000 monteith and unsworth 2013 sieber et al 2022 however for the initial stage of paddy rice the field surface was mostly covered by water with lower albedo indicating the paddy field received more rn than the reference surface substituting rn from the paddy field for the radiation term of et0 may result in larger et0 estimation and thus lower kc ini montazar et al 2017 indicated that for the paddy field in california the lower albedo during the early season stage led to a higher kc value in this study the underestimation of kc ini was not much because the albedo of shallow water with some vegetation was unlikely lower than 0 1 considering the short duration and flooded field condition of the initial stage the lower kc ini had limited impact on seasonal etc or irrigation scheduling in summary our use of the meteorological data from ec system only has small underestimation on early season kc in addition the uncertainty in kc did not influence our conclusions about advection nevertheless we highlight the importance of meteorological sources for kc estimation and the consistency of these data with the reference surface should be referred 5 conclusions advection has been deemed to increase available energy and lead to increased etc and kc while the effect of advection on kc over paddy field has been rarely considered in this study three year 2016 2018 energy fluxes were observed based on the ec technique over a double cropping rice field in the poyang lake basin southern china the local kc curve as well as the role of advection on kc was further investigated the main conclusions can be summarized as follows the three year average local kc ini kc mid and kc end were 1 12 1 29 and 1 13 for the early rice and 1 11 1 39 and 1 02 for the late rice respectively extraordinarily higher daily kc values were observed due to sensible heat advection which may be originated from upwind nanchang city advection described by negative h was more likely to appear during the late rice season than the early rice season there were more advective days longer duration and larger magnitude of negative h during the late rice season the contribution of advection on kc was generally lower than that in arid and semi arid croplands but cannot be neglected on shorter time scale hourly to daily the occurrence advection was closely related to the temperature gradients δt between the upwind nanchang city and the study site and u2 higher δt and u2 can serve as good indicators of advection and help modify suitable irrigation practices credit
