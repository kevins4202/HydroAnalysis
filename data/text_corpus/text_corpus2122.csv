10611,in achieving water resource management goals such as irrigation scheduling an accurate estimate of reference evapotranspiration et0 is critical support vector regression svr was applied to the modeling of daily et0 at three meteorological stations in iran subject to different climates isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid different pre processing approaches relief rl random forests rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor served to determine the svr s optimal input combinations while these approaches introduced different inputs to the svr models those drawn upon by the rf approach i e rf svr generated better results than other approaches models performance was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency e a novel hybrid model coupling svr with a whale optimization algorithm woa was also developed and applied to daily et0 modeling the hybrid models outperformed the svr only models with the hybrid rf svr woa model having the best performance keywords reference evapotranspiration support vector regression whale optimization algorithm hybrid model pre processing 1 introduction as over 60 of global precipitation is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration et the latter represents a major component of the hydrologic cycle chow et al 1988 wang et al 2019 accordingly an accurate estimation of et is critical to the optimal design and management of irrigation systems efficient irrigation scheduling and a variety of other water resources management tasks mehdizadeh et al 2017a ferreira et al 2019 huang et al 2019 while lysimeters afford the most accurate method for the direct measurement of et they are costly and time consuming moreover given the difficulty involved in estimating et for individual plants reference evapotranspiration et0 is generally calculated first and then converted to the et of a desired plant using a crop coefficient considerable research has been undertaken to develop practical low cost methods to accurately estimate et0 and this has yielded numerous approaches ranging from empirical equations to artificial intelligence ai techniques widely used and precise the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation allen et al 1998 has been adopted globally as a reference method for computing et0 tabari et al 2013 valiantzas 2015 xu et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 zhao et al 2019 notwithstanding that its application requires access to a full meteorological dataset moreover as the high variability of et0 results in the poor performance of linear models researchers have developed non linear approaches such as ai that can account for the complex and non linear behaviour of et0 in recent years ai techniques have been broadly applied to et0 modeling several ai models have been applied to estimate et0 and their ability to do so accurately at different time scales and at a wide range of sites has been compared table 1 for example modeling the decadal et0 of six regions in burkina faso traore and guven 2012 reported gene expression programming gep with its ability to represent algebraic equations to be a reliable technique for modeling et0 in modeling monthly mean et0 of 275 stations in turkey citakoglu et al 2014 found an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis outperformed an artificial neural network ann similarly kisi et al 2015 employing data driven methods including ann gep anfis grid partitioning anfis gp and anfis subtractive clustering anfis sc to model mean monthly et0 at 50 stations in iran found the anfis gp to have performed best comparing the performance of ann and gep for modeling daily et0 at 19 stations in saudi arabia yassin et al 2016 found ann models to provide greater accuracy than gep models likewise patil and deka 2016 estimating weekly et0 at jodhpur and pali india compared the performance of ann least square support vector machine lssvm and extreme learning machine elm approaches the elm provided better et0 estimates than either the ann or svm models in china feng et al 2016 compared the performance of empirical equations elm wavelet neural networks wnn and neural networks optimized via the genetic algorithm gann in estimating the et0 at 13 weather stations on both daily and monthly time horizons the elm and gann surpassed the ann and empirical equations in a further study feng et al 2017 modeled daily et0 for two weather stations in china using random forest rf and generalized regression neural network grnn models finding the rf to provide slightly better estimates of et0 than the grnn evaluating the accuracy of ann and four empirical equations for modeling daily et0 at the amineto weather station in greece antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 found the ann to provide better results than the empirical equations comparing the ability of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars svm and gep to estimate mean monthly et0 at 44 stations in iran mehdizadeh et al 2017b found mars to outperform the svm and gep in a further study mehdizadeh 2018a applied mars and gep approaches to daily et0 estimation for six stations in iran situated in different climates finding the former to outperform the latter recently granata 2019 estimated the et0 of an experimental site in florida usa using m5p regression tree svr and rf techniques he reported that these methods were all capable of accurately modeling et0 at the study location in another study nourani et al 2019 used feed forward neural networks ffnn anfis and svr ensemble based models to model et0 at 14 stations in iran iraq turkey libya and cyprus and found the ensemble methods improved the accuracy of classical ai models over the last few years optimization algorithms have received increased attention for their ability to enhance ai approaches in modeling procedures addressing engineering problems moazenzadeh et al 2018 coupled a firefly algorithm ffa and svr to successfully model pan evaporation moazenzadeh et al 2018 and mean monthly air temperature aghelpour et al 2019 moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 introduced a hybrid model by coupling optimization algorithms including the ffa and krill herd algorithm kha with svr and elman neural networks for modeling soil temperature yaseen et al 2018 coupled a bat algorithm ba and lssvm for modeling dissolved oxygen concentrations in rivers the successful modeling outcomes of these studies confirmed the suitability of bio inspired optimization algorithms to enhance single ai models given the importance of et0 in hydro climatological studies its reliable estimation and modeling through a range of new approaches remains desirable the improvement upon classic ai model performances in estimating et0 achieved by creating hybrid models such as those integrating an ai with a bio inspired optimization algorithm is well documented accordingly the present study s aim was to add to the already existing body of literature regarding the capacity to accurately model daily et0 with a single svr and or with an svr coupled with a bio inspired optimization algorithm in this case a whale optimization algorithm woa the svr is a popular technique for classification regression function approximation and prediction vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 in recent years use of the svr in hydrology and water engineering has been suggested by moazenzade et al 2018 moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 and aghelpour et al 2019 recently mirjalili and lewis 2016 also provided a new swarm based optimization strategy for solving engineering problems namely the woa the woa was tested with some mathematical benchmark optimization problems and the woa was found to be competitive with other metaheuristic algorithms as such our study posited that woa could be used as an optimization tool and coupled with the svr three stations in iran isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid were considered as case studies in order to generalize the results as the performance of any modeling technique in accurately estimating the target variable is highly dependent on the proper selection of predictors their inappropriate selection may adversely affect an applied model s performance accordingly the present study s main objectives were to i apply a single svr to the modeling of daily et0 while considering four data pre processing approaches relief rl random forests rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor to recognize optimal inputs ii introduce a novel hybrid model by coupling svr with woa and iii compare the relative accuracies of single and hybrid models to the best of the authors knowledge the present work represents the first reported attempt to employ these pre processing approaches to identify input variables and to develop a hybrid svr woa for modeling et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study and data used the data required for the present study including daily minimum and maximum air temperatures tmin tmax relative humidity rh wind speed at a height of 2 m u2 solar radiation rs and sunshine duration ssd were compiled from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2014 records of three meteorological stations situated in iran fig 1 isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid based on the aridity index recommended by the united nations environment program united nations environment programme unep 1992 given the unequal quality of rs data outliers and lacunae in the rs data were determined jiang 2009 sabziparvar et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2015a 2015b and the latter estimated using the calibrated forms of angstrom prescott relationships provided by sabziparvar et al 2013 data from 2000 to 2010 was used in training the models while data from 2011 to 2014 served in model testing the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation for each input variable table 2 show the training and test datasets to have similar distribution statistics for the isfahan urmia and yazd stations training phase daily et0 ranged from 0 48 10 38 mm d 1 0 31 8 39 mm d 1 and 0 44 12 32 respectively while values for the testing phase were 0 49 10 12 mm d 1 0 32 7 64 mm d 1 and 0 47 11 33 mm d 1 the u2 followed by et0 presented the lowest standard deviations for each location fig 2 presents time series of daily fao 56 pm et0 over the training and testing phases 2 2 fao 56 pm method proposed by allen et al 1998 the fao 56 pm approach usually used for computing et0 when lysimeter data is unavailable served here as a reference method with daily fao 56 pm derived et0 values serving as outputs in the training and testing of single and hybrid models it is formulated as follows allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 r n g 900 γ u 2 t 273 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 γ is the psychometric constant kpa ºc 1 u2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 t is the average daily air temperature ºc es and ea are saturation and actual vapor pressures kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa and δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa ºc 1 2 3 pre processing methods model input combinations and proper training and testing data lengths are among the main factors limiting the predictive accuracy of any non linear model choubin and malekian 2017 to determine the best set of input variables weight based decision tree variable variance and linear methods relief rl random forest rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor respectively were individually applied to abstract the most correlated variables the weight based rl method generates a statistical solution for feature selection that is inspired by sample based algorithms the rf as a hybrid learning method operates on a structure consisting of many decision trees a variance based method pca extracts a low dimensional set of features from a high dimensional one to help record more information with fewer variables the cor approach examines the linear relationships between inputs and outputs in numerical data sets to compare pre processing methods data were normalized to within a range of 0 1 2 x n x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where xn xi xmin and xmax denote the normalized data observed data and minimum and maximum of the data respectively 2 3 1 relief rl notably sensitive to feature interactions relief rl is an algorithm developed by kira and rendell 1992 that employs a random search method based on a filter method approach to select features no feedback on the learning algorithm is applied to assess the subset of selected features in reducing input data dimensions the rl algorithm follows four steps i the ultimate goal is given each ranking correlation feature ii the ranks are updated using randomly selected samples iii ratings are sorted and features with the lowest rank are removed and iv a threshold is used to rank individual features the remaining features are retained as the superior features and make up the input to a batch algorithm kira and rendell 1992 depending on the number of features and exemplars in the sample collection the rl algorithm is more or less competent in handling noise problems and other more complex issues in the dataset accordingly it works well for both continuous and point data the rl algorithm uses an evaluation function that calculates the sum of a statistically significant criterion and a criterion of complexity and minimizes their sum in doing so this algorithm finds the function which best classifies the data then considers those properties which in combination with the selected elements increase the separation of classes this process is halted when the minimal expected criterion for the pending representation are reached kira and rendell 1992 2 3 2 random forests rf a recently developed and popular ensemble method used extensively across a multitude of engineering fields random forest rf a k a random decision forests approaches can serve in building models for classification and regression problems cutler et al 2007 under this technique several trees are used in estimation the tree predictors randomly use numerical values to class labels in the random forest classifier the random forest regression used in this study implemented the assembly of input variables at each node in order to grow a tree the rf technique requires only two user defined factors the number of variables used at each node and the number of trees díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 2 3 3 principal component analysis pca many raw data sets have a high dimension space and are accordingly difficult to interpret in addressing this issue pca is commonly used to reduce the data dimension i e the number of variables that are measured per view using the communication description between variables thereby drawing maximum information from the original data set while maintaining a minimal error between the original data set and the new dimensions obtained an unsupervised learning method similar to clustering hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 principal component analysis pca is a statistical procedure employed in extracting essential variables in the form of components from a broad set of variables within a dataset or otherwise put in an effort to record more information with fewer variables the pca extracts a set with a low dimension of features from one of high dimension in doing do variables in a multimode correlated area are a collection of non correlated components each of which is a linear combination of the main variables in general the pca method is mainly applied to reduce the number of variables and find the relationship structure between similarly classified variables in doing so the main input is converted to new variables that are non correlated i e the resultant component is a linear composition of the main variable abdi and williams 2010 the pca will have changed the input variables to main components that are independent and linear combinations of the input variables thereby suffering minimal losses in the main components hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 the main advantage of this method is to eliminate the linear model contained within the models given the many effective variables in the model in the present study the main components of the first component which bore at least eighty percent of the total variance in the data served as the input to the estimation models 2 3 4 pearson s correlation cor the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables pearson s correlation coefficient r is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations mehdizadeh et al 2019a 3 r i 1 i n x i x y i y i 1 i n x i x 2 i 1 i n y i y 2 where xi and yi are two vectors of length n and x and y correspond to the means of xi and yi respectively the point biserial correlation is conducted with the pearson correlation method with the exception that one of the variables is dichotomous 2 4 estimation models 2 4 1 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr based on the theory of statistical learning was first introduced by vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression tasks svr is based on binary classification in the space of arbitrary properties and is therefore a suitable method pai and hong 2007 the svr can learn and model non linear relationships between the input and output data in a higher dimension thereby minimizing the observed training error and distribution error sufficiently to achieve generalized regression efficiency yu et al 2018 an efficient learning system based on effective optimization theory svr implements the principle of inductive minimization of structural error to attain a general optimal solution the structure of a svr is presented in fig 3 let the training data set be x1 y1 x2 y2 xn yn where xi i 1 n and yi i 1 n indicate the i th input and output vector respectively and n is the number of training data pairs the svr function attempts to detect a suitable function f x by minimizing the distribution error limits to attain general regression efficiency as follows vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 4 f x w t φ x b where φ x represents the non linear projection function which maps the input vector x into a higher dimensional feature space where the trained data show linearity while w and b are the weight and constant coefficients respectively which are estimated by minimizing the arranged risk function for this purpose it is necessary to minimize the error function eq 5 by considering the conditions given in eq 6 pai and hong 2007 5 1 2 w 2 c i 1 i l ξ i ξ i 6 w φ x i b y i ε ξ i y i w φ x i b ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is an integer and positive number which is considered as the determining penalty factor used to control the trade off between the regularization term and empirical risk when a calibration error occurs φ x indicates high dimensional space features which map the input space vector x while ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables olatomiwa et al 2015 pai and hong 2007 finally the function of support vector regression is revised into the following form pai and hong 2007 7 f x i 1 i n α i ϕ x i t ϕ x b where α i represents the mean lagrangian coefficient calculation of ϕ x in its characteristic space may be very complicated selecting a kernel function is the typical process invoked to solve this problem in the vector regression model the fundamental kernel functions implemented by support vector machine include linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf extensively used as an optimal kernel function olatomiwa et al 2015 mehdizadeh 2018b mehdizadeh et al 2018 baydaroğlu and koçak 2014 the rbf can be expressed as follows olatomiwa et al 2015 8 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where x i x j display the vectors in the input space and σ indicates the gaussian noise level of standard deviation olatomiwa et al 2015 2 4 2 whale optimization algorithm woa first introduced by mirjalili and lewis 2016 to solve optimization problems the whale optimization algorithm woa was inspired by the bubble net feeding behavior of the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae watkins and schevill 1979 humpback whales hunt small fish and other marine creatures by creating an encircling curtain of bubbles as the whales rise towards the surface in the woa algorithm the target prey is considered the best solution and the possible situation of the humpback whales around the prey is formulated as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 9 x t 1 x t a c x t x t where t explains the running iteration x explains the situation vectors of the whale x explains the situation vector of the best solution and is updated if there is a better solution a 2 a r a and c 2 r are coefficient vectors a is a vector which is linearly reduced from 2 to 0 as iterations proceed and r is a random vector 0 1 the bubble net attacking approach includes two main phases i the encirclement process i e the whales move to the surface of the water represents shrinking and involves reducing a in the formula a 2 a r a the value of a decreases as a decreases and ii spiral updating of the whales positions is employed to imitate the spiral motion of whales in the hunt periphery by calculating the space between the hunt x y and hunter x y mirjalili and lewis 2016 10 x t 1 d e b l cos 2 π l x t d x t x t defines the space between the hunt and the i th whale b signifies a constant for determining the form of the logarithmic helix shaped motion l signifies a random number belonging to 1 1 the motion of the whales around the prey occurs along the spiral shaped paths by shrinking the circles the following mathematical model is given for the modeling of this simultaneous behavior mirjalili and lewis 2016 11 x t 1 x t a d i f p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π l x t i f p 0 5 where p 0 1 this allows one to find the probability of keeping the rotation mode in order to update the situations of the whales in the searching exploration phase the humpback whales search for the hunt randomly according to their location as compared to other whales mirjalili and lewis 2016 therefore the whales update their situations in accordance with randomly selected search factors rather than the best search factor mirjalili and lewis 2016 12 d c x r a n d x 13 x t 1 x r a n d a d where x r a n d is a random position that is found via the current population for more information about the whale optimization algorithm see mirjalili and lewis 2016 2 4 3 proposed hybrid model the proposed method sought to improve the basic svr model s efficiency for daily et0 simulation by employing a meta heuristic algorithm to train the parameters of the membership functions and weights between layers of this model in the proposed method a woa was coupled with a svr resulting in a hybrid svr woa model wherein the woa served to optimize the svr parameters fig 4 in order to use the woa for training of svr weight updates the optimization in the new n dimensional space svr woa must be processed in this arrangement the svr is considered as a whale in a d dimensional space where d is equal to the total number of weights and the svr bias adjusting the search between local and global optima is illustrated in fig 4 in the weight optimization process weights are randomly assigned the initial weights are then changed and modified in each repetition if the difference of support vector regression output and the output related to the actual inputs is less than a specified limit 2 5 performance evaluation measures as the first published attempt to implement a woa optimization algorithm in concert with an svr to improve the latter s estimation the accuracy of the single svr and hybrid svr woa had to be compared statistically the following statistics i e root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse mean absolute error mae co efficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency e were applied chai and

respectively lower values for the rmse nrmse and mae and higher values for the r2 and e represent a better daily et0 modeling performance 3 results four pre processing techniques including relief rl random forest rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor were applied to detect the most influential weather variables at different stations so as to provide accurate modeling of daily et0 the results of applying pre processing methods to select input variables in modeling daily et0 are summarized in fig 5 and further discussed in section 4 covering at least 80 of the variance in the data the pca outputs were selected as the best inputs for the modeling process for the cor method each variable which exhibited an r 0 6 was selected to serve as the best input variables in the rl and rf methods the variables with the greatest weights were selected after the implementation of the pre processing techniques on the meteorological data from the study stations the scenarios that were to be implemented were defined according to table 3 the four approaches resulted in different optimal input combinations for daily et0 modeling at different stations for the isfahan station u2 and ssd were used for the rl approach t rs u2 and tmin for the rf method rh and tmax for the pca method and t tmin tmax rs and rh for the cor approach the optimal input combinations for the semi arid urmia and hyper arid yazd stations are provided in table 3 the various input combinations then served in modeling the output variable i e daily et0 via the svr technique accordingly four different single svr models were developed rl svr rf svr pca svr and cor svr for example the rf svr model was developed by considering the input combinations introduced by the rf approach it is necessary to mention that optimal parameters were obtained searched by trial and error method when implementing the svr models the optimal parameters of the svr ranged for radial basis function parameter 0 2 17 6 and trade off parameter 1 12 19 47 the error statistics for the different unmodified svr models operating with data from the isfahan urmia and yazd stations table 4 showed the rl svr models provided the poorest accuracy for all stations studied only slight differences were apparent between the performances of the rf svr pca svr and cor svr models developed at urmia station with the rf svr model providing marginally better statistics in contrast significant differences were observed among the accuracies of rf svr pca svr and cor svr models developed at the isfahan and yazd stations the rf svr followed by the cor svr model surpassed the pca svr model comparing the performance of all single models developed at the studied areas the rf svr and cor svr models generally outperformed the rl svr and pca svr models the rf svr model performed the best in terms of rmse nrmse mae r2 and e indices table 4 isfahan station rmse 0 531 mm d 1 nrmse 14 277 mae 0 395 mm d 1 r2 0

rmse 0 482 mm d 1 nrmse 10 162 mae 0 366 mm d 1 r2 0 968 e 0 963 for testing period an attempt was then made to improve the accuracy of svr modeling of daily et0 by coupling woa with svr leading to the development of four types of hybrid models rl svr woa rf svr woa pca svr woa and cor svr woa when coupling the woa on the svr the following values were used 500 as the maximum number of iterations 40 as the number of whales 0 05 as the total load demand 0 2 as the up coefficient vector and 0 15 as the down coefficient vector the values of the statistical indices of model accuracy obtained for the hybrid models for both the training and testing phases table 4 show the coupled svr woa models to have better estimates of daily et0 at the stations under study in terms of r2 e rmse nrmse and mae compared to unmodified svr models similar to the single rl svr and pca svr models the hybrid rf svr woa and cor svr woa models outperformed both the rl svr woa and pca svr woa models with the rf svr woa model also outperforming the cor svr woa for all study regions table 4 isfahan station rmse 0 247 mm d 1 nrmse 6 654 mae 0 169 mm d 1 r2 0 987 e 0 987 for training period rmse 0 213 mm d 1 nrmse 5

for testing period to simultaneously evaluate the performance of single and hybrid models in daily et0 modeling for the study locations the values of rmse nrmse mae r2 and e statistics averaged across locations were compared table 5 on average the single rf svr and rl svr models yielded the best and worst performances respectively the hybrid rf svr woa model surpassed all other hybrid models rmse 0 294 mm d 1 nrmse 7 931 mae 0 204 mm d 1 r2 0 981 e 0 981 for training period rmse 0 265 mm d 1 nrmse 6 945 mae 0 193 mm d 1 r2 0 986 e 0 986 for testing period to further evaluate the performance of the single and hybrid models comparisons of model performance were displayed schematically using scatter and hydrograph plots figs 6 8 depict the comparison of daily fao 56 pm calculated et0 as the reference data and modeled daily et0 through the single rf svr and hybrid rf svr woa models these particular models were chosen as they showed the best performance amongst all models tested the scatter plots clearly illustrate that there was less dispersion scatter around the ideal line i e 1 1 line for the hybrid rf svr woa vs rf svr models which indicates that the hybrid models had superior estimations to the single rf svr models moreover the equations in the scatter plots represent the linear regression equations that are obtained by fitting a linear regression to the daily fao 56 pm et0 and modeled et0 by the single and hybrid models as y ax b y is the modeled et0 x is the calculated fao 56 pm et0 a is a slope and b is an intercept the greater slope and lower intercept values for the relationship between fao 56 pm calculated vs model estimated et0 plots showed the hybrid rf svr woa to outperform the single rf svr models an overview of the hydrograph plots shows that peak points are well modeled by the hybrid models but underestimated by the single models indicating that the potential of the hybrid models to capture daily et0 time series especially at peak points is much greater than that of single models 4 discussion one of the main drawbacks of ai techniques such as svr is over fitting fathian et al 2019 a model with an over fitting issue fits the training dataset with a high level of precision however poor performances are to be expected for the test dataset bishop 1995 the present single and hybrid models are not expected to suffer from over fitting since the results of the testing phase were acceptable when compared to those at the training stage the results of the hybrid models which performed best at the different study locations i e rf svr woa were compared based on the rmse and r2 criteria with the results obtained with optimal hybrid models for daily et0 estimation developed in previous studies by coupling ai techniques and bio inspired optimization algorithms table 6 in doing so the rmse and r2 criteria are used since these indicators are most commonly used to evaluate model accuracy in the literature the values of rmse and r2 statistics during the test stage for the best hybrid rf svr woa models are as follows rmse 0 213 mm day 1 and r2 0 991 at isfahan station rmse 0 325 mm day 1 and r2 0 977 at urmia station rmse 0 257 mm day 1 and r2 0 991 at yazd station recently bio inspired optimization algorithms have received increasing attention as methods of improving the modeling of eto using ai techniques table 6 tao et al 2018 reported a hybrid anfis ffa model to achieve rmse and r2 values of 0 24 mm day 1 and 0 97 respectively for et0 estimation at a site in bur dedougou burkina faso in china values of rmse 0 138 mm day 1 and r2 0 995 were obtained by yin et al 2017 for a hybrid svm genetic algorithm model i e svm ga coupling particle swarm optimization pso and radial basis function neural networks rbfnn to model monthly et0 in serbia petković et al 2016 found values of rmse and r2 of 0 0518 mm day 1 and 0 9716 respectively for a hybrid rbfnn pso model the hybrid anfis cuckoo search algorithm i e anfis csa developed by shamshirband et al 2015 for the estimation of monthly eto in serbia achieved an rmse 0 265 mm day 1 and r2 0 9695 finally wu et al 2019 developed hybrid models by hybridizing an elm with each of four bio inspired optimization algorithms for daily eto modeling for eight stations in china they concluded that the hybrid elm flower pollination algorithm i e elm fpa model performed better than the anfis fpa rmse and r2 error statistics being 0 1263 mm day 1 and 0 9943 respectively the rates of decline in the rmse statistic with the hybrid models as compared with the single ai models were 6 76 30 07 and 28 32 respectively in the yin et al 2017 tao et al 2018 and wu et al 2019 studies the reduction rates of rmse for the best rf svr woa models compared with the single rf svr models in the present study testing phase were 58 40 at isfahan station 39 14 at urmia station and 46 68 at yazd station it can therefore be said that the performance enhancement of hybrid models generated via the coupling of ai techniques and bio inspired optimization algorithms depends not only on the types of ai and bio inspired optimization algorithms but also on the climate of the study location and the time horizon applied for modeling the et0 time series the present study compared the accuracy of a classic svr model and a classic svr coupled with a woa in estimating daily et0 the selection of optimal model inputs is a critical issue for the analysis of data arising from non linear phenomena different measured or calculated inputs and et0 values were subjected to one of four data pre processing methods to select the best set of inputs variables selecting suitable inputs for models can be effective in improving model results accordingly for three different stations in iran various combinations of input variables were identified using the rl rf pca and cor pre processing methods based on fig 5 under the rl pre processing method u2 and ssd were deemed the most effective variables for modeling et0 at all three study areas this is consistent with the fact that et occurs at times of sunshine and wind under the rf method t and rs were important variables for effective et0 estimation at the isfahan and urmia stations while in the yazd station u2 was the most important variable this difference in selected variables was related to the stations differing climates the rl method used u2 and ssd as variables effective in et0 modeling at all three stations whereas the rf method identified t rs and u2 for the pca method the variables effective for et0 modeling common to all three stations were rh and tmax under the cor pre processing method at all three stations t tmin tmax and rs were the most important variables overall the rf method was the most successful in selecting input variables for modeling et0 at all three stations showing that a hybrid learning method that operates with a structure consisting of many decision trees is the pre processing method best suited to selecting the best input variables for et0 modeling one of the most important results in the present research was the ability of the rf method to find suitable inputs for estimation models in the rf method by providing the conditions for building various classification trees and by summarizing the results more accurate results can be achieved the rf uses a randomized split technique at each node to produce many different unpruned decision trees afterward the results of approximated trees are combined to make a more stable and resilient structure for achieving accurate classification accordingly we recommend using the rf method to best detect the input variables for modeling et0 a model s ability to accurately estimate a specific variable is directly related to its structure this is especially true for machine learning models where every simulation result is a function of model kernels functions optimization approaches learning methods etc mohammadi 2019 accurate hydrological computations can be achieved by implementing bio inspired algorithms which can also allow models to achieve specific goals such as higher accuracy greater speed more versatile processing and simplification of phenomena in the present case a bio inspired optimization method woa was used for the training of a classic svr model to increase the accuracy in modeling et0 the woa is inspired by the way whales hunt in the wild where they circle about their prey creating a cylindrical wall of bubbles which prevents their prey from receiving visual cues of the whales presence the whales then seek to move from the outside towards the inside of the circle in a manner which minimizes the distance they must cover the equation describing the minimum path is employed in the woa optimization equation and when combined with a classic svr allows for better training and learning accordingly modeling et0 based on a natural behavior can add to the accuracy of the modeling process the woa determines optimal values in three phases bait enclosure encircling prey operation phase bubble network attack method and exploration stage bait search and svr training is improved by the woa algorithm thereby reducing et0 modeling error the accuracy of the improved model svr woa with the best inputs selected by the rf method was evaluated using several deterministic indices this indicates that the svr woa model can be successfully used for estimating daily et0 using meteorological variables as inputs this offers accurate simulation results for different et0 analyses in the fields of agriculture meteorology and hydrology facilitating efforts towards understanding and managing water balance processes and plant eco climatology and providing for better data mining in hydrological studies the overall results showed that the svr woa model could be effectively used for et0 estimation under different climates by using different meteorological data 5 conclusions with the aim of enhancing the performance of an svr model for daily modeling of et0 the svr was coupled with a woa generating a new hybrid model svr woa the hybrid model s performance was compared to that of the single svr using the rmse nrmse mae r2 and e statistics as a way of generalizing the results three meteorological stations situated in different climates were considered as study sites in addition rl rf pca and cor pre processing approaches were used to identify the most influential variables to be used as inputs for the svr models the rf method was deemed to be a robust approach to determine the optimal input combinations since based on r2 e rmse nrmse and mae the svr models developed via the rf inputs i e rf svr models exhibited better performances at the different sites than the rl pca or cor methods the hybrid models performed better than the single svr models similarly the hybrid rf svr woa models were the best performing models for daily et0 modeling while the present study evaluated the accuracy of a hybrid svr woa model for modeling daily et0 future research could develop other types of hybrid models by hybridizing ai techniques such as anfis and the multi layer perceptron mlp with other optimization algorithms such as ga pso ffa kha etc the results could then be compared with the outcomes of the present work moreover the results of selecting the optimal inputs by different pre processing methods i e rl rf pca and cor to feed the svr confirm that the performance of ai approaches is very sensitive to the correct introduction of inputs therefore it is recommended that selection of inputs for et0 modeling in future studies be done carefully declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest 
10611,in achieving water resource management goals such as irrigation scheduling an accurate estimate of reference evapotranspiration et0 is critical support vector regression svr was applied to the modeling of daily et0 at three meteorological stations in iran subject to different climates isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid different pre processing approaches relief rl random forests rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor served to determine the svr s optimal input combinations while these approaches introduced different inputs to the svr models

modeling the hybrid models outperformed the svr only models with the hybrid rf svr woa model having the best performance keywords reference evapotranspiration support vector regression whale optimization algorithm hybrid model pre processing 1 introduction as over 60 of global precipitation is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration et the latter represents a major component of the hydrologic cycle chow et al 1988 wang et al 2019 accordingly an accurate estimation of et is critical to the optimal design and management of irrigation systems efficient irrigation scheduling and a variety of other water resources management tasks mehdizadeh et al 2017a ferreira et al 2019 huang et al 2019 while lysimeters afford the most accurate method for the direct measurement of et they are costly and time consuming moreover given the difficulty involved in estimating et for individual plants reference evapotranspiration et0 is generally calculated first and then converted to the et of a desired plant using a crop coefficient considerable research has been undertaken to develop practical low cost methods to accurately estimate et0 and this has yielded numerous approaches ranging from empirical equations to artificial intelligence ai techniques widely used and precise the fao 56 penman monteith fao 56 pm equation allen et al 1998 has been adopted globally as a reference method for computing et0 tabari et al 2013 valiantzas 2015 xu et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 zhao et al 2019 notwithstanding that its application requires access to a full meteorological dataset moreover as the high variability of et0 results in the poor performance of linear models researchers have developed non linear approaches such as ai that can account for the complex and non linear behaviour of et0 in recent years ai techniques have been broadly applied to et0 modeling several ai models have been applied to estimate et0 and their ability to do so accurately at different time scales and at a wide range of sites has been compared table 1 for example modeling the decadal et0 of six regions in burkina faso traore and guven 2012 reported gene expression programming gep with its ability to represent algebraic equations to be a reliable technique for modeling et0 in modeling monthly mean et0 of 275 stations in turkey citakoglu et al 2014 found an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis outperformed an artificial neural network ann similarly kisi et al 2015 employing data driven methods including ann gep anfis grid partitioning anfis gp and anfis subtractive clustering anfis sc to model mean monthly et0 at 50 stations in iran found the anfis gp to have performed best comparing the performance of ann and gep for modeling daily et0 at 19 stations in saudi arabia yassin et al 2016 found ann models to provide greater accuracy than gep models likewise patil and deka 2016 estimating weekly et0 at jodhpur and pali india compared the performance of ann least square support vector machine lssvm and extreme learning machine elm approaches the elm provided better et0 estimates than either the ann or svm models in china feng et al 2016 compared the performance of empirical equations elm wavelet neural networks wnn and neural networks optimized via the genetic algorithm gann in estimating the et0 at 13 weather stations on both daily and monthly time horizons the elm and gann surpassed the ann and empirical equations in a further study feng et al 2017 modeled daily et0 for two weather stations in china using random forest rf and generalized regression neural network grnn models finding the rf to provide slightly better estimates of et0 than the grnn evaluating the accuracy of ann and four empirical equations for modeling daily et0 at the amineto weather station in greece antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 found the ann to provide better results than the empirical equations comparing the ability of multivariate adaptive regression splines mars svm and gep to estimate mean monthly et0 at 44 stations in iran mehdizadeh et al 2017b found mars to outperform the svm and gep in a further study mehdizadeh 2018a applied mars and gep approaches to daily et0 estimation for six stations in iran situated in different climates finding the former to outperform the latter recently granata 2019 estimated the et0 of an experimental site in florida usa using m5p regression tree svr and rf techniques he reported that these methods were all capable of accurately modeling et0 at the study location in another study nourani et al 2019 used feed forward neural networks ffnn anfis and svr ensemble based models to model et0 at 14 stations in iran iraq turkey libya and cyprus and found the ensemble methods improved the accuracy of classical ai models over the last few years optimization algorithms have received increased attention for their ability to enhance ai approaches in modeling procedures addressing engineering problems moazenzadeh et al 2018 coupled a firefly algorithm ffa and svr to successfully model pan evaporation moazenzadeh et al 2018 and mean monthly air temperature aghelpour et al 2019 moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 introduced a hybrid model by coupling optimization algorithms including the ffa and krill herd algorithm kha with svr and elman neural networks for modeling soil temperature yaseen et al 2018 coupled a bat algorithm ba and lssvm for modeling dissolved oxygen concentrations in rivers the successful modeling outcomes of these studies confirmed the suitability of bio inspired optimization algorithms to enhance single ai models given the importance of et0 in hydro climatological studies its reliable estimation and modeling through a range of new approaches remains desirable the improvement upon classic ai model performances in estimating et0 achieved by creating hybrid models such as those integrating an ai with a bio inspired optimization algorithm is well documented accordingly the present study s aim was to add to the already existing body of literature regarding the capacity to accurately model daily et0 with a single svr and or with an svr coupled with a bio inspired optimization algorithm in this case a whale optimization algorithm woa the svr is a popular technique for classification regression function approximation and prediction vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 in recent years use of the svr in hydrology and water engineering has been suggested by moazenzade et al 2018 moazenzadeh and mohammadi 2019 and aghelpour et al 2019 recently mirjalili and lewis 2016 also provided a new swarm based optimization strategy for solving engineering problems namely the woa the woa was tested with some mathematical benchmark optimization problems and the woa was found to be competitive with other metaheuristic algorithms as such our study posited that woa could be used as an optimization tool and coupled with the svr three stations in iran isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid were considered as case studies in order to generalize the results as the performance of any modeling technique in accurately estimating the target variable is highly dependent on the proper selection of predictors their inappropriate selection may adversely affect an applied model s performance accordingly the present study s main objectives were to i apply a single svr to the modeling of daily et0 while considering four data pre processing approaches relief rl random forests rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor to recognize optimal inputs ii introduce a novel hybrid model by coupling svr with woa and iii compare the relative accuracies of single and hybrid models to the best of the authors knowledge the present work represents the first reported attempt to employ these pre processing approaches to identify input variables and to develop a hybrid svr woa for modeling et0 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study and data used the data required for the present study including daily minimum and maximum air temperatures tmin tmax relative humidity rh wind speed at a height of 2 m u2 solar radiation rs and sunshine duration ssd were compiled from 1 january 2000 to 31 december 2014 records of three meteorological stations situated in iran fig 1 isfahan arid urmia semi arid and yazd hyper arid based on the aridity index recommended by the united nations environment program united nations environment programme unep 1992 given the unequal quality of rs data outliers and lacunae in the rs data were determined jiang 2009 sabziparvar et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2015a 2015b and the latter estimated using the calibrated forms of angstrom prescott relationships provided by sabziparvar et al 2013 data from 2000 to 2010 was used in training the models while data from 2011 to 2014 served in model testing the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation for each input variable table 2 show the training and test datasets to have similar distribution statistics for the isfahan urmia and yazd stations training phase daily et0 ranged from 0 48 10 38 mm d 1 0 31 8 39 mm d 1 and 0 44 12 32 respectively while values for the testing phase were 0 49 10 12 mm d 1 0 32 7 64 mm d 1 and 0 47 11 33 mm d 1 the u2 followed by et0 presented the lowest standard deviations for each location fig 2 presents time series of daily fao 56 pm et0 over the training and testing phases 2 2 fao 56 pm method proposed by allen et al 1998 the fao 56 pm approach usually used for computing et0 when lysimeter data is unavailable served here as a reference method with daily fao 56 pm derived et0 values serving as outputs in the training and testing of single and hybrid models it is formulated as follows allen et al 1998 1 e t 0 0 408 r n g 900 γ u 2 t 273 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 rn is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the

vapor pressures kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa and δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa ºc 1 2 3 pre processing methods model input combinations and proper training and testing data lengths are among the main factors limiting the predictive accuracy of any non linear model choubin and malekian 2017 to determine the best set of input variables weight based decision tree variable variance and linear methods relief rl random forest rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor respectively were individually applied to abstract the most correlated variables the weight based rl method generates a statistical solution for feature selection that is inspired by sample based algorithms the rf as a hybrid learning method operates on a structure consisting of many decision trees a variance based method pca extracts a low dimensional set of features from a high dimensional one to help record more information with fewer variables the cor approach examines the linear relationships between inputs and outputs in numerical data sets to compare pre processing methods data were normalized to within a range of 0 1 2 x n x i x m i n x m a x x m i n where xn xi xmin and xmax denote the normalized data observed data and minimum and maximum of the data respectively 2 3 1 relief rl notably sensitive to feature interactions relief rl is an algorithm developed by kira and rendell 1992 that employs a random search method based on a filter method approach to select features no feedback on the learning algorithm is applied to assess the subset of selected features in reducing input data dimensions the rl algorithm follows four steps i the ultimate goal is given each ranking correlation feature ii the ranks are updated using randomly selected samples iii ratings are sorted and features with the lowest rank are removed and iv a threshold is used to rank individual features the remaining features are retained as the superior features and make up the input to a batch algorithm kira and rendell 1992 depending on the number of features and exemplars in the sample collection the rl algorithm is more or less competent in handling noise problems and other more complex issues in the dataset accordingly it works well for both continuous and point data the rl algorithm uses an evaluation function that calculates the sum of a statistically significant criterion and a criterion of complexity and minimizes their sum in doing so this algorithm finds the function which best classifies the data then considers those properties which in combination with the selected elements increase the separation of classes this process is halted when the minimal expected criterion for the pending representation are reached kira and rendell 1992 2 3 2 random forests rf a recently developed and popular ensemble method used extensively across a multitude of engineering fields random forest rf a k a random decision forests approaches can serve in building models for classification and regression problems cutler et al 2007 under this technique several trees are used in estimation the tree predictors randomly use numerical values to class labels in the random forest classifier the random forest regression used in this study implemented the assembly of input variables at each node in order to grow a tree the rf technique requires only two user defined factors the number of variables used at each node and the number of trees díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 2 3 3 principal component analysis pca many raw data sets have a high dimension space and are accordingly difficult to interpret in addressing this issue pca is commonly used to reduce the data dimension i e the number of variables that are measured per view using the communication description between variables thereby drawing maximum information from the original data set while maintaining a minimal error between the original data set and the new dimensions obtained an unsupervised learning method similar to clustering hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 principal component analysis pca is a statistical procedure employed in extracting essential variables in the form of components from a broad set of variables within a dataset or otherwise put in an effort to record more information with fewer variables the pca extracts a set with a low dimension of features from one of high dimension in doing do variables in a multimode correlated area are a collection of non correlated components each of which is a linear combination of the main variables in general the pca method is mainly applied to reduce the number of variables and find the relationship structure between similarly classified variables in doing so the main input is converted to new variables that are non correlated i e the resultant component is a linear composition of the main variable abdi and williams 2010 the pca will have changed the input variables to main components that are independent and linear combinations of the input variables thereby suffering minimal losses in the main components hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 the main advantage of this method is to eliminate the linear model contained within the models given the many effective variables in the model in the present study the main components of the first component which bore at least eighty percent of the total variance in the data served as the input to the estimation models 2 3 4 pearson s correlation cor the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables pearson s correlation coefficient r is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations mehdizadeh et al 2019a 3 r i 1 i n x i x y i y i 1 i n x i x 2 i 1 i n y i y 2 where xi and yi are two vectors of length n and x and y correspond to the means of xi and yi respectively the point biserial correlation is conducted with the pearson correlation method with the exception that one of the variables is dichotomous 2 4 estimation models 2 4 1 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr based on the theory of statistical learning was first introduced by vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 a set of supervised learning methods used for classification and regression tasks svr is based on binary classification in the space of arbitrary properties and is therefore a suitable method pai and hong 2007 the svr can learn and model non linear relationships between the input and output data in a higher dimension thereby minimizing the observed training error and distribution error sufficiently to achieve generalized regression efficiency yu et al 2018 an efficient learning system based on effective optimization theory svr implements the principle of inductive minimization of structural error to attain a general optimal solution the structure of a svr is presented in fig 3 let the training data set be x1 y1 x2 y2 xn yn where xi i 1 n and yi i 1 n indicate the i th input and output vector respectively and n is the number of training data pairs the svr function attempts to detect a suitable function f x by minimizing the distribution error limits to attain general regression efficiency as follows vapnik and chervonenkis 1974 4 f x w t φ x b where φ x represents the non linear projection function which maps the input vector x into a higher dimensional feature space where the trained data show linearity while w and b are the weight and constant coefficients respectively which are estimated by minimizing the arranged risk function for this purpose it is necessary to minimize the error function eq 5 by considering the conditions given in eq 6 pai and hong 2007 5 1 2 w 2 c i 1 i l ξ i ξ i 6 w φ x i b y i ε ξ i y i w φ x i b ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 where c is an integer and positive number which is considered as the determining penalty factor used to control the trade off between the regularization term and empirical risk when a calibration error occurs φ x indicates high dimensional space features which map the input space vector x while ξ i and ξ i are the slack variables olatomiwa et al 2015 pai and hong 2007 finally the function of support vector regression is revised into the following form pai and hong 2007 7 f x i 1 i n α i ϕ x i t ϕ x b where α i represents the mean lagrangian coefficient calculation of ϕ x in its characteristic space may be very complicated selecting a kernel function is the typical process invoked to solve this problem in the vector regression model the fundamental kernel functions implemented by support vector machine include linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf extensively used as an optimal kernel function olatomiwa et al 2015 mehdizadeh 2018b mehdizadeh et al 2018 baydaroğlu and koçak 2014 the rbf can be expressed as follows olatomiwa et al 2015 8 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where x i x j display the vectors in the input space and σ indicates the gaussian noise level of standard deviation olatomiwa et al 2015 2 4 2 whale optimization algorithm woa first introduced by mirjalili and lewis 2016 to solve optimization problems the whale optimization algorithm woa was inspired by the bubble net feeding behavior of the humpback whale megaptera novaeangliae watkins and schevill 1979 humpback whales hunt small fish and other marine creatures by creating an encircling curtain of bubbles as the whales rise towards the surface in the woa algorithm the target prey is considered the best solution and the possible situation of the humpback whales around the prey is formulated as follows mirjalili and lewis 2016 9 x t 1 x t a c x t x t where t explains the running iteration x explains the situation vectors of the whale x explains the situation vector of the best solution and is updated if there is a better solution a 2 a r a and c 2 r are coefficient vectors a is a vector which is linearly reduced from 2 to 0 as iterations proceed and r is a random vector 0 1 the bubble net attacking approach includes two main phases i the encirclement process i e the whales move to the surface of the water represents shrinking and involves reducing a in the formula a 2 a r a the value of a decreases as a decreases and ii spiral updating of the whales positions is employed to imitate the spiral motion of whales in the hunt periphery by calculating the space between the hunt x y and hunter x y mirjalili and lewis 2016 10 x t 1 d e b l cos 2 π l x t d x t x t defines the space between the hunt and the i th whale b signifies a constant for determining the form of the logarithmic helix shaped motion l signifies a random number belonging to 1 1 the motion of the whales around the prey occurs along the spiral shaped paths by shrinking the circles the following mathematical model is given for the modeling of this simultaneous behavior mirjalili and lewis 2016 11 x t 1 x t a d i f p 0 5 d e b l cos 2 π l x t i f p 0 5 where p 0 1 this allows one to find the probability of keeping the rotation mode in order to update the situations of the whales in the searching exploration phase the humpback whales search for the hunt randomly according to their location as compared to other whales mirjalili and lewis 2016 therefore the whales update their situations in accordance with randomly selected search factors rather than the best search factor mirjalili and lewis 2016 12 d c x r a n d x 13 x t 1 x r a n d a d where x r a n d is a random position that is found via the current population for more information about the whale optimization algorithm see mirjalili and lewis 2016 2 4 3 proposed hybrid model the proposed method sought to improve the basic svr model s efficiency for daily et0 simulation by employing a meta heuristic algorithm to train the parameters of the membership functions and weights between layers of this model in the proposed method a woa was coupled with a svr resulting in a hybrid svr woa model wherein the woa served to optimize the svr parameters fig 4 in order to use the woa for training of svr weight updates the optimization in the new n dimensional space svr woa must be processed in this arrangement the svr is considered as a whale in a d dimensional space where d is equal to the total number of weights and the svr bias adjusting the search between local and global optima is illustrated in fig 4 in the weight optimization process weights are randomly assigned the initial weights are then changed and modified in each repetition if the difference of support vector regression output and the output related to the actual inputs is less than a specified limit 2 5 performance evaluation measures as the first published attempt to implement a woa optimization algorithm in concert with an svr to improve the latter s estimation the accuracy of the single svr and hybrid svr woa had to be compared

random forest rf principal component analysis pca and pearson s correlation cor were applied to detect the most influential weather variables at different stations so as to provide accurate modeling of daily et0 the results of applying pre processing methods to select input variables in modeling daily et0 are summarized in fig 5 and further discussed in section 4 covering at least 80 of the variance in the data the pca outputs were selected as the best inputs for the modeling process for the cor method each variable which exhibited an r 0 6 was selected to serve as the best input variables in the rl and rf methods the variables with the greatest weights were selected after the implementation of the pre processing techniques on the meteorological data from the study stations the scenarios that were to be implemented were defined according to table 3 the four approaches resulted in different optimal input combinations for daily et0 modeling at different stations for the isfahan station u2 and ssd were used for the rl approach t rs u2 and tmin for the rf method rh and tmax for the pca method and t tmin tmax rs and rh for the cor approach the optimal input combinations for the semi arid urmia and hyper arid yazd stations are provided in table 3 the various input combinations then served in modeling the output variable i e daily et0 via the svr technique accordingly four different single svr models were developed rl svr rf svr pca svr and cor svr for example the rf svr model was developed by considering the input combinations introduced by the rf approach it is necessary to mention that optimal parameters were obtained searched by trial and error method when implementing the svr models the optimal parameters of the svr ranged for radial basis function parameter 0 2 17 6 and trade off parameter 1 12 19 47 the error statistics for the different unmodified svr models operating with data from the isfahan urmia and yazd stations table 4 showed the rl svr models provided the poorest accuracy for all stations studied only slight differences were apparent between the performances of the rf svr pca svr and cor svr models developed at urmia station with the rf svr model providing marginally better statistics in contrast significant differences were observed among the accuracies of rf svr pca svr and cor svr models developed at the isfahan and yazd stations the rf svr followed by the cor svr model surpassed the pca svr model comparing the performance of all single models developed at the studied areas the rf svr and cor svr models generally outperformed the rl svr and pca svr models the rf svr model performed the best in terms of rmse nrmse mae r2 and e indices table 4 isfahan station rmse 0 531 mm d 1 nrmse 14 277 mae 0 395 mm d 1 r2 0

rmse 0 482 mm d 1 nrmse 10 162 mae 0 366 mm d 1 r2 0 968 e 0 963 for testing period an attempt was then made to improve the accuracy of svr modeling of daily et0 by coupling woa with svr leading to the development of four types of hybrid models rl svr woa rf svr woa pca svr woa and cor svr woa when coupling the woa on the svr the following values were used 500 as the maximum number of iterations 40 as the number of whales 0 05 as the total load demand 0 2 as the up coefficient vector and 0 15 as the down coefficient vector the values of the statistical indices of model accuracy obtained for the hybrid models for both the training and testing phases table 4 show the coupled svr woa models to have better estimates of daily et0 at the stations under study in terms of r2 e rmse nrmse and mae compared to unmodified svr models similar to the single rl svr and pca svr models the hybrid rf svr woa and cor svr woa models outperformed both the rl svr woa and pca svr woa models with the rf svr woa model also outperforming the cor svr woa for all study regions table 4 isfahan station rmse 0 247 mm d 1 nrmse 6 654 mae 0 169 mm d 1 r2 0 987 e 0 987 for training period rmse 0 213 mm d 1 nrmse 5

for testing period to simultaneously evaluate the performance of single and hybrid models in daily et0 modeling for the study locations the values of rmse nrmse mae r2 and e statistics averaged across locations were compared table 5 on average the single rf svr and rl svr models yielded the best and worst performances respectively the hybrid rf svr woa model surpassed all other hybrid models rmse 0

the single and hybrid models comparisons of model performance were displayed schematically using scatter and hydrograph plots figs 6 8 depict the comparison of daily fao 56 pm calculated et0 as the reference data and modeled daily et0 through the single rf svr and hybrid rf svr woa models these particular models were chosen as they showed the best performance amongst all models tested the scatter plots clearly illustrate that there was less dispersion scatter around the ideal line i e 1 1 line for the hybrid rf svr woa vs rf svr models which indicates that the hybrid models had superior estimations to the single rf svr models moreover the equations in the scatter plots represent the linear regression equations that are obtained by fitting a linear regression to the daily fao 56 pm et0 and modeled et0 by the single and hybrid models as y ax b y is the modeled et0 x is the calculated fao 56 pm et0 a is a slope and b is an intercept the greater slope and lower intercept values for the relationship between fao 56 pm calculated vs model estimated et0 plots showed the hybrid rf svr woa to outperform the single rf svr models an overview of the hydrograph plots shows that peak points are well modeled by the hybrid models but underestimated by the single models indicating that the potential of the hybrid models to capture daily et0 time series especially at peak points is much greater than that of single models 4 discussion one of the main drawbacks of ai techniques such as svr is over fitting fathian et al 2019 a model with an over fitting issue fits the training dataset with a high level of precision however poor performances are to be expected for the test dataset bishop 1995 the present single and hybrid models are not expected to suffer from over fitting since the results of the testing phase were acceptable when compared to those at the training stage the results of the hybrid models which performed best at the different study locations i e rf svr woa were compared based on the rmse and r2 criteria with the results obtained with optimal hybrid models for daily et0 estimation developed in previous studies by coupling ai techniques and bio inspired optimization algorithms table 6 in doing so the rmse and r2 criteria are used since these indicators are most commonly used to evaluate model accuracy in the literature the values of rmse and r2 statistics during the test stage for the best hybrid rf svr woa models are as follows rmse 0 213 mm day 1 and r2 0 991 at isfahan station rmse 0 325 mm day 1 and r2 0 977 at urmia station rmse 0 257 mm day 1 and r2 0 991 at yazd station recently bio inspired optimization algorithms have received increasing attention as methods of improving the modeling of eto using ai techniques table 6 tao et al 2018 reported a hybrid anfis ffa model to achieve rmse and r2 values of 0 24 mm day 1 and 0 97 respectively for et0 estimation at a site in bur dedougou burkina faso in china values of rmse 0 138 mm day 1 and r2 0 995 were obtained by yin et al 2017 for a hybrid svm genetic algorithm model i e svm ga coupling particle swarm optimization pso and radial basis function neural networks rbfnn to model monthly et0 in serbia petković et al 2016 found values of rmse and r2 of 0 0518 mm day 1 and 0 9716 respectively for a hybrid rbfnn pso model the hybrid anfis cuckoo search algorithm i e anfis csa developed by shamshirband et al 2015 for the estimation of monthly eto in serbia achieved an rmse 0 265 mm day 1 and r2 0 9695 finally wu et al 2019 developed hybrid models by hybridizing an elm with each of four bio inspired optimization algorithms for daily eto modeling for eight stations in china they concluded that the hybrid elm flower pollination algorithm i e elm fpa model performed better than the anfis fpa rmse and r2 error statistics being 0 1263 mm day 1 and 0 9943 respectively the rates of decline in the rmse statistic with the hybrid models as compared with the single ai models were 6 76 30 07 and 28 32 respectively in the yin et al 2017 tao et al 2018 and wu et al 2019 studies the reduction rates of rmse for the best rf svr woa models compared with the single rf svr models in the present study testing phase were 58 40 at isfahan station 39 14 at urmia station and 46 68 at yazd station it can therefore be said that the performance enhancement of hybrid models generated via the coupling of ai techniques and bio inspired optimization algorithms depends not only on the types of ai and bio inspired optimization algorithms but also on the climate of the study location and the time horizon applied for modeling the et0 time series the present study compared the accuracy of a classic svr model and a classic svr coupled with a woa in estimating daily et0 the selection of optimal model inputs is a critical issue for the analysis of data arising from non linear phenomena different measured or calculated inputs and et0 values were subjected to one of four data pre processing methods to select the best set of inputs variables selecting suitable inputs for models can be effective in improving model results accordingly for three different stations in iran various combinations of input variables were identified using the rl rf pca and cor pre processing methods based on fig 5 under the rl pre processing method u2 and ssd were deemed the most effective variables for modeling et0 at all three study areas this is consistent with the fact that et occurs at times of sunshine and wind under the rf method t and rs were important variables for effective et0 estimation at the isfahan and urmia stations while in the yazd station u2 was the most important variable this difference in selected variables was related to the stations differing climates the rl method used u2 and ssd as variables effective in et0 modeling at all three stations whereas the rf method identified t rs and u2 for the pca method the variables effective for et0 modeling common to all three stations were rh and tmax under the cor pre processing method at all three stations t tmin tmax and rs were the most important variables overall the rf method was the most successful in selecting input variables for modeling et0 at all three stations showing that a hybrid learning method that operates with a structure consisting of many decision trees is the pre processing method best suited to selecting the best input variables for et0 modeling one of the most important results in the present research was the ability of the rf method to find suitable inputs for estimation models in the rf method by providing the conditions for building various classification trees and by summarizing the results more accurate results can be achieved the rf uses a randomized split technique at each node to produce many different unpruned decision trees afterward the results of approximated trees are combined to make a more stable and resilient structure for achieving accurate classification accordingly we recommend using the rf method to best detect the input variables for modeling et0 a model s ability to accurately estimate a specific variable is directly related to its structure this is especially true for machine learning models where every simulation result is a function of model kernels functions optimization approaches learning methods etc mohammadi 2019 accurate hydrological computations can be achieved by implementing bio inspired algorithms which can also allow models to achieve specific goals such as higher accuracy greater speed more versatile processing and simplification of phenomena in the present case a bio inspired optimization method woa was used for the training of a classic svr model to increase the accuracy in modeling et0 the woa is inspired by the way whales hunt in the wild where they circle about their prey creating a cylindrical wall of bubbles which prevents their prey from receiving visual cues of the whales presence the whales then seek to move from the outside towards the inside of the circle in a manner which minimizes the distance they must cover the equation describing the minimum path is employed in the woa optimization equation and when combined with a classic svr allows for better training and learning accordingly modeling et0 based on a natural behavior can add to the accuracy of the modeling process the woa determines optimal values in three phases bait enclosure encircling prey operation phase bubble network attack method and exploration stage bait search and svr training is improved by the woa algorithm thereby reducing et0 modeling error the accuracy of the improved model svr woa with the best inputs selected by the rf method was evaluated using several deterministic indices this indicates that the svr woa model can be successfully used for estimating daily et0 using meteorological variables as inputs this offers accurate simulation results for different et0 analyses in the fields of agriculture meteorology and hydrology facilitating efforts towards understanding and managing water balance processes and plant eco climatology and providing for better data mining in hydrological studies the overall results showed that the svr woa model could be effectively used for et0 estimation under different climates by using different meteorological data 5 conclusions with the aim of enhancing the performance of an svr model for daily modeling of et0 the svr was coupled with a woa generating a new hybrid model svr woa the hybrid model s performance was compared to that of the single svr using the rmse nrmse mae r2 and e statistics as a way of generalizing the results three meteorological stations situated in different climates were considered as study sites in addition rl rf pca and cor pre processing approaches were used to identify the most influential variables to be used as inputs for the svr models the rf method was deemed to be a robust approach to determine the optimal input combinations since based on r2 e rmse nrmse and mae the svr models developed via the rf inputs i e rf svr models exhibited better performances at the different sites than the rl pca or cor methods the hybrid models performed better than the single svr models similarly the hybrid rf svr woa models were the best performing models for daily et0 modeling while the present study evaluated the accuracy of a hybrid svr woa model for modeling daily et0 future research could develop other types of hybrid models by hybridizing ai techniques such as anfis and the multi layer perceptron mlp with other optimization algorithms such as ga pso ffa kha etc the results could then be compared with the outcomes of the present work moreover the results of selecting the optimal inputs by different pre processing methods i e rl rf pca and cor to feed the svr confirm that the performance of ai approaches is very sensitive to the correct introduction of inputs therefore it is recommended that selection of inputs for et0 modeling in future studies be done carefully declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest 
10612,stony karst landscape in the adriatic coastal area has been cultivated for centuries to grow mediterranean crops shallow and less fertile soils were mostly used for rain fed grapevine and olive production native grapevine cultivars are in general well adapted to the warm and droughty climate but a rapid drift in weather patterns characterized mostly by long lasting high temperature events during the growing season urges the producers to apply irrigation this research studying the effects of different irrigation levels on babić grapevine performance was carried out in two growing seasons 2015 and 2016 with contrasting weather conditions in a vineyard established on a parcel of land derived from the stony surface of a limestone plateau on the very edge of the eastern adriatic coast the study evaluated the effects of different irrigation regimes based on the quantification of grapevine water use 50 75 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration by measuring the total leaf area leaf gas exchange performance and grape yield and quality the irrigation treatments increased the total leaf area net photosynthetic rate average transpiration rate and average mesophyll co2 concentration the yield components and grape quality were also affected by the irrigation treatments positive effects of irrigation in both the experimental seasons were associated with increased yield and total soluble solids tss as well as synchronized tss and phenolic ripening furthermore water stress positively affected the concentrations of anthocyanins and other polyphenols in both years of the study in 2015 extremely high temperatures reduced the grape yield juice yield and anthocyanin content in grapes in non irrigated vines as well as in all irrigation treatments irrigation was efficient in reducing these negative effects except in the case of the anthocyanin content keywords stony soils drought water stress polyphenols total leaf area grapevine yield and quality 1 introduction karst landscapes are widespread along the mediterranean area including the croatian adriatic coast and islands in the context of agricultural land use this region is known for extreme climatic conditions the intensity and duration of anomalous weather events including extreme precipitation droughts or high temperature occurrences vary over the years simolo et al 2012 additionally trenberth 2011 documented that high impact weather events or even extremes have increased in the past decades on the global scale due to the extremely complex landscape configuration of the dinaric karst climatic conditions can be considerably variable even over short time periods furthermore strong wind events in the eastern adriatic coast are also related to the land sea discontinuity and hinterland orography pandžić and likso 2005 stony soils are widespread across the globe and represent a signiﬁcant part of agricultural land van wesemael et al 1995 it was estimated that as much as 30 of soils in western europe are stony and they occupy more than 60 of the land in the mediterranean region poesen and lavee 1994 furthermore their usage tends to increase because of the erosion and cultivation of marginal lands garcía ruiz 2010 or by the remediation and cultivation of rocky hillslopes or highlands due to the high complexity of relief forms steep slopes shallow stony soils sparse natural vegetation and lack of surface water karst surfaces have been subjected to anthropogenic modification to enhance their agricultural potential two specific forms of human hillslope modification in karst environments in the dinaric region to create deeper soils and a flat surface suitable for cultivation are stone walled terrace fronts built from the removal of large blocks of limestone from the original hillslope and doline the creation of a surface suitable for cultivation following the infilling of a funnel shaped form lewin and woodward 2009 these forms reflect the historical mission of the local people to cultivate apparently non fertile land furthermore some of these agricultural landscape features such as stony terraces are now protected as cultural landscapes andlar et al 2017 and mostly used for the production of native grapevine cultivars such as babić and the famous high quality red wine on these sites without irrigation high grape and wine qualities but very low yields are obtained however when grown on sites of fertile deep soils with full irrigation this particular cultivar shows a significant increase in yield but the quality of the grape and wine is quite low zdunić 2005 maletić et al 2015 in the last two decades more than 5000 ha of the karst stony terraces and steep slopes of the eastern adriatic coast have been reclaimed by stone crushing to provide land suitable for agricultural production mostly for grapevines and olives land parcels obtained after karst reclamation are characterized by a high proportion of stones and rock fragments variable ratio concerning the fine soil fraction and low water holding capacity the low water holding capacity of such soils along with the low precipitation rate during the main vegetation season increases the sensitivity of grapevine to drought water stress and increasing air temperatures are reported to be among the most influential impacts of climate change on agriculture affecting the length of the growing season changes in phenology and ultimately product quality water stress is a limiting factor for a wide range of physiological processes ondrasek 2014 including grapevine photosynthesis and leaf transpiration chaves et al 2010 in addition water stress is often accompanied with other stressful factors such as high temperatures and irradiance which are especially prominent in the mediterranean region flexas et al 1999 grape quality is strongly determined by the air temperature during the ripening period tarara et al 2008 in spite of its drought tolerance grapevine growth is highly affected by global climate change and irrigation is adopted as a common practice in vineyards located in regions with seasonal drought regulated deficit irrigation i e spatially and or temporally manipulated irrigation that is defined by the application of decreased amounts of water in relation to the full crop evapotranspiration during the whole agricultural cycle or only during certain growth periods has shown positive effects on the grape quality and yield increase chaves et al 2007 prevention of photochemical down regulation in grapevines and maintaining high photosystem ii psii efficiency flexas et al 1998 in addition it also results in a higher grape and wine quality with lower water consumption compared to full irrigation bravdo et al 1985 medrano et al 2003 chaves et al 2007 furthermore mild water stress can increase the proportion of the berry surface area to volume ratio of mesocarp tissue by restricting berry growth kennedy et al 2002 ojeda et al 2002 but can also directly increase the concentrations and amounts of specific compounds such as skin tannins and anthocyanins roby et al 2004 specific environmental conditions for grapevine growing on reclaimed karst or similar locations have not been widely studied the reclamation of such land is both technically and financially demanding and therefore it is usually attempted in regions with poor land resources the main benefit of karst reclamation is the provision of large land parcels for grapevine cultivation because the land with fertile and deep soil at lower positions such as polje and doline is usually highly fragmented or already occupied by other crops thus not suitable for grapevine plantations from stony soils derived from limestone well drained soils with pockets of clayey or silty clayey material are produced which are rapidly colonized by vine roots corti et al 2011 in such locations water that can be used for irrigation is generally scarce and frequently salinized over the growing season recently advanced sensing techniques such as hyperspectral remote sensing have provided evidence of plant water stress and its severity in vineyards from reclaimed karst zovko et al 2019 based on the identified problems the experiment was set up in a vineyard established on a land parcel derived from the limestone plateau located at the very edge of the adriatic coast with the general aim to test the effects of various irrigation regimes on berry development berry quality and the prevention of grapevine water stress the purpose of this study was to provide insight into the development of a water efficient management strategy in vineyards established on stony soils in the area with frequent occurrence of extremely high air temperatures during vegetation period the specific objectives were to evaluate the effects of different irrigation regimes based on grapevine water use quantification 50 75 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration which was estimated by measuring the i total leaf area ii leaf gas exchange performance and iii yield and quality of grapevines grown on reclaimed mediterranean karst land in two years with the difference in duration and intensity of high temperature periods during the application of irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics and climate experiments were conducted during two successive years 2015 and 2016 in a commercial vineyard established in 2010 on a site obtained by karst reclamation šibenik croatia 43 39 57 n 15 58 44 e fig 1 a the substrate was produced by stone crushing to a depth of 0 6 m the native soil types in the area were regosol and shallow brown soil on limestone the distribution of rock fragments in such a substrate is highly variable regarding their ratio shape and size within the root zone in the surface to 25 cm depth layer the proportion of rock fragments 25 mm in diameter amounts to 81 fig 1b the texture of fine soil particles with a diameter below 2 mm is silty clay loam mixed with small rock fragments that have been left after crushing which are the size of fine coarse sand the underlying layer found at a depth of 25 60 cm is dominated by large blocks of crushed rock

soil fraction is alkaline phkcl 7 6 containing variable contents of caco3 10 48 and humus 3 5 6 0 in general soils developed on the limestone of dinaric karst contain an adequate concentration of available potassium but a very low available phosphorus concentration based on the climatic data from the nearest meteorological station located in city of šibenik for period from 1981 2010 the climate is considered mediterranean with hot dry summers and mild rainy winters šegota and filipčić 2003 the average annual rainfall amounts to 750 mm of which approximately 60 falls during the grapevine dormancy period the area is generally windy with an average annual wind speed of 3 9 m s 1 all climatic parameters e g radiation insolation and evapotranspiration reach their maximum in july except for wind speed due to the significant variation in specific climatic features over short distances data collected from the šibenik meteorological station were not considered completely reliable for the study site therefore an automated weather station was installed at the study site pinova meteo weather station http pinova meteo com hr hr to record the air temperature relative air humidity precipitation leaf moisture wind speed and direction solar radiation and soil moisture in 10 minute intervals in 2015 the total annual rainfall amounted to 1016 mm which was considerably higher than the average for the region 750 mm but the 757 mm of rainfall in 2016 was close to the long term precipitation average in 2015 the total precipitation during the grapevine growing period amounted to 619 mm compared to the 408 mm in 2016 in contrast to the precipitation no major differences in the annual temperature were noticed the sum of the effective temperatures defined as total summation of daily average air temperature above 10 c from april 1 to october 31 in the northern hemisphere which are crucial for the growth and development of grapevines was 2394 in 2015 and 2227 4 in 2016 the reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficient kc were used to compute the daily amount of water required by the vines etc using the equation etc kc et0 allen et al 1998 the values of kc were derived from previous experiments girona et al 2006 marsal et al 2014 and adjusted for the specific stage of canopy development as follows for the initial stage kc in 0 2 for the mid season stage

seven year old babić vines grafted on 110r rootstock was cordon trained with four spurs each with two buds total of eight buds per vine and shoots were vertically positioned the distance between vines was 0 8 m with 1 5 m between rows the experiment was conducted on three separate grapevine rows with 50 vines each and with one row of isolation between the irrigation treatments fig 1a drip irrigation was applied based on the daily water balance in the days without rain the evapotranspiration lost was compensated by irrigation in the rainy days irrigation was postponed until the sum of effective precipitation had been consumed by etc wetting percentage was estimated on 20 the experimental treatments and their abbreviations are shown in table 1 the drip lines were placed along each row with 2 l h 1 emitters placed 0 6 m apart the water addition per treatment was adjusted by installing 1 2 or 3 pipe lines which enabled the application of rising water quantities according to the experimental irrigation treatments while the duration of irrigation was the same for all treatments a web based galcon gsi irrigation controller http galconc com was used for remote irrigation system

irrigation no marked differences for the reference evapotranspiration et0 between the two experimental seasons 2015 and 2016 were recorded the et0 amounted to 1200 and 1145 mm during 2015 and 2016 respectively during the growing seasons the et0 reached 1021 8 and 958 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 a and b the crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated as 458 mm in 2015 and 431 mm during 2016 which means that both the et0 and etc were approximately 6 higher during 2015 irrigation started when the sum of the etc daily values exceeded the sum of the precipitation which occurred in the first week of june in 2015 and in the second week of june 2016 fig 2a and b irrigation was applied 46 and 41 times in 2015 and 2016 respectively during both seasons irrigation ended in the third week of august fig 2a and b during 2015 84 mm of water was applied in the irr 50 treatment 169 mm in the irr 75 treatment and 253 mm in the irr 100 treatment fig 2a during 2016 70 mm of water was applied in the irr 50 treatment 155 mm in the irr 75 treatment and 259 mm in the irr 100 treatment fig 2b although the variation in the sum of temperatures between the two experimental seasons does not vary distinctively the differences in the appearance and duration of the high temperature events are evident table 3 as shown in fig 3 the highest temperature in 2015 reached 38 8 while in 2016 this was 36 5 furthermore in 2015 the sum of temperatures above 35 lasted over 64 5 h an extreme event was recorded on july 7 2015 before véraison when temperatures higher than 35 lasted continuously for 6 5 h all other high temperature events occurred during the grape ripening stage recorded on july 17 in the control plot during 2016 temperatures above 35 lasted over 12 h and 20 min but only for 40 min at the ripening stage recorded on july 20 in the control plot 3 2 total leaf area tla the tla of the vines grown in the control plot did not differ significantly from vines grown in the irr 50 treatment plot during both years while the irr 100 treatment resulted in a significantly higher tla than that of the other treatments and control during both experimental seasons table 4 3 3 grapevine leaf gas exchange parameters higher average values for the net photosynthetic rate a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei as well as a lower mesophyll co2 concentration ci were obtained from the 1st compared to the 2nd measurement period table 5 irrigation treatments increased the net photosynthetic rate and the highest a for both measurements were obtained in treatment irr 100 while the lowest was observed in the control table 5 however a was significantly affected by the irrigation treatment measurement time interaction since in the 1st measurement no difference was determined in a between the control and irr 50 treatments whereas in the 2nd measurement there was no difference in a between treatments irr 75 and irr 100 table 5 irrigation treatments increased the average transpiration rate e in both measurements and the highest e was obtained in irr 100 and lowest in the control table 5 however a significant irrigation measurement time interaction was found for e since no difference was found between irr 50 and irr 75 in the 1st measurement table 5 the stomatal conductance gs increased with rising irrigation rates in both measurements table 5 the average mesophyll co2 concentration ci increased according to the irrigation treatment compared to control however in the 1st measurement the highest ci was obtained in the irr 75 and irr 50 treatments in the 2nd measurement the highest ci was obtained in the irr 50 treatment while the ci decreased in irr 75 and irr 100 table 5 the irrigation treatments decreased the average intrinsic water use efficiency wuei compared to the control the highest wuei was obtained in the control and lowest wuei was obtained in the irr 75 and irr 100 treatments however in the 1st measurement no difference was recorded in the wuei between the irr 50 irr 75 and irr 100 treatments and in the 2nd measurement between the control and irr 50 treatments and between the irr 75 and irr 100 treatments table 5 3 4 yield components and grape quality the dynamics of berry juice total soluble solids tss accumulation and titratable acidity ta reduction in the period from véraison to harvest are presented in fig 4 during both experimental seasons significant differences were determined among the irrigation treatments for the tss and ta during grape ripening specifically during both experimental seasons significantly higher tss levels were determined in berries of vines grown in the control plot at the beginning of véraison than in all irrigated plots with the exception of the control and irr 75 in 2016 though the irrigation treatments did not significantly differ during maturation the accumulation of tss in berry juice obtained from irrigated vines occurred more intensively resulting in the lowest tss levels in the control plot with the exception of the control and irr 50 in 2015 at the stage of full maturity a significantly lower berry juice ta was determined for vines grown in the control plot than for all three irrigated plots but only during the first sampling in 2015 the first experimental season was also characterized by faster ta reduction during ripening concentrations of tartaric and malic acid at full maturity did not differ significantly among the irrigation treatments but the control differed significantly from all of them table 6 a significantly higher concentration of tartaric acid and significantly lower concentration of malic acid were determined for vines grown in the control plot compared to all irrigation treatments and during both experimental seasons irrigation significantly affected the malic acid berry juice concentration during both seasons but the interactions between the irrigation and season were not significant for the tartaric and malic acid juice concentrations the grape yield juice yield cluster weight and berry weight were significantly higher for irrigated vines compared to control vines during both years table 6 the number of clusters did not significantly differ between vines grown in the control and irrigated plots with the exception of the significantly higher number of clusters produced on vines from irr 100 in comparison to vines grown in the control plot in 2016 as shown in fig 5 the dynamics of polyphenols were significantly affected by different irrigation treatments during both experimental seasons the highest concentration of anthocyanins during both seasons and for each measurement time was determined in the grape juice from the control plot the maximum anthocyanin concentrations were observed during the 4th measuring time though these differed considerably between the seasons the irrigation treatments certainly affected the biosynthesis of flavonoids in particular anthocyanins the production of anthocyanins in grapes from all experimental variants and during both seasons were typically bell shaped fig 5 however during harvest in 2015 the accumulation in grapes from vines grown in the control plot was significantly higher compared to all irrigated plots in 2016 significantly different concentrations of anthocyanins were observed only between the control and irr 100 plots which means that the biosynthesis of anthocyanins was certainly modulated by the water supply similar effects were observed for the concentration dynamics of flavonols and flavanols during the grape ripening period fig 5 even though the differences between the two seasons were also evident the response of grape performance to water supply can be additionally described by the correlation between the various yield parameters and grape juice quality as shown in fig 6 a highly significant positive correlation was determined between the total amount of water applied by rainfall and irrigation and the yield berry and cluster weight and number of clusters during both experimental seasons 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors and irrigation strategy this study supports the premise that high within vineyard variation of the properties of stony soil formed on remediated karst which along with seasonal climatic differences is a huge challenge for grapevine growers regarding issues such as water management grapevine phonological development and juice quality remediated karst agricultural land is a highly specific environment because it is created artificially by crashing limestone outcrops at coastal parts of dinaric karst as shown in fig 1 the produced substrate differs substantially from natural stony and gravelly soils which are used worldwide for wine grape growing and is characterized by a high spatial variability of both physical and chemical properties the wine grape growing media at the study site is enriched by a low share of a highly reactive fine soil fraction which forms organo mineral complexes as a stock of plant nutrients churchman 2018 also highlights the functional role of clay minerals and importance of the effects of its surface properties such as the adsorption of nutrients and organic matter on soil fertility along with water and nutritional status the most influential environmental factors on fruit composition including all external stimuli are light radiation and temperature teixeira et al 2013 evidently two experimental seasons presented in this study differ considerably in the sum of temperatures but not in sunlight irradiation as shown in table 7 in regions with mediterranean type climates vineyard water status and related vine growth and juice quality are issues of concern for grapevine growers romic et al 2012 2014 the benefits of grapevine irrigation are widely reported in the literature but practical protocols based on specific local conditions are required for farmers to apply advanced irrigation techniques 4 2 interactive effects of irrigation treatments and grapevine physiology irrigation started before flowering and approximately 50 of the total water was applied before véraison which resulted in a higher tla with higher irrigation treatments at this stage as shown in table 4 the first significant evidence of water stress on a cellular level was a decrease in the turgor pressure and thus turgor dependant activities such as cell growth and leaf expansion which are the most sensitive processes to water deficit taiz and zeiger 2012 furthermore the photosynthetic rate was mostly restricted by a decreased gs which was affected by a water deficit occurring at decreased irrigation rates savi et al 2018 explained that the fast stomatal closure under drought conditions was isohydric behaviour which is considered advantageous under dry conditions this result is further confirmed by the calculation of wuei namely wuei increased with the increasing water deficit due to a higher reduction of gs compared to a for grapevine reduced stomatal conductance caused by an irrigation deficit resulted in an improved water use efficiency and productivity thus approaching those of non stress conditions chaves et al 2007 zufferey et al 2017 the reduction of gs caused the concomitant reduction of e and ci table 5 however e was more affected compared to ci which can be explained by the higher concentration gradients in water vapour compared to the co2 concentration gradient between the leaf mesophyll and surrounding air taiz and zeiger 2012 in addition to the water deficit temperatures above 30 which were frequent in 2015 affected the carboxylation activity of rubisco and increased its affinity to oxygenation which was indicated by higher ci values obtained from irr 75 and irr 50 treated vines compared to irr 100 during the first and second measurement times respectively as a c3 plant the rubisco carboxylation activity of grapevine is susceptible to drought and high temperatures medrano et al 2003 taiz and zeiger 2012 although several authors reported that increased grapevine leaf temperatures between 30 and 44 do not cause the permanent reduction of carbon acquisition chaves et al 2010 greer 2017 in addition the highest transpiration rate obtained at irr 100 might foster leaf cooling and thus mitigate the effects of high temperatures on photorespiration 4 3 effects of irrigation on grapevine physiology grape quality yield components and vine vigour the highest level of juice tss berry skin anthocyanins and lowest level of juice ta were recorded for the control vines during the first sampling during both experimental seasons which suggests that the maturation of unirrigated vines started earlier than that of the irrigated ones in general environmental factors that promote plant vigour such as sufficient water availability may negatively affect flavonoid biosynthesis braidot et al 2008 it is reported that vine roots in drying soil produce abscisic acid aba which promotes grapevine ripening stoll et al 2000 moreover for grapevine increased aba synthesis is associated with fruit maturation and quality because it increases sugar accumulation and decreases the titrable acid concentration setha 2012 as well as increases the total anthocyanins and total phenolic concentrations cantín et al 2007 sandhu et al 2011 this effect is common for different vine cultivars grown in various soil types esteban et al 1999 castellarin et al 2007 deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 there are also studies that have not detected an effect of water deficit on tss at vérasion ojeda et al 2002 or have detected a negative impact of pre vérasion water deficit on the start of vérasion romero et al 2013 during grape maturation water deficit had a strong negative effect on tss accumulation in grapes from the control plants this happens if the reduction in the stomatal conductance and therefore reduced photosynthesis outweighs the positive effects of water deficit van leeuwen et al 2009 at the final stages of grape maturation the tss concentration trend was opposite to the one at vérasion with the lowest tss level recorded for the control plants and the highest for irrigation level irr 50 this confirms the findings of other studies that have suggested that water deficit has a positive impact on the tss concentration but only to a certain level deluc et al 2009 in the case of anthocyanin accumulation at first sampling vérasion a significantly higher concentration was observed in berries from control vines in comparison to irrigated vines in contrast grapes from control vines had higher levels of total anthocyanin concentrations in the fresh berry weight during maturation and at harvest this effect can be attributed to the increased transcription of genes responsible for anthocyanin synthesis induced by a water deficit in specific cultivars deluc et al 2009 additionally the dilution effect due to increased berry size under increased water availability roby et al 2004 can result in a lower anthocyanin concentration which also corresponds to the negative correlation between berry anthocyanins and the irrigation levels used in our research a similar effect of increased water availability on the anthocyanin concentration was observed for other cultivars such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot kennedy et al 2002 castellarin et al 2007 deluc et al 2009 the highest level of anthocyanins was detected in grapes from the 4th sampling time during both experimental seasons when tss reached 80 90 oe for all irrigation treatments followed by a decrease at the last sampling date this process is attributed to an enzymatic degradation of the most abundant anthocyanin malvidin 3 o glicoside in ripened grapes pastore et al 2013 other anthocyanins can also be affected deluc et al 2009 resulting in a decrease in the total anthocyanins concentration during advanced stages of grape maturation this maximum concentration of anthocyanins is an indicator of the phenolic ripeness of grapes which is specific for different cultivars because of the effects of high temperatures during grape ripening many grapevine cultivars used for wine production achieve full phenolic ripeness at a high tss resulting in an extremely high wine alcohol level mira de orduña 2010 on the contrary the native variety babić shows a good adaptation to the warm mediterranean climate and reaches phenolic ripeness at relatively low tss concentrations for this reason at the stage when the tss reaches a concentration typical for premium red wines from this cultivar close to 100 oe it has also reached the maximum anthocyanin concentration a higher tss level in the case of irrigated vines allows for an earlier harvest closer to the phenolic ripeness which can partially compensate the lower concentration of polyphenols induced by the irrigation tartaric acid concentrations in juice at full ripeness are quite stable and specific for certain cultivars while malic acid is affected by different environmental factors and can vary greatly preiner et al 2013 accordingly in our research different irrigation treatments did not significantly affect the concentration of tartaric acid on the other hand unirrigated control vines had a significantly higher tartaric acid concentration than the irrigated vines therefore compared to the irrigated vines a higher tartaric acid concentration was recorded for unirrigated wines under water deficit esteban et al 1999 this can be explained by the fact that the content of tartaric acid per berry was not changed significantly after vérasion while the concentration decrease during maturation happens because of berry growth which is suppressed in the case of water deficit shellie 2010 the yield berry and cluster size and number of clusters per wine were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments showing a highly positive correlation with the total amount of water applied by rainfall and irrigation similar results were obtained in other studies related to the effects of water deficit and irrigation bravdo et al 1985 chaves et al 2007 keller et al 2016 the earliest detectable significant effect of water stress on a cellular level is a decrease in turgor pressure and thus turgor dependent activities such as cell growth and leaf expansion are the most sensitive processes to water deficit taiz and zeiger 2012 this is also confirmed in our study by the tla differences found between vines under different levels of irrigation and control vines based on the results for the total grape and juice yield per wine it can be concluded that a significant increase in yield occurs in the case of irrigated wines with differences between the applied irrigation levels juice wine yield loss due to reduced water availability is largely based on the reduction of cluster and berry weights 4 4 effects of high temperatures on grapevine performance difference between an unusually warm year 2015 and year with average temperatures 2016 reveals additional information about the negative effects of high temperatures on the performance of grapevine despite or in combination with the application of irrigation these effects are probably even more intensive due to the specific karstic soil type with limited water storage estrada medina et al 2012 the first experimental season in 2015 was characterised by extremely high temperatures during the ripening period which were not evident in 2016 differences were not only recorded for maximum temperatures reaching 38 8 in 2015 and 36 5 in 2016 but also for the duration of extremely high temperatures even though identical irrigation treatments were applied during both experimental seasons significant differences were observed for most of the measured parameters yield number of clusters per vine average cluster weight juice malic acid content berries anthocyanin and flavanols and flavonols concentrations the dynamics of tss accumulation in 2015 reveals the severe effects of temperature and water stress which resulted in a very low increase in tss between the 2nd and 3rd samplings for the control vines a period corresponding to a time of extremely high temperatures as noticed before water deficit along with high temperatures affected photosynthetic metabolism by reducing the stomatal conductivity carboxylation activity and increased oxygenation activity of rubisco during simultaneous heat and drought conditions stomatal movements oppose those that occur during heat alone rizhsky et al 2004 resulting in the inhibition of metabolism thus leading to reduced metabolite accumulations mira de orduña 2010 the rapid decrease of ta in 2015 compared to 2016 for both the control and irrigated vines also reveals that severe temperature stress was present in 2015 the 50 reduction in the juice ta concentration after vérasion in only 10 days from 19 85 to 10 13 g l 1 can be attributed to the degradation of malic acid in the grapes malic acid is an important source of carbon for respiration gluconeogenesis and other pathways during ripening in the case of limited transpiration and photosynthesis sweetman et al 2014 related to high temperatures the negative effects of high temperatures during and after vérasion are known to have a negative influence on anthocyanin synthesis spayd et al 2002 fernandes de oliveira et al 2015 especially if high daily temperatures are followed by warm nights mori et al 2005 which was the case in 2015 it has already been reported that temperatures 30 reduce anthocyanin synthesis while temperatures 37 can lead to a complete and irreversible inhibition of their synthesis for some cultivars kliewer 1977 mira de orduña 2010 according to several studies of different plant species including grapevine lin wang et al 2011 yamane et al 2006 this can be attributed to an inhibition of the expression of anthocyanin activators and related structural genes enhancement of their repressors and reduced enzymatic activities in anthocyanin biosynthesis during high temperatures especially in the case of both high day and night temperatures besides reduced synthesis high temperatures can also lead to the degradation of anthocyanins induced by an increased activity of peroxidase enzymes as the direct effect of thermal stress liu et al 2018 different patterns concerning the degradation of flavanols and flavonols as well as variations in their final concentrations between the two experimental seasons correspond to the effects of high temperatures on this groups of polyphenols fujita et al 2006 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the irrigation effects on grapevine grown in land parcels on reclaimed mediterranean karst during two experimental seasons 2015 and 2016 the irrigation strategy was based on the daily amount of water required by vines etc using high density observations from the automated weather station installed at the study site the appearance and duration of high temperatures in 2015 resulted in the different performance of grapevine compared to the 2016 season however irrigation managed to mitigate most of the negative effects which may be expected due to the vine temperature stress the native grapevine babić is certainly well adapted to the mediterranean climatic conditions but vine grape production on reclaimed karst combined with extreme climatic events such as heat incidence may have a severe effect on the vine performance and yield irrigation mitigates the negative effects of water deficit and heat stress on grapevine by positively affecting gas exchange parameters positive effects of irrigation were confirmed by the increased yield and tss while mild water stress positively affected the concentration of anthocyanins and other polyphenols an additional positive effect of irrigation was the synchronisation of tss and phenolic ripening all of these possible benefits should be considered when defining the irrigation level for wine production on reclaimed karst in our study the irrigation level in which 50 of the total evapotranspiration was supplemented did not compromise the balance between the yield level and quality higher levels of irrigation resulted in an additional increase in yield and in a higher juice total soluble solids concentration but also in a decrease in grape skin polyphenols especially anthocyanins which can result in lower wine quality declaration

10612,stony karst landscape in the adriatic coastal area has been cultivated for centuries to grow mediterranean crops shallow and less fertile soils were mostly used for rain fed grapevine and olive production native grapevine cultivars are in general well adapted to the warm and droughty climate but a rapid drift in weather patterns characterized mostly by long lasting high temperature events during the growing season urges the producers to apply irrigation this research studying the effects of different irrigation levels on babić grapevine performance was carried out in two growing seasons 2015 and 2016 with contrasting weather conditions in a vineyard established on a parcel of land derived from the stony surface of a limestone plateau on the very edge of the eastern adriatic coast the study evaluated the effects of different irrigation regimes based on the quantification of grapevine water use 50 75 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration by measuring the total leaf area leaf gas exchange performance and grape yield and quality the irrigation treatments increased the total leaf area net photosynthetic rate average transpiration rate and average mesophyll co2 concentration the yield components and grape quality were also affected by the irrigation treatments positive effects of irrigation in both the experimental seasons were associated with increased yield and total soluble solids tss as well as synchronized tss and phenolic ripening furthermore water stress positively affected the concentrations of anthocyanins and other polyphenols in both years of the study in 2015 extremely high temperatures reduced the grape yield juice yield and anthocyanin content in grapes in non irrigated vines as well as in all irrigation treatments irrigation was efficient in reducing these negative effects except in the case of the anthocyanin content keywords stony soils drought water stress polyphenols total leaf area grapevine yield and quality 1 introduction karst landscapes are widespread along the mediterranean area including the croatian adriatic coast and islands in the context of agricultural land use this region is known for extreme climatic conditions the intensity and duration of anomalous weather events including extreme precipitation droughts or high temperature occurrences vary over the years simolo et al 2012 additionally trenberth 2011 documented that high impact weather events or even extremes have increased in the past decades on the global scale due to the extremely complex landscape configuration of the dinaric karst climatic conditions can be considerably variable even over short time periods furthermore strong wind events in the eastern adriatic coast are also related to the land sea discontinuity and hinterland orography pandžić and likso 2005 stony soils are widespread across the globe and represent a signiﬁcant part of agricultural land van wesemael et al 1995 it was estimated that as much as 30 of soils in western europe are stony and they occupy more than 60 of the land in the mediterranean region poesen and lavee 1994 furthermore their usage tends to increase because of the erosion and cultivation of marginal lands garcía ruiz 2010 or by the remediation and cultivation of rocky hillslopes or highlands due to the high complexity of relief forms steep slopes shallow stony soils sparse natural vegetation and lack of surface water karst surfaces have been subjected to anthropogenic modification to enhance their agricultural potential two specific forms of human hillslope modification in karst environments in the dinaric region to create deeper soils and a flat surface suitable for cultivation are stone walled terrace fronts built from the removal of large blocks of limestone from the original hillslope and doline the creation of a surface suitable for cultivation following the infilling of a funnel shaped form lewin and woodward 2009 these forms reflect the historical mission of the local people to cultivate apparently non fertile land furthermore some of these agricultural landscape features such as stony terraces are now protected as cultural landscapes andlar et al 2017 and mostly used for the production of native grapevine cultivars such as babić and the famous high quality red wine on these sites without irrigation high grape and wine qualities but very low yields are obtained however when grown on sites of fertile deep soils with full irrigation this particular cultivar shows a significant increase in yield but the quality of the grape and wine is quite low zdunić 2005 maletić et al 2015 in the last two decades more than 5000 ha of the karst stony terraces and steep slopes of the eastern adriatic coast have been reclaimed by stone crushing to provide land suitable for agricultural production mostly for grapevines and olives land parcels obtained after karst reclamation are characterized by a high proportion of stones and rock fragments variable ratio concerning the fine soil fraction and low water holding capacity the low water holding capacity of such soils along with the low precipitation rate during the main vegetation season increases the sensitivity of grapevine to drought water stress and increasing air temperatures are reported to be among the most influential impacts of climate change on agriculture affecting the length of the growing season changes in phenology and ultimately product quality water stress is a limiting factor for a wide range of physiological processes ondrasek 2014 including grapevine photosynthesis and leaf transpiration chaves et al 2010 in addition water stress is often accompanied with other stressful factors such as high temperatures and irradiance which are especially prominent in the mediterranean region flexas et al 1999 grape quality is strongly determined by the air temperature during the ripening period tarara et al 2008 in spite of its drought tolerance grapevine growth is highly affected by global climate change and irrigation is adopted as a common practice in vineyards located in regions with seasonal drought regulated deficit irrigation i e spatially and or temporally manipulated irrigation that is defined by the application of decreased amounts of water in relation to the full crop evapotranspiration during the whole agricultural cycle or only during certain growth periods has shown positive effects on the grape quality and yield increase chaves et al 2007 prevention of photochemical down regulation in grapevines and maintaining high photosystem ii psii efficiency flexas et al 1998 in addition it also results in a higher grape and wine quality with lower water consumption compared to full irrigation bravdo et al 1985 medrano et al 2003 chaves et al 2007 furthermore mild water stress can increase the proportion of the berry surface area to volume ratio of mesocarp tissue by restricting berry growth kennedy et al 2002 ojeda et al 2002 but can also directly increase the concentrations and amounts of specific compounds such as skin tannins and anthocyanins roby et al 2004 specific environmental conditions for grapevine growing on reclaimed karst or similar locations have not been widely studied the reclamation of such land is both technically and financially demanding and therefore it is usually attempted in regions with poor land resources the main benefit of karst reclamation is the provision of large land parcels for grapevine cultivation because the land with fertile and deep soil at lower positions such as polje and doline is usually highly fragmented or already occupied by other crops thus not suitable for grapevine plantations from stony soils derived from limestone well drained soils with pockets of clayey or silty clayey material are produced which are rapidly colonized by vine roots corti et al 2011 in such locations water that can be used for irrigation is generally scarce and frequently salinized over the growing season recently advanced sensing techniques such as hyperspectral remote sensing have provided evidence of plant water stress and its severity in vineyards from reclaimed karst zovko et al 2019 based on the identified problems the experiment was set up in a vineyard established on a land parcel derived from the limestone plateau located at the very edge of the adriatic coast with the general aim to test the effects of various irrigation regimes on berry development berry quality and the prevention of grapevine water stress the purpose of this study was to provide insight into the development of a water efficient management strategy in vineyards established on stony soils in the area with frequent occurrence of extremely high air temperatures during vegetation period the specific objectives were to evaluate the effects of different irrigation regimes based on grapevine water use quantification 50 75 and 100 of crop evapotranspiration which was estimated by measuring the i total leaf area ii leaf gas exchange performance and iii yield and quality of grapevines grown on reclaimed mediterranean karst land in two years with the difference in duration and intensity of high temperature periods during the application of irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics and climate experiments were conducted during two successive years 2015 and 2016 in a commercial vineyard established in 2010 on a site obtained by karst reclamation šibenik croatia 43 39 57 n 15 58 44 e fig 1 a the substrate was produced by stone crushing to a depth of 0 6 m the native soil types in the area were regosol and shallow brown soil on limestone the distribution of rock fragments in such a substrate is highly variable regarding their ratio shape and size within the root zone in the surface to 25 cm depth layer the proportion of rock fragments 25 mm in diameter amounts to 81 fig 1b the texture of fine soil particles with a diameter below 2 mm is silty clay loam mixed with small rock fragments that have been left after crushing which are the size of fine coarse sand the underlying layer found at a depth of 25 60 cm is dominated by large blocks of crushed rock

climate is considered mediterranean with hot dry summers and mild rainy winters šegota and filipčić 2003 the average annual rainfall amounts to 750 mm of which approximately 60 falls during the grapevine dormancy period the area is generally windy with an average annual wind speed of 3 9 m s 1 all climatic parameters e g radiation insolation and evapotranspiration reach their maximum in july except for wind speed due to the significant variation in specific climatic features over short distances data collected from the šibenik meteorological station were not considered completely reliable for the study site therefore an automated weather station was installed at the study site pinova meteo weather station http pinova meteo com hr hr to record the air temperature relative air humidity precipitation leaf moisture wind speed and direction solar radiation and soil moisture in 10 minute intervals in 2015 the total annual rainfall amounted to 1016 mm which was considerably higher than the average for the region 750 mm but the 757 mm of rainfall in 2016 was close to the long term precipitation average in 2015 the total precipitation during the grapevine growing period amounted to 619 mm compared to the 408 mm in 2016 in contrast to the precipitation no major differences in the annual temperature were noticed the sum of the effective temperatures defined as total summation of daily average air temperature above 10 c from april 1 to october 31 in the northern hemisphere which are crucial for the growth and development of grapevines was 2394 in 2015 and 2227 4 in 2016 the reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficient kc were used to compute the daily amount of water required by the vines etc using the equation etc kc et0 allen et al 1998 the values of kc were derived from previous experiments girona et al 2006 marsal et al 2014 and adjusted for the specific stage of canopy development as follows for the initial stage kc in 0 2 for the mid season stage

seven year old babić vines grafted on 110r rootstock was cordon trained with four spurs each with two buds total of eight buds per vine and shoots were vertically positioned the distance between vines was 0 8 m with 1 5 m between rows the experiment was conducted on three separate grapevine rows with 50 vines each and with one row of isolation between the irrigation treatments fig 1a drip irrigation was applied based on the daily water balance in the days without rain the evapotranspiration lost was compensated by irrigation in the rainy days irrigation was postponed until the sum of effective precipitation had been consumed by etc wetting percentage was estimated on 20 the experimental treatments and their abbreviations are shown in table 1 the drip lines were placed along each row with 2 l h 1 emitters placed 0 6 m apart the water addition per treatment was adjusted by installing 1 2 or 3 pipe lines which enabled the application of rising water quantities according to the experimental irrigation treatments while the duration of irrigation was the same for all treatments a web based galcon gsi irrigation controller http galconc com was used for remote irrigation system

stage of full berry development before véraison on july 8 and during grape ripening on july 30 2015 the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei was calculated as a quotient of the net photosynthetic rate a and stomatal conductance gs 2 4 phenology and grape ripening pattern the sampling pattern followed the grape ripening stages from véraison to full maturity in rather uniform intervals across five sampling dates table 2 at each sampling date three samples consisting of 50 randomly chosen berries from 10 individual clusters and from different positions on each cluster were taken from each

parameters were determined cluster length and width cluster weight number of berries per cluster and average berry weight the proportion of juice in each cluster was determined after the mechanical composition analysis of the clusters and used to calculate the yield per vine the tss ta and ph values were determined using standard methods oiv 2009 from three random fresh juice samples per

expressed as mg per fresh berry weight 2 6 statistical analysis all variables were examined separately by analysis of variance anova and means separations were performed by duncan s multiple range tests at p 0 05 to establish whether there were significant differences among the treatments correlations between the measured parameters and total amount of water applied by rainfall and irrigation during the two experimental seasons 2015 and 2016 were determined using the pearson coefficients all statistical analyses were performed using sas software v 9 3 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions and irrigation no marked differences for the reference evapotranspiration et0 between the two experimental seasons 2015 and 2016 were recorded the et0 amounted to 1200 and 1145 mm during 2015 and 2016 respectively during the growing seasons the et0 reached 1021 8 and 958 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 2 a and b the crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated as 458 mm in 2015 and 431 mm during 2016 which means that both the et0 and etc were approximately 6 higher during 2015 irrigation started when the sum of the etc daily values exceeded the sum of the precipitation which occurred in the first week of june in 2015 and in the second week of june 2016 fig 2a and b irrigation was applied 46 and 41 times in 2015 and 2016 respectively during both seasons irrigation ended in the third week of august fig 2a and b during 2015 84 mm of water was applied in the irr 50 treatment 169 mm in the irr 75 treatment and 253 mm in the irr 100 treatment fig 2a during 2016 70 mm of water was applied in the irr 50 treatment 155 mm in the irr 75 treatment and 259 mm in the irr 100 treatment fig 2b although the variation in the sum of temperatures between the two experimental seasons does not vary distinctively the differences in the appearance and duration of the high temperature events are evident table 3 as shown in fig 3 the highest temperature in 2015 reached 38 8 while in 2016 this was 36 5 furthermore in 2015 the sum of temperatures above 35 lasted over 64 5 h an extreme event was recorded on july 7 2015 before véraison when temperatures higher than 35 lasted continuously for 6 5 h all other high temperature events occurred during the grape ripening stage recorded on july 17 in the control plot during 2016 temperatures above 35 lasted over 12 h and 20 min but only for 40 min at the ripening stage recorded on july 20 in the control plot 3 2 total leaf area tla the tla of the vines grown in the control plot did not differ significantly from vines grown in the irr 50 treatment plot during both years while the irr 100 treatment resulted in a significantly higher tla than that of the other treatments and control during both experimental seasons table 4 3 3 grapevine leaf gas exchange parameters higher average values for the net photosynthetic rate a stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei as well as a lower mesophyll co2 concentration ci were obtained from the 1st compared to the 2nd measurement period table 5 irrigation treatments increased the net photosynthetic rate and the highest a for both measurements were obtained in treatment irr 100 while the lowest was observed in the control table 5 however a was significantly affected by the irrigation treatment measurement time interaction since in the 1st measurement no difference was determined in a between the control and irr 50 treatments whereas in the 2nd measurement there was no difference in a between treatments irr 75 and irr 100 table 5 irrigation treatments increased the average transpiration rate e in both measurements and the highest e was obtained in irr 100 and lowest in the control table 5 however a significant irrigation measurement time interaction was found for e since no difference was found between irr 50 and irr 75 in the 1st measurement table 5 the stomatal conductance gs increased with rising irrigation rates in both measurements table 5 the average mesophyll co2 concentration ci increased according to the irrigation treatment compared to control however in the 1st measurement the highest ci was obtained in the irr 75 and irr 50 treatments in the 2nd measurement the highest ci was obtained in the irr 50 treatment while the ci decreased in irr 75 and irr 100 table 5 the irrigation treatments decreased the average intrinsic water use efficiency wuei compared to the control the highest wuei was obtained in the control and lowest wuei was obtained in the irr 75 and irr 100 treatments however in the 1st measurement no difference was recorded in the wuei between the irr 50 irr 75 and irr 100 treatments and in the 2nd measurement between the control and irr 50 treatments and between the irr 75 and irr 100 treatments table 5 3 4 yield components and grape quality the dynamics of berry juice total soluble solids tss accumulation and titratable acidity ta reduction in the period from véraison to harvest are presented in fig 4 during both experimental seasons significant differences were determined among the irrigation treatments for the tss and ta during grape ripening specifically during both experimental seasons significantly higher tss levels were determined in berries of vines grown in the control plot at the beginning of véraison than in all irrigated plots with the exception of the control and irr 75 in 2016 though the irrigation treatments did not significantly differ during maturation the accumulation of tss in berry juice obtained from irrigated vines occurred more intensively resulting in the lowest tss levels in the control plot with the exception of the control and irr 50 in 2015 at the stage of full maturity a significantly lower berry juice ta was determined for vines grown in the control plot than for all three irrigated plots but only during the first sampling in 2015 the first experimental season was also characterized by faster ta reduction during ripening concentrations of tartaric and malic acid at full maturity did not differ significantly among the irrigation treatments but the control differed significantly from all of them table 6 a significantly higher concentration of tartaric acid and significantly lower concentration of malic acid were determined for vines grown in the control plot compared to all irrigation treatments and during both experimental seasons irrigation significantly affected the malic acid berry juice concentration during both seasons but the interactions between the irrigation and season were not significant for the tartaric and malic acid juice concentrations the grape yield juice yield cluster weight and berry weight were significantly higher for irrigated vines compared to control vines during both years table 6 the number of clusters did not significantly differ between vines grown in the control and irrigated plots with the exception of the significantly higher number of clusters produced on vines from irr 100 in comparison to vines grown in the control plot in 2016 as shown in fig 5 the dynamics of polyphenols were significantly affected by different irrigation treatments during both experimental seasons the highest concentration of anthocyanins during both seasons and for each measurement time was determined in the grape juice from the control plot the maximum anthocyanin concentrations were observed during the 4th measuring time though these differed considerably between the seasons the irrigation treatments certainly affected the biosynthesis of flavonoids in particular anthocyanins the production of anthocyanins in grapes from all experimental variants and during both seasons were typically bell shaped fig 5 however during harvest in 2015 the accumulation in grapes from vines grown in the control plot was significantly higher compared to all irrigated plots in 2016 significantly different concentrations of anthocyanins were observed only between the control and irr 100 plots which means that the biosynthesis of anthocyanins was certainly modulated by the water supply similar effects were observed for the concentration dynamics of flavonols and flavanols during the grape ripening period fig 5 even though the differences between the two seasons were also evident the response of grape performance to water supply can be additionally described by the correlation between the various yield parameters and grape juice quality as shown in fig 6 a highly significant positive correlation was determined between the total amount of water applied by rainfall and irrigation and the yield berry and cluster weight and number of clusters during both experimental seasons 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors and irrigation strategy this study supports the premise that high within vineyard variation of the properties of stony soil formed on remediated karst which along with seasonal climatic differences is a huge challenge for grapevine growers regarding issues such as water management grapevine phonological development and juice quality remediated karst agricultural land is a highly specific environment because it is created artificially by crashing limestone outcrops at coastal parts of dinaric karst as shown in fig 1 the produced substrate differs substantially from natural stony and gravelly soils which are used worldwide for wine grape growing and is characterized by a high spatial variability of both physical and chemical properties the wine grape growing media at the study site is enriched by a low share of a highly reactive fine soil fraction which forms organo mineral complexes as a stock of plant nutrients churchman 2018 also highlights the functional role of clay minerals and importance of the effects of its surface properties such as the adsorption of nutrients and organic matter on soil fertility along with water and nutritional status the most influential environmental factors on fruit composition including all external stimuli are light radiation and temperature teixeira et al 2013 evidently two experimental seasons presented in this study differ considerably in the sum of temperatures but not in sunlight irradiation as shown in table 7 in regions with mediterranean type climates vineyard water status and related vine growth and juice quality are issues of concern for grapevine growers romic et al 2012 2014 the benefits of grapevine irrigation are widely reported in the literature but practical protocols based on specific local conditions are required for farmers to apply advanced irrigation techniques 4 2 interactive effects of irrigation treatments and grapevine physiology irrigation started before flowering and approximately 50 of the total water was applied before véraison which resulted in a higher tla with higher irrigation treatments at this stage as shown in table 4 the first significant evidence of water stress on a cellular level was a decrease in the turgor pressure and thus turgor dependant activities such as cell growth and leaf expansion which are the most sensitive processes to water deficit taiz and zeiger 2012 furthermore the photosynthetic rate was mostly restricted by a decreased gs which was affected by a water deficit occurring at decreased irrigation rates savi et al 2018 explained that the fast stomatal closure under drought conditions was isohydric behaviour which is considered advantageous under dry conditions this result is further confirmed by the calculation of wuei namely wuei increased with the increasing water deficit due to a higher reduction of gs compared to a for grapevine reduced stomatal conductance caused by an irrigation deficit resulted in an improved water use efficiency and productivity thus approaching those of non stress conditions chaves et al 2007 zufferey et al 2017 the reduction of gs caused the concomitant reduction of e and ci table 5 however e was more affected compared to ci which can be explained by the higher concentration gradients in water vapour compared to the co2 concentration gradient between the leaf mesophyll and surrounding air taiz and zeiger 2012 in addition to the water deficit temperatures above 30 which were frequent in 2015 affected the carboxylation activity of rubisco and increased its affinity to oxygenation which was indicated by higher ci values obtained from irr 75 and irr 50 treated vines compared to irr 100 during the first and second measurement times respectively as a c3 plant the rubisco carboxylation activity of grapevine is susceptible to drought and high temperatures medrano et al 2003 taiz and zeiger 2012 although several authors reported that increased grapevine leaf temperatures between 30 and 44 do not cause the permanent reduction of carbon acquisition chaves et al 2010 greer 2017 in addition the highest transpiration rate obtained at irr 100 might foster leaf cooling and thus mitigate the effects of high temperatures on photorespiration 4 3 effects of irrigation on grapevine physiology grape quality yield components and vine vigour the highest level of juice tss berry skin anthocyanins and lowest level of juice ta were recorded for the control vines during the first sampling during both experimental seasons which suggests that the maturation of unirrigated vines started earlier than that of the irrigated ones in general environmental factors that promote plant vigour such as sufficient water availability may negatively affect flavonoid biosynthesis braidot et al 2008 it is reported that vine roots in drying soil produce abscisic acid aba which promotes grapevine ripening stoll et al 2000 moreover for grapevine increased aba synthesis is associated with fruit maturation and quality because it increases sugar accumulation and decreases the titrable acid concentration setha 2012 as well as increases the total anthocyanins and total phenolic concentrations cantín et al 2007 sandhu et al 2011 this effect is common for different vine cultivars grown in various soil types esteban et al 1999 castellarin et al 2007 deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 there are also studies that have not detected an effect of water deficit on tss at vérasion ojeda et al 2002 or have detected a negative impact of pre vérasion water deficit on the start of vérasion romero et al 2013 during grape maturation water deficit had a strong negative effect on tss accumulation in grapes from the control plants this happens if the reduction in the stomatal conductance and therefore reduced photosynthesis outweighs the positive effects of water deficit van leeuwen et al 2009 at the final stages of grape maturation the tss concentration trend was opposite to the one at vérasion with the lowest tss level recorded for the control plants and the highest for irrigation level irr 50 this confirms the findings of other studies that have suggested that water deficit has a positive impact on the tss concentration but only to a certain level deluc et al 2009 in the case of anthocyanin accumulation at first sampling vérasion a significantly higher concentration was observed in berries from control vines in comparison to irrigated vines in contrast grapes from control vines had higher levels of total anthocyanin concentrations in the fresh berry weight during maturation and at harvest this effect can be attributed to the increased transcription of genes responsible for anthocyanin synthesis induced by a water deficit in specific cultivars deluc et al 2009 additionally the dilution effect due to increased berry size under increased water availability roby et al 2004 can result in a lower anthocyanin concentration which also corresponds to the negative correlation between berry anthocyanins and the irrigation levels used in our research a similar effect of increased water availability on the anthocyanin concentration was observed for other cultivars such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot kennedy et al 2002 castellarin et al 2007 deluc et al 2009 the highest level of anthocyanins was detected in grapes from the 4th sampling time during both experimental seasons when tss reached 80 90 oe for all irrigation treatments followed by a decrease at the last sampling date this process is attributed to an enzymatic degradation of the most abundant anthocyanin malvidin 3 o glicoside in ripened grapes pastore et al 2013 other anthocyanins can also be affected deluc et al 2009 resulting in a decrease in the total anthocyanins concentration during advanced stages of grape maturation this maximum concentration of anthocyanins is an indicator of the phenolic ripeness of grapes which is specific for different cultivars because of the effects of high temperatures during grape ripening many grapevine cultivars used for wine production achieve full phenolic ripeness at a high tss resulting in an extremely high wine alcohol level mira de orduña 2010 on the contrary the native variety babić shows a good adaptation to the warm mediterranean climate and reaches phenolic ripeness at relatively low tss concentrations for this reason at the stage when the tss reaches a concentration typical for premium red wines from this cultivar close to 100 oe it has also reached the maximum anthocyanin concentration a higher tss level in the case of irrigated vines allows for an earlier harvest closer to the phenolic ripeness which can partially compensate the lower concentration of polyphenols induced by the irrigation tartaric acid concentrations in juice at full ripeness are quite stable and specific for certain cultivars while malic acid is affected by different environmental factors and can vary greatly preiner et al 2013 accordingly in our research different irrigation treatments did not significantly affect the concentration of tartaric acid on the other hand unirrigated control vines had a significantly higher tartaric acid concentration than the irrigated vines therefore compared to the irrigated vines a higher tartaric acid concentration was recorded for unirrigated wines under water deficit esteban et al 1999 this can be explained by the fact that the content of tartaric acid per berry was not changed significantly after vérasion while the concentration decrease during maturation happens because of berry growth which is suppressed in the case of water deficit shellie 2010 the yield berry and cluster size and number of clusters per wine were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments showing a highly positive correlation with the total amount of water applied by rainfall and irrigation similar results were obtained in other studies related to the effects of water deficit and irrigation bravdo et al 1985 chaves et al 2007 keller et al 2016 the earliest detectable significant effect of water stress on a cellular level is a decrease in turgor pressure and thus turgor dependent activities such as cell growth and leaf expansion are the most sensitive processes to water deficit taiz and zeiger 2012 this is also confirmed in our study by the tla differences found between vines under different levels of irrigation and control vines based on the results for the total grape and juice yield per wine it can be concluded that a significant increase in yield occurs in the case of irrigated wines with differences between the applied irrigation levels juice wine yield loss due to reduced water availability is largely based on the reduction of cluster and berry weights 4 4 effects of high temperatures on grapevine performance difference between an unusually warm year 2015 and year with average temperatures 2016 reveals additional information about the negative effects of high temperatures on the performance of grapevine despite or in combination with the application of irrigation these effects are probably even more intensive due to the specific karstic soil type with limited water storage estrada medina et al 2012 the first experimental season in 2015 was characterised by extremely high temperatures during the ripening period which were not evident in 2016 differences were not only recorded for maximum temperatures reaching 38 8 in 2015 and 36 5 in 2016 but also for the duration of extremely high temperatures even though identical irrigation treatments were applied during both experimental seasons significant differences were observed for most of the measured parameters yield number of clusters per vine average cluster weight juice malic acid content berries anthocyanin and flavanols and flavonols concentrations the dynamics of tss accumulation in 2015 reveals the severe effects of temperature and water stress which resulted in a very low increase in tss between the 2nd and 3rd samplings for the control vines a period corresponding to a time of extremely high temperatures as noticed before water deficit along with high temperatures affected photosynthetic metabolism by reducing the stomatal conductivity carboxylation activity and increased oxygenation activity of rubisco during simultaneous heat and drought conditions stomatal movements oppose those that occur during heat alone rizhsky et al 2004 resulting in the inhibition of metabolism thus leading to reduced metabolite accumulations mira de orduña 2010 the rapid decrease of ta in 2015 compared to 2016 for both the control and irrigated vines also reveals that severe temperature stress was present in 2015 the 50 reduction in the juice ta concentration after vérasion in only 10 days from 19 85 to 10 13 g l 1 can be attributed to the degradation of malic acid in the grapes malic acid is an important source of carbon for respiration gluconeogenesis and other pathways during ripening in the case of limited transpiration and photosynthesis sweetman et al 2014 related to high temperatures the negative effects of high temperatures during and after vérasion are known to have a negative influence on anthocyanin synthesis spayd et al 2002 fernandes de oliveira et al 2015 especially if high daily temperatures are followed by warm nights mori et al 2005 which was the case in 2015 it has already been reported that temperatures 30 reduce anthocyanin synthesis while temperatures 37 can lead to a complete and irreversible inhibition of their synthesis for some cultivars kliewer 1977 mira de orduña 2010 according to several studies of different plant species including grapevine lin wang et al 2011 yamane et al 2006 this can be attributed to an inhibition of the expression of anthocyanin activators and related structural genes enhancement of their repressors and reduced enzymatic activities in anthocyanin biosynthesis during high temperatures especially in the case of both high day and night temperatures besides reduced synthesis high temperatures can also lead to the degradation of anthocyanins induced by an increased activity of peroxidase enzymes as the direct effect of thermal stress liu et al 2018 different patterns concerning the degradation of flavanols and flavonols as well as variations in their final concentrations between the two experimental seasons correspond to the effects of high temperatures on this groups of polyphenols fujita et al 2006 5 conclusions this study demonstrates the irrigation effects on grapevine grown in land parcels on reclaimed mediterranean karst during two experimental seasons 2015 and 2016 the irrigation strategy was based on the daily amount of water required by vines etc using high density observations from the automated weather station installed at the study site the appearance and duration of high temperatures in 2015 resulted in the different performance of grapevine compared to the 2016 season however irrigation managed to mitigate most of the negative effects which may be expected due to the vine temperature stress the native grapevine babić is certainly well adapted to the mediterranean climatic conditions but vine grape production on reclaimed karst combined with extreme climatic events such as heat incidence may have a severe effect on the vine performance and yield irrigation mitigates the negative effects of water deficit and heat stress on grapevine by positively affecting gas exchange parameters positive effects of irrigation were confirmed by the increased yield and tss while mild water stress positively affected the concentration of anthocyanins and other polyphenols an additional positive effect of irrigation was the synchronisation of tss and phenolic ripening all of these possible benefits should be considered when defining the irrigation level for wine production on reclaimed karst in our study the irrigation level in which 50 of the total evapotranspiration was supplemented did not compromise the balance between the yield level and quality higher levels of irrigation resulted in an additional increase in yield and in a higher juice total soluble solids concentration but also in a decrease in grape skin polyphenols especially anthocyanins which can result in lower wine quality declaration

cause extreme events often interact and are spatially and or temporally dependent a recent literature review pointed out that remote sensing indices can be used to assess drought impacts kern et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 páscoa et al 2018 analysed the impacts of drought events on vegetation activity in an area located in south eastern europe using the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 at several time scales and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi kogan 1995 although ndvi provides a seasonal measure of greenness the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 is more sensitive to high biomass conditions such as vineyard vigour foliar area evi is a key earth science parameter used to assess vegetation and was originally developed and calibrated for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aboard the terra and aqua satellites the soil water index swi originally developed by wagner et al 1999 and later improved by other research groups bernhard bauer marschallinger 2018a b bauer marschallinger 2019 is currently available because of microwave remote sensing techniques the copernicus global land service the european union s earth observation programme already provides swi v3 which uses near real time surface soil moisture data from the ascat sensors aboard the metop a b c satellites the swi is used in soil vegetation atmosphere transfer schemes to improve the understanding of the feedback between climate and vegetation the evi and swi are still not applied to modelling remotely sensed indices in drought related yield losses in south eastern europe and the republic of moldova rm therefore determining the link between swi evi and yield to assess drought related yield losses is an essential aspect of this study remote sensing indices require a combination of meteorological yield information to guarantee causality therefore in this work we integrated the impact of drought on three rainfed crops maize sunflower and grapevine as quantified by the monthly lagged spei weekly remote sensing indices evi and swi and yearly crop yields at the finest district scale in the rm the aims of the present study are i to explore the ability of different remote sensing indices for crop yield rather than to develop an empirical model and ii to determine the optimal time window of satellite derived swi and evi for the yield estimations of maize sunflower and grapevine further it was beyond the scope of this study to determine if coupling evi with swi and spei could further improve the yield estimations of maize sunflower and grapevine 2 target area and crop selection type the target area of this study is the rm as a black sea region country its southern border extends almost as far as the black sea coast and access to the black sea is open for rm through the dniester estuary and the danube fig 2 a b in the northern region southern region the annual mean air temperature ranges from 6 3 to 9 7 c 8 3 11 5 c and the mean annual precipitation amount varies from 520 to 680 mm 490 550 mm during 1951 2012 the mann kendall test revealed statistically significant negative trends in the spei from june to september in the southern region of moldova potopová et al 2016a during the growing season of maize and sunflower the potential evapotranspiration pet exceeds the amount of precipitation by 300 mm in the north and more than 400 mm in the south this may translate into much greater yield variability at the farm level moldova is one of the most productive agricultural regions and can be a major supplier of agricultural products because of its chernozem soil 80 and the fact that it has the highest accumulated temperature above 10 0 c 2 750 3 400 c and the longest growing season and frost free period more than 200 days rm s total land area is 3384 6 thousand hectares nbs 2019 including 2 500 1 thousand ha 73 9 of agricultural land table 1 thus field crops and perennial plantations play an important role in the economy of the country and crop yield is a key element of rural development and an indicator of national food security the three most important summer and perennial crops maize zea mays l sunflower helianthus annuus l and grapevine vitis vinifera l were selected for their vulnerability to increasing drought severity grain maize represents the most prevalent summer crop making up approximately 35 40 of the structure of cereals in the study region sunflower is the most important oilseed crop vegetable cooking oil and sunflower meal with a total sowing area of 17 3 in terms of regional performance yields have been very similar to ukrainian sunflower seed yield and only slightly below romanian yields faostat 2019 viticulture includes a large variety of grapes of which 70 are white varieties 24 are red varieties and 6 are table varieties the total land area of vineyards is 147 000 ha 7 although moldova ranks 13th globally in the harvested viticulture sector it is 22nd in terms of grape production 0 8 of total world grape production and 2 1 in european grape production this can be explained by the lower average yields per hectare approximately 4 3 tha 1 compared to the world yields 7 2 tha 1 in eu and 9 6 tha 1 at world level faostat 2019 however the moldovan wine sector has been one of the most significant agricultural subsectors in a predominantly agricultural economy for instance milestii mici is the largest wine cellar in the world it stretches for 200 km of the former limestone mine and holds almost 2 million bottles of wine there are four wine growing regions but the southern and central regions are the main zones where the vine plantations are located and most enterprises specialize in both the production and bottling of all wine varieties 3 data and methods we combined observations from agrometeorological stations remote sensing techniques and data collected in an agricultural census e g land use crop area harvested yield the meteorological information in combination with the high frequency remote sensing observations is used to assess the effectiveness of the satellite derived indices in the yield estimations 3 1 yield statistics district level census data on yields of the three largest commodity crops were collected from all agricultural censuses in the rm which have average yields derived from agricultural enterprises and farms with agricultural land areas of 10 ha then crop yield observations were aggregated to the main spatial unit defined administrative district nuts2 level administrative units by the map of fig 2a the areas of the nuts2 level districts are the finest spatial resolution and vary between 1 545 km2 cahul district and 295 km2 basarabeasca district rainfed crop yield data series were used for maize sunflower and grapevine as homogenized by the national bureau of statistics of the rm nbs 2019 during 2000 2018 farming years for 37 districts crop yield data going back to the early 21st century were selected at the finest resolution in addition the availability of applied remote sensing data constrained the start of the time period to after 2000 for each district and crop combination the coefficient of variation cv was calculated with the yield statistics for the time series from 2000 to 2018 to highlight the dispersion of the yield distribution and to explain whether the relationships found between the yield and the predictors depend on the amplitude of variability to estimate the long term impact of climate drought as well as the short term variability of soil moisture anomalies on the yields we used two separate periods i a historical period 1961 2018 at country level and ii the present period 2000 2018 at district level long term trends in crop yield are mostly caused by technical progress in management practices various corrections are used to eliminate this effect such as the standardized yield residuals series syrs potopová et al 2015 2016a for historical period thereby we used the same normalization to subtract long term trends in yield series syrs and climate drought index spei the present period is characterized by slowing of technology impact due to lacking innovation in crop management and limitations on fertilizer use the crop yields are therefore strongly correlated to the rainfall because of high economic weight of agricultural sector each rainfall deficit impacts the whole country economy hence the yield losses were calculated using two approaches i below a certain threshold level for each district and ii probabilistic risk assessment at country level when the available yield dataset is rather small a threshold level method was applied to convert risk of yield losses crop yields were considered to have failed when yield levels fell below 30 of the average annual yield for each crop species in each harvested district the 30 decrease compared to average yield levels was chosen as a measure for crop failure following international standards webber et al 2016 potopová et al 2016c the use of a lower threshold for crop failure may be more appropriate for risk analysis at aggregate scales thereby the probabilistic risk assessment approach as a function of the lagged spei and syrs values of 0 51 to 0 99 correspond to low yield losses 1 00 to 1 49 to moderate yield losses and below or equal to 1 50 to high yield losses was allow us to estimate the crop losses under climate drought at country level 3 2 satellite data 3 2 1 remotely sensed vegetation index for the satellite data set almost 19 years of measurements were used that were collected by modis instruments aboard terra satellite healthy vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared nir but absorbs the red red wavelengths thus combinations of these two bands give a two band version of the evi that is helpful for understanding vegetation vigour we used a two band version of the evi without a blue band evi2 jiang et al 2008 which has the closest similarity with the 3 band evi red blue and near infrared bands the evi2 improved vegetation monitoring through a de coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences these data are obtained by measuring the reflectance of the observed surfaces in selected parts of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum a cropland cover mask was applied to the satellite data to remove the effect of non agricultural land on the evi2 signals the evi2 time series were also smoothed to reduce noise in the data the smoothing procedure due to various atmospheric conditions and cloudiness is used separately for the data rows within each grid 250 250 m the smoothing procedure consists of several steps first unlikely sudden decreases in the daily time series are identified as probable errors and removed for this purpose daily values observed within a window for the last 10 days are analysed and missing or removed data are linearly interpolated due to the variation in the evi2 time series which is caused by the utilization of crop rotation schemes and changing crop patterns between seasons the values are aggregated into a grid with cells that are 5 5 km in size at a weekly time step i e the average value of all pixels inside a cell represents the cell value the basic assumption was that the proportion of individual crops in the field remains stable at the 5 km while greatly varies at 250 m scale for each cell the prevailing type of land cover is determined using the corine land cover 2006 data set version 16 04 2012 as seen in fig 2b for each district the weekly evi2 was computed by the following eq 1 1 e v i 2 g n i r r e d n i r c r e d 1 where nir and red are the reflectances in the near infrared and red bands respectively the three coefficients adopted in the evi2 algorithm are g 2 5 which is the gain factor c 2 4 which is the coefficient of the aerosol resistance term which uses the red band to correct for aerosol influences and 1 which is the canopy background adjustment that addresses nonlinear factors because we were interested only in the vegetation signal evi2 values 0 0 typically representing water or poorly corrected data were removed from the analysis resulting in values ranging from 0 1 0 the relative greenness approach can be used for crop water stress confirmation next a relative vegetation condition index was calculated as the ratio of current evi2 to the historical mean of evi2 2000 2018 for the same week below normal normal state and above normal vegetation condition week 1 denotes the first week of the year 1 st week of january evi21 while week 52 denotes the last week of the year last week of december evi252 basically as a rule of thumb we use the range of 95 105 of long term evi2 mean for the given week based on 2000 2018 data as normal range as it accounts for uncertainty in evi2 calculating procedure as fig 4 shows in the worst years the evi2 might drop below 55 e g 2007 while during the best seasons reaches above 135 e g 2018 it should be noted that while only pixels positively identified as arable land are analysed the crop specific evi2 inevitably contains signal from all crops grown in the given pixel thus the evi2 derived greenness index reflects the relative condition for all vegetation types for the same period there is no easy technical way to separate out the evi2 due to a single crop e g johnson et al 2016 kern et al 2018 hence it is still a mixture of the signals but it might still be useful at a given time period due to the dominance of some crops in terms of a harvested area the sunflower maize crop season starts with an active sowing period from april to early may crop growth occurs from june to september and harvests mostly in october after wintertime dormancy the evi210 17 in march april can be an indicator of the start of the grapevine vegetative cycle with the budburst stage leading to the first signs of greenness in the vineyard while maize and sunflower are planted later they cannot develop significant green leaves by the end of that period the evi221 24 in may or early june corresponds to the flowering stage with small flower clusters almost immediately when the berries initiate growth evi227 30 values correspond to the beginning of the fruit berry set the evi232 35 values in wine growing districts corresponding to the veraison stage when 50 of the red grape clusters show changes in colour or when signs of softening in white grapes appear vegetative growth shoots and leaves generally stops or decreases after this stage 3 2 2 remotely sensed soil moisture index the profile soil moisture content cannot be measured directly by remote sensing to estimate remotely sensed root zone soil moisture roots of common crops the swi model of wagner et al 1999 was used a semi empirical modelling approach is based on a two layer water balance algorithm which describes the relationship between surface and profile soil moisture as a function of time the first layer is the soil surface layer accessible to c band scatterometers and the second layer is the part of the profile that extends downwards from the bottom of the soil surface layer temporally irregular surface soil moisture ssm measurements are used as input the ssm is retrieved from scatterometer observations from the ascat instruments on board the metop satellites the swi represents the soil moisture content in the first 1 m of the soil in relative units the swi was then calculated for time tn integrating ssm data over a preceding time period t using the formula 2 s w i t n i n s s m t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t f o r t i t n in which t n is the observation time of the current measurement and t i are the observation times of the previous measurements in eq 2 all ssm observations made before t n are summed up and exponentially weighted the factor t determines how fast the weights decrease and how strongly ssm observations taken in the past influence the current swi larger t values require longer periods of surface moisture information to estimate the root zone swi it takes a certain time interval for water to percolate from the first surface layer to the second layer therefore if the t value is 5 and an ssm measurement was taken 10 days before t n then this observation would receive the weight e 10 5 0 135 the weekly swi with 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution was aggregated for each district s topsoil 0 40 cm swi at layer 12 and root zone layer 0 100 cm swi at layer 14 from january 1st 2000 until the end of 2018 in the rm as with the evi2 data swi was calculated as the relative value the swi at layer 12 swi 12 is highly dynamic due to precipitation evaporation and surface runoff and describes how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer it provides insights into local precipitation impacts and soil conditions the swi 12 can also be used as an indicator to detect the time of sowing and harvesting of summer crops for instance pullens et al 2019 considered it to be impossible to sow when the topsoil was highly water saturated 85 of the maximum water holding capacity in the top layer swi at layer 14 swi 14 shows the intensity of drought within the root zone soil layer this layer is solely controlled by the past moisture conditions in the swi 12 and thus the precipitation history with increasing profile depth in the swi 14 the temporal dynamic of the moisture conditions is decreasing as the amount of water stored in the reservoir depends on the infiltration of water added to the swi 12 during precipitation events the retrieval algorithm is implemented within a software package called the soil water retrieval package warp quality information on the swi is described in the validation reports of 2018 at copernicus global land service https land copernicus eu 3 3 agrometeorological data a 68 year climatic series from all weather stations precipitation p maximum tmax and minimum temperatures tmin was used to calculate the spei at time scales ranging from 1 to 12 months for the 1951 2018 period the arcgis kriging function was selected to interpolate weather station datasets to the same spatial resolution as satellite datasets we found that by adding an elevation factor ordinary kriging method produced most accurately spatial distribution of p tmax and tmin to quantify pet we used monthly data of the tmin tmax and extra terrestrial radiation then the water balance equation di is used to calculate the monthly deficit pi peti pet is a good indicator for characterizing the climate aridity especially over water limited non humid regions where the actual evapotranspiration is primarily dominated by water availability rather than energy zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019a b zhang et al 2019a also proposed a water energy balance approach for multi scalar and multi category drought analysis following vicente serrano et al 2010 and our previous studies potop 2011 potopová et al 2016a the evolved deficit values are standardized and fitted to a log logistic distribution function however the application of generalized extreme value distribution has also been recommended stagge et al 2015 as with the yield and satellite datasets the spei data series were spatially averaged by the nuts2 level to match the spatial resolution of the evi2 and swi indices fig s1 the use of a variety of time scales incorporates the memory of the preceding months which does not happen with remote sensing indices because the annual growth cycle of grapevine begins with bud break in the spring and culminates in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy the lagged spei effect of drought stress was used the spei 6 at the beginning of flowering and the fruit set period corresponds with june for the berry development and berry filling period with july august for the harvest period with september october inter annual variability in grapevine ripening is mostly driven by air temperature whereas water availability is reported as a major climatic factor for greenness the monthly lagged spei for summer crops comprised the major growth cycle stages pre sowing and sowing early spring middle of spring the beginning of the vegetative stage end of spring early summer the reproductive stages middle of summer and the ripening and harvest stages end of summer early autumn 3 4 multiple linear regressions and artificial neural network models drought impacts on yield crops by two independent methods multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural network ann have been applied anns are nonlinear models capable of capturing nonlinear relationships in data while mlr models capture linear behaviour of the relationship between crop yield and water three different crops are exposed to large inter annual variability thus heterogeneity of agro meteorological processes explaining the yield losses cannot be synthesized in a single predictor or week 3 4 1 multiple linear regression models first to determine the best time to make an accurate yield estimation and or the moments of vegetative cycle of the highest crop requirements for moisture conditions a preliminary correlation analysis was calculated between the observed yield of maize sunflower and grapevine and weekly evi2 swi 12 or swi 14 time series for each district over years 2000 2018 second mlr models were developed on the same data sets for maize sunflower and grapevine thus each resulting model nomenclature refers to the target crop yield letter m for maize s for sunflower g for grapevine the respective agro climatic regions i north ii central iii south and the possible combination of predictors for example the model mlr1 ypm i refers to the yield estimation of the maize in the northern agricultural region based on the statistically significant weeks of evi2i we also attempted to minimize the signal of random greenness of evi2 by calculating an adjustment factor for each crop crop specific evi2 i e estimating the spatial average weighted by the area of harvested crop in each district moreover because the yield of crops is not only affected by water availability but also by soil quality fertilization plant protection and the overall intensity of the cropping system in the individual districts the historical yield of crops for individual districts nuts2 was introduced as another predictor variable in some of the prediction models this will help to take account of this variation and improve the prediction ability of models the crop specific evi2i and swi 12i derived from the average crop yield y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g for each district thus parameters y i 0 s y i 0 s and y i 0 g defines as average crop yield over years 2000 2018 for maize sunflower and grapevine respectively finally the best predictors found during the crop cycle were considered input to the ann 3 4 2 bayesian regularized neural network in this study a bayesian regularized neural network bbn was adopted using the brnn package of r project software r core team 2019 perez rodriguez and gianola 2018 the bbns are mathematical models composed of several layers of neurons and connections between neurons each connection transfers the output of a neuron to the input of a neuron in the following layer the brnn function fits a two layer neural network as described by mackay 1992 and foresee and hagan 1997 it uses the nguyen and widrow algorithm 1990 to assign initial weights and the gauss newton algorithm to perform the optimization the bayesian approach decreases the risk of overfitting by putting a prior distribution on the network weights van hinsbergen et al 2009 therefore bbn neural networks can provide good generalization capabilities the architectures indicate the number of neurons in the input hidden and outputs layers different architectures of the network were tested with the number of neurons in the hidden layers between 1 and 3 the number of neurons in the input layer corresponds to the number of selected predictors for each model the ypm yps ypg were used as model targets while evi 2i swi 12i speii and y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g were used as model inputs the number of neurons in the input layer depends on the number of selected predictors for each target the performance of the proposed neural network was assessed using a leave one out cross validation procedure this method assesses the model prediction capability by successively using one of the observations from the original data for validation and the remaining observations as the training data kuhn 2019 the number of iterations is equal to the total number of observations an error estimate is obtained as a mean value of the errors calculated in each iteration the performance of each model was measured by the determination coefficient r2 the mean absolute error mae and the root mean squared error rmse between the observed yield and the model estimations once the models were developed their predictive skill ss was assessed via a validation phase as reported in previous study e g johnson et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal evolution of weekly evi2 swi 12 and swi 14 to illustrate the performance of two satellite derived indices figs 3 4 summarized the evolution of soil moisture and vegetation conditions over all districts the multiannual weekly cycle of swi 12 for each district in the north central and south agro climatic regions is depicted in fig 3a b the swi 12 shows the bimodal seasonal cycle of drying and the highest depletion of soil moisture occurred early in the growing season the drying peak in early spring is presumably related to an early melt of snow which predates the seasonal decline of soil moisture a similar event occurred in central europe potopová et al 2016b ruosteenoja et al 2017 the low values of swi 12 during the early season in conjunction with atmospheric summer drought could explain the decreasing summer crop yields in the last decade in the wine growing regions however the grapevines continue to grow productively highlighting the role of root structure for grapevine vigour the fluctuation of weekly swi in the driest year of 2007 at the topsoil 2008 normal year for grape and the best year 2018 for grape are included in fig 3c e the lowest values of weekly swi 12 and swi 14 at the topsoil and the root zone layers respectively were recorded in 2007 fig 3c which was the driest year in the study the highest values of weekly swi 12 and swi 14 were recorded in 2018 fig 3e the wettest early growing season where extreme precipitation events occurred and resulted in excess moisture in soil as well as waterlogging consequently the extremely wet soil conditions in the early growing season of 2018 were diagnosed by the swi 12 swi 14 and the extreme atmospheric drought in the later growing season was highlighted by the 1 month spei thus the countrywide appearance of waterlogging and drought damage collectively affected more than 30 000 farmers to evaluate the temporal explanatory ability of the evi2 fig 4a d the multiannual greenness cycle for each district in the north central and south agro climatic regions were determined the weekly evi2 captures the multiannual fluctuations in the rate of greenness growth the greenness values increased from the beginning of the growing season reaching a maximum at weeks 21 26 followed by a decrease until the end of the growing season these results are in agreement with the literature huete et al 2002 jiang et al 2008 the evi2 anomalies confirm the existence of high inter annual variability in the rate of land greenness with the lowest values recorded in the driest years which were 2007 and 2012 fig 5 a b the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation stress obtained with evi2 anomalies is in agreement with the drought conditions quantified by the 6 mo 10 mo 12 mo spei and swi 12 swi 14 identifying this drought year as responsible for the reduced vegetation activity the highest values of weekly evi2 were recorded in the wettest growing seasons which were in 2010 and 2018 this pattern is in accordance with the results obtained by the spei and páscoa et al 2018 as result the situations corresponding to dry soils and low vegetation in 2007 and wet soil high vegetation in 2018 are particularly seen in the 21 30 weeks of the year these specific conditions could be helpful factors in identifying the beginning or the end of a drought period the frequency of dry weeks with worsening vegetation and soil moisture conditions quantified by the evi2 and the swi 12 i e values dropping below the long term average are summarized in figs 5c 6 c overall broadly similar anomalies in the soil moisture and vegetation conditions occurred the lowest number of dry weeks occurred simultaneously in vegetation and soil conditions in 2010 2013 and 2014 heating and precipitation excess but opposing phenomena the highest frequency of weeks with worsening vegetation and soil moisture conditions occurred in 2007 2012 and 2015 heating and precipitation deficit the opposing sensed phenomena the lower frequency of weeks with worsening vegetation conditions and a higher number of dry weeks with worsening soil moisture conditions in the topsoil occurred simultaneously in the growing seasons with cooling and precipitation deficits e g 2011 the swi 12 data highlight that the soil moisture surplus from 2017 and 2018 could not compensate for the heating phenomena which dominated in almost all districts in the southern region fig s1 2 thus despite evi2 and swi 12 having similar temporal evolution the soil moisture anomalies evolved spatially differently across countries because of differences in the preceding conditions and the magnitude of the atmospheric drought in the southern region the summer rainfall was not as extensive as it was in the northern region which meant that vegetation conditions deteriorated more quickly once the weather became hotter and drier while evi2 and swi 12 14 are widely used as proxies for dryness and vegetation activity bauer marschallinger et al 2018a b kern et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 respectively it still needs to be emphasized that both metrics are only highly simplified proxies of dryness and vegetation activity we also found differences in the time spent under drought conditions between the evi2 and spei this difference suggests that the land greenness can be delayed by several weeks after the meteorological conditions improve spei 1 because the crops were too badly damaged to fully recover over a short period of time wang et al 2011 2016 2018 also observed that the impact of precipitation on vegetation does not occur instantaneously atmospheric dryness that occurs in a month spei 1 does not strongly affect vegetation in that month 4 2 identifying significant predictors to better identify the temporal window during which evi2 swi 12 swi 14 and spei are most predictive of yields in this study correlation plots are shown in fig 7 a l computed between remote sensing indices climatic index and the yield of summer crops grapevines for each agro climatic region from weeks 14 45 weeks 1 52 such behaviour in fig 7a l is closely related to the growth dynamic of summer crops grape which can vary from one year to the other through the combination of agricultural practices and climatic conditions e g dry and wet moisture conditions which can reduce or accelerate the growth rate the all the correlation coefficients passed the significance test of α 0 05 which indicated the evi2 was significantly highly correlated with sunflower yields r up to 0 84 and maize yields r up to 0 75 while the relationship was moderate for grape yields r up to 0 84 we also observed different relationships between evi2 and grape yields for the early mid and late growing seasons with r values of 0 25 0 84 and 0 30 respectively the relationship between evi2 and summer crop yields was higher with r values of 0 58 0 84 and 0 21 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively because evi2 is designed to respond to vegetation development it is not surprising that we found lower correlations between evi and crop yields in the early and late growing seasons where the soil colour is the dominant driver of the red and nir spectral response based on nir red reflectance soil likely contributed to increased variability and decreased correspondence between yield and vegetation as correlations for yield and evi2 systemically increased with vegetation density the highest correlation between evi2 and the yield of maize was found during weeks 25 30 and for sunflower yield during weeks 23 28 fig 7a b the best time values were found to approximately coincide with the periods of heading flowering and filling of the crops which is comparable to the results of potopová et al 2016a hence the predictors used in the estimated yield models for maize were the values of evi2 from weeks 25 30 and for sunflower were the values of evi2 from weeks 23 28 respectively the optimal time window for grapevine yield estimated fig 7c was found to be from weeks 23 30 early june to late july 1 3 months before harvest despite the fact that summer crops maize sunflower are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth however the swi 12 fig 7d e f had the stronger correlation with crop yield then swi 14 fig 7g h l since swi 14 averages the soil water content from the surface to 1 m depth it is not always the best index sandra et al 2018 the swi 14 is not sensitive enough for most field crops which even at their maximum have a great majority of roots concentrated within the first 40 cm of the soil profile fan et al 2017 and in early stages of growth there are no roots below this depth this explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and swi 12 which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil i e to 0 4 m even in the case of grapevine which as perennial plants have roots established well below 1 m the majority of roots are present in the first 50 cm of soil e g cellete et al 2005 in any case all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season with swi 12 performing better than swi 14 when water was the main factor controlling maize or sunflower yield the importance of the swi 12 values varied across the growing season in the first part of the growing season the correlation coefficients are negative and the soil water content decreases below the optimal conditions as a result dry anomalies represent harmful conditions because the available soil water is too low to provide enough water in the most drought susceptible phases the correlation also dropped around spring in weeks 16 21 when the lowest moisture was in the soil these findings suggest that during the pre sowing and sowing periods of maize and sunflower there is a narrow window of perhaps 2 3 weeks when the swi of the entire profile is critical conversely the remote sensing soil moisture indices are able to discern that early season water use by grapevines was usually replenished by winter snow rain and soil water content was not lower than the arable crops which could even be a benefit for final forming yield fig 7f i these results highlight that the availability of water in the first part of the growing season is key for the successful cultivation of arable crops in south eastern europe as a result crops affected by water stress often have lower yields and the ability to capture these impacts through remote sensing indices depends on the timing of the stress likewise kern et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 and ribeiro et al 2019 suggested that if the stress event occurs before the peak of the growing season it will reduce growth and result in lower peak evi2 and or ndvi in this case the relationship between yield and peak evi2 may be more useful than swi 12 for grapes the stress happens after the peak of the growing season e g during fruit berry set which may not affect the peak of evi2 and the relationship between grape yield and evi2 is usually weaker when studying the drought related yield losses based on spei and crop yields we found that summer crops presented a high vulnerability to drought and the correlation between crop yields and spei were highest in july fig 7j l the significant positive correlations increase with the spei time scale potop 2011 potopová et al 2016b c and the results of the lagged spei 10 suggest that the rainfall is inefficient to meet evapotranspiration requirements during the entire growing season the spring water balance did not replenish soil water content levels after sowing summer crops the relationship between the spei 10 and grapevine yields was lower than the evi2 with r values of 0 15 0 42 and 0 19 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively while the correlation between the spei 10 and summer crop yields was higher with r values of 0 41 0 68 and 0 28 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively this shows that the yield decreases with a decrease in the spei that is the drier atmospheric conditions are the higher the yield loss 4 3 drought driven yield loss risk the observed maize sunflower yield ranged from the north to south districts between 3 8 and 1 5 tha 1 1 9 and 1 2 tha 1 and 1 5 and 3 8 tha 1 for grapevines fig 8 thus there are decreases increases in summer crops perennial crops yields toward the southern districts a key observation was high yield losses in grapevine yields for northern districts which point towards the facts that areas with lower yields or less contribution to regional production demonstrate higher inter annual variation than the key producing regions such as central districts the crop yields of maize sunflower and grapevines have exhibited substantial variations during the past decade figs 9 10 and crop yield reductions are often observed when they are experiencing a severe drought waterlogging as shown in fig 9 crop yield is currently most prone to climate induced stresses there is a moderately high risk of failure in summer crop production and a very low economic return for almost all districts for sunflower and maize the south region shows the highest risk of yield reduction under droughts while a relatively low risk is observed for grape production in the central region this could be attributed to the fact that grape is more sensitive to temperature than precipitation irimia et al 2017 costea et al 2018 drought stress led to a decrease in suitable area by 45 and 32 in maize and sunflower respectively under dryness soil and the detrimental effects were ameliorated of around 23 in both crops in the northern districts thus the most vulnerable crop areas for sunflower are situated in the southern districts fig 9 characterized by the highest frequency of the soil drought fig 6c and high proportion of row crops in the total agricultural area potopová et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the lack of soil moisture in the sowing stage of maize coupled with the extremely high temperatures during the flowering stage led to a drastic decrease in yields in central and southern districts thus the cropping system is not keeping pace with changes in drought severity as is the case for maize systems the distribution of yield loss related climate drought index at the national level fig 10 showed a substantial association between drought and yield reductions the nonlinear yield response to the increase in drought severity implies that yield loss risk tends to grow progressively independent of crop types the latter is in accordance with leng and hall 2019 who found that the yield loss risk grows non linearly with an increase in drought severity figs fig 11 11 fig 12 12 present an example of impacts of fluctuations in the soil moisture at the topsoil swi 12 and the root zone layer swi 14 on maize sunflower and grape for each harvested district the soil moisture induced impact accelerated yield losses due to lower soil water content at the topsoil which occurred in the majority key producing districts of summer crops 10 2 overall the swi 14 index reveals that soil water content at the root zone layer of maize and sunflower is also insufficient for the fullest expression of the production potential of crops over time it has been estimated that low levels of soil moisture limit summer crops production in about 77 of the nation s cultivated lands we found that climate drought risk expressed in terms of the spei and syrs is an increasing problem during middle of the growing season meanwhile the soil drought risk expressed by the swi 12 swi 14 and crop specific yield y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g showed in the early of the growing season over the past 19 years a lack of soil moisture can form significantly earlier in spring than it has been usual thus the swi was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics at the topsoil swi 12 and the root zone layer swi 14 4 4 maize yield estimation models with a high number of predictors are less successful therefore the best models to explain yield have been selected per the agro climatic region the performance of validation models for yield estimation are as follows 1 evi2i only vegetation model greenness model mlr1 bbn1 2 evi2i adjusted greenness model mlr2 bbn2 3 swi 12i only soil moisture model mlr3 bbn3 4 swi 12i adjusted soil moisture model mlr4 bbn4 5 swi 12i x evi2i the adjusted soil vegetation model mlr5 bbn5 and 6 swi 12i x evi2i x speii the adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model mlr6 bbn6 the statistical models of risk generated by the mlr and bbn are described in tables table 2 2 table 3 3 tables s1 4 respectively and their levels of predictive skill are assessed in fig 13 a c the statistics in tables s1 2 fig 13a show that bayesian neural network techniques slightly improved the performance of the maize mlr models the mlr models were able to explain 58 16 and 82 9 of the yield variability at the significance level of 0 02 in agreement with the assessment of model skill the adjusted greenness models the soil vegetation models and the soil vegetation atmosphere model recorded the highest performance of both bbn and mlr techniques adding it to models as additional predictors appears to improve the estimation skill of both mlr and bbn approaches fig 13a the simple evi2i model gives less predictive power and the evi2i adjusted model gives higher skill scores the performance of the mlr1 bbn1 expressed by r2 was 0 531 0 564 within districts in the north 0 583 0 591 in central and 0 543 0 545 in southern regions at the significance level of 0 05 the performance of mlr2 bbn2 varies from 0 653 0 707 within districts in the north to 0 640 0 646 in central and 0 696 0 734 in south districts at the significance level of 0 02 we also confirm earlier findings burke and lobell 2017 that the adjusted greenness model was able to capture the effects of nutrient stress on maize yield with bbn2 more suited to this challenge than mrl2 johnson et al 2016 the swi 12i only mlr3 bbn3 model can explain 48 3 of the observed maize yield variability in the north 50 6 in the centre and 56 2 in the south the inclusion of evi2i in the soil moisture bbn5 model led to improving the predictive power of the swi 12i this model offers different information from predictors of swi 1225 30 x evi225 30 x y i 0 m showing how well the crop is growing and whether crops are experiencing soil moisture deficits and or surpluses in critical stages for districts within regions ii and iii the values of the regression coefficients of mlr models during weeks 25 30 had positive results for evi225 27 and negative results for swi 1225 27 table s5 confirming the aforementioned overall results thus the combination of swi 1225 30 x evi225 30 predictors during the optimal time window for maize yield estimating better explains the variability in crop yield via the bbn approach to illustrate how these two parameters are related over larger domains wagner et al 2013 show the correlation of monthly ndvi and swi time series over africa for agricultural areas they showed that the correlation is strong in regions with a strong seasonal vegetation cycle the relationship between swi and ndvi was exploited by zribi et al 2010 who developed a methodology to predict the following month s ndvi based on the current month s ndvi and swi values wang et al 2016 also performed accurate monitoring of winter wheat drought threats in northern china using multiple climate based drought indices and soil moisture data during 2000 2013 fig 14 presents an example of the spatial distribution of mean bias error estimated yield by the adjusted soil moisture model mlr4 for each harvested district in general the variability of the maize yield is overestimated by the adjusted soil moisture model mostly because negative yield deviations are not captured by the model however the model is able to predict the observed values over the entire period the long term differences between the estimated and observed maize yields for the period 2000 2018 are between 1 5 and 0 5 tha 1 4 5 sunflower yield estimation tables 2 3 fig 13b show the results of the statistical evaluation of the predictors used to develop mlr and bbn models for sunflower the values of the regression coefficients and the explained variance for sunflower yields are very similar to those obtained for maize in the mlr models table s5 moreover the r2 and skill score of sunflower mlr and bbn models were higher than for maize and estimated yield with reasonable accuracy and predictive power in most cases bayesian neural network models showed higher r2 and ss values than the multiple linear regression models especially for more complex models bbn5 mlr5 mlr6 and bbn6 interestingly the simple aggregated greenness model evi2i can explain 80 of the observed yield variance by both mlr and bbn techniques the model with increased skill had an adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model based on mlr6 86 4 α 0 01 and bbn 87 8 α 0 01 the spei proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the sunflower yield assessment this finding is likely due to the greater impacts of drought with an increasing evaporation deficit over the past decade of the dataset mouatadid et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 potopová et al 2019 thus mlr6 and bbn6 models may be useful in estimating sunflower yield the mlr1 and mlr2 models were able to capture 48 5 80 1 of the variance in sunflower yield losses while the bbn1 and bbn2 models also captured 50 2 88 2 and they all passed the significance test of α 0 01 thus greenness models showed that when conditions for plant growth are favourable the evi225 27 and evi228 30 predictors had similar information regardless of the vegetation type a lower level of estimated power was observed between observed and predicted sunflower yield for mlr3 bbn3 models therefore the non crop specific aggregated swi 12 is not applicable with slightly less predictive power when assessed for estimated power with the adjusted soil moisture model the regression model mlr4 outperformed the bayesian network bbn4 in predictive skill and was able to capture 48 of the variance yield the incorporation of the vegetation index slightly improved the predictive power of the soil moisture model 4 6 grapevine yield estimation tables s3 4 fig 13c show the statistical performance metrics of the mlr and bbn grapevine models although the all models were characterized with low r2 and ss values it also passed the significance test of α 0 05 moreover when the crop specific swi 12i and evii were used to predict grape yield the bbn models could produce a prediction accuracy of larger than 50 similarly significant statistical models were found for mlr which were able to predict crop yield with an accuracy of 48 respectively thus there are few differences among linear and nonlinear models for grape and the predictive power of some bbn models is poorer than that of the regression models similar results were obtained in other studies that compared neural networks with regression and found a significantly better performance of regression over neural networks johnson et al 2016 two models were considered to have a moderate skill score and the simple greenness model aggregated to grape yield mlr2 and the complex model of mlr6 the output of mlr2 bbn2 and mlr6 bbn6 models fit well with the observed grape yield which means that if using these for predictors we can construct a relatively good model fig s4 and table s5 the preferred model is also mlr2 ypg ii mlr2 ypg iii which can explain 38 1 48 5 of the grape yield variability and has predictive power for explaining 43 1 53 5 of the variance at the p 0 05 statistical level for nonlinear models the preferred models are bbn5 ypg ii and bbn5 ypg iii bbn5 ypg ii can explain 42 1 of the observed grape yield variability and bbn5 ypg iii might explain 50 2 of the yield variance p 0 04 thus the bbn5 model showed that when grapevine is impacted by the soil drought the biochemical constituent of the crop changes and so would be the spectral signatures and greenness evi2i when the spei 107 with remote sensing predictors was included bbn6 the r2 values increased by a few percent and the predictive power both increased by 5 and explained additional variances relative to the adjusted soil vegetation model bbn5 this finding is likely because the monthly spei has a longer averaging time and might mask anomalies whereas the evi221 24 swi 1221 24 and evi227 30 swi 1227 30 predictors using shorter time periods and might be more useful ribeiro et al 2019 páscoa et al 2018 5 summary and conclusion given the large and rapidly increasing number of drought studies conducted by remote sensing indices this study offers the following recommendations to improve statistical modelling of risk using linear and nonlinear machine learning methods for yield estimation utilizing remote sensing data in yield estimation models can be a key component in addressing issues of global food security particularly in data limited regions soil vegetation atmosphere indicators were included in an attempt to identify and enhance yield estimation this study can serve as a baseline for future analyses including other methods to improve estimation of drought related yield losses the interactions between drought and crop production requires an understanding of the soil crop atmosphere interactions and associations between atmospheric variables soil moisture variables and the crop yield variability such as new management practices and technologies the evi2 and swi 12 swi 14 were innovatively proposed to identify drought conditions for the first time in the rm compared with station data remote sensing soil moisture products have the advantages of wide coverage and dynamic which can effectively compensate for the deficiency in the spatial distribution of the weather stations first we explore and discuss studies related to the use of remote sensing indices in crop statistical modelling coupled with other climatic and agricultural information for improved model performance in order to use the remote sensing data we aggregated them using the crop land mask to the time series representing individual districts at this level data on crop yields and other drought impacts were available which also made it possible to bring together multiple indices originating from different sensors with varying spatial and temporal resolution second the predictive skills of the regression and bayesian network models were compared and the effectiveness that each approach provides to yield estimation was discussed we realize that standardized indices cannot be used in all models therefore we developed two simple models based on the satellite derived indices the evi2i only vegetation model and the swi 12i only soil moisture model and four models adjusted to crop yield type adjusted greenness model adjusted soil moisture model adjusted soil vegetation model and adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model we found that the nonlinear models slightly improved the performance of the linear models which is similar to the results of the study of johnson et al 2016 a linear model is also useful because evi2 is considered to be linearly related to crop photosynthetic capacity which can be used to model crop biomass accumulation and yield nonetheless we recommend the use of a mixed approach to yield the most useful results for yield estimation particularly for the short period of available satellite data the proposed models could be easily implemented in other regions of the globe because the inputted satellite data for both vegetation evi2 and soil moisture swi 12 swi 14 and gridded spei are available globally and in near real time moreover the swi model has been sufficiently verified by observation data by the large validation and inter comparison studies across the globe wagner et al 2013 paulik et al 2014 or locally in southern brocca et al 2010 and central europe thaler et al 2018 the yield estimations are an important adaptation tool that can assist farmers in assessing and potentially mitigating drought related risks to crop production to put our results into the context of global food production we conclude that i both the regression and bayesian network algorithms identified that the lower performers had the simpler soil moisture models and the higher performers had adjusted greenness models to crop yield type and adjusted soil vegetation models thus crop specific derived evi2i and swi 12i were found to be the better predictors though spei generally added extra skill in light of the growing importance of drought impacts on crop yields and the projections of more frequent and extreme droughts in the near future therefore we also suggest using standardized indices to quantify drought related yield losses ii the accurate estimation of maize sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest rmse of 1 2 tha 1 it is not surprising that the model with the highest estimation skill score had sunflower satellite derived models followed by maize and then grapevines iii although the adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model was a good fit for summer crops between the estimated and observed yields increasing differences from the northern to southern districts were found for the mlr6 and bbn6 maize models for grapes the greatest differences between the observed and estimated yield values were recorded in more southerly districts with higher frequencies of severe drought iv the equations of the fitted grape mlr models show that early soil moisture deficit has a greater impact on the reduction in yield than on late soil moisture deficit the reduction in grape yield through excessive soil moisture stress occurs much less frequently than the loss of yield due to insufficient water deficit the regression coefficients of evi2 spei swi 12 and swi 14 with the yield of summer crops gradually reduced increased when moving from the semi arid southern area to a more humid northern area these results suggest that evi2 swi 12 swi 14 and spei can be used more effectively to demonstrate the progress of agricultural drought under varying climates and its impacts on the crop yields since summer crops are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth a two layer soil scheme was used to model the soil dynamics over the entire root zone depth this study does not only provide a yield losses assessment using soil moisture and vegetation remote sensing indices based on the crop specific soil moisture model we found that topsoil moisture declines during the growing season dry anomalies create stress conditions because the available soil water is too low to provide enough water in the most drought susceptible crop growth stages it demonstrates that an introduction of integrated soil crop system management based on systematic use of cultural methods crop rotation and soil conservation tillage use of water saving technologies drip irrigation growing of drought tolerant crop varieties and use of agro climatic decision support tools based on soil vegetation atmosphere models seem to be

10613,meteorological and agricultural information coupled with remote sensing observations has been used to assess the effectiveness of satellite derived indices in yield estimations the estimate yield models generated by both the regression mlr and bayesian network bbn algorithms and their levels of predictive skill were assessed the enhanced vegetation index evi2 soil water index swi standardized precipitation evaporation index spei have been considered predictors for three rainfed crops maize sunflower and grapevine grown in 37 districts in the republic of moldova rm we used the weekly evi2 which was collected by modis instruments aboard the terra satellite with a 250m 250m spatial resolution and aggregated for each district during the 2000 2018 period we also used the weekly

2000 2018 the multiscalar spei during 1951 2018 farming years proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the yield assessment the study also summarized i the optimal time window of satellite derived swii and evi2i for yield estimation and ii the capability of remotely sensed indices for representing the spatio temporal variations of agricultural droughts we developed statistical soil vegetation atmosphere models to explore drought related yield losses the skill scores of the sunflower mlr and bbn models were higher than those for the maize and grape models and were able to estimate yields with reasonable accuracy and predictive power the accurate estimation of maize sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest rmse of 1 2 tha 1 despite the fact that summer crops maize sunflower are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth however the swi 12 had the stronger correlation with crop yield then swi 14 this explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and swi 12 which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil in any case all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season with swi 12 performing better than swi 14 based on the crop specific soil moisture model we found that topsoil moisture declines in the most drought susceptible crop growth stages which indicates that rm is a good candidate for studying drought

regions during different times of the year conversely the countries in south eastern europe were less affected by drought however the prevailing wet period during 2016 2019 was not nearly enough to erase the rainfall deficit that had accumulated over the previous decade potopová et al 2016a 2019 although grapevine is considered tolerant to drought stress grape plants contain less malic acid and more anthocyanins when under excessive water stress and berry weight can be reduced by as much as 50 costea et al 2018 therefore the grape and wine industries are severely hampered by drought

statistical models are widely understood systematic evaluations of their performance relative to other methods exist lobell and burke 2010 moore and lobell 2015 burke and lobell 2017 to date assessments on the adaptations to climate change in agricultural cropping systems have mostly been based on data from field trials and crop growth models with some additional analyses of farm statistical data zhao et al 2020 several recent studies have applied the probabilistic risk assessment approach to analyze yield losses and to find crop specific risk levels however building more complex statistical models is often not feasible because crop yield time series are too short zscheischler et al 2017 madadgar et al 2017 developed a multivariate probabilistic model that uses

grapevine zscheischler et al 2018 suggests that traditional risk assessment methods typically only consider one driver at a time potentially leading to underestimation of risk as the processes that cause extreme events often interact and are spatially and or temporally dependent a recent literature review pointed out that remote sensing indices can be used to assess drought impacts kern et al

greenness the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 is more sensitive to high biomass conditions such as vineyard vigour foliar area evi is a key earth science parameter used to assess vegetation and was originally developed and calibrated for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis aboard the terra and aqua satellites the soil water index swi originally developed by

copernicus global land service the european union s earth observation programme already provides swi v3 which uses near real time surface soil moisture data from the ascat sensors aboard the metop a b c satellites the swi is used in soil vegetation atmosphere transfer schemes to improve the understanding of the feedback between climate and vegetation the evi and swi are still not applied to modelling remotely sensed indices in drought related yield losses in south eastern europe and the republic of moldova rm therefore determining the link between swi evi and yield to assess drought related yield losses is an essential aspect of this study remote sensing indices require a combination of meteorological yield information to guarantee causality therefore in this work we integrated the impact of drought on three rainfed crops maize sunflower and grapevine as quantified by the monthly lagged spei weekly remote sensing indices evi and swi and yearly crop yields at the finest district scale in the rm the aims of the present study are i to explore the ability of different remote sensing indices for crop yield rather than to develop an empirical model and ii to determine the optimal time window of satellite derived swi and evi for the yield estimations of maize sunflower and grapevine further it was beyond the scope of this study to determine if coupling evi with swi and spei could further improve the yield estimations of maize sunflower and grapevine 2 target area and crop selection type the target area of this study is the rm as a black sea region country its southern border extends almost as far as the black sea coast and access to the black sea is open for rm through the dniester estuary and the danube fig 2 a b in the northern region southern region the annual mean air temperature ranges from 6 3 to 9 7 c 8 3 11 5 c and the mean annual precipitation amount varies from 520 to 680 mm 490 550 mm during 1951 2012 the mann kendall test revealed statistically significant negative trends in the spei from june to september in the southern region of moldova potopová et al 2016a during the growing season of maize and sunflower the potential evapotranspiration pet exceeds the amount of precipitation by 300 mm in the north and more than 400 mm in the south this may translate into much greater yield variability at the farm level moldova is one of the most productive agricultural regions and can be a major supplier of agricultural products because of its chernozem soil 80 and the fact that it has the highest accumulated temperature above 10 0 c 2 750 3 400 c and the longest growing season and frost free period more than 200 days rm s total land area is 3384 6 thousand hectares nbs 2019 including 2 500 1 thousand ha 73 9 of agricultural land table 1 thus field crops and perennial plantations play an important role in the economy of the country and crop yield is a key element of rural development and an indicator of national food security the three most important summer and perennial crops maize zea mays l sunflower helianthus annuus l and grapevine vitis vinifera l were selected for their vulnerability to increasing drought severity grain maize represents the most prevalent summer crop making up approximately 35 40 of the structure of cereals in the study region sunflower is the most important oilseed crop vegetable cooking oil and sunflower meal with a total sowing area of 17 3 in terms of regional performance yields have been very similar to ukrainian sunflower seed yield and only slightly below romanian yields faostat 2019 viticulture includes a large variety of grapes of which 70 are white varieties 24 are red varieties and 6 are table varieties the total land area of vineyards is 147 000 ha 7 although moldova ranks 13th globally in the harvested viticulture sector it is 22nd in terms of grape production 0 8 of total world grape production and 2 1 in european grape production this can be explained by the lower average yields per hectare approximately 4 3 tha 1 compared to the world yields 7 2 tha 1 in eu and 9 6 tha 1 at world level faostat 2019 however the moldovan wine sector has been one of the most significant agricultural subsectors in a predominantly agricultural economy for instance milestii mici is the largest wine cellar in the world it stretches for 200 km of the former limestone mine and holds almost 2 million bottles of wine there are four wine growing regions but the southern and central regions are the main zones where the vine plantations are located and most enterprises specialize in both the production and bottling of all wine varieties 3 data and methods we combined observations from agrometeorological stations remote sensing techniques and data collected in an agricultural census e g land use crop area harvested yield the meteorological information in combination with the high frequency remote sensing observations is used to assess the effectiveness of the satellite derived indices in the yield estimations 3 1 yield statistics district level census data on yields of the three largest commodity crops were collected from all agricultural censuses in the rm which have average yields derived from agricultural enterprises and farms with agricultural land areas of 10 ha then crop yield observations were aggregated to the main spatial unit defined administrative district nuts2 level administrative units by the map of fig 2a the areas of the nuts2 level districts are the finest spatial resolution and vary between 1 545 km2 cahul district and 295 km2 basarabeasca district rainfed crop yield data series were used for maize sunflower and grapevine as homogenized by the national bureau of statistics of the rm nbs 2019 during 2000 2018 farming years for 37 districts crop yield data going back to the early 21st century were selected at the finest resolution in addition the availability of applied remote sensing data constrained the start of the time period to after 2000 for each district and crop combination the coefficient of variation cv was calculated with the yield statistics for the time series from 2000 to 2018 to highlight the dispersion of the yield distribution and to explain whether the relationships found between the yield and the predictors depend on the amplitude of variability to estimate the long term impact of climate drought as well as the short term variability of soil moisture anomalies on the yields we used two separate periods i a historical period 1961 2018 at country level and ii the present period 2000 2018 at district level long term trends in crop yield are mostly caused by technical progress in management practices various corrections are used to eliminate this effect such as the standardized yield residuals series syrs potopová et al 2015 2016a for historical period thereby we used the same normalization to subtract long term trends in yield series syrs and climate drought index spei the present period is characterized by slowing of technology impact due to lacking innovation in crop management and limitations on fertilizer use the crop yields are therefore strongly correlated to the rainfall because of high economic weight of agricultural sector each rainfall deficit impacts the whole country economy hence the yield losses were calculated using two approaches i below a certain threshold level for each district and ii probabilistic risk assessment at country level when the available yield dataset is rather small a threshold level method was applied to convert risk of yield losses crop yields were considered to have failed when yield levels fell below 30 of the average annual yield for each crop species in each harvested district the 30 decrease compared to average yield levels was chosen as a measure for crop failure following international standards webber et al 2016 potopová et al 2016c the use of a lower threshold for crop failure may be more appropriate for risk analysis at aggregate scales thereby the probabilistic risk assessment approach as a function of the lagged spei and syrs values of 0 51 to 0 99 correspond to low yield losses 1 00 to 1 49 to moderate yield losses and below or equal to 1 50 to high yield losses was allow us to estimate the crop losses under climate drought at country level 3 2 satellite data 3 2 1 remotely sensed vegetation index for the satellite data set almost 19 years of measurements were used that were collected by modis instruments aboard terra satellite healthy vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared nir but absorbs the red red wavelengths thus combinations of these two bands give a two band version of the evi that is helpful for understanding vegetation vigour we used a two band version of the evi without a blue band evi2 jiang et al 2008 which has the closest similarity with the 3 band evi red blue and near infrared bands the evi2 improved vegetation monitoring through a de coupling of the canopy background signal and a reduction in atmospheric influences these data are obtained by measuring the reflectance of the observed surfaces in selected parts of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum a cropland cover mask was applied to the satellite data to remove the effect of non agricultural land on the evi2 signals the evi2 time series were also smoothed to reduce noise in the data the smoothing procedure due to various atmospheric conditions and cloudiness is used separately for the data rows within each grid 250 250 m the smoothing procedure consists of several steps first unlikely sudden decreases in the daily time series are identified as probable errors and removed for this purpose daily values observed within a window for the last 10 days are analysed and missing or removed data are linearly interpolated due to the variation in the evi2 time series which is caused by the utilization of crop rotation schemes and changing crop patterns between seasons the values are aggregated into a grid with cells that are 5 5 km in size at a weekly time step i e the average value of all pixels inside a cell represents the cell value the basic assumption was that the proportion of individual crops in the field remains stable at the 5 km while greatly varies at 250 m scale for each cell the prevailing type of land cover is determined using the corine land cover 2006 data set version 16 04 2012 as seen in fig 2b for each district the weekly evi2 was computed by the following eq 1 1 e v i 2 g n i r r e d n i r c r e d 1 where nir and red are the reflectances in the near infrared and red bands respectively the three coefficients adopted in the evi2 algorithm are g 2 5 which is the gain factor c 2 4 which is the coefficient of the aerosol resistance term which uses the red band to correct for aerosol influences and 1 which is the canopy background adjustment that addresses nonlinear factors because we were interested only in the vegetation signal evi2 values 0 0 typically representing water or poorly corrected data were removed from the analysis resulting in values ranging from 0 1 0 the relative greenness approach can be used for crop water stress confirmation next a relative vegetation condition index was calculated as the ratio of current evi2 to the historical mean of evi2 2000 2018 for the same week below normal normal state and above normal vegetation condition week 1 denotes the first week of the year 1 st week of january evi21 while week 52 denotes the last week of the year last week of december evi252 basically as a rule of thumb we use the range of 95 105 of long term evi2 mean for the given week based on 2000 2018 data as normal range as it accounts for uncertainty in evi2 calculating procedure as fig 4 shows in the worst years the evi2 might drop below 55 e g 2007 while during the best seasons reaches above 135 e g 2018 it should be noted that while only pixels positively identified as arable land are analysed the crop specific evi2 inevitably contains signal from all crops grown in the given pixel thus the evi2 derived greenness index reflects the relative condition for all vegetation types for the same period there is no easy technical way to separate out the evi2 due to a single crop e g johnson et al 2016 kern et al 2018 hence it is still a mixture of the signals but it might still be useful at a given time period due to the dominance of some crops in terms of a harvested area the sunflower maize crop season starts with an active sowing period from april to early may crop growth occurs from june to september and harvests mostly in october after wintertime dormancy the evi210 17 in march april can be an indicator of the start of the grapevine vegetative cycle with the budburst stage leading to the first signs of greenness in the vineyard while maize and sunflower are planted later they cannot develop significant green leaves by the end of that period the evi221 24 in may or early june corresponds to the flowering stage with small flower clusters almost immediately when the berries initiate growth evi227 30 values correspond to the beginning of the fruit berry set the evi232 35 values in wine growing districts corresponding to the veraison stage when 50 of the red grape clusters show changes in colour or when signs of softening in white grapes appear vegetative growth shoots and leaves generally stops or decreases after this stage 3 2 2 remotely sensed soil moisture index the profile soil moisture content cannot be measured directly by remote sensing to estimate remotely sensed root zone soil moisture roots of common crops the swi model of wagner et al 1999 was used a semi empirical modelling approach is based on a two layer water balance algorithm which describes the relationship between surface and profile soil moisture as a function of time the first layer is the soil surface layer accessible to c band scatterometers and the second layer is the part of the profile that extends downwards from the bottom of the soil surface layer temporally irregular surface soil moisture ssm measurements are used as input the ssm is retrieved from scatterometer observations from the ascat instruments on board the metop satellites the swi represents the soil moisture content in the first 1 m of the soil in relative units the swi was then calculated for time tn integrating ssm data over a preceding time period t using the formula 2 s w i t n i n s s m t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t f o r t i t n in which t n is the observation time of the current measurement and t i are the observation times of the previous measurements in eq 2 all ssm observations made before t n are summed up and exponentially weighted the factor t determines how fast the weights decrease and how strongly ssm observations taken in the past influence the current swi larger t values require longer periods of surface moisture information to estimate the root zone swi it takes a certain time interval for water to percolate from the first surface layer to the second layer therefore if the t value is 5 and an ssm measurement was taken 10 days before t n then this observation would receive the weight e 10 5 0 135 the weekly swi with 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution was aggregated for each district s topsoil 0 40 cm swi at layer 12 and root zone layer 0 100 cm swi at layer 14 from january 1st 2000 until the end of 2018 in the rm as with the evi2 data swi was calculated as the relative value the swi at layer 12 swi 12 is highly dynamic due to precipitation evaporation and surface runoff and describes how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer it provides insights into local precipitation impacts and soil conditions the swi 12 can also be used as an indicator to detect the time of sowing and harvesting of summer crops for instance pullens et al 2019 considered it to be impossible to sow when the topsoil was highly water saturated 85 of the maximum water holding capacity in the top layer swi at layer 14 swi 14 shows the intensity of drought within the root zone soil layer this layer is solely controlled by the past moisture conditions in the swi 12 and thus the precipitation history with increasing profile depth in the swi 14 the temporal dynamic of the moisture conditions is decreasing as the amount of water stored in the reservoir depends on the infiltration of water added to the swi 12 during precipitation events the retrieval algorithm is implemented within a software package called the soil water retrieval package warp quality information on the swi is described in the validation reports of 2018 at copernicus global land service https land copernicus eu 3 3 agrometeorological data a 68 year climatic series from all weather stations precipitation p maximum tmax and minimum temperatures tmin was used to calculate the spei at time scales ranging from 1 to 12 months for the 1951 2018 period the arcgis kriging function was selected to interpolate weather station datasets to the same spatial resolution as satellite datasets we found that by adding an elevation factor ordinary kriging method produced most accurately spatial distribution of p tmax and tmin to quantify pet we used monthly data of the tmin tmax and extra terrestrial radiation then the water balance equation di is used to calculate the monthly deficit pi peti pet is a good indicator for characterizing the climate aridity especially over water limited non humid regions where the actual evapotranspiration is primarily dominated by water availability rather than energy zhang and he 2016 zhang et al 2019a b zhang et al 2019a also proposed a water energy balance approach for multi scalar and multi category drought analysis following vicente serrano et al 2010 and our previous studies potop 2011 potopová et al 2016a the evolved deficit values are standardized and fitted to a log logistic distribution function however the application of generalized extreme value distribution has also been recommended stagge et al 2015 as with the yield and satellite datasets the spei data series were spatially averaged by the nuts2 level to match the spatial resolution of the evi2 and swi indices fig s1 the use of a variety of time scales incorporates the memory of the preceding months which does not happen with remote sensing indices because the annual growth cycle of grapevine begins with bud break in the spring and culminates in leaf fall in autumn followed by winter dormancy the lagged spei effect of drought stress was used the spei 6 at the beginning of flowering and the fruit set period corresponds with june for the berry development and berry filling period with july august for the harvest period with september october inter annual variability in grapevine ripening is mostly driven by air temperature whereas water availability is reported as a major climatic factor for greenness the monthly lagged spei for summer crops comprised the major growth cycle stages pre sowing and sowing early spring middle of spring the beginning of the vegetative stage end of spring early summer the reproductive stages middle of summer and the ripening and harvest stages end of summer early autumn 3 4 multiple linear regressions and artificial neural network models drought impacts on yield crops by two independent methods multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural network ann have been applied anns are nonlinear models capable of capturing nonlinear relationships in data while mlr models capture linear behaviour of the relationship between crop yield and water three different crops are exposed to large inter annual variability thus heterogeneity of agro meteorological processes explaining the yield losses cannot be synthesized in a single predictor or week 3 4 1 multiple linear regression models first to determine the best time to make an accurate yield estimation and or the moments of vegetative cycle of the highest crop requirements for moisture conditions a preliminary correlation analysis was calculated between the observed yield of maize sunflower and grapevine and weekly evi2 swi 12 or swi 14 time series for each district over years 2000 2018 second mlr models were developed on the same data sets for maize sunflower and grapevine thus each resulting model nomenclature refers to the target crop yield letter m for maize s for sunflower g for grapevine the respective agro climatic regions i north ii central iii south and the possible combination of predictors for example the model mlr1 ypm i refers to the yield estimation of the maize in the northern agricultural region based on the statistically significant weeks of evi2i we also attempted to minimize the signal of random greenness of evi2 by calculating an adjustment factor for each crop crop specific evi2 i e estimating the spatial average weighted by the area of harvested crop in each district moreover because the yield of crops is not only affected by water availability but also by soil quality fertilization plant protection and the overall intensity of the cropping system in the individual districts the historical yield of crops for individual districts nuts2 was introduced as another predictor variable in some of the prediction models this will help to take account of this variation and improve the prediction ability of models the crop specific evi2i and swi 12i derived from the average crop yield y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g for each district thus parameters y i 0 s y i 0 s and y i 0 g defines as average crop yield over years 2000 2018 for maize sunflower and grapevine respectively finally the best predictors found during the crop cycle were considered input to the ann 3 4 2 bayesian regularized neural network in this study a bayesian regularized neural network bbn was adopted using the brnn package of r project software r core team 2019 perez rodriguez and gianola 2018 the bbns are mathematical models composed of several layers of neurons and connections between neurons each connection transfers the output of a neuron to the input of a neuron in the following layer the brnn function fits a two layer neural network as described by mackay 1992 and foresee and hagan 1997 it uses the nguyen and widrow algorithm 1990 to assign initial weights and the gauss newton algorithm to perform the optimization the bayesian approach decreases the risk of overfitting by putting a prior distribution on the network weights van hinsbergen et al 2009 therefore bbn neural networks can provide good generalization capabilities the architectures indicate the number of neurons in the input hidden and outputs layers different architectures of the network were tested with the number of neurons in the hidden layers between 1 and 3 the number of neurons in the input layer corresponds to the number of selected predictors for each model the ypm yps ypg were used as model targets while evi 2i swi 12i speii and y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g were used as model inputs the number of neurons in the input layer depends on the number of selected predictors for each target the performance of the proposed neural network was assessed using a leave one out cross validation procedure this method assesses the model prediction capability by successively using one of the observations from the original data for validation and the remaining observations as the training data kuhn 2019 the number of iterations is equal to the total number of observations an error estimate is obtained as a mean value of the errors calculated in each iteration the performance of each model was measured by the determination coefficient r2 the mean absolute error mae and the root mean squared error rmse between the observed yield and the model estimations once the models were developed their predictive skill ss was assessed via a validation phase as reported in previous study e g johnson et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal evolution of weekly evi2 swi 12 and swi 14 to illustrate the performance of two satellite derived indices figs 3 4 summarized the evolution of soil moisture and vegetation conditions over all districts the multiannual weekly cycle of swi 12 for each district in the north central and south agro climatic regions is depicted in fig 3a b the swi 12 shows the bimodal seasonal cycle of drying and the highest depletion of soil moisture occurred early in the growing season the drying peak in early spring is presumably related to an early melt of snow which predates the seasonal decline of soil moisture a similar event occurred in central europe potopová et al 2016b ruosteenoja et al 2017 the low values of swi 12 during the early season in conjunction with atmospheric summer drought could explain the decreasing summer crop yields in the last decade in the wine growing regions however the grapevines continue to grow productively highlighting the role of root structure for grapevine vigour the fluctuation of weekly swi in the driest year of 2007 at the topsoil 2008 normal year for grape and the best year 2018 for grape are included in fig 3c e the lowest values of weekly swi 12 and swi 14 at the topsoil and the root zone layers respectively were recorded in 2007 fig 3c which was the driest year in the study the highest values of weekly swi 12 and swi 14 were recorded in 2018 fig 3e the wettest early growing season where extreme precipitation events occurred and resulted in excess moisture in soil as well as waterlogging consequently the extremely wet soil conditions in the early growing season of 2018 were diagnosed by the swi 12 swi 14 and the extreme atmospheric drought in the later growing season was highlighted by the 1 month spei thus the countrywide appearance of waterlogging and drought damage collectively affected more than 30 000 farmers to evaluate the temporal explanatory ability of the evi2 fig 4a d the multiannual greenness cycle for each district in the north central and south agro climatic regions were determined the weekly evi2 captures the multiannual fluctuations in the rate of greenness growth the greenness values increased from the beginning of the growing season reaching a maximum at weeks 21 26 followed by a decrease until the end of the growing season these results are in agreement with the literature huete et al 2002 jiang et al 2008 the evi2 anomalies confirm the existence of high inter annual variability in the rate of land greenness with the lowest values recorded in the driest years which were 2007 and 2012 fig 5 a b the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation stress obtained with evi2 anomalies is in agreement with the drought conditions quantified by the 6 mo 10 mo 12 mo spei and swi 12 swi 14 identifying this drought year as responsible for the reduced vegetation activity the highest values of weekly evi2 were recorded in the wettest growing seasons which were in 2010 and 2018 this pattern is in accordance with the results obtained by the spei and páscoa et al 2018 as result the situations corresponding to dry soils and low vegetation in 2007 and wet soil high vegetation in 2018 are particularly seen in the 21 30 weeks of the year these specific conditions could be helpful factors in identifying the beginning or the end of a drought period the frequency of dry weeks with worsening vegetation and soil moisture conditions quantified by the evi2 and the swi 12 i e values dropping below the long term average are summarized in figs 5c 6 c overall broadly similar anomalies in the soil moisture and vegetation conditions occurred the lowest number of dry weeks occurred simultaneously in vegetation and soil conditions in 2010 2013 and 2014 heating and precipitation excess but opposing phenomena the highest frequency of weeks with worsening vegetation and soil moisture conditions occurred in 2007 2012 and 2015 heating and precipitation deficit the opposing sensed phenomena the lower frequency of weeks with worsening vegetation conditions and a higher number of dry weeks with worsening soil moisture conditions in the topsoil occurred simultaneously in the growing seasons with cooling and precipitation deficits e g 2011 the swi 12 data highlight that the soil moisture surplus from 2017 and 2018 could not compensate for the heating phenomena which dominated in almost all districts in the southern region fig s1 2 thus despite evi2 and swi 12 having similar temporal evolution the soil moisture anomalies evolved spatially differently across countries because of differences in the preceding conditions and the magnitude of the atmospheric drought in the southern region the summer rainfall was not as extensive as it was in the northern region which meant that vegetation conditions deteriorated more quickly once the weather became hotter and drier while evi2 and swi 12 14 are widely used as proxies for dryness and vegetation activity bauer marschallinger et al 2018a b kern et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2019 respectively it still needs to be emphasized that both metrics are only highly simplified proxies of dryness and vegetation activity we also found differences in the time spent under drought conditions between the evi2 and spei this difference suggests that the land greenness can be delayed by several weeks after the meteorological conditions improve spei 1 because the crops were too badly damaged to fully recover over a short period of time wang et al 2011 2016 2018 also observed that the impact of precipitation on vegetation does not occur instantaneously atmospheric dryness that occurs in a month spei 1 does not strongly affect vegetation in that month 4 2 identifying significant predictors to better identify the temporal window during which evi2 swi 12 swi 14 and spei are most predictive of yields in this study correlation plots are shown in fig 7 a l computed between remote sensing indices climatic index and the yield of summer crops grapevines for each agro climatic region from weeks 14 45 weeks 1 52 such behaviour in fig 7a l is closely related to the growth dynamic of summer crops grape which can vary from one year to the other through the combination of agricultural practices and climatic conditions e g dry and wet moisture conditions which can reduce or accelerate the growth rate the all the correlation coefficients passed the significance test of α 0 05 which indicated the evi2 was significantly highly correlated with sunflower yields r up to 0 84 and maize yields r up to 0 75 while the relationship was moderate for grape yields r up to 0 84 we also observed different relationships between evi2 and grape yields for the early mid and late growing seasons with r values of 0 25 0 84 and 0 30 respectively the relationship between evi2 and summer crop yields was higher with r values of 0 58 0 84 and 0 21 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively because evi2 is designed to respond to vegetation development it is not surprising that we found lower correlations between evi and crop yields in the early and late growing seasons where the soil colour is the dominant driver of the red and nir spectral response based on nir red reflectance soil likely contributed to increased variability and decreased correspondence between yield and vegetation as correlations for yield and evi2 systemically increased with vegetation density the highest correlation between evi2 and the yield of maize was found during weeks 25 30 and for sunflower yield during weeks 23 28 fig 7a b the best time values were found to approximately coincide with the periods of heading flowering and filling of the crops which is comparable to the results of potopová et al 2016a hence the predictors used in the estimated yield models for maize were the values of evi2 from weeks 25 30 and for sunflower were the values of evi2 from weeks 23 28 respectively the optimal time window for grapevine yield estimated fig 7c was found to be from weeks 23 30 early june to late july 1 3 months before harvest despite the fact that summer crops maize sunflower are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth however the swi 12 fig 7d e f had the stronger correlation with crop yield then swi 14 fig 7g h l since swi 14 averages the soil water content from the surface to 1 m depth it is not always the best index sandra et al 2018 the swi 14 is not sensitive enough for most field crops which even at their maximum have a great majority of roots concentrated within the first 40 cm of the soil profile fan et al 2017 and in early stages of growth there are no roots below this depth this explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and swi 12 which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil i e to 0 4 m even in the case of grapevine which as perennial plants have roots established well below 1 m the majority of roots are present in the first 50 cm of soil e g cellete et al 2005 in any case all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season with swi 12 performing better than swi 14 when water was the main factor controlling maize or sunflower yield the importance of the swi 12 values varied across the growing season in the first part of the growing season the correlation coefficients are negative and the soil water content decreases below the optimal conditions as a result dry anomalies represent harmful conditions because the available soil water is too low to provide enough water in the most drought susceptible phases the correlation also dropped around spring in weeks 16 21 when the lowest moisture was in the soil these findings suggest that during the pre sowing and sowing periods of maize and sunflower there is a narrow window of perhaps 2 3 weeks when the swi of the entire profile is critical conversely the remote sensing soil moisture indices are able to discern that early season water use by grapevines was usually replenished by winter snow rain and soil water content was not lower than the arable crops which could even be a benefit for final forming yield fig 7f i these results highlight that the availability of water in the first part of the growing season is key for the successful cultivation of arable crops in south eastern europe as a result crops affected by water stress often have lower yields and the ability to capture these impacts through remote sensing indices depends on the timing of the stress likewise kern et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 and ribeiro et al 2019 suggested that if the stress event occurs before the peak of the growing season it will reduce growth and result in lower peak evi2 and or ndvi in this case the relationship between yield and peak evi2 may be more useful than swi 12 for grapes the stress happens after the peak of the growing season e g during fruit berry set which may not affect the peak of evi2 and the relationship between grape yield and evi2 is usually weaker when studying the drought related yield losses based on spei and crop yields we found that summer crops presented a high vulnerability to drought and the correlation between crop yields and spei were highest in july fig 7j l the significant positive correlations increase with the spei time scale potop 2011 potopová et al 2016b c and the results of the lagged spei 10 suggest that the rainfall is inefficient to meet evapotranspiration requirements during the entire growing season the spring water balance did not replenish soil water content levels after sowing summer crops the relationship between the spei 10 and grapevine yields was lower than the evi2 with r values of 0 15 0 42 and 0 19 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively while the correlation between the spei 10 and summer crop yields was higher with r values of 0 41 0 68 and 0 28 for the early middle and late growing seasons respectively this shows that the yield decreases with a decrease in the spei that is the drier atmospheric conditions are the higher the yield loss 4 3 drought driven yield loss risk the observed maize sunflower yield ranged from the north to south districts between 3 8 and 1 5 tha 1 1 9 and 1 2 tha 1 and 1 5 and 3 8 tha 1 for grapevines fig 8 thus there are decreases increases in summer crops perennial crops yields toward the southern districts a key observation was high yield losses in grapevine yields for northern districts which point towards the facts that areas with lower yields or less contribution to regional production demonstrate higher inter annual variation than the key producing regions such as central districts the crop yields of maize sunflower and grapevines have exhibited substantial variations during the past decade figs 9 10 and crop yield reductions are often observed when they are experiencing a severe drought waterlogging as shown in fig 9 crop yield is currently most prone to climate induced stresses there is a moderately high risk of failure in summer crop production and a very low economic return for almost all districts for sunflower and maize the south region shows the highest risk of yield reduction under droughts while a relatively low risk is observed for grape production in the central region this could be attributed to the fact that grape is more sensitive to temperature than precipitation irimia et al 2017 costea et al 2018 drought stress led to a decrease in suitable area by 45 and 32 in maize and sunflower respectively under dryness soil and the detrimental effects were ameliorated of around 23 in both crops in the northern districts thus the most vulnerable crop areas for sunflower are situated in the southern districts fig 9 characterized by the highest frequency of the soil drought fig 6c and high proportion of row crops in the total agricultural area potopová et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 the lack of soil moisture in the sowing stage of maize coupled with the extremely high temperatures during the flowering stage led to a drastic decrease in yields in central and southern districts thus the cropping system is not keeping pace with changes in drought severity as is the case for maize systems the distribution of yield loss related climate drought index at the national level fig 10 showed a substantial association between drought and yield reductions the nonlinear yield response to the increase in drought severity implies that yield loss risk tends to grow progressively independent of crop types the latter is in accordance with leng and hall 2019 who found that the yield loss risk grows non linearly with an increase in drought severity figs fig 11 11 fig 12 12 present an example of impacts of fluctuations in the soil moisture at the topsoil swi 12 and the root zone layer swi 14 on maize sunflower and grape for each harvested district the soil moisture induced impact accelerated yield losses due to lower soil water content at the topsoil which occurred in the majority key producing districts of summer crops 10 2 overall the swi 14 index reveals that soil water content at the root zone layer of maize and sunflower is also insufficient for the fullest expression of the production potential of crops over time it has been estimated that low levels of soil moisture limit summer crops production in about 77 of the nation s cultivated lands we found that climate drought risk expressed in terms of the spei and syrs is an increasing problem during middle of the growing season meanwhile the soil drought risk expressed by the swi 12 swi 14 and crop specific yield y i 0 m y i 0 s y i 0 g showed in the early of the growing season over the past 19 years a lack of soil moisture can form significantly earlier in spring than it has been usual thus the swi was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics at the topsoil swi 12 and the root zone layer swi 14 4 4 maize yield estimation models with a high number of predictors are less successful therefore the best models to explain yield have been selected per the agro climatic region the performance of validation models for yield estimation are as follows 1 evi2i only vegetation model greenness model mlr1 bbn1 2 evi2i adjusted greenness model mlr2 bbn2 3 swi 12i only soil moisture model mlr3 bbn3 4 swi 12i adjusted soil moisture model mlr4 bbn4 5 swi 12i x evi2i the adjusted soil vegetation model mlr5 bbn5 and 6 swi 12i x evi2i x speii the adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model mlr6 bbn6 the statistical models of risk generated by the mlr and bbn are described in tables table 2 2 table 3 3 tables s1 4 respectively and their levels of predictive skill are assessed in fig 13 a c the statistics in tables s1 2 fig 13a show that bayesian neural network techniques slightly improved the performance of the maize mlr models the mlr models were able to explain 58 16 and 82 9 of the yield variability at the significance level of 0 02 in agreement with the assessment of model skill the adjusted greenness models the soil vegetation models and the soil vegetation atmosphere model recorded the highest performance of both bbn and mlr techniques adding it to models as additional predictors appears to improve the estimation skill of both mlr and bbn approaches fig 13a the simple evi2i model gives less predictive power and the evi2i adjusted model gives higher skill scores the performance of the mlr1 bbn1 expressed by r2 was 0 531 0 564 within districts in the north 0 583 0 591 in central and 0 543 0 545 in southern regions at the significance level of 0 05 the performance of mlr2 bbn2 varies from 0 653 0 707 within districts in the north to 0 640 0 646 in central and 0 696 0 734 in south districts at the significance level of 0 02 we also confirm earlier findings burke and lobell 2017 that the adjusted greenness model was able to capture the effects of nutrient stress on maize yield with bbn2 more suited to this challenge than mrl2 johnson et al 2016 the swi 12i only mlr3 bbn3 model can explain 48 3 of the observed maize yield variability in the north 50 6 in the centre and 56 2 in the south the inclusion of evi2i in the soil moisture bbn5 model led to improving the predictive power of the swi 12i this model offers different information from predictors of swi 1225 30 x evi225 30 x y i 0 m showing how well the crop is growing and whether crops are experiencing soil moisture deficits and or surpluses in critical stages for districts within regions ii and iii the values of the regression coefficients of mlr models during weeks 25 30 had positive results for evi225 27 and negative results for swi 1225 27 table s5 confirming the aforementioned overall results thus the combination of swi 1225 30 x evi225 30 predictors during the optimal time window for maize yield estimating better explains the variability in crop yield via the bbn approach to illustrate how these two parameters are related over larger domains wagner et al 2013 show the correlation of monthly ndvi and swi time series over africa for agricultural areas they showed that the correlation is strong in regions with a strong seasonal vegetation cycle the relationship between swi and ndvi was exploited by zribi et al 2010 who developed a methodology to predict the following month s ndvi based on the current month s ndvi and swi values wang et al 2016 also performed accurate monitoring of winter wheat drought threats in northern china using multiple climate based drought indices and soil moisture data during 2000 2013 fig 14 presents an example of the spatial distribution of mean bias error estimated yield by the adjusted soil moisture model mlr4 for each harvested district in general the variability of the maize yield is overestimated by the adjusted soil moisture model mostly because negative yield deviations are not captured by the model however the model is able to predict the observed values over the entire period the long term differences between the estimated and observed maize yields for the period 2000 2018 are between 1 5 and 0 5 tha 1 4 5 sunflower yield estimation tables 2 3 fig 13b show the results of the statistical evaluation of the predictors used to develop mlr and bbn models for sunflower the values of the regression coefficients and the explained variance for sunflower yields are very similar to those obtained for maize in the mlr models table s5 moreover the r2 and skill score of sunflower mlr and bbn models were higher than for maize and estimated yield with reasonable accuracy and predictive power in most cases bayesian neural network models showed higher r2 and ss values than the multiple linear regression models especially for more complex models bbn5 mlr5 mlr6 and bbn6 interestingly the simple aggregated greenness model evi2i can explain 80 of the observed yield variance by both mlr and bbn techniques the model with increased skill had an adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model based on mlr6 86 4 α 0 01 and bbn 87 8 α 0 01 the spei proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the sunflower yield assessment this finding is likely due to the greater impacts of drought with an increasing evaporation deficit over the past decade of the dataset mouatadid et al 2018 páscoa et al 2018 potopová et al 2019 thus mlr6 and bbn6 models may be useful in estimating sunflower yield the mlr1 and mlr2 models were able to capture 48 5 80 1 of the variance in sunflower yield losses while the bbn1 and bbn2 models also captured 50 2 88 2 and they all passed the significance test of α 0 01 thus greenness models showed that when conditions for plant growth are favourable the evi225 27 and evi228 30 predictors had similar information regardless of the vegetation type a lower level of estimated power was observed between observed and predicted sunflower yield for mlr3 bbn3 models therefore the non crop specific aggregated swi 12 is not applicable with slightly less predictive power when assessed for estimated power with the adjusted soil moisture model the regression model mlr4 outperformed the bayesian network bbn4 in predictive skill and was able to capture 48 of the variance yield the incorporation of the vegetation index slightly improved the predictive power of the soil moisture model 4 6 grapevine yield estimation tables s3 4 fig 13c show the statistical performance metrics of the mlr and bbn grapevine models although the all models were characterized with low r2 and ss values it also passed the significance test of α 0 05 moreover when the crop specific swi 12i and evii were used to predict grape yield the bbn models could produce a prediction accuracy of larger than 50 similarly significant statistical models were found for mlr which were able to predict crop yield with an accuracy of 48 respectively thus there are few differences among linear and nonlinear models for grape and the predictive power of some bbn models is poorer than that of the regression models similar results were obtained in other studies that compared neural networks with regression and found a significantly better performance of regression over neural networks johnson et al 2016 two models were considered to have a moderate skill score and the simple greenness model aggregated to grape yield mlr2 and the complex model of mlr6 the output of mlr2 bbn2 and mlr6 bbn6 models fit well with the observed grape yield which means that if using these for predictors we can construct a relatively good model fig s4 and table s5 the preferred model is also mlr2 ypg ii mlr2 ypg iii which can explain 38 1 48 5 of the grape yield variability and has predictive power for explaining 43 1 53 5 of the variance at the p 0 05 statistical level for nonlinear models the preferred models are bbn5 ypg ii and bbn5 ypg iii bbn5 ypg ii can explain 42 1 of the observed grape yield variability and bbn5 ypg iii might explain 50 2 of the yield variance p 0 04 thus the bbn5 model showed that when grapevine is impacted by the soil drought the biochemical constituent of the crop changes and so would be the spectral signatures and greenness evi2i when the spei 107 with remote sensing predictors was included bbn6 the r2 values increased by a few percent and the predictive power both increased by 5 and explained additional variances relative to the adjusted soil vegetation model bbn5 this finding is likely because the monthly spei has a longer averaging time and might mask anomalies whereas the evi221 24 swi 1221 24 and evi227 30 swi 1227 30 predictors using shorter time periods and might be more useful ribeiro et al 2019 páscoa et al 2018 5 summary and conclusion given the large and rapidly increasing number of drought studies conducted by remote sensing indices this study offers the following recommendations to improve statistical modelling of risk using linear and nonlinear machine learning methods for yield estimation utilizing remote sensing data in yield estimation models can be a key component in addressing issues of global food security particularly in data limited regions soil vegetation atmosphere indicators were included in an attempt to identify and enhance yield estimation this study can serve as a baseline for future analyses including other methods to improve estimation of drought related yield losses the interactions between drought and crop production requires an understanding of the soil crop atmosphere interactions and associations between atmospheric variables soil moisture variables and the crop yield variability such as new management practices and technologies the evi2 and swi 12 swi 14 were innovatively proposed to identify drought conditions for the first time in the rm compared with station data remote sensing soil moisture products have the advantages of wide coverage and dynamic which can effectively compensate for the deficiency in the spatial distribution of the weather stations first we explore and discuss studies related to the use of remote sensing indices in crop statistical modelling coupled with other climatic and agricultural information for improved model performance in order to use the remote sensing data we aggregated them using the crop land mask to the time series representing individual districts at this level data on crop yields and other drought impacts were available which also made it possible to bring together multiple indices originating from different sensors with varying spatial and temporal resolution second the predictive skills of the regression and bayesian network models were compared and the effectiveness that each approach provides to yield estimation was discussed we realize that standardized indices cannot be used in all models therefore we developed two simple models based on the satellite derived indices the evi2i only vegetation model and the swi 12i only soil moisture model and four models adjusted to crop yield type adjusted greenness model adjusted soil moisture model adjusted soil vegetation model and adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model we found that the nonlinear models slightly improved the performance of the linear models which is similar to the results of the study of johnson et al 2016 a linear model is also useful because evi2 is considered to be linearly related to crop photosynthetic capacity which can be used to model crop biomass accumulation and yield nonetheless we recommend the use of a mixed approach to yield the most useful results for yield estimation particularly for the short period of available satellite data the proposed models could be easily implemented in other regions of the globe because the inputted satellite data for both vegetation evi2 and soil moisture swi 12 swi 14 and gridded spei are available globally and in near real time moreover the swi model has been sufficiently verified by observation data by the large validation and inter comparison studies across the globe wagner et al 2013 paulik et al 2014 or locally in southern brocca et al 2010 and central europe thaler et al 2018 the yield estimations are an important adaptation tool that can assist farmers in assessing and potentially mitigating drought related risks to crop production to put our results into the context of global food production we conclude that i both the regression and bayesian network algorithms identified that the lower performers had the simpler soil moisture models and the higher performers had adjusted greenness models to crop yield type and adjusted soil vegetation models thus crop specific derived evi2i and swi 12i were found to be the better predictors though spei generally added extra skill in light of the growing importance of drought impacts on crop yields and the projections of more frequent and extreme droughts in the near future therefore we also suggest using standardized indices to quantify drought related yield losses ii the accurate estimation of maize sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest rmse of 1 2 tha 1 it is not surprising that the model with the highest estimation skill score had sunflower satellite derived models followed by maize and then grapevines iii although the adjusted soil vegetation atmosphere model was a good fit for summer crops between the estimated and observed yields increasing differences from the northern to southern districts were found for the mlr6 and bbn6 maize models for grapes the greatest differences between the observed and estimated yield values were recorded in more southerly districts with higher frequencies of severe drought iv the equations of the fitted grape mlr models show that early soil moisture deficit has a greater impact on the reduction in yield than on late soil moisture deficit the reduction in grape yield through excessive soil moisture stress occurs much less frequently than the loss of yield due to insufficient water deficit the regression coefficients of evi2 spei swi 12 and swi 14 with the yield of summer crops gradually reduced increased when moving from the semi arid southern area to a more humid northern area these results suggest that evi2 swi 12 swi 14 and spei can be used more effectively to demonstrate the progress of agricultural drought under varying climates and its impacts on the crop yields since summer crops are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth a two layer soil scheme was used to model the soil dynamics over the entire root zone depth this study does not only provide a yield losses assessment using soil moisture and vegetation remote sensing indices based on the crop specific soil moisture model we found that topsoil moisture declines during the growing season dry anomalies create stress conditions because the available soil water is too low to provide enough water in the most drought susceptible crop growth stages it demonstrates that an introduction of integrated soil crop system management based on systematic use of cultural methods crop rotation and soil conservation tillage use of water saving technologies drip irrigation growing of drought tolerant crop varieties and use of agro climatic decision support tools based on soil vegetation atmosphere models seem to be

10614,increasing irrigation efficiencies remains the focus of numerous efforts to mitigate water scarcity in reality higher local efficiencies do often not reduce water scarcity but instead cause a redistribution of water flows when the entire irrigation scheme or river basin is considered insufficient understanding of consumed fractions and non consumptive use i e return flows have led to ineffective or even harmful water conservation measures in this paper we demonstrate a novel method for spatial quantification of the consumed fraction cf of withdrawn irrigation water based on satellite remote sensing and the budyko hypothesis this method was applied to evaluate consumption of irrigation water etblue total water supply and non consumptive use across the indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan an average etblue of 707 mm yr from irrigated cropland was found for 2004 2012 with values per canal command area cca varying from 421 mm yr to 1011 mm yr although canal supply 662 mm yr on average in most ccas was largely sufficient to sustain etblue a similar volume of additional pumping 690 mm yr was required to comply with hydro climatological principles prescribed by budyko theory cf values between 0 38 and 0 66 were computed at cca level with an average value of 0 52 co occurrence of relatively low cf values high additional water supply and long term canal diversions similar to etblue implies that the ibis is characterized by extensive reuse of non consumed flows within ccas in addition the notably higher cf of 0 71 0 93 of the full ibis indicates that return flow reuse between ccas cannot be neglected these conclusions imply that the ibis network of irrigators is adapted to extensively recover and reuse drainage flows on different spatial scales water saving and efficiency enhancement measures should therefore be implemented with great caution by relying on globally available satellite products and limited additional data this novel method to determine consumed fractions and non consumed flows can support policy makers worldwide to make irrigation systems more efficient without detriment to downstream users keywords consumed fraction non consumptive use water reuse budyko remote sensing 1 introduction pressure on water resources is expected to increase in many of the world s river basins due to population growth and the associated increase in demand for food fiber and biofuels changing precipitation evapotranspiration and carbon fluxes are projected to further exacerbate water shortages recent policy reports and development programs supported by global institutions as well as scientific and popular articles promote irrigation efficiency improvements as a solution to water scarcity e g world bank 2016 siyal et al 2016 sultana et al 2016 usaid 2016 this perspective contradicts however with the growing body of work conveying the notion that aiming for more efficient water use in agriculture will not solve the water crisis fao 2017 grafton et al 2018 lankford 2012 perry 2011 the latter studies address the paradoxical effect of intended water savings having adverse effects by in fact boosting water consumption scott et al 2014 this efficiency paradox occurs when farmers find new use for the freed up water by expanding irrigated areas introducing new crops with higher water requirements or switching from deficit to full irrigation berbel et al 2015 gómez and pérez blanco 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2017 by now the occurrence of this phenomenon its preconditions and implications have been well described in a large number of case studies e g pfeiffer and lin 2014 contor and taylor 2013 lecina et al 2010 rodriguez díaz et al 2012 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 when no policy mechanisms are in place that incentivize farmers to reduce withdrawals or restrict either irrigated area or consumptive water use there is a high risk of efficiency enhancing measures leading to reduced non consumed flows i e return flows for effective planning of irrigation technology improvements and policies it is therefore essential to understand the dependencies between water users anthropogenic as well as natural across a river basin reuse of non consumed flows within and between sectors is facilitated by both natural pathways and human interventions and results in a complex interplay between surface water and groundwater flows grogan et al 2017 intensity and complexity of reuse networks typically increase with scale simons et al 2015 wu et al 2019 environmental flow requirements of downstream ecosystems are often neglected while their vulnerability to changes in agricultural non consumed flows is potentially very high carrillo guerrero et al 2013 pastor et al 2014 as the conclusion of a literature review on impacts of drip irrigation introduction van der kooij et al 2013 called for an increased awareness of the scale dependency of efficiencies and unintended re allocations of water flows to achieve this objective and to account for spatial tradeoffs in policies and regulations quantitative data on consumed and non consumed portions of withdrawals are required quantifying consumed fractions on different scales would support assessments of the likely scope for water saving by irrigation modernization or policy alterations berbel and mateos 2014 in addition it would support implementation of evapotranspiration caps in water rights systems a key policy instrument to ensure water availability to downstream users e g dagnino and ward 2012 bastiaanssen et al 2008 data availability is currently a major limiting factor in the uptake of existing water reuse frameworks and indicators simons et al 2015 wiener et al 2016 demonstrated how water reuse can be well characterized for a watershed where extensive records of withdrawals consumptive use and non consumed flows are available this is however not the case for most river basins governmental line agencies are struggling with the quantitative assessment of consumed fractions estimates of consumed fractions are therefore commonly limited to static literature values assumed at country level based on prevailing irrigation types despite spatially varying biophysical factors having significant effects jägermeyr et al 2015 plot level efficiency measurements in an experimental setting remain the main source of quantitative information bos et al 2005 bos and nugteren 1990 with simple extrapolation of these values to larger spatial scales increasing chances of misunderstandings and mismanagement merks 2018 molden and sakthivadivel 1999 by definition an assessment of consumed fractions in an irrigation context requires estimates of i the volume of water that is withdrawn for irrigation and ii the fraction of this water that evaporates to quantify the latter over the past years the scientific community has turned to satellite remote sensing global satellite derived data products can provide spatiotemporal insight in key hydrological parameters such as precipitation actual evapotranspiration soil moisture changes runoff and storage change bastiaanssen and harshadeep 2005 poortinga et al 2017 simons et al 2016 local estimates of consumed irrigation water can for example be obtained by analyzing evapotranspiration of nearby sites with similar land use but known to be solely rainfed van eekelen et al 2015 as satellites cannot measure water withdrawals coupling remote sensing with simulation models has been explored for evaluating irrigation dynamics droogers et al 2010 peña arancibia et al 2016 santos et al 2008 promising results were achieved but site specific calibration remains necessary prohibiting an easily scalable monitoring approach in addition some global scale hydrological models compute consumed fractions by partitioning irrigation water into consumed and non consumed flows e g jägermeyr et al 2015 although this enables scenario studies at the global scale their applicability for monitoring purposes at the basin level remains limited application of the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is an approach that has not yet been pursued by the scientific community for quantifying consumptive use of irrigation water the budyko curve prescribes the theoretical partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration based on water and energy climatologies it has frequently been applied successfully for purposes of developing constraining and validating water balance models e g zhang et al 2008 gentine et al 2012 chen et al 2013 poortinga et al 2017 although initially developed for natural river basins in dynamic equilibrium and with precipitation as the sole source of water supply extensions and re formulations of the original budyko approach have recently been proposed to evaluate the water balance of systems with anthropogenic supply or storage of water chen et al 2020 greve et al 2016 wang et al 2016 these formulations have previously been tested favorably in irrigated arid environments such as the tarim basin han et al 2011 heihe river basin du et al 2016 and the lower jordan gunkel and lange 2017 in this paper we present a novel method for quantifying consumed fractions of irrigation systems based on budyko theory and satellite derived data products of evapotranspiration and precipitation the approach is demonstrated by describing its application to the indus basin irrigation system which is the largest continuous irrigation system in the world consumptive use irrigation water supply and non consumed flows are presented and findings are discussed in the context of water reuse and water saving potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the pakistani part of the indus basin irrigation system ibis excluding the canal command areas ccas upstream of jinnah barrage fig 1 ibis receives its water mainly from snow melt and glacial waters in the upstream high mountain areas of the himalayas karakoram and hindu kush immerzeel et al 2010 as well as from extraordinary rainfall falling on the windward slopes of the himalayan mountains the major part of ibis surface area has an arid climate and rainfall in catchment areas is a secondary source of water the monsoonal regime causes rainfall during the dry rabi season in the months november to april to be only 30 of that in the rainy kharif season from may to october habib 2004 surface water flow is concentrated in the indus river and its tributaries jhelum chenab ravi sutlej and kabul water is buffered and distributed by a system comprising 3 major reservoirs 18 barrages and headworks 2 major siphons and 12 inter river link canals serving a gross irrigable command area of over 16 million hectares in total qureshi 2011 after extensive consumptive use for irrigation and to a far lesser extent municipal and industrial purposes remaining streamflow downstream of the ibis supports the rich diversity of vegetation and wildlife of the indus delta where the indus river eventually drains into the arabian sea annual environmental flow requirements are in place to combat inundation sea water intrusion and coastal erosion kalhoro et al 2016 drainage flows largely of poor quality are also transported out of the system to evaporation ponds or directly to the sea through the left bank outflow drainage lbod canal basharat and rizvi 2016 cropping intensities in the ibis have increased over the past decades and crop water requirements are at the system scale not fulfilled by the sum of surface water withdrawals and rainfall ullah et al 2001 this discrepancy between water supply and demand is especially experienced by tail end farmers who typically have 32 less water available than head end farmers qureshi et al 2010 inadequacy and unreliability of surface water supply has driven farmers to augment water shortages by pumping groundwater resources reported amounts vary from 52 to 61 km3 yr approaching the volume of annually replenished groundwater of 55 63 km3 yr laghari et al 2012 pbs 2014 watto and mugera 2016 falling groundwater tables are observed in areas with fresh groundwater most notably in the northeastern part of the province of punjab mekonnen et al 2015 particularly eastern punjab is a hotspot of groundwater depletion with water table decline possibly exacerbated by transboundary impacts from extensive groundwater pumping across the indian border cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 watto and mugera 2016 the situation is different in sindh province where groundwater quality is generally marginal to hazardous and groundwater abstractions only constitute 4 8 of total water use qureshi et al 2008 van steenbergen et al 2015 young et al 2019 structural waterlogging is a serious problem here with over half of all cca surface area increasingly affected by shallow water tables due to high surface water supplies and a low level of groundwater pumping as well as poorly functioning drainage facilities and salinization basharat and rizvi 2016 van steenbergen et al 2015 2 2 analytical framework and calculation steps the conceptual framework proposed by simons et al 2015 is followed in this study thus defining the consumed fraction cf as the ratio between consumptive use of irrigation water and total water withdrawal following the common definitions of green and blue water falkenmark and rockström 2006 the component of actual evapotranspiration etact from surface or groundwater resource is denoted as etblue and rain dependent etact is termed etgreen 1 e t a c t e t g r e e n e t b l u e note that etblue is also referred to as incremental evapotranspiration hoogeveen et al 2015 or secondary evaporation van dijk et al 2018 etgreen is referred to as net precipitation in classical formulations of irrigation water requirements jensen and allen 2016 the equation for computing cf then becomes 2 c f e t b l u e q w where qw comprises withdrawals from surface water and or groundwater for irrigation in the context of an ibis cca it is relevant to distinguish two types of inflow 3 q w q d i v q a d d where qdiv represents the volume of surface water diverted at the main canal head qadd comprises additional sources of water such as local non consumed flows that are pumped up fossil groundwater abstraction or drainage water from upstream ccas entering through surface or sub surface pathways other than the main canal the non consumed portion of applied irrigation water is then calculated as the difference between total blue water supply and consumptive use of irrigation water 4 q n c q w e t b l u e the proposed procedure for partitioning etact into etgreen and etblue is based on the budyko hypothesis bh which describes an empirical relation between etact reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p for areas in dynamic equilibrium and with negligible storage changes sposito 2017 the original budyko equation has been reformulated several times in order to account for systematic differences between watersheds this study applies the commonly used budyko reformulation derived by fu 1981 5 e t g r e e n p 1 e t 0 p 1 e t 0 p ω 1 ω where ω is a free parameter that describes the shape of the budyko curve ω can be viewed as an integrated catchment characteristic determined by catchment specific properties such as climate land cover vegetation and soil hydraulics condon and maxwell 2017 li et al 2013 higher ω values indicate a higher etgreen under the same et0 p ratio the aridity index and are thus related to a greater capacity of a basin to retain water for evapotranspiration in many river basins the original bh assumptions are nowadays violated by extensive human influence on the water balance this is in particular the case under irrigated conditions when precipitation can no longer be assumed to be the only source of water available for evapotranspiration chen et al 2020 however various studies have demonstrated that accounting for alternative water sources in addition to p such as canal water supply and storage changes allow for successful application of fu type budyko models in arid irrigated regions du et al 2016 gunkel and lange 2017 han et al 2011 the ω parameter is then considered the indicator to reflect the synthetical influence of basin characteristics on et chen et al 2020 this includes for example the effect of deeper rooting of irrigated crops which enhances access to water from the soil profile zhang et al 2004 as well as the artificial supply of surface water and or groundwater to the crop multi parameter budyko models have been developed to examine these processes under unsteady state conditions such as on monthly or seasonal scales however these extended budyko formulations do not provide additional explanatory power on a multi annual time scale as impacts of short term rainfall and irrigation events are averaged out du et al 2016 greve et al 2016 for the irrigated ibis on a multi annual time scale under the assumption of zero storage changes alternative sources of water are included as follows 6 e t a c t p a d j 1 e t r e f p a d j 1 e t r e f p a d j ω 1 ω where 7 p a d j p q w based on spatially distributed p et0 and ω data see section 2 3 eq 5 can be solved for etgreen by subtracting computed etgreen from satellite derived etact etblue can be calculated as the portion of consumptive water use that cannot be accounted for by rainfall according to the bh fig 2 left panel under the assumption that eq 4 is valid at the pixel scale viola et al 2017 this step yields spatial data of both rainfall and irrigation dependent et subsequently in order to estimate the supply side of cf eq 6 is applied to find the value of padj for which etact padj equals the theoretical value of this ratio prescribed by budyko theory as illustrated in the right panel of fig 2 in this case 1 etact padj equals the runoff fraction rf subtracting p from the comprehensive supply term padj then yields the estimate of qw required for quantifying cf eq 2 if records of qdiv are available qadd can be computed by applying eq 3 to explore reuse of water and unsustainable groundwater pumping an overview of the full approach is presented in fig 3 2 3 datasets this study uses etact data for 2004 2012 from the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop v4 model which is one of several global scale satellite derived etact products available in the public domain senay 2018 senay et al 2013 ssebop is a surface energy balance model that calculates the latent heat flux from land surface temperature measured by the satellite based modis sensor it is based on pixel specific pre defined temperature differences between cold wet and hot dry conditions where air temperature from climate models is used as an indicator for the coldest land surface temperature the performance of ssebop relative to other global etact products and field measurements has been evaluated in multiple studies and has been generally found favorable e g simons et al 2016 fao 2019 another reason for using ssebop in this study is the availability of a corresponding et0 product in the public domain which ensures consistency between et0 and etact as required for bh application the spatial resolution of the ssebop etact and et0 products is 1 km2 and 1 degree respectively although ssebop performance in terms of spatial and temporal dynamics has previously been found satisfactory systematic biases can occur depending on the region of interest and the algorithm should be calibrated based on auxiliary data senay 2018 this relates to the use of a maximum et scaling factor k in the ssebop algorithm which depends on the aerodynamic roughness the degree of advection and prevailing weather conditions among others based on independent estimates of etact e g from field experiments or the conservation of water mass at the river basin scale a potential bias correction of the global ssebop product in a river basin of interest is recommended in this study we take the approach of inventorying previous efforts to quantify etact in the ibis and correcting long term ssebop etact for these values several previous studies have been performed in the indus basin applying locally calibrated models to assess water consumption of irrigated crops table 1 presents the identified studies quantifying annual etact for at least a part of the ibis based on the values presented in these studies and ssebop values for the corresponding years and areas a correction factor of 0 78 was applied to the original global ssebop data to correct for overestimation this linear bias correction is justified due to the linear relation of k to etact in the ssebop formulation next to etact and et0 data on rainfall and the budyko ω parameter are required for application of the bh monthly rainfall data at 5 km resolution were obtained from the quasi global satellite derived climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps v2 0 dataset funk et al 2015 for pakistan in 2004 2012 data from approximately 35 rainfall stations are incorporated in the chirps algorithm to enhance satellite rainfall estimates data on ω were acquired from the study by xu et al 2013 who produced spatially discrete data on ω using a neural network model fed by etact et0 p and streamflow data for 256 river basins their model was trained including ndvi as an explicit input based on 23 years of p et0 and q data the ω values can therefore be seen as representative for this period including impacts of irrigation on vegetation and water depending on surface area the number of unique ω values per cca varies between 1 and 14 finally monthly data on canal diversions and reservoir releases required for partitioning calculated withdrawals into qdiv and qadd were made available by the water and power development agency of pakistan wapda for the years 2004 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration of irrigation water fig 4 shows the position of the 40 ibis ccas in budyko space based on area averaged values of mean annual etact et0 and p over the period may 2004 april 2012 eight full hydrological years each of the ccas has a unique theoretical budyko curve depending on ω for reference fig 4 presents the curves corresponding with minimum and maximum ω at the cca level as well as one for the average ω value for entire ibis all ccas are located well above the budyko curves where it should be noted that the y axis is plotted on a logarithmic scale base 2 to account for the relatively large distances to the theoretical curves the arid climate in the ibis is demonstrated by the high aridity indices plotted on the x axis with ccas located in punjab generally coinciding with lower etact p and et0 p values than those in sindh1 this is representative of the northeast southwest rainfall gradient occurring in ibis overall given budyko theory fig 4 matches expectations with regards to an irrigated system as for none of the ccas the rate of water consumption can be explained by natural water supply through rainfall the theoretical lines in fig 4 can be used to infer the etact value associated with p i e etgreen in eq 5 according to the theoretical concept illustrated in fig 2 etact can now be partitioned into etblue and etgreen for each cca based on the distance to the cca specific theoretical budyko curves fig 5 shows the resulting maps of annual etblue and etgreen averaged for 2004 2012 whereas annual etgreen follows a relatively smooth spatial pattern corresponding with the rainfall gradient etblue is much more heterogeneous and depends on e g crop type canal operations groundwater pumping behavior soil salinity and groundwater quality high values for etblue are particularly observed in the central part of ibis and in southern sindh particularly in areas close to the main river locally values of over 1200 mm of annual etblue occur in rohri lined and khaipur west ccas low etblue values approaching zero are found at the edges of many ccas where irrigation is absent and further from the main canal inlets it is striking that a major part of thal cca surface area has negligible etblue which corresponds with the large extent of rainfed agriculture in this cca reported by the land use land cover map of cheema and bastiaanssen 2010 fig 6 presents cca level averages for annual etblue etgreen and shows that etgreen generally follows the variability of cca averaged rainfall amounts precipitation as is to be expected several ccas in punjab depend on rainfall for a substantial portion of their water consumption with etgreen in four ccas marala ravi link thal upper jhelum brbd internal accounting for over half of total etact this is very different in sindh province with annual etgreen for all ccas at 25 of total etact or less here arid conditions require supply of high volumes of irrigation water to satisfy crop water requirements in punjab province annual etblue values vary between 268 mm yr thal and 937 mm yr upper bahawal qaim in sindh minimum and maximum annual etblue is 588 mm yr k b feeder and 1011 mm yr khaipur west respectively in table 2 etblue and etgreen results are aggregated for provinces as well as for the agro climatic zones distinguished by ullah et al 2001 relatively low eta c t values in the mixed cropping zone can be explained by cultivation of fruit crops that are less water demanding and by high seepage due to presence of sandy soils liaqat et al 2015 ullah et al 2001 the table shows how despite similar overall etact values at the provincial level the relative attribution of this consumed water to rainfall and additional irrigation water differs substantially between the provinces the ratio of etgreen over p presented in the far right column of table 2 can be viewed as the percentage of effective rainfall which on the annual scale for the entire ibis amounts to 85 it should be noted that presented values do not include unofficial irrigation outside cca boundaries and that a thorough review of cca boundaries is beyond the scope of the current research 3 2 canal diversions and additional water supply the distance of the ccas to the theoretical budyko curves in fig 4 is indicative of water sources other than precipitation fig 7 presents the ccas in budyko space once again now with measured qdiv added to the supply side of both ratios by adding qdiv as a supply of water the et ratio vertical axis and aridity index horizontal axis decrease reflecting a situation with wetter land surface climatology as a consequence all cca points have moved substantially towards the budyko lines it should be noted that values are annual averages for the 2004 2012 period and only ccas are shown for which at least one full hydrological year of qdiv data is available during this period see table 3 for the years included per cca the majority of the points are still above the theoretical budyko lines suggesting that the sum of precipitation and canal water diversions is unable to explain all water supplied to the crops strikingly as opposed to what was observed in fig 4 sindh ccas are now generally closer to the budyko curve than those in punjab this can be explained by relatively high surface irrigation allocations in sindh as described by van steenbergen et al 2015 excessive canal supplies in several of sindh ccas have been observed to lead to extensive water logging a well known example of this is rice canal no 34 which fits the observation that it approaches the theoretical budyko value in fig 7 k b feeder no 30 is located below the budyko curves which can be explained by the fact that a substantial part of diverted water is transported for domestic use to the megacity of karachi adjacent to the cca phul et al 2010 this cca is therefore excluded from further analyses most punjab ccas are still far from the theoretical budyko curves indicating that a relatively large portion of their water supply comes from sources other than main canal headwaters what follows from fig 7 is that etact in most ccas is attributable to sources of water in addition to rainfall and canal diversions as most cca points plot well above the curve total qw can now be computed from the distance between the actual data points in budyko space and the theoretical budyko curve as prescribed by the cca specific ω values by solving eq 6 for the comprehensive supply term padj and subsequently applying eq 7 a full overview of all blue water fluxes per cca including additional supply qadd as the difference between qw and qdiv is provided in table 3 it is clear that relatively large volumes of qadd are computed for almost all ccas at the same time a substantial amount of non consumed water qnc is computed as apparently qw has to exceed etblue substantially to maintain the hydrological processes imbedded in the budyko hypothesis this annual water balance looks as follows 8 q d i v q a d d e t b l u e q n c for the ibis filling in the terms in eq 8 with their average values yields 662 690 707 645 with all values in mm per year as described in section 2 2 qadd can be a combination of different sources of water both depending on hydrological processes within the respective cca and between ccas it is interesting to explore the qadd term further as it provides insight into the nature of reuse of non consumed flows in the ibis and potentially also includes unsustainable groundwater pumping fig 8 presents qadd relative to other water supply components for all ccas dependency on qadd differs highly among the areas with values ranging between 5 rice and 61 khaipur west at the provincial level these values amount to 47 and 38 of total water supply including precipitation for punjab and sindh respectively this difference could be explained for example by coarser soils with more percolation losses the degree to which canal water allocation meet crop water requirements and groundwater quality issues evaluating multi annual qdiv against etblue provides insight in the long term blue water balance and the source of qadd in ccas where etblue exceeds qdiv qadd must structurally depend on non consumed flows from upstream ccas rainfall recharge outside of cca or total ibis boundaries or unsustainable groundwater use on the other hand positive values for qdiv etblue indicate a net positive contribution of blue water in the corresponding cca to the aquifer system table 3 shows that on average qdiv 662 mm on average is largely able to sustain etblue 707 mm or 107 of qdiv however fig 9 demonstrates that qdiv etblue varies greatly per cca and in fact per province clearly jhang panjnad lower bari doab and rohri are examples of ccas requiring substantial volumes of water on the long term in addition to qdiv to explain irrigation consumptive use an example of the opposite phenomenal is rice canal which due to excessive canal supply has a blue water surplus of 1 8 bcm looking at the provincial level substantial differences exist between punjab and sindh annual etblue in punjab is approximately 7 bcm 15 higher than qdiv whereas for sindh a minor positive qdiv etblue value is calculated the above analysis shows that consumptive use in punjab ccas is more dependent on return flows and aquifer recharge generated outside cca boundaries and or fossil groundwater pumping the latter has received elaborate attention in recent scientific literature and model assessments although local falling water tables due to unsustainable groundwater use are a well known point of concern especially in punjab they cannot be regarded as dominant in explaining qadd volumes since long term qadd is substantially higher than qdiv etblue in all ccas the main source of qadd must lie within the cca and must be replenished within the annual time frame this finding is supported by previous analyses of grace water storage data in which groundwater depletion over the upper indus plain in 2003 2010 was estimated at 1 48 bcm yr or 13 5 mm yr iqbal et al 2016 this corresponds to only 4 of annual qadd computed for the relevant ccas the groundwater balance presented by young et al 2019 based on a comprehensive literature review similarly suggests that the recharge and discharge components of the overall aquifer system are largely in balance overall the budyko based analysis paints a picture of a system where discrepancies between crop water demands and canal water supply during the irrigation season lead to pumping of a mixture of qdiv and qadd based on the magnitude of qadd volumes in both punjab and sindh compared to other blue water fluxes it can be safely stated that this additional supply term mainly consists of local within cca non consumed flows qnc in this regard it is interesting to note the similar magnitude of qadd and qnc presented in table 3 irrigation in ibis ccas is characterized by the pumping of considerable volumes of non consumed flows generated within the same cca which for a major part drain back into the system and are withdrawn again in a next cycle 3 3 consumed fractions and implications for agricultural water management thanks to the availability of etblue and qw data eq 1 can now be applied to calculate consumed fractions of water withdrawals at the cca level fig 10 shows the resulting map of cf across ibis although cf values differ between ccas cf values in sindh are generally found to be higher than in punjab overall cf ranges between 0 38 upper jhelum and 0 66 abbasia at the level of the ibis main ccas with an average size of 4036 km2 the average cf at cca level for entire ibis weighted according to total qw is 0 52 to provide reference for the bh based results table 4 gives an overview of ibis irrigation efficiency values found in scientific literature though efficiency definitions are not consistent among these studies they typically incorporate losses of diverted water in the processes of conveyance through canals and application to the field crop the budyko based analysis generally yields higher values than irrigation efficiencies previously assumed for pakistan which vary between 0 3 and 0 49 this suggests that irrigation in the ibis is more efficient than previously reported mostly based on local scale measurements in comparison to literature efficiency estimates separating beneficial and non beneficial consumption it should be noted that etblue does not discriminate between crop transpiration and soil evaporation which logically yields somewhat higher cf values evaluating cf values on different spatial scales leads to insight in the system scale reuse of non consumed flows in this study it is assumed that the cca level is the minimum scale on which budyko theory assumptions are valid cf of the entire ibis can be estimated by dividing budyko derived etblue by the total water supply to the system as long term net groundwater recharge is virtually zero a conservative estimate of cf can be computed based on total releases of the main reservoirs at the ibis head which in 2004 2012 amounted to 163 6 km3 yr or 990 mm yr on average pbs 2014 cf of entire ibis can then be estimated by the ratio between etblue table 3 and reservoir releases i e 707 990 0 71 however as not all of the released water is used for irrigation purposes a different estimate can be calculated based on total official surface water withdrawals of 125 bcm yr young et al 2019 or 756 mm yr which leads to a total system cf of 0 93 although the real supply volume arguably lies somewhere in between both estimates are well above the cca average of 0 52 and signify a relatively efficient system despite substantial water losses on smaller scales this indicates that non consumed flows to unconfined aquifers drainage canals and baseflow contribution to rivers cause water reuse processes to extend beyond cca borders in reality informal irrigation outside official cca boundaries leads to higher etblue and thus an even greater return flow reuse and system cf when increasing the scope of the analysis to the full transboundary indus basin cf may be further enhanced by lateral groundwater flows between india and pakistan khan et al 2017 this study has successfully quantified total water supply and consumed fractions in the ibis command areas demonstrating the production of considerable volumes of non consumed flows as discussed above this water is not only extensively reused within the ccas for example to mitigate differences in head vs tail canal supplies but also leave cca boundaries for pumping downstream this notion of a dense and complex network of water re use is supported by various studies according to van steenbergen and gohar 2005 an estimated 79 of pumped groundwater in ibis originates from canal seepage percolation from the river and non consumed flows karimi et al 2013 report a basin scale classical efficiency of 84 for the full indus basin incorporating transboundary lateral flows grogan et al 2017 showed that the indus flow regime will significantly shift when consumed fractions are altered due to extensive reuse of non consumed flows it is evident that further increases of system scale cf will impact flow volumes and patterns downstream of kotri barrage and therefore hydrological and sedimentation regimes in the indus delta salik et al 2016 the results of this study exemplify the need to account for the system scale when considering efficiency improvement measures in the ibis in practice increases in evapotranspiration in the ibis are often achieved by a reduction in groundwater recharge exacerbating the decline of the groundwater table and reducing water availability to downstream users ahmad et al 2007 by providing spatially disaggregated cf values the proposed approach facilitates a more effective and tailored development of water conservation measures in the different ccas it is found that in many ccas field scale efficiency improvements may impact on an existing equilibrium of non consumed flows and reuse of these flows by others as part of their qadd however in areas where observations of rapidly falling groundwater tables coincide with a relatively low cf such as on the upper indus plain fig 10 appropriate measures could result in a greater sustainability of the system similarly occurrence of low cf values in areas with hazardous groundwater quality particularly found in sindh may justify interventions to minimize recharge of saline groundwater bodies 4 conclusions and recommendations a new method for spatially quantifying consumptive use of irrigation water based on the budyko hypothesis was successfully demonstrated for the ibis in pakistan the innovation is twofold as the approach i distinguishes green and blue water consumption using reference evapotranspiration and precipitation data and ii computes total water supply to support consumed fraction estimates which are essential for understanding system scale water use and potential for water savings it was found that out of the average annual etact of 927 mm yr 707 mm yr 76 depends on irrigation water etblue values vary greatly among ccas with a range of 421 to 1011 mm yr as a consequence of differing canal headwater volumes crop types climate conditions and groundwater quality among others by evaluating budyko based total blue water supply against long term main canal diversions it was concluded that most command areas rely substantially on water not diverted at the head of the primary canal with additional supply qadd 690 mm yr on average even slightly exceeding qdiv 662 mm yr the average consumed fraction of the ibis canal command areas was computed at 0 52 with cca values ranging between 0 38 and 0 66 from the relatively low cf values high additional water supplies and long term canal supplies largely sufficient to sustain etblue the conclusion can be drawn that the ibis is characterized by extensive reuse of non consumed flows within ccas at the same time a notably higher cf at the system scale indicates that reuse of non consumed water facilitated by lateral connectivity between ccas cannot be disregarded these conclusions imply that although the ibis is generally not regarded as an efficient irrigation system it is in fact tailored to recover and reuse drainage flows on different spatial scales water saving measures should therefore be implemented with caution it is recommended to supplement the results of this study with ancillary information on groundwater quality and groundwater table time series to identify locations where cf increases may be beneficial on the system scale it should be noted that the accuracy of the cca map used in this study is continuously under revision by government institutions allowing for more refined cf assessments in the future e g by accounting for irrigated area dynamics and city boundaries by providing quantitative estimates of previously unexposed parameters etblue cf and qnc per cca the proposed approach contributes significantly to the understanding of water consumption and reuse in the ibis results of the consecutive steps of the budyko based approach climatology and et partitioning consumptive use and assessments of water supply components were shown to be in agreement with the existing knowledge base on the ibis a big advantage of the method over alternative approaches is that estimates of etblue qadd and qnc were produced without the need for complex hydrological models data on soil parameters or assumptions on curve numbers although diversion data were used for partitioning total withdrawals into canal water and additional supply they are not required for the basic etblue and cf analyses allowing for application of the method in ungauged irrigated basins as the use of global satellite derived data products allows worldwide replication the proposed method holds great potential for more accurate evaluation of consumptive use reuse and dependencies among water users in river basins this can facilitate targeted and more effective water allocation policies and water conservation measures thus allowing accounting in practice for the scale dependency of efficiencies that has long been discussed in scientific literature this study fits in a recent body of work exploring the potential of the budyko hypothesis in various reformulations to function under differing conditions in terms of spatial and temporal scales storage changes and degree of anthropogenic impact on the natural water balance ccas typically with areas of several thousands of km2 were assumed appropriate units for bh based analysis analyses were based on multi annual input datasets to allow for assumption of zero storage change and seasonal scale results were deemed incongruous with bh preconditions and were therefore not presented it is recommended for future studies to further explore opportunities and limitations of budyko based analyses in an irrigation context with regards to appropriate spatiotemporal dimensions and potentially more complex bh formulations to account for non steady states or incorporate physical catchment parameters in a more explicit way factors determining ω in irrigated basins could be further investigated to acknowledge the importance of this parameter in a fu type budyko application and allow further optimizing of methods for its estimation by using pixel based satellite data products on evapotranspiration and precipitation the proposed method is highly flexible in terms of scale and can easily be applied to other basins and budyko formulations declaration of competing interest the

10614,increasing irrigation efficiencies remains the focus of numerous efforts to mitigate water scarcity in reality higher local efficiencies do often not reduce water scarcity but instead cause a redistribution of water flows when the entire irrigation scheme or river basin is considered insufficient understanding of consumed fractions and non consumptive use i e return flows have led to ineffective or even harmful water conservation measures in this paper we demonstrate a novel method for spatial quantification of the consumed fraction cf of withdrawn irrigation water based on satellite remote sensing and the budyko hypothesis this method was applied to evaluate consumption of irrigation water etblue total water supply and non consumptive use across the indus basin irrigation system ibis of pakistan an average etblue of 707 mm yr from irrigated cropland was found for 2004 2012 with values per canal command area cca varying from 421 mm yr to 1011 mm yr although canal supply 662 mm yr on average in most ccas was largely sufficient to sustain etblue a similar volume of additional pumping 690 mm yr was required to comply with hydro climatological principles prescribed by budyko theory cf values between 0 38 and 0 66 were computed at cca level with an average value of 0 52 co occurrence of relatively low cf values high additional water supply and long term canal diversions similar to etblue implies that the ibis is characterized by extensive reuse of non consumed flows within ccas in addition the notably higher cf of 0 71 0 93 of the full ibis indicates that return flow reuse between ccas cannot be neglected these conclusions imply that the ibis network of irrigators is adapted to extensively recover and reuse drainage flows on different spatial scales water saving and efficiency enhancement measures should therefore be implemented with great caution by relying on globally available satellite products and limited additional data this novel method to determine consumed fractions and non consumed flows can support policy makers worldwide to make irrigation systems more efficient without detriment to downstream users keywords consumed fraction non consumptive use water reuse budyko remote sensing 1 introduction pressure on water resources is expected to increase in many of the world s river basins due to population growth and the associated increase in demand for food fiber and biofuels changing precipitation evapotranspiration and carbon fluxes are projected to further exacerbate water shortages recent policy reports and development programs supported by global institutions as well as scientific and popular articles promote irrigation efficiency improvements as a solution to water scarcity e g world bank 2016 siyal et al 2016 sultana et al 2016 usaid 2016 this perspective contradicts however with the growing body of work conveying the notion that aiming for more efficient water use in agriculture will not solve the water crisis fao 2017 grafton et al 2018 lankford 2012 perry 2011 the latter studies address the paradoxical effect of intended water savings having adverse effects by in fact boosting water consumption scott et al 2014 this efficiency paradox occurs when farmers find new use for the freed up water by expanding irrigated areas introducing new crops with higher water requirements or switching from deficit to full irrigation berbel et al 2015 gómez and pérez blanco 2014 sanchis ibor et al 2017 by now the occurrence of this phenomenon its preconditions and implications have been well described in a large number of case studies e g pfeiffer and lin 2014 contor and taylor 2013 lecina et al 2010 rodriguez díaz et al 2012 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 when no policy mechanisms are in place that incentivize farmers to reduce withdrawals or restrict either irrigated area or consumptive water use there is a high risk of efficiency enhancing measures leading to reduced non consumed flows i e return flows for effective planning of irrigation technology improvements and policies it is therefore essential to understand the dependencies between water users anthropogenic as well as natural across a river basin reuse of non consumed flows within and between sectors is facilitated by both natural pathways and human interventions and results in a complex interplay between surface water and groundwater flows grogan et al 2017 intensity and complexity of reuse networks typically increase with scale simons et al 2015 wu et al 2019 environmental flow requirements of downstream ecosystems are often neglected while their vulnerability to changes in agricultural non consumed flows is potentially very high carrillo guerrero et al 2013 pastor et al 2014 as the conclusion of a literature review on impacts of drip irrigation introduction van der kooij et al 2013 called for an increased awareness of the scale dependency of efficiencies and unintended re allocations of water flows to achieve this objective and to account for spatial tradeoffs in policies and regulations quantitative data on consumed and non consumed portions of withdrawals are

bastiaanssen et al 2008 data availability is currently a major limiting factor in the uptake of existing water reuse frameworks and indicators simons et al 2015 wiener et al 2016 demonstrated how water reuse can be well characterized for a watershed where extensive records of withdrawals consumptive use and non consumed flows are available this is however not the case for most river basins governmental line agencies are struggling with the quantitative assessment of consumed fractions estimates of consumed fractions are therefore commonly limited to static literature values assumed at country level based on prevailing irrigation types despite spatially varying biophysical factors having significant effects jägermeyr et al 2015 plot level efficiency measurements in an experimental setting remain the main source of quantitative information bos et al 2005 bos and nugteren 1990 with simple extrapolation of these values to larger spatial scales increasing chances of misunderstandings and mismanagement merks 2018 molden and sakthivadivel 1999 by definition an assessment of consumed fractions in an irrigation context requires estimates of i the volume of water that is withdrawn for irrigation and ii the fraction of this water that evaporates to quantify the latter over the past years the scientific community has turned to satellite remote sensing global satellite derived data products can provide spatiotemporal insight in key hydrological parameters such as precipitation actual evapotranspiration soil moisture changes runoff and storage change bastiaanssen and harshadeep 2005 poortinga et al 2017 simons et al 2016 local estimates of consumed irrigation water can for example be obtained by analyzing evapotranspiration of nearby sites with similar land use but known to be solely rainfed van eekelen et al 2015 as satellites cannot measure water withdrawals coupling remote sensing with simulation models has been explored for evaluating irrigation dynamics droogers et al 2010 peña arancibia et al 2016 santos et al 2008 promising results were achieved but site specific calibration remains necessary prohibiting an easily scalable monitoring approach in addition some global scale hydrological models compute consumed fractions by partitioning irrigation water into consumed and non consumed flows e g jägermeyr et al 2015 although this enables scenario studies at the global scale their applicability for monitoring purposes at the basin level remains limited application of the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 is an approach that has not yet been pursued by the scientific community for quantifying consumptive use of irrigation water the budyko curve prescribes the theoretical partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and evapotranspiration based on water and energy climatologies it has frequently been applied successfully for purposes of developing constraining and validating water balance models e g zhang et al 2008

jordan gunkel and lange 2017 in this paper we present a novel method for quantifying consumed fractions of irrigation systems based on budyko theory and satellite derived data products of

consumptive use irrigation water supply and non consumed flows are presented and findings are discussed in the context of water reuse and water saving potential 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the pakistani part of the indus basin irrigation system ibis excluding the canal command areas ccas upstream of jinnah barrage fig 1 ibis receives its water mainly from snow melt and glacial waters in the upstream high mountain areas of the himalayas karakoram and hindu kush immerzeel et al 2010 as well as from extraordinary rainfall falling on the windward slopes of the himalayan mountains the major part of ibis surface area has an arid climate and rainfall in catchment areas is a secondary source of water the monsoonal regime causes rainfall during the dry rabi season in the months november to april to be only 30 of that in the rainy kharif season from may to october habib 2004 surface water flow is concentrated in the indus river and its tributaries jhelum chenab ravi sutlej and kabul water is buffered and distributed by a system comprising 3 major reservoirs 18 barrages and headworks 2 major siphons and 12 inter river link canals serving a gross irrigable command area of over 16 million hectares in total qureshi 2011 after extensive consumptive use for irrigation and to a far lesser extent municipal and industrial purposes remaining streamflow downstream of the ibis supports the rich diversity of vegetation and wildlife of the indus delta where the indus river eventually drains into the arabian sea annual environmental flow requirements are in place to combat inundation sea water intrusion and coastal erosion kalhoro et al 2016 drainage flows largely of poor quality are also transported out of the system to evaporation ponds or directly to the sea through the left bank outflow drainage lbod canal basharat and rizvi 2016 cropping intensities in the ibis have increased over the past decades and crop water requirements are at the system scale not fulfilled by the sum of surface water withdrawals and rainfall ullah et al 2001 this discrepancy between water supply and demand is especially experienced by tail end farmers who typically have 32 less water available than head end farmers qureshi et al 2010 inadequacy and unreliability of surface water supply has driven farmers to augment water shortages by pumping groundwater resources reported amounts vary from 52 to 61 km3 yr approaching the volume of annually replenished groundwater of 55 63 km3 yr laghari et al 2012 pbs 2014 watto and mugera 2016 falling groundwater tables are observed in areas with fresh groundwater most notably in the northeastern part of the province of punjab mekonnen et al 2015 particularly eastern punjab is a hotspot of groundwater depletion with water table decline possibly exacerbated by transboundary impacts from extensive groundwater pumping across the indian border cheema et al 2014 iqbal et al 2017 watto and mugera 2016 the situation is different in sindh province where groundwater quality is generally marginal to hazardous and groundwater abstractions only constitute 4 8 of total water use qureshi et al 2008 van steenbergen et al 2015 young et al 2019 structural waterlogging is a serious problem here with over half of all cca surface area increasingly affected by shallow water tables due to high surface water supplies and a low level of groundwater pumping as well as poorly functioning drainage facilities and salinization basharat and rizvi 2016 van steenbergen et al 2015 2 2 analytical framework and calculation steps the conceptual framework proposed by simons et al 2015 is followed in this study thus defining the consumed fraction cf as the ratio between consumptive use of irrigation water and total water withdrawal following the common definitions of green and blue water falkenmark and rockström 2006 the component of actual evapotranspiration etact from surface or groundwater resource is denoted as etblue and rain dependent etact is termed etgreen 1 e t a c t e t g r e e n e t b l u e note that etblue is also referred to as incremental evapotranspiration hoogeveen et al 2015 or secondary evaporation van dijk et al 2018 etgreen is referred to as net precipitation in classical formulations of irrigation water requirements jensen and allen 2016 the equation for computing cf then becomes 2 c f e t b l u e q w where qw comprises withdrawals from surface water and or groundwater for irrigation in the context of an ibis cca it is relevant to distinguish two types of inflow 3 q w q d i v q a d d where qdiv represents the volume of surface water diverted at the main canal head qadd comprises additional sources of water such as local non consumed flows that are pumped up fossil groundwater abstraction or drainage water from upstream ccas entering through surface or sub surface pathways other than the main canal the non consumed portion of applied irrigation water is then calculated as the difference between total blue water supply and consumptive use of irrigation water 4 q n c q w e t b l u e the proposed procedure for partitioning etact into etgreen and etblue is based on the budyko hypothesis bh which describes an empirical relation between etact reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p for areas in dynamic equilibrium and with negligible storage changes sposito 2017 the original budyko equation has been reformulated several times in order to account for systematic differences between watersheds this study applies the commonly used budyko reformulation derived by fu 1981 5 e t g r e e n p 1 e t 0 p 1 e t 0 p ω 1 ω where ω is a free parameter that describes the shape of the budyko curve ω can be viewed as an integrated catchment characteristic determined by catchment specific properties such as climate land cover vegetation and soil hydraulics condon and maxwell 2017 li et al 2013 higher ω values indicate a higher etgreen under the same et0 p ratio the aridity index and are thus related to a greater capacity of a basin to retain water for evapotranspiration in many river basins the original bh assumptions are nowadays violated by extensive human influence on the water balance this is in particular the case under irrigated conditions when precipitation can no longer be assumed to be the only source of water available for evapotranspiration chen et al 2020 however various studies have demonstrated that accounting for alternative water sources in addition to p such as canal water supply and storage changes allow for successful application of fu type budyko models in arid irrigated regions du et al 2016 gunkel and lange 2017 han et al 2011 the ω parameter is then considered the indicator to reflect the synthetical influence of basin characteristics on et chen et al 2020 this includes for example the effect of deeper rooting of irrigated crops which enhances access to water from the soil profile zhang et al 2004 as well as the artificial supply of surface water and or groundwater to the crop multi parameter budyko models have been developed to examine these processes under unsteady state conditions such as on monthly or seasonal scales however these extended budyko formulations do not provide additional explanatory power on a multi annual time scale as impacts of short term rainfall and irrigation events are averaged out du et al 2016 greve et al 2016 for the irrigated ibis on a multi annual time scale under the assumption of zero storage changes alternative sources of water are included as follows 6 e t a c t p a d j 1 e t r e f p a d j 1 e t r e f p a d j ω 1 ω where 7 p a d j p q w based on spatially distributed p et0 and ω data see section 2 3 eq 5 can be solved for etgreen by subtracting computed etgreen from satellite derived etact etblue can be calculated as the portion of consumptive water use that cannot be accounted for by rainfall according to the bh fig 2 left panel under the assumption that eq 4 is valid at the pixel scale viola et al 2017 this step yields spatial data of both rainfall and irrigation dependent et subsequently in order to estimate the supply side of cf eq 6 is applied to find the value of padj for which etact padj equals the theoretical value of this ratio prescribed by budyko theory as illustrated in the right panel of fig 2 in this case 1 etact padj equals the runoff fraction rf subtracting p from the comprehensive supply term padj then yields the estimate of qw required for quantifying cf eq 2 if records of qdiv are available qadd can be computed by applying eq 3 to explore reuse of water and unsustainable groundwater pumping an overview of the full approach is presented in fig 3 2 3 datasets this study uses etact data for 2004 2012 from the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop v4 model which is one of several global scale satellite derived etact products available in the public domain senay 2018 senay et al 2013 ssebop is a surface energy balance model that calculates the latent heat flux from land surface temperature measured by the satellite based modis sensor it is based on pixel specific pre defined temperature differences between cold wet and hot dry conditions where air temperature from climate models is used as an indicator for the coldest land surface temperature the performance of ssebop relative to other global etact products and field measurements has been evaluated in multiple studies and has been generally found favorable e g simons et al 2016 fao 2019 another reason for using ssebop in this study is the availability of a corresponding et0 product in the public domain which ensures consistency between et0 and etact as required for bh application the spatial resolution of the ssebop etact and et0 products is 1 km2 and 1 degree respectively although ssebop performance in terms of spatial and temporal dynamics has previously been found satisfactory systematic biases can occur depending on the region of interest and the algorithm should be calibrated based on auxiliary data senay 2018 this relates to the use of a maximum et scaling factor k in the ssebop algorithm which depends on the aerodynamic roughness the degree of advection and prevailing weather conditions among others based on independent estimates of etact e g from field experiments or the conservation of water mass at the river basin scale a potential bias correction of the global ssebop product in a river basin of interest is recommended in this study we take the approach of inventorying previous efforts to quantify etact in the ibis and correcting long term ssebop etact for these values several previous studies have been performed in the indus basin applying locally calibrated models to assess water consumption of irrigated crops table 1 presents the identified studies quantifying annual etact for at least a part of the ibis based on the values presented in these studies and ssebop values for the corresponding years and areas a correction factor of 0 78 was applied to the original global ssebop data to correct for overestimation this linear bias correction is justified due to the linear relation of k to etact in the ssebop formulation next to etact and et0 data on rainfall and the budyko ω parameter are required for application of the bh monthly rainfall data at 5 km resolution were obtained from the quasi global satellite derived climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps v2 0 dataset funk et al 2015 for pakistan in 2004 2012 data from approximately 35 rainfall stations are incorporated in the chirps algorithm to enhance satellite rainfall estimates data on ω were acquired from the study by xu et al 2013 who produced spatially discrete data on ω using a neural network model fed by etact et0 p and streamflow data for 256 river basins their model was trained including ndvi as an explicit input based on 23 years of p et0 and q data the ω values can therefore be seen as representative for this period including impacts of irrigation on vegetation and water depending on surface area the number of unique ω values per cca varies between 1 and 14 finally monthly data on canal diversions and reservoir releases required for partitioning calculated withdrawals into qdiv and qadd were made available by the water and power development agency of pakistan wapda for the years 2004 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 evapotranspiration of irrigation water fig 4 shows the position of the 40 ibis ccas in budyko space based on area averaged values of mean annual etact et0 and p over the period may 2004 april 2012 eight full hydrological years each of the ccas has a unique theoretical budyko curve depending on ω for reference fig 4 presents the curves corresponding with minimum and maximum ω at the cca level as well as one for the average ω value for entire ibis all ccas are located well above the budyko curves where it should be noted that the y axis is plotted on a logarithmic scale base 2 to account for the relatively large distances to the theoretical curves the arid climate in the ibis is demonstrated by the high aridity indices plotted on the x axis with ccas located in punjab generally coinciding with lower etact p and et0 p values than those in sindh1 this is representative of the northeast southwest rainfall gradient occurring in ibis overall given budyko theory fig 4 matches expectations with regards to an irrigated system as for none of the ccas the rate of water consumption can be explained by natural water supply through rainfall the theoretical lines in fig 4 can be used to infer the etact value associated with p i e etgreen in eq 5 according to the theoretical concept illustrated in fig 2 etact can now be partitioned into etblue and etgreen for each cca based on the distance to the cca specific theoretical budyko curves fig 5 shows the resulting maps of annual etblue and etgreen averaged for 2004 2012 whereas annual etgreen follows a relatively smooth spatial pattern corresponding with the rainfall gradient etblue is much more heterogeneous and depends on e g crop type canal operations groundwater pumping behavior soil salinity and groundwater quality high values for etblue are particularly observed in the central part of ibis and in southern sindh particularly in areas close to the main river locally values of over 1200 mm of annual etblue occur in rohri lined and khaipur west ccas low etblue values approaching zero are found at the edges of many ccas where irrigation is absent and further from the main canal inlets it is striking that a major part of thal cca surface area has negligible etblue which corresponds with the large extent of rainfed agriculture in this cca reported by the land use land cover map of cheema and bastiaanssen 2010 fig 6 presents cca level averages for annual etblue etgreen and shows that etgreen generally follows the variability of cca averaged rainfall amounts precipitation as is to be expected several ccas in punjab depend on rainfall for a substantial portion of their water consumption with etgreen in four ccas marala ravi link thal upper jhelum brbd internal accounting for over half of total etact this is very different in sindh province with annual etgreen for all ccas at 25 of total etact or less here arid conditions require supply of high volumes of irrigation water to satisfy crop water requirements in punjab province annual etblue values vary between 268 mm yr thal and 937 mm yr upper bahawal qaim in sindh minimum and maximum annual etblue is 588 mm yr k b feeder and 1011 mm yr khaipur west respectively in table 2 etblue and etgreen results are aggregated for provinces as well as for the agro climatic zones distinguished by ullah et al 2001 relatively low eta c t values in the mixed cropping zone can be explained by cultivation of fruit crops that are less water demanding and by high seepage due to presence of sandy soils liaqat et al 2015 ullah et al 2001 the table shows how despite similar overall etact values at the provincial level the relative attribution of this consumed water to rainfall and additional irrigation water differs substantially between the provinces the ratio of etgreen over p presented in the far right column of table 2 can be viewed as the percentage of effective rainfall which on the annual scale for the entire ibis amounts to 85 it should be noted that presented values do not include unofficial irrigation outside cca boundaries and that a thorough review of cca boundaries is beyond the scope of the current research 3 2 canal diversions and additional water supply the distance of the ccas to the theoretical budyko curves in fig 4 is indicative of water sources other than precipitation fig 7 presents the ccas in budyko space once again now with measured qdiv added to the supply side of both ratios by adding qdiv as a supply of water the et ratio vertical axis and aridity index horizontal axis decrease reflecting a situation with wetter land surface climatology as a consequence all cca points have moved substantially towards the budyko lines it should be noted that values are annual averages for the 2004 2012 period and only ccas are shown for which at least one full hydrological year of qdiv data is available during this period see table 3 for the years included per cca the majority of the points are still above the theoretical budyko lines suggesting that the sum of precipitation and canal water diversions is unable to explain all water supplied to the crops strikingly as opposed to what was observed in fig 4 sindh ccas are now generally closer to the budyko curve than those in punjab this can be explained by relatively high surface irrigation allocations in sindh as described by van steenbergen et al 2015 excessive canal supplies in several of sindh ccas have been observed to lead to extensive water logging a well known example of this is rice canal no 34 which fits the observation that it approaches the theoretical budyko value in fig 7 k b feeder no 30 is located below the budyko curves which can be explained by the fact that a substantial part of diverted water is transported for domestic use to the megacity of karachi adjacent to the cca phul et al 2010 this cca is therefore excluded from further analyses most punjab ccas are still far from the theoretical budyko curves indicating that a relatively large portion of their water supply comes from sources other than main canal headwaters what follows from fig 7 is that etact in most ccas is attributable to sources of water in addition to rainfall and canal diversions as most cca points plot well above the curve total qw can now be computed from the distance between the actual data points in budyko space and the theoretical budyko curve as prescribed by the cca specific ω values by solving eq 6 for the comprehensive supply term padj and subsequently applying eq 7 a full overview of all blue water fluxes per cca including additional supply qadd as the difference between qw and qdiv is provided in table 3 it is clear that relatively large volumes of qadd are computed for almost all ccas at the same time a substantial amount of non consumed water qnc is computed as apparently qw has to exceed etblue substantially to maintain the hydrological processes imbedded in the budyko hypothesis this annual water balance looks as follows 8 q d i v q a d d e t b l u e q n c for the ibis filling in the terms in eq 8 with their average values yields 662 690 707 645 with all values in mm per year as described in section 2 2 qadd can be a combination of different sources of water both depending on hydrological processes within the respective cca and between ccas it is interesting to explore the qadd term further as it provides insight into the nature of reuse of non consumed flows in the ibis and potentially also includes unsustainable groundwater pumping fig 8 presents qadd relative to other water supply components for all ccas dependency on qadd differs highly among the areas with values ranging between 5 rice and 61 khaipur west at the provincial level these values amount to 47 and 38 of total water supply including precipitation for punjab and sindh respectively this difference could be explained for example by coarser soils with more percolation losses the degree to which canal water allocation meet crop water requirements and groundwater quality issues evaluating multi annual qdiv against etblue provides insight in the long term blue water balance and the source of qadd in ccas where etblue exceeds qdiv qadd must structurally depend on non consumed flows from upstream ccas rainfall recharge outside of cca or total ibis boundaries or unsustainable groundwater use on the other hand positive values for qdiv etblue indicate a net positive contribution of blue water in the corresponding cca to the aquifer system table 3 shows that on average qdiv 662 mm on average is largely able to sustain etblue 707 mm or 107 of qdiv however fig 9 demonstrates that qdiv etblue varies greatly per cca and in fact per province clearly jhang panjnad lower bari doab and rohri are examples of ccas requiring substantial volumes of water on the long term in addition to qdiv to explain irrigation consumptive use an example of the opposite phenomenal is rice canal which due to excessive canal supply has a blue water surplus of 1 8 bcm looking at the provincial level substantial differences exist between punjab and sindh annual etblue in punjab is approximately 7 bcm 15 higher than qdiv whereas for sindh a minor positive qdiv etblue value is calculated the above analysis shows that consumptive use in punjab ccas is more dependent on return flows and aquifer recharge generated outside cca boundaries and or fossil groundwater pumping the latter has received elaborate attention in recent scientific literature and model assessments although local falling water tables due to unsustainable groundwater use are a well known point of concern especially in punjab they cannot be regarded as dominant in explaining qadd volumes since long term qadd is substantially higher than qdiv etblue in all ccas the main source of qadd must lie within the cca and must be replenished within the annual time frame this finding is supported by previous analyses of grace water storage data in which groundwater depletion over the upper indus plain in 2003 2010 was estimated at 1 48 bcm yr or 13 5 mm yr iqbal et al 2016 this corresponds to only 4 of annual qadd computed for the relevant ccas the groundwater balance presented by young et al 2019 based on a comprehensive literature review similarly suggests that the recharge and discharge components of the overall aquifer system are largely in balance overall the budyko based analysis paints a picture of a system where discrepancies between crop water demands and canal water supply during the irrigation season lead to pumping of a mixture of qdiv and qadd based on the magnitude of qadd volumes in both punjab and sindh compared to other blue water fluxes it can be safely stated that this additional supply term mainly consists of local within cca non consumed flows qnc in this regard it is interesting to note the similar magnitude of qadd and qnc presented in table 3 irrigation in ibis ccas is characterized by the pumping of considerable volumes of non consumed flows generated within the same cca which for a major part drain back into the system and are withdrawn again in a next cycle 3 3 consumed fractions and implications for agricultural water management thanks to the availability of etblue and qw data eq 1 can now be applied to calculate consumed fractions of water withdrawals at the cca level fig 10 shows the resulting map of cf across ibis although cf values differ between ccas cf values in sindh are generally found to be higher than in punjab overall cf ranges between 0 38 upper jhelum and 0 66 abbasia at the level of the ibis main ccas with an average size of 4036 km2 the average cf at cca level for entire ibis weighted according to total qw is 0 52 to provide reference for the bh based results table 4 gives an overview of ibis irrigation efficiency values found in scientific literature though efficiency definitions are not consistent among these studies they typically incorporate losses of diverted water in the processes of conveyance through canals and application to the field crop the budyko based analysis generally yields higher values than irrigation efficiencies previously assumed for pakistan which vary between 0 3 and 0 49 this suggests that irrigation in the ibis is more efficient than previously reported mostly based on local scale measurements in comparison to literature efficiency estimates separating beneficial and non beneficial consumption it should be noted that etblue does not discriminate between crop transpiration and soil evaporation which logically yields somewhat higher cf values evaluating cf values on different spatial scales leads to insight in the system scale reuse of non consumed flows in this study it is assumed that the cca level is the minimum scale on which budyko theory assumptions are valid cf of the entire ibis can be estimated by dividing budyko derived etblue by the total water supply to the system as long term net groundwater recharge is virtually zero a conservative estimate of cf can be computed based on total releases of the main reservoirs at the ibis head which in 2004 2012 amounted to 163 6 km3 yr or 990 mm yr on average pbs 2014 cf of entire ibis can then be estimated by the ratio between etblue table 3 and reservoir releases i e 707 990 0 71 however as not all of the released water is used for irrigation purposes a different estimate can be calculated based on total official surface water withdrawals of 125 bcm yr young et al 2019 or 756 mm yr which leads to a total system cf of 0 93 although the real supply volume arguably lies somewhere in between both estimates are well above the cca average of 0 52 and signify a relatively efficient system despite substantial water losses on smaller scales this indicates that non consumed flows to unconfined aquifers drainage canals and baseflow contribution to rivers cause water reuse processes to extend beyond cca borders in reality informal irrigation outside official cca boundaries leads to higher etblue and thus an even greater return flow reuse and system cf when increasing the scope of the analysis to the full transboundary indus basin cf may be further enhanced by lateral groundwater flows between india and pakistan khan et al 2017 this study has successfully quantified total water supply and consumed fractions in the ibis command areas demonstrating the production of considerable volumes of non consumed flows as discussed above this water is not only extensively reused within the ccas for example to mitigate differences in head vs tail canal supplies but also leave cca boundaries for pumping downstream this notion of a dense and complex network of water re use is supported by various studies according to van steenbergen and gohar 2005 an estimated 79 of pumped groundwater in ibis originates from canal seepage percolation from the river and non consumed flows karimi et al 2013 report a basin scale classical efficiency of 84 for the full indus basin incorporating transboundary lateral flows grogan et al 2017 showed that the indus flow regime will significantly shift when consumed fractions are altered due to extensive reuse of non consumed flows it is evident that further increases of system scale cf will impact flow volumes and patterns downstream of kotri barrage and therefore hydrological and sedimentation regimes in the indus delta salik et al 2016 the results of this study exemplify the need to account for the system scale when considering efficiency improvement measures in the ibis in practice increases in evapotranspiration in the ibis are often achieved by a reduction in groundwater recharge exacerbating the decline of the groundwater table and reducing water availability to downstream users ahmad et al 2007 by providing spatially disaggregated cf values the proposed approach facilitates a more effective and tailored development of water conservation measures in the different ccas it is found that in many ccas field scale efficiency improvements may impact on an existing equilibrium of non consumed flows and reuse of these flows by others as part of their qadd however in areas where observations of rapidly falling groundwater tables coincide with a relatively low cf such as on the upper indus plain fig 10 appropriate measures could result in a greater sustainability of the system similarly occurrence of low cf values in areas with hazardous groundwater quality particularly found in sindh may justify interventions to minimize recharge of saline groundwater bodies 4 conclusions and recommendations a new method for spatially quantifying consumptive use of irrigation water based on the budyko hypothesis was successfully demonstrated for the ibis in pakistan the innovation is twofold as the approach i distinguishes green and blue water consumption using reference evapotranspiration and precipitation data and ii computes total water supply to support consumed fraction estimates which are essential for understanding system scale water use and potential for water savings it was found that out of the average annual etact of 927 mm yr 707 mm yr 76 depends on irrigation water etblue values vary greatly among ccas with a range of 421 to 1011 mm yr as a consequence of differing canal headwater volumes crop types climate conditions and groundwater quality among others by evaluating budyko based total blue water supply against long term main canal diversions it was concluded that most command areas rely substantially on water not diverted at the head of the primary canal with additional supply qadd 690 mm yr on average even slightly exceeding qdiv 662 mm yr the average consumed fraction of the ibis canal command areas was computed at 0 52 with cca values ranging between 0 38 and 0 66 from the relatively low cf values high additional water supplies and long term canal supplies largely sufficient to sustain etblue the conclusion can be drawn that the ibis is characterized by extensive reuse of non consumed flows within ccas at the same time a notably higher cf at the system scale indicates that reuse of non consumed water facilitated by lateral connectivity between ccas cannot be disregarded these conclusions imply that although the ibis is generally not regarded as an efficient irrigation system it is in fact tailored to recover and reuse drainage flows on different spatial scales water saving measures should therefore be implemented with caution it is recommended to supplement the results of this study with ancillary information on groundwater quality and groundwater table time series to identify locations where cf increases may be beneficial on the system scale it should be noted that the accuracy of the cca map used in this study is continuously under revision by government institutions allowing for more refined cf assessments in the future e g by accounting for irrigated area dynamics and city boundaries by providing quantitative estimates of previously unexposed parameters etblue cf and qnc per cca the proposed approach contributes significantly to the understanding of water consumption and reuse in the ibis results of the consecutive steps of the budyko based approach climatology and et partitioning consumptive use and assessments of water supply components were shown to be in agreement with the existing knowledge base on the ibis a big advantage of the method over alternative approaches is that estimates of etblue qadd and qnc were produced without the need for complex hydrological models data on soil parameters or assumptions on curve numbers although diversion data were used for partitioning total withdrawals into canal water and additional supply they are not required for the basic etblue and cf analyses allowing for application of the method in ungauged irrigated basins as the use of global satellite derived data products allows worldwide replication the proposed method holds great potential for more accurate evaluation of consumptive use reuse and dependencies among water users in river basins this can facilitate targeted and more effective water allocation policies and water conservation measures thus allowing accounting in practice for the scale dependency of efficiencies that has long been discussed in scientific literature this study fits in a recent body of work exploring the potential of the budyko hypothesis in various reformulations to function under differing conditions in terms of spatial and temporal scales storage changes and degree of anthropogenic impact on the natural water balance ccas typically with areas of several thousands of km2 were assumed appropriate units for bh based analysis analyses were based on multi annual input datasets to allow for assumption of zero storage change and seasonal scale results were deemed incongruous with bh preconditions and were therefore not presented it is recommended for future studies to further explore opportunities and limitations of budyko based analyses in an irrigation context with regards to appropriate spatiotemporal dimensions and potentially more complex bh formulations to account for non steady states or incorporate physical catchment parameters in a more explicit way factors determining ω in irrigated basins could be further investigated to acknowledge the importance of this parameter in a fu type budyko application and allow further optimizing of methods for its estimation by using pixel based satellite data products on evapotranspiration and precipitation the proposed method is highly flexible in terms of scale and can easily be applied to other basins and budyko formulations declaration of competing interest the
