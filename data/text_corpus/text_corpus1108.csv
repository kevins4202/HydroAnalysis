5540,many studies have been conducted on the regulation effects of rain gardens on rainfall runoff however the parameters of rain gardens have been rarely simulated and optimized in this study the design parameters of rain gardens were optimized through combining the drainmod model and the response surface methodology on the basis of the monitoring data of a rain garden in the xi an university of technology campus in china from 2016 to 2017 the parameter sensitivities in the drainmod h and drainmod n modules were analyzed and the drainmod model was calibrated and validated the determination and nash efficiency coefficients were approximately 0 8 and above 0 6 respectively confirming that the water volume and nitrogen regulation effects of rain gardens can be simulated with drainmod different scenarios were set up to simulate and analyze the reduction effects of rain gardens on water volume and nitrogen load the influences of various factors including the influent nitrogen concentration the confluence ratio the thickness of the filler layer and the depth of submerged zone on the regulation effects of rain gardens were discussed according to simulation results these factors were optimized by using the response surface methodology to obtain the design values under different targets the optimized minimum thickness of the filler layer is 37 cm and the maximum is 80 cm the optimized depth of the submerged zone is at least 22 cm and the maximum is 45 cm the treatment effects of the rain gardens are better after parameter optimization results can provide a

related to the rational use of stormwater resources and ecological environment construction and must therefore be given enough attention rational rainfall treatment is the key to solving urban water environment problems and the research and development direction of the comprehensive management of urban water environment in the future low impact development lid and the control and utilization of stormwater from the source positively affect runoff reduction and pollutant control davis et al 2009 lid replaces or reinforces land through hydrological and hydraulic design and controls storm runoff from the source thereby maintaining the hydrological status after development as a typical lid facility the bioretention system is an indispensable and efficient economic stormwater treatment measure that includes rain garden bio swale detention flower bed and tree pool in line with the concept of urban lid as a powerful measure of the bioretention system rain gardens can regulate storm runoff and beautify landscapes rain gardens mainly rely on their unique permeable filler to reduce the total amount of rain garden outflow and effectively purify the quality of stormwater thereby reducing the urban waterlogging risk and improving the quality of the water environment rain gardens have many functions such as conserving water resources regulating floods purifying water quality maintaining biodiversity regulating the local microclimate and beautifying landscapes rain gardens can be divided into three types anti seepage semi permeable and infiltration current research on rain gardens include hydrological simulation soil penetration the retention of pollutants and the construction and application of rain gardens li et al 2014 iqbal et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 constructed two impervious rain gardens in xixian new area with planting soil filler and improved fillers volume ratio of 60 planting soil 30 sand 5 sawdust 5 water treatment residuals the cumulative annual load of the rain garden and the adsorption capacity of the filler medium were analyzed through continuous years of field rainfall monitoring brown et al 2013 examined the influence of previous events on outflow concentrations by analyzing flow weighted composite samples from four to six consecutive events during three different seasons for two sets of field monitored bioretention cells in nashville north carolina the regulation effect of rain gardens is affected by catchment area water storage depth and local meteorological conditions guo et al 2019 by optimizing the structure of a facility and changing the height of the submerged zone denitrification can be enhanced to remove nitrogen from the rainfall runoff to study the effect of rain gardens on stormwater a long term model is required for simulation and prediction to better utilize stormwater resources the models for simulating rain gardens hydrological processes include recarga hydrus and drainmod recarga is a water balance calculation model based on the richards equation kleiven 2017 however the calculation of the drainage process is not comprehensive and cannot simulate the water quality the hydrus model considers the simulation of water quantity and quality but it has many input parameters and cannot simulate the submerged zone li et al 2018 drainmod is a hydrological field model agricultural water management model developed by dr wayne skaggs of the department of agriculture and bioengineering at the university of north carolina state in the 1970s negm et al 2016 drainmod is mainly used to simulate and predict the drainage process of different drainage designs and management measures brown et al 2013 drainmod was first applied to simulate the drainage of a farmland currently the bioretention system can be conceptually modeled in drainmod brown et al 2010 brown and hunt 2011 discussed the simulation steps of the hydrological model for bioretention facilities using drainmod to simulate the quality effects of hydrological water caused by different drainage structures media depths surface water depths and soil types in bioretention ponds tang et al 2016 used drainmod to analyze the long term effects of rain gardens affected by various factors such as aquifer depth confluence ratio and rainfall characteristics the basic principle of drainmod involves water balance on a thin section of soil per unit area between two adjacent drains from an impermeable layer to a surface an approximation method is then used instead of a numerical solution to describe the characteristics of water movement tian et al 2012a the drainage rate is calculated by assuming that the lateral flow movement in the soil profile mainly occurs in a saturated area when the groundwater level fails to rise to the surface hooghoudt s equation is used to calculate drainage negm et al 2014 the kirkham equation is used when water rises to completely submerge the ground saarinen et al 2013 water balance is calculated by using drainmod daily after meteorological and soil data the surface conditions and other parameters are inputted infiltration evaporation surface and underground runoff underground drainage and other water balance results are considered output quan et al 2012 in drainmod the hydrological module can be divided into hydrological calculation and human design luo et al 2000 these two parts are connected by parameters to form an interactive model system therefore the applicability of the model can be improved by adjusting the artificial design component of the model an extended application of drainmod is nitrogen simulation which describes the comprehensive nitrogen cycle process that involves nitrate nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen the simulation of nitrogen migration through a multiphase one dimensional convection dispersion reaction equation is used to model nitrogen transport tian et al 2012b drainmod is largely used to simulate farmland drainage few simulations are available for lid measures and the parameters of rain gardens are rarely optimized design expert is a widely used experimental design software assistant developed in the united states design expert can be used to statistically analyze data fit curves establish mathematical models and perform experimental optimization the software has been widely used in various multi factor experimental designs and analyses torabi et al 2017 the design expert software has a response surface methodology which can perform surface analysis on quadratic polynomial equation well and whose operation is convenient jannet et al 2012 the optimization result of the response surface analysis can be automatically obtained by the software therefore this study aims to i calibrate and validate the hydrological and water quality parameters of drainmod ii set up and simulate different scenarios with the validated model and analyze the effects of bioretention facilities on rainfall regulation and nitrogen purification and iii optimize these factors and explore the appropriate bioretention facility structure by using the response surface methodology an optimization method of rain gardens is provided by which reasonable design parameters can be obtained to enhance the treatment effects of rain gardens the method would be beneficial to the construction of rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area overview xi an city is located in the middle of the yellow river the air in this area is unevenly heated because of the high terrain in the south and the low terrain in the north leading to the uneven distribution of rainfall in time and space in summer this climate easily causes unstable weather in certain areas consequently summer in xi an is hot and rainy with occasional drought winter in xi an is cold and rainy and the temperature highly fluctuates in spring and rainy autumn the average annual precipitation of the city is approximately 583 7 mm the average duration of rainfall is 96 6 days and the maximum duration of continuous rainfall is 13 19 days li et al 2016 most of the rainfall is concentrated in july september accounting for approximately 50 of the annual rainfall frequent heavy rains are likely to cause natural disasters such as flood and soil erosion the main pollutants in stormwater are suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus these pollutants are derived from the scouring of roofing and roads by urban stormwater in which the ss concentration exceeds twice that of urban sewage untreated wastewater compared with the class v water quality requirements of the quality standard for surface water environment in china the concentration of pollutants in stormwater is twice the standard yuan et al 2011 this rate has a notable impact on the water environment if the initial stormwater is directly discharged into the water body zhang et al 2015 2 2 experimental facility the object of this study is an impervious rain garden in the test field of the xi an university of technology campus shaanxi province china fig 1 shows the structure and fig 2 shows the experiment site stormwater from the roof of the water conservation research institute is collected by a rain garden device through a downpipe which is connected to an inlet pipe on the side of the rain garden an inverted triangle inlet is provided in the inlet pipe and stormwater from the roof flows into the rain garden through the inflow port the pool measures 4 m 3 m 0 9 m length width height respectively and its confluence ratio ratio of catchment area to rain garden area is 6 1 the filler layers are composed of 0 20 cm of soil 20 40 cm of fine sand 40 55 cm of coarse sand and 55 70 cm of gravel from top to bottom a 10 cm diameter drain pipe with uniform drainage holes is laid at the bottom of the pool the bottom of the garden is impervious and outflow is discharged to the municipal pipe network system 2 3 monitored method 2 3 1 water quantity monitoring a triangular weir monitors the inflow and drainage processes of the rain garden the pressure sensor is installed at a stable place in front of the triangle weir to automatically record the weir head process in real time the weir head process of the triangular weir is corrected through manual measurement the instantaneous flow is integrated to obtain the inflow and drainage the amounts are specifically expressed as formulas 1 and 2 respectively prakash and shivapur 2004 1 q 8 15 μ tan θ 2 2 g h 2 5 2 v 0 t q t d t where q is the flow process l min μ is the flow coefficient which is approximately 0 6 θ is the angle of the triangle rafts which is 45 g is the acceleration of gravity which is 9 808 m s2 h is the geometric head in front of the triangle weir measured by the pressure sensor v is the inflow or drainage l and t is the monitored rainfall time in min 2 3 2 water quality analysis method during each rainfall process water samples are taken at 0 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and so on when the roof runoff begins to flow into the rain garden water quality is analyzed in a laboratory nitrate nitrogen is determined by phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry and ammonia nitrogen is determined by using nessler s reagent photometry method nitrogen concentration for a rainfall event is obtained through calculating the arithmetic mean value of all the measured concentrations of water samples with time 3 model establishment of drainmod 3 1 input data the five main components of the parameters that should be inputted in drainmod are meteorological data soil data crop data the design parameters of the drainage system and the nitrogen transport parameters hawary et al 2015 the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall are entered as meteorological data and the steady state thornthwaite empirical formula is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and the meteorological data of the model youssef et al 2018 the measured soil water characteristic curve the saturated hydraulic conductivity the stratified thickness and the physical and chemical characteristics of each layer were inputted as soil data thunbergia alata a drought tolerant and waterlogging tolerant plant was grown in the rain garden its planting date and flowering time and the effective depth of the root system change over time are the main input crop data the drainage system design parameters include the drainage pipe depth the impervious layer depth and the drainage coefficient the nitrogen transport parameters are the initial nitrogen content of soil and rainfall the nitrification process parameters the denitrification process parameters and the organic matter decomposition parameters before the simulation the depth of the concealed pipe was set shallowly the drainage spacing and coefficient were set as large as possible and the maximum surface storage was set consistently with kirkham s depth for flow to drains thus only a small amount of runoff was lost to the surface and most of the runoff was collected into the bioretention system to obtain the flow background file hunt et al 2007 the rainfall and temperature data from 2016 to 2017 were entered into the model on the basis of the existing data the rainfall data included the daily rainfall in the two years which was obtained from the weather station of the water conservation research institute of xi an university of technology the temperature data included the daily highest and lowest temperatures in the two years which were derived from the weather network 3 2 sensitivity analysis of parameters the sensitivity analysis of the parameters could effectively reduce the workload of adjustment help the model achieve an ideal simulation effect as quickly as possible and effectively guide data monitoring and collection kurtulus and flipo 2012 this study used the modified morris screening method which is a widely used sensitivity analysis method in modified morris classification screening the independent variable changes in a fixed step size and the average value of the morse coefficient as calculated by multiple disturbances is taken as the sensitivity discrimination factor of the parameter equation 3 li et al 2018 3 s i 0 n 1 y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i n 1 where s is the sensitivity discriminating factor yi is the ith running output value of the model yi 1 is the i 1st running output value of the model y 0 is the initial parameter calculation result value pi is the percentage of the ith model operation parameter value relative to the initial parameter value change pi 1 is the percentage change of the i 1st model operation parameter value relative to the initial parameter value and n is the number of model runs the sensitivity of the parameters can be divided into four categories namely si 1 which is a highly sensitive parameter 0 2 si 1 which is a sensitive parameter 0 05 si 0 2 which is a moderately sensitive parameter and 0 si 0 05 which is an insensitive parameter in our study the sensitivity parameters of the key measurements were selected the first parameter in the model was chosen to perform sensitivity analysis whereas the other parameters remained unchanged the parameter was perturbed by a fixed step size of 5 the disturbance ranges were as follows 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 the model was run once for each parameter change and the disturbance and simulation of the other parameters were performed in sequence in the drainmod h module the sensitivity of the drainage design parameters such as the saturated conductivity the spacing between drains and the depth from the soil surface to the drain was analyzed the annual drainage output was used as a basis for hydraulic sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the nitrogen transport parameters during nitrification and denitrification in the drainmod n module was analyzed and the nitrogen loss of the output data was used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis of the water quality parameters table 1 provides the hydraulic and water quality parameters required for sensitivity analysis and the calculation results the parameter value range refers to wang et al 2005 s is the sensitivity discriminating factor rank is the order of sensitivity and value is the value of the parameter after calibration and validation two parameters in the drainmod h module namely actual distance from the surface to the impervious layer h and the depth from the surface to the drain b are extremely sensitive and their variations considerably influence the change in drainage the spacing between drains l and the saturated conductivity of the fourth layer of the packing layer k4 are highly sensitive parameters the maximum surface storage is a sensitive parameter the first to third layers of saturated conductivity k1 k3 are moderately sensitive parameters the other parameters are insensitive and slightly affect the drainage changes in the drainmod n module the change in the water filled pore space content threshold of denitrification wpfsden remarkably influences the change in nitrogen loss the denitrification experience exponent α and optimum temperature topt den are highly sensitive parameters the decomposition optimum temperature topt dec the decomposition empirical shape coefficient βdec the nitrification maximum reaction rate vmax nit the nitrification half saturation constant km nit and other parameters are moderately sensitive parameters whereas the other parameters are sensitive in this module the parameters of denitrification are more sensitive than the corresponding nitrification parameters these parameter sensitivity analysis results can be used to effectively guide the progress of the calibration work in the next step focus on adjusting the sensitivity parameters and reduce the subsequent workload 3 3 calibration of drainmod model eleven rainfall events complete and representative from may 2016 to september 2016 were selected and the drainage in the simulation results was compared with the measured data the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the simulated and measured values were calculated and analyzed by constantly adjusting the model parameters especially the sensitive ones to calibrate the model parameters the closer the value of nash efficiency coefficients is to 1 the higher the efficiency of the model is li et al 2016 fig 3 shows the simulation results of the rain garden drainage and the monitored values the simulation results of nitrogen loss drainage nitrogen load multiplication of nitrogen concentration and water volume in the rain garden are compared with the measured values in figs 4 and 5 these figures show that the simulated values are consistent with the monitored values the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the monitored and simulated values of drainage are 0 861 and 0 775 respectively the determination coefficients between the monitored and simulated values of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen loss are 0 761 and 0 773 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 694 and 0 621 respectively 3 4 validation of drainmod model the outflow data of the actual monitoring of 12 rainfalls from may 2017 to september 2017 were used for validation fig 6 shows the simulated and monitored values of the rain garden drainage figs 7 and 8 illustrate the comparison of the simulation results of the nitrogen loss in the rain garden with the measured values the differences between the simulated and monitored values in the validation period are smaller than those in the calibration period the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the simulated and measured values of drainage are 0 820 and 0 743 respectively the determination coefficients between the measured values of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen losses and the simulated values are 0 751 and 0 736 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 663 and 0 654 respectively this finding suggests that the hydrological and nitrogen transport processes of rain gardens can be simulated by drainmod drainmod can be used to study the simulation effect of water quantity and nitrogen regulation on storm runoff in rain gardens 3 5 simulation of different scenarios and parameter optimization of rain garden according to the average precipitation data of xi an in the past 60 years the average annual precipitation in xi an is 583 7 mm precipitation is mainly distributed from june to september and the monthly average precipitation accounts for 17 6 13 4 16 7 and 10 9 of the annual precipitation respectively li et al 2016 on the basis of this result we designed the rainfall data using an annual rainfall of 580 mm which was distributed proportionally to each month one year of rainfall data was used as input into the model to analyze the regulation effect of rain gardens on water quantity and nitrogen under different conditions this study mainly investigated five influencing factors of rain gardens namely nitrogen influent concentration confluence ratio depth of aquifer thickness of packing and depth of submerged zone the depth of aquifer refers to the depth of the rain garden fill layer below the ground the depth of submerged zone refers to the height of the water storage inside the garden these five factors are important factors influencing the effect of rain gardens the influent concentrations of nitrogen was denoted as l low concentration nitrate nitrogen 4 5 mg l ammonia nitrogen 1 5 mg l m medium concentration nitrate nitrogen 7 2 mg l ammonia nitrogen 2 2 mg l and h high concentration nitrate nitrogen 10 mg l ammonia nitrogen 3 mg l according to the actual monitoring conditions of the xi an stormwater according to the technical guide for sponge city construction construction of low impact development system trial that was issued by the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china in 2014 five confluence ratios namely 10 1 12 1 14 1 16 1 and 18 1 were adopted and the aquifer depths were 20 25 and 30 cm the thickness of the filler was selected from 30 40 50 60 and 70 cm the depths of the submerged zone were 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm the following scenarios were set using the validated drainmod based on five influencing factors 1 different influent concentrations of nitrogen the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm the packing thickness was 50 cm and no submerged zone existed the nitrogen influent concentration was set as l m and h 2 different confluence ratios the aquifer depth was 25 cm the packing layer thickness was 50 cm no submerged zone existed the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the five confluence ratios were taken 3 different aquifer depths the confluence ratio was 10 1 the packing layer thickness was 50 cm no submerged zone was detected the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the three aquifer depths were taken 4 different packing thicknesses the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm no submerged zone was detected nitrogen influent concentration was m and the thickness of the five filler layers were taken 5 different submerged zone depths the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm the thickness of the filler layer was 50 cm the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the five depths of the submerged zone from 0 cm to 40 cm were taken using the response surface methodology of the design expert software and on the basis of all considered factors such as the influent concentration of nitrogen confluence ratio aquifer depth packing thickness and the depth of the submerged zone the multiple quadratic regression equations between the water or nitrogen load reduction rate and various factors were established given different qualifications and optimization goals the key factors were optimized to search for the best conditions for the corresponding targets 4 results and discussion the simulation was performed on the basis of the different scenarios the inflow drainage nitrogen inflow nitrogen loss water volume reduction rate and nitrogen load reduction rate were calculated table 2 shows the results for one year 4 1 analysis of simulation results 4 1 1 influences of different nitrogen influent concentrations on the regulation effect of rain garden at a confluence ratio of 10 1 the thickness of the packing layer is 50 cm without a submerged zone and the h m and l nitrogen influent concentrations correspond to various nitrogen load reduction rates as the influent concentration increases the load reduction effect of nitrogen on the rain garden is weakened because the adsorption effect of the packing layer of the rain garden on nitrogen is fixed and remains unchanged consequently the high influent concentration decreases the nitrogen load reduction rate the load reduction effect of ammonia nitrogen is particularly obvious the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen at a low nitrate nitrogen concentration of influent 4 5 mg l is 6 48 higher than that of the high nitrate nitrogen influent concentration 10 mg l at a low ammonia nitrogen concentration of influent 1 5 mg l the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate is 39 55 higher than that of the high ammonia nitrogen influent concentration 3 mg l these findings can be attributed to the conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen by the action of nitrifying bacteria at h influent concentrations and the concentration of nitrate nitrogen is extremely high however the group of denitrifying bacteria has a slow proliferation rate and maintaining a high biological concentration is difficult denitrification requires a certain carbon source which inhibits the denitrification process peralta et al 2010 therefore the load reduction effect of ammonia nitrogen is more obvious than the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen with a reduction in influent concentration 4 1 2 influences of different confluence ratios on the regulation effect of rain garden different confluence ratios indicate various influent water volumes the influent water volume increases continuously when the confluence ratio increases from 10 1 to 18 1 at the fixed volume of the rain garden the drainage and the overflow increase and the water volume reduction rate continuously decreases from 60 41 to 42 93 the influent water volume and the nitrogen influent load increase with the confluence ratio whereas the nitrogen load reduction rate decreases in addition to the adsorption effect the flow rate in the rain garden changes greatly causing insufficient contact between the filler and the influent this factor becomes the main reason for the reduction in nitrogen load reduction effect 4 1 3 influences of different aquifer depths on the regulation effect of rain garden the retention capacity of the rain garden increases with aquifer depth decreasing the overflow and increasing the contact time between the stormwater and the garden filler therefore the water and nitrogen load reduction rates show an increasing trend when the depth of the aquifer increased from 20 cm to 30 cm the water reduction rate of the rain garden increased by 2 25 whereas the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen increased by 8 96 and the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increased by 4 06 4 1 4 influences of different packing thicknesses on the regulation effect of rain garden water volume reduction rate increases with the thickness of the packing layer because of the increased retention capacity of the rain garden the load reduction rate of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen in the rain garden remains the same as the thickness of the filler layer increases the contact surface of the influent and the filler widens enabling full adsorption of nitrogen pollutants the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen is enhanced as the thickness of the packing layer increases from 30 cm to 70 cm the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen is increased by 6 36 and the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen is increased by 1 36 the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen is not obvious because increasing the depth of the rain garden results in insufficient oxygen at the bottom of the pool and hinders nitrification thus the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increases slowly 4 1 5 influences of different submerged zone depths on the regulation effect of rain garden the change in the depth of the submerged zone is achieved by changing the height of the outlet of the drain pipe the simulation results show that the reduction rate of water volume decreases as the depth of the submerged zone increases this observation is consistent with the results obtained by zhang et al 2011 as the depth of the submerged zone increases the outlet of the drain pipe is raised and the drainage increases the water reduction rate of the rain garden decreases from 60 41 to 57 13 as the submerged zone widens the height of the anaerobic zone increases thereby providing additional anaerobic sites for denitrifying bacteria and causing the denitrification reaction to occur smoothly consequently the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen increases considerably although the anaerobic zone is not conducive to the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen a sufficient amount of oxygen remains at the top when the depth of the anaerobic zone is not high thus the load reduction of ammonia nitrogen is slightly affected and the load reduction of nitrate nitrogen promotes the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen hence the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate slightly increases when the submerged zone continues to increase and the area with good nutrients decreases the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen decreases 4 2 parameter optimization based on the simulation results of drainmod the multivariate quadratic regression equations between the water reduction rate or nitrogen load reduction rate and various factors established by the response surface methodology are as follows water r e d u c t i o n r a t e 49 6 0 25 a 0 25 b 10 64 c 1 12 d 6 06 e 2 01 f 0 69 c 2 0 053 d 2 0 19 e 2 0 11 f 2 nitrate n i t r o g e n l o a d r e d u c t i o n r a t

0 8 d 2 0 15 e 2 2 95 f 2 where a is the influent concentration of nitrate nitrogen mg l b is the influent concentration of ammonia nitrogen mg l c is the confluence ratio d is the aquifer depth mm e is the packing thickness mm and f is the depth of the submerged zone mm tables 3 and 4 show the optimization results of the thickness of packing and the depth of the submerged zone under different qualifications and optimization objectives when only the nitrogen regulation effect is considered optimal the packing thickness increases from 37 cm to 70 cm as the confluence ratio and influent concentration of nitrogen increase the depth of the submerged zone is 45 cm when the confluence ratio is 16 1 and influent concentration of nitrogen is h which is 23 cm higher than that when the confluence ratio is 12 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is l therefore the depth of the submerged zone should be deepened to achieve a high nitrogen load reduction rate when the effects of the water quantity and quality control are both considered the thickness of the filler layer is the key factor affecting the water reduction rate whereas the packing thickness increases from 42 cm to 80 cm as the confluence ratio increases the depth of the submerged zone is 40 cm when the confluence ratio is 16 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is h which is 14 cm higher than that when the confluence ratio is 12 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is l when the water volume and nitrogen load reduction rates are optimal the ratio of the depth of the submerged zone to the total thickness of the facility is lower than the ratio of the optimal nitrogen control effect when considering the optimal nitrogen regulation effect the optimized nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate is between 65 and 75 when the water and nitrogen regulation effects are optimal the optimized water reduction rate is between 40 and 60 and the nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate is between 70 and 80 the facility height in this table is the sum of aquifer depth soil thickness filler layer thickness and gravel layer thickness which can provide a reference for the construction of rain gardens 5 conclusions 1 in the drainmod h module two parameters namely actual distance from the surface to the impervious layer h and the depth from the surface to the drain b are considered highly sensitive parameters their sensitivity discriminating factors s are 5 23 and 5 54 respectively in the drainmod n module the water filled pore space content threshold of denitrification wpfsden the denitrification experience exponent α and the denitrification optimum temperature topt den are highly sensitive parameters and are 3 87 1 775 and 1 254 respectively the parameters of denitrification are more sensitive than the corresponding nitrification parameters when the reader uses the model he must pay attention to adjusting the above parameters to calibrate and validate the model 2 the long term hydrological and nitrogen transport processes of rain gardens can be simulated well using drainmod the determination and nash efficiency coefficients of the simulated and monitored values of the drainage are 0 820 and 0 743 respectively the determination and nash efficiency coefficients of the measured and simulated values of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen losses are 0 751 and 0 736 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 663 and 0 654 respectively 3 the simulations of different scenarios reveal that the lower the nitrogen influent concentration is the better the load reduction effect will be the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate is considerably improved as the confluence ratio increases the rain garden filler retention remains unchanged and the water reduction and nitrogen reducing effects are weakened as the depth of the aquifer increases the water and nitrogen load reduction rates show an increasing trend the thickness of the filler layer increases the water reduction rate increases from 56 79 to 63 92 the nitrate load reduction rate increases by 6 36 and the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increases by 1 36 setting the submerged zone within a certain range can enhance the nitrate nitrogen load reduction effect the ammonia nitrogen load reduction effect also increases however an extremely high submerged zone affects the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate and the nitrogen nitrate load reduction effect also increases slowly 4 the parameters are optimized by using the response surface methodology and the minimum thickness of the filler layer is 37 cm and the maximum is 80 cm the depth of the submerged zone is at least 22 cm and the maximum is 45 cm to make the nitrogen load reduction rate high the submerged zone must be deepened tables 3 and 4 can provide a basis for the construction of rain gardens the design parameters of rain gardens are optimized via drainmod and the response surface methodology which can reduce the total amount of rain garden outflow and effectively purify the quality of stormwater thereby reducing urban waterlogging risk and improving the quality of the water environment

stormwater from the source positively affect runoff reduction and pollutant control davis et al 2009 lid replaces or reinforces land through hydrological and hydraulic design and controls storm runoff from the source thereby maintaining the hydrological status after development as a typical lid facility the bioretention system is an indispensable and efficient economic stormwater treatment measure that includes rain garden bio swale detention flower bed and tree pool in line with the concept of urban lid as a powerful measure of the bioretention system rain gardens can regulate storm runoff and beautify landscapes rain gardens mainly rely on their unique permeable filler to reduce the total amount of rain garden outflow and effectively purify the quality of stormwater thereby reducing the urban waterlogging risk and improving the quality of the water environment rain gardens have many functions such as conserving water resources regulating floods purifying water quality maintaining biodiversity regulating the local microclimate and beautifying landscapes rain gardens can be divided into three types anti seepage semi permeable and infiltration current research on rain gardens include hydrological simulation soil penetration the retention of pollutants and the construction and application of rain gardens li et al 2014 iqbal et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 constructed two impervious rain gardens in xixian new area with planting soil filler and improved fillers volume ratio of 60 planting soil 30 sand 5 sawdust 5 water treatment residuals the cumulative annual load of the rain garden and the adsorption capacity of the filler medium were analyzed through continuous years of field rainfall monitoring brown et al 2013 examined the influence of previous events on outflow concentrations by analyzing flow weighted composite samples from four to six consecutive events during three different seasons for two sets of field monitored bioretention cells in nashville north carolina the regulation effect of rain gardens is affected by catchment area water storage depth and local meteorological conditions guo et al 2019 by optimizing the structure of a facility and changing the height of the submerged zone denitrification can be enhanced to remove nitrogen from the rainfall runoff to study the effect of rain gardens on stormwater a long term model is required for simulation and prediction to better utilize stormwater resources the models for simulating rain gardens hydrological processes include recarga hydrus and drainmod recarga is a water balance calculation model based on the richards equation kleiven 2017 however the calculation of the drainage process is not comprehensive and cannot simulate the water quality the hydrus model considers the simulation of water quantity and quality but it has many input parameters and cannot simulate the submerged zone li et al 2018 drainmod is a hydrological field model agricultural water management model developed by dr wayne skaggs of the department of agriculture and bioengineering at the university of north carolina state in the 1970s negm et al 2016 drainmod is mainly used to simulate and predict the drainage process of different drainage designs and management measures brown et al 2013 drainmod was first applied to simulate the drainage of a farmland currently the bioretention system can be conceptually modeled in drainmod brown et al 2010 brown and hunt 2011 discussed the simulation steps of the hydrological model for bioretention facilities using drainmod to simulate the quality effects of hydrological water caused by different drainage structures media depths surface water depths and soil types in bioretention ponds tang et al 2016 used drainmod to analyze the long term effects of rain gardens affected by various factors such as aquifer depth confluence ratio and rainfall characteristics the basic principle of drainmod involves water balance on a thin section of soil per unit area between two adjacent drains from an impermeable layer to a surface an approximation method is then used instead of a numerical solution to describe the characteristics of water movement tian et al 2012a the drainage rate is calculated by assuming that the lateral flow movement in the soil profile mainly occurs in a saturated area when the groundwater level fails to rise to the surface hooghoudt s equation is used to calculate drainage negm et al 2014 the kirkham equation is used when water rises to completely submerge the ground saarinen et al 2013 water balance is calculated by using drainmod daily after meteorological and soil data the surface conditions and other parameters are inputted infiltration evaporation surface and underground runoff underground drainage and other water balance results are considered output quan et al 2012 in drainmod the hydrological module can be divided into hydrological calculation and human design luo et al 2000 these two parts are connected by parameters to form an interactive model system therefore the applicability of the model can be improved by adjusting the artificial design component of the model an extended application of drainmod is nitrogen simulation which describes the comprehensive nitrogen cycle process that involves nitrate nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen the simulation of nitrogen migration through a multiphase one dimensional convection dispersion reaction equation is used to model nitrogen transport tian et al 2012b drainmod is largely used to simulate farmland drainage few simulations are available for lid measures and the parameters of rain gardens are rarely optimized design expert is a widely used experimental design software assistant developed in the united states design expert can be used to statistically analyze data fit curves establish mathematical models and perform experimental optimization the software has been widely used in various multi factor experimental designs and analyses torabi et al 2017 the design expert software has a response surface methodology which can perform surface analysis on quadratic polynomial equation well and whose operation is convenient jannet et al 2012 the optimization result of the response surface analysis can be automatically obtained by the software therefore this study aims to i calibrate and validate the hydrological and water quality parameters of drainmod ii set up and simulate different scenarios with the validated model and analyze the effects of bioretention facilities on rainfall regulation and nitrogen purification and iii optimize these factors and explore the appropriate bioretention facility structure by using the response surface methodology an optimization method of rain gardens is provided by which reasonable design parameters can be obtained to enhance the treatment effects of rain gardens the method would be beneficial to the construction of rain gardens 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area overview xi an city is located in the middle of the yellow river the air in this area is unevenly heated because of the high terrain in the south and the low terrain in the north leading to the uneven distribution of rainfall in time and space in summer this climate easily causes unstable weather in certain areas consequently summer in xi an is hot and rainy with occasional drought winter in xi an is cold and rainy and the temperature highly fluctuates in spring and rainy autumn the average annual precipitation of the city is approximately 583 7 mm the average duration of rainfall is 96 6 days and the maximum duration of continuous rainfall is 13 19 days li et al 2016 most of the rainfall is concentrated in july september accounting for approximately 50 of the annual rainfall frequent heavy rains are likely to cause natural disasters such as flood and soil erosion the main pollutants in stormwater are suspended solids ss chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus these pollutants are derived from the scouring of roofing and roads by urban stormwater in which the ss concentration exceeds twice that of urban sewage untreated wastewater compared with the class v water quality requirements of the quality standard for surface water environment in china the concentration of pollutants in stormwater is twice the standard yuan et al 2011 this rate has a notable impact on the water environment if the initial stormwater is directly discharged into the water body zhang et al 2015 2 2 experimental facility the object of this study is an impervious rain garden in the test field of the xi an university of technology campus shaanxi province china fig 1 shows the structure and fig 2 shows the experiment site stormwater from the roof of the water conservation research institute is collected by a rain garden device through a downpipe which is connected to an inlet pipe on the side of the rain garden an inverted triangle inlet is provided in the inlet pipe and stormwater from the roof flows into the rain garden through the inflow port the pool measures 4 m 3 m 0 9 m length width height respectively and its confluence ratio ratio of catchment area to rain garden area is 6 1 the filler layers are composed of 0 20 cm of soil 20 40 cm of fine sand 40 55 cm of coarse sand and 55 70 cm of gravel from top to bottom a 10 cm diameter drain pipe with uniform drainage holes is laid at the bottom of the pool the bottom of the garden is impervious and outflow is discharged to the municipal pipe network system 2 3 monitored method 2 3 1 water quantity monitoring a triangular weir monitors the inflow and drainage processes of the rain garden the pressure sensor is installed at a stable place in front of the triangle weir to automatically record the weir head process in real time the weir head process of the triangular weir is corrected through manual measurement the instantaneous flow is integrated to obtain the inflow and drainage the amounts are specifically expressed as formulas 1 and 2 respectively prakash and shivapur 2004 1 q 8 15 μ tan θ 2 2 g h 2 5 2 v 0 t q t d t where q is the flow process l min μ

determined by phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry and ammonia nitrogen is determined by using nessler s reagent photometry method nitrogen concentration for a rainfall event is obtained through calculating the arithmetic mean value of all the measured concentrations of water samples with time 3 model establishment of drainmod 3 1 input data the five main components of the parameters that should be inputted in drainmod are meteorological data soil data crop data the design parameters of the drainage system and the nitrogen transport parameters hawary et al 2015 the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall are entered as meteorological data and the steady state thornthwaite empirical formula is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration and the meteorological data of the model youssef et al 2018 the measured soil water characteristic curve the saturated hydraulic conductivity the stratified thickness and the physical and chemical characteristics of each layer were inputted as soil data thunbergia alata a drought tolerant and waterlogging tolerant plant was grown in the rain garden its planting date and flowering time and the effective depth of the root system change over time are the main input crop data the drainage system design parameters include the drainage pipe depth the impervious layer depth and the drainage coefficient the nitrogen transport parameters are the initial nitrogen content of soil and rainfall the nitrification process parameters the denitrification process parameters and the organic matter decomposition parameters before the simulation the depth of the concealed pipe was set shallowly the drainage spacing and coefficient were set as large as possible and the maximum surface storage was set consistently with kirkham s depth for flow to drains thus only a small amount of runoff was lost to the surface and most of the runoff was collected into the bioretention system to obtain the flow background file hunt et al 2007 the rainfall and temperature data from 2016 to 2017 were entered into the model on the basis of the existing data the rainfall data included the daily rainfall in the two years which was obtained from the weather station of the water conservation research institute of xi an university of technology the temperature data included the daily highest and lowest temperatures in the two years which were derived from the weather network 3 2 sensitivity analysis of parameters the sensitivity analysis of the parameters could effectively reduce the workload of adjustment help the model achieve an ideal simulation effect as quickly as possible and effectively guide data monitoring and collection kurtulus and flipo 2012 this study used the modified morris screening method which is a widely used sensitivity analysis method in modified morris classification screening the independent variable changes in a fixed step size and the average value of the morse coefficient as calculated by multiple disturbances is taken as the sensitivity discrimination factor of the parameter equation 3 li et al 2018 3 s i 0 n 1 y i 1 y i y 0 p i 1 p i n 1 where s is the sensitivity discriminating factor yi is the ith running output value of the model yi 1 is the i 1st running output value of the model y 0 is the initial parameter calculation result value pi is the percentage of the ith model operation parameter value relative to the initial parameter value change pi 1 is the percentage change of the i 1st model operation parameter value relative to the initial parameter value and n is the number of model runs the sensitivity of the parameters can be divided into four categories namely si 1 which is a highly sensitive parameter 0 2 si 1 which is a sensitive parameter 0 05 si 0 2 which is a moderately sensitive parameter and 0 si 0 05 which is an insensitive parameter in our study the sensitivity parameters of the key measurements were selected the first parameter in the model was chosen to perform sensitivity analysis whereas the other parameters remained unchanged the parameter was perturbed by a fixed step size of 5 the disturbance ranges were as follows 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 the model was run once for each parameter change and the disturbance and simulation of the other parameters were performed in sequence in the drainmod h module the sensitivity of the drainage design parameters such as the saturated conductivity the spacing between drains and the depth from the soil surface to the drain was analyzed the annual drainage output was used as a basis for hydraulic sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the nitrogen transport parameters during nitrification and denitrification in the drainmod n module was analyzed and the nitrogen loss of the output data was used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis of the water quality parameters table 1 provides the hydraulic and water quality parameters required for sensitivity analysis and the calculation results the parameter value range refers to wang et al 2005 s is the sensitivity discriminating factor rank is the order of sensitivity and value is the value of the parameter after calibration and validation two parameters in the drainmod h module namely actual distance from the surface to the impervious layer h and the depth from the surface to the drain b are extremely sensitive and their variations considerably influence the change in drainage the spacing between drains l and the saturated conductivity of the fourth layer of the packing layer k4 are highly sensitive parameters the maximum surface storage is a sensitive parameter the first to third layers of saturated conductivity k1 k3 are moderately sensitive parameters the other parameters are insensitive and slightly affect the drainage changes in the drainmod n module the change in the water filled pore space content threshold of denitrification wpfsden remarkably influences the change in nitrogen loss the denitrification experience exponent α and optimum temperature topt den are highly sensitive parameters the decomposition optimum temperature topt dec the decomposition empirical shape coefficient βdec the nitrification maximum reaction rate vmax nit the nitrification half saturation constant km nit and other parameters are moderately sensitive parameters whereas the other parameters are sensitive in this module the parameters of denitrification are more sensitive than the corresponding nitrification parameters these parameter sensitivity analysis results can be used to effectively guide the progress of the calibration work in the next step focus on adjusting the sensitivity parameters and reduce the subsequent workload 3 3 calibration of drainmod model eleven rainfall events complete and representative from may 2016 to september 2016 were selected and the drainage in the simulation results was compared with the measured data the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the simulated and measured values were calculated and analyzed by constantly adjusting the model parameters especially the sensitive ones to calibrate the model parameters the closer the value of nash efficiency coefficients is to 1 the higher the efficiency of the model is li et al 2016 fig 3 shows the simulation results of the rain garden drainage and the monitored values the simulation results of nitrogen loss drainage nitrogen load multiplication of nitrogen concentration and water volume in the rain garden are compared with the measured values in figs 4 and 5 these figures show that the simulated values are consistent with the monitored values the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the monitored and simulated values of drainage are 0 861 and 0 775 respectively the determination coefficients between the monitored and simulated values of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen loss are 0 761 and 0 773 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 694 and 0 621 respectively 3 4 validation of drainmod model the outflow data of the actual monitoring of 12 rainfalls from may 2017 to september 2017 were used for validation fig 6 shows the simulated and monitored values of the rain garden drainage figs 7 and 8 illustrate the comparison of the simulation results of the nitrogen loss in the rain garden with the measured values the differences between the simulated and monitored values in the validation period are smaller than those in the calibration period the determination and nash efficiency coefficients between the simulated and measured values of drainage are 0 820 and 0 743 respectively the determination coefficients between the measured values of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen losses and the simulated values are 0 751 and 0 736 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 663 and 0 654 respectively this finding suggests that the hydrological and nitrogen transport processes of rain gardens can be simulated by drainmod drainmod can be used to study the simulation effect of water quantity and nitrogen regulation on storm runoff in rain gardens 3 5 simulation of different scenarios and parameter optimization of rain garden according to the average precipitation data of xi an in the past 60 years the average annual precipitation in xi an is 583 7 mm precipitation is mainly distributed from june to september and the monthly average precipitation accounts for 17 6 13 4 16 7 and 10 9 of the annual precipitation respectively li et al 2016 on the basis of this result we designed the rainfall data using an annual rainfall of 580 mm which was distributed proportionally to each month one year of rainfall data was used as input into the model to analyze the regulation effect of rain gardens on water quantity and nitrogen under different conditions this study mainly investigated five influencing factors of rain gardens namely nitrogen influent concentration confluence ratio depth of aquifer thickness of packing and depth of submerged zone the depth of aquifer refers to the depth of the rain garden fill layer below the ground the depth of submerged zone refers to the height of the water storage inside the garden these five factors are important factors influencing the effect of rain gardens the influent concentrations of nitrogen was denoted as l low concentration nitrate nitrogen 4 5 mg l ammonia nitrogen 1 5 mg l m medium concentration nitrate nitrogen 7 2 mg l ammonia nitrogen 2 2 mg l and h high concentration nitrate nitrogen 10 mg l ammonia nitrogen 3 mg l according to the actual monitoring conditions of the xi an stormwater according to the technical guide for sponge city construction construction of low impact development system trial that was issued by the ministry of housing and urban rural development of china in 2014 five confluence ratios namely 10 1 12 1 14 1 16 1 and 18 1 were adopted and the aquifer depths were 20 25 and 30 cm the thickness of the filler was selected from 30 40 50 60 and 70 cm the depths of the submerged zone were 0 10 20 30 and 40 cm the following scenarios were set using the validated drainmod based on five influencing factors 1 different influent concentrations of nitrogen the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm the packing thickness was 50 cm and no submerged zone existed the nitrogen influent concentration was set as l m and h 2 different confluence ratios the aquifer depth was 25 cm the packing layer thickness was 50 cm no submerged zone existed the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the five confluence ratios were taken 3 different aquifer depths the confluence ratio was 10 1 the packing layer thickness was 50 cm no submerged zone was detected the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the three aquifer depths were taken 4 different packing thicknesses the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm no submerged zone was detected nitrogen influent concentration was m and the thickness of the five filler layers were taken 5 different submerged zone depths the confluence ratio was 10 1 the aquifer depth was 25 cm the thickness of the filler layer was 50 cm the nitrogen influent concentration was m and the five depths of the submerged zone from 0 cm to 40 cm were taken using the response surface methodology of the design expert software and on the basis of all considered factors such as the influent concentration of nitrogen confluence ratio aquifer depth packing thickness and the depth of the submerged zone the multiple quadratic regression equations between the water or nitrogen load reduction rate and various factors were established given different qualifications and optimization goals the key factors were optimized to search for the best conditions for the corresponding targets 4 results and discussion the simulation was performed on the basis of the different scenarios the inflow drainage nitrogen inflow nitrogen loss water volume reduction rate and nitrogen load reduction rate were calculated table 2 shows the results for one year 4 1 analysis of simulation results 4 1 1 influences of different nitrogen influent concentrations on the regulation effect of rain garden at a confluence ratio of 10 1 the thickness of the packing layer is 50 cm without a submerged zone and the h m and l nitrogen influent concentrations correspond to various nitrogen load reduction rates as the influent concentration increases the load reduction effect of nitrogen on the rain garden is weakened because the adsorption effect of the packing layer of the rain garden on nitrogen is fixed and remains unchanged consequently the high influent concentration decreases the nitrogen load reduction rate the load reduction effect of ammonia nitrogen is particularly obvious the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen at a low nitrate nitrogen concentration of influent 4 5 mg l is 6 48 higher than that of the high nitrate nitrogen influent concentration 10 mg l at a low ammonia nitrogen concentration of influent 1 5 mg l the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate is 39 55 higher than that of the high ammonia nitrogen influent concentration 3 mg l these findings can be attributed to the conversion of ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen by the action of nitrifying bacteria at h influent concentrations and the concentration of nitrate nitrogen is extremely high however the group of denitrifying bacteria has a slow proliferation rate and maintaining a high biological concentration is difficult denitrification requires a certain carbon source which inhibits the denitrification process peralta et al 2010 therefore the load reduction effect of ammonia nitrogen is more obvious than the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen with a reduction in influent concentration 4 1 2 influences of different confluence ratios on the regulation effect of rain garden different confluence ratios indicate various influent water volumes the influent water volume increases continuously when the confluence ratio increases from 10 1 to 18 1 at the fixed volume of the rain garden the drainage and the overflow increase and the water volume reduction rate continuously decreases from 60 41 to 42 93 the influent water volume and the nitrogen influent load increase with the confluence ratio whereas the nitrogen load reduction rate decreases in addition to the adsorption effect the flow rate in the rain garden changes greatly causing insufficient contact between the filler and the influent this factor becomes the main reason for the reduction in nitrogen load reduction effect 4 1 3 influences of different aquifer depths on the regulation effect of rain garden the retention capacity of the rain garden increases with aquifer depth decreasing the overflow and increasing the contact time between the stormwater and the garden filler therefore the water and nitrogen load reduction rates show an increasing trend when the depth of the aquifer increased from 20 cm to 30 cm the water reduction rate of the rain garden increased by 2 25 whereas the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen increased by 8 96 and the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increased by 4 06 4 1 4 influences of different packing thicknesses on the regulation effect of rain garden water volume reduction rate increases with the thickness of the packing layer because of the increased retention capacity of the rain garden the load reduction rate of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen in the rain garden remains the same as the thickness of the filler layer increases the contact surface of the influent and the filler widens enabling full adsorption of nitrogen pollutants the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen is enhanced as the thickness of the packing layer increases from 30 cm to 70 cm the load reduction rate of nitrate nitrogen is increased by 6 36 and the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen is increased by 1 36 the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen is not obvious because increasing the depth of the rain garden results in insufficient oxygen at the bottom of the pool and hinders nitrification thus the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increases slowly 4 1 5 influences of different submerged zone depths on the regulation effect of rain garden the change in the depth of the submerged zone is achieved by changing the height of the outlet of the drain pipe the simulation results show that the reduction rate of water volume decreases as the depth of the submerged zone increases this observation is consistent with the results obtained by zhang et al 2011 as the depth of the submerged zone increases the outlet of the drain pipe is raised and the drainage increases the water reduction rate of the rain garden decreases from 60 41 to 57 13 as the submerged zone widens the height of the anaerobic zone increases thereby providing additional anaerobic sites for denitrifying bacteria and causing the denitrification reaction to occur smoothly consequently the load reduction effect of nitrate nitrogen increases considerably although the anaerobic zone is not conducive to the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen a sufficient amount of oxygen remains at the top when the depth of the anaerobic zone is not high thus the load reduction of ammonia nitrogen is slightly affected and the load reduction of nitrate nitrogen promotes the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen hence the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate slightly increases when the submerged zone continues to increase and the area with good nutrients decreases the load reduction rate of ammonia nitrogen decreases 4 2 parameter optimization based on the simulation results of drainmod the multivariate quadratic regression equations between the water reduction rate or nitrogen load reduction rate and various factors established by the response surface methodology are as follows water r e d u c t i o n r a t e 49 6 0 25 a 0 25 b 10 64 c 1 12 d 6 06 e 2 01 f 0 69 c 2 0 053 d 2 0 19 e 2 0 11 f 2 nitrate n i t r o g e n l o a d r e d u c t i o n r a t

0 8 d 2 0 15 e 2 2 95 f 2 where a is the influent concentration of nitrate nitrogen mg l b is the influent concentration of ammonia nitrogen mg l c is the confluence ratio d is the aquifer depth mm e is the packing thickness mm and f is the depth of the submerged zone mm tables 3 and 4 show the optimization results of the thickness of packing and the depth of the submerged zone under different qualifications and optimization objectives when only the nitrogen regulation effect is considered optimal the packing thickness increases from 37 cm to 70 cm as the confluence ratio and influent concentration of nitrogen increase the depth of the submerged zone is 45 cm when the confluence ratio is 16 1 and influent concentration of nitrogen is h which is 23 cm higher than that when the confluence ratio is 12 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is l therefore the depth of the submerged zone should be deepened to achieve a high nitrogen load reduction rate when the effects of the water quantity and quality control are both considered the thickness of the filler layer is the key factor affecting the water reduction rate whereas the packing thickness increases from 42 cm to 80 cm as the confluence ratio increases the depth of the submerged zone is 40 cm when the confluence ratio is 16 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is h which is 14 cm higher than that when the confluence ratio is 12 1 and the influent concentration of nitrogen is l when the water volume and nitrogen load reduction rates are optimal the ratio of the depth of the submerged zone to the total thickness of the facility is lower than the ratio of the optimal nitrogen control effect when considering the optimal nitrogen regulation effect the optimized nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate is between 65 and 75 when the water and nitrogen regulation effects are optimal the optimized water reduction rate is between 40 and 60 and the nitrate nitrogen load reduction rate is between 70 and 80 the facility height in this table is the sum of aquifer depth soil thickness filler layer thickness and gravel layer thickness which can provide a reference for the construction of rain gardens 5 conclusions 1 in the drainmod h module two parameters namely actual distance from the surface to the impervious layer h and the depth from the surface to the drain b are considered highly sensitive parameters their sensitivity discriminating factors s are 5 23 and 5 54 respectively in the drainmod n module the water filled pore space content threshold of denitrification wpfsden the denitrification experience exponent α and the denitrification optimum temperature topt den are highly sensitive parameters and are 3 87 1 775 and 1 254 respectively the parameters of denitrification are more sensitive than the corresponding nitrification parameters when the reader uses the model he must pay attention to adjusting the above parameters to calibrate and validate the model 2 the long term hydrological and nitrogen transport processes of rain gardens can be simulated well using drainmod the determination and nash efficiency coefficients of the simulated and monitored values of the drainage are 0 820 and 0 743 respectively the determination and nash efficiency coefficients of the measured and simulated values of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen losses are 0 751 and 0 736 respectively and their nash efficiency coefficients are 0 663 and 0 654 respectively 3 the simulations of different scenarios reveal that the lower the nitrogen influent concentration is the better the load reduction effect will be the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate is considerably improved as the confluence ratio increases the rain garden filler retention remains unchanged and the water reduction and nitrogen reducing effects are weakened as the depth of the aquifer increases the water and nitrogen load reduction rates show an increasing trend the thickness of the filler layer increases the water reduction rate increases from 56 79 to 63 92 the nitrate load reduction rate increases by 6 36 and the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate increases by 1 36 setting the submerged zone within a certain range can enhance the nitrate nitrogen load reduction effect the ammonia nitrogen load reduction effect also increases however an extremely high submerged zone affects the ammonia nitrogen load reduction rate and the nitrogen nitrate load reduction effect also increases slowly 4 the parameters are optimized by using the response surface methodology and the minimum thickness of the filler layer is 37 cm and the maximum is 80 cm the depth of the submerged zone is at least 22 cm and the maximum is 45 cm to make the nitrogen load reduction rate high the submerged zone must be deepened tables 3 and 4 can provide a basis for the construction of rain gardens the design parameters of rain gardens are optimized via drainmod and the response surface methodology which can reduce the total amount of rain garden outflow and effectively purify the quality of stormwater thereby reducing urban waterlogging risk and improving the quality of the water environment

5541,himalayan glaciers exert considerable influence on basin hydrology and its response to climate change melt runoff generated from ungauged himalayan basins uhb requires an understanding of snow and ice cover extent along with prevailing meteorological conditions therefore an estimation of seasonal snow cover distribution topographic elevation aspect and slope and climatic variability was carried out using satellite data and meteorological observations from three automatic weather stations awss located at different elevations in an uhb chorabari glacier results suggest that the topography and the meteorological conditions of the basin influence the dynamics of snow cover and the corresponding processes responsible for the melt runoff generation the snow cover area sca has high variability in the elevation range of 3799 5000 m indicating that as glacier ablation begins sca below this elevation primarily contributes to the melt runoff likewise the eastern aspect and the slopes 0 10 and 70 80 show higher variability further the annual distribution of air temperature gradients dt dz or temperature lapse rates tlrs exhibits a bimodal pattern the mean annual tlr for the basin is 6 0 c km 1 which is lower than the traditionally used adiabatic or environmental lapse rate 6 5 c km 1 we also established the role of tlrs in the dynamics of sca which is an important parameter used for the computation of melt runoff the 0 c isotherm established indicates that the elevation zone above 5000 5500 m has persistent snow cover throughout the year and snow cover below this zone contributes to the melt runoff during the ablation season therefore validating the equilibrium line altitude ela of chorabari glacier lies within this zone since the tlr and sca vary with space and time our study in an ungauged glacierized basin of river ganga could be useful for policymakers as well as other researchers working on the regional hydrology keywords snow cover temperature lapse rate equilibrium line altitude automatic weather stations ungauged himalayan basins 1 introduction hydrometeorological observations are required for understanding the hydrological processes and modelling the estimates of streamflow it is essential for the planning and management of water resources at the basin scale however many processes that are of interest from a hydrologic point of view are difficult to observe routinely and unambiguously loukas and vasiliades 2014 most of the basins in the himalayan region are ungauged or poorly gauged due to complex terrain harsh environment and inaccessibility han et al 2019 these regions have a large volume of freshwater stored as snow and glaciers that melts during summer and provides critical flow of water in the pro glacial rivers sustaining downstream ecosystem agricultural practices hydroelectric power generation and urban water supplies seidel et al 1994 singh and jain 2003 immerzeel et al 2009 though major river basins in india have been gauged for determination of hydrological variables medium and small sized himalayan catchments are mostly ungauged kothyari and garde 1991 kothyari 2004 various studies have simulated runoff generation processes for ungauged basins with estimated snow cover area sca snow water equivalent swe or glacier area changes but scarce in situ measurements lead to large uncertainties since snowmelt is a significant contributor to total runoff singh et al 2008 it is essential to understand the extent and melting pattern of sca for hydrological studies in the mountainous regions gupta et al 2005 minora et al 2015 mukhopadhyay and khan 2017 also the variability of sca has an impact on the timing and magnitude of the snowmelt runoff srivastava et al 2014 generally the information on snow cover extent and its variability is obtained through limited field survey and snowfall data recorded at the meteorological stations however they provide point based information and do not represent the whole basin particularly in the undulated and high relief topography like the himalaya therefore the use of remote sensing in combination with in situ observations provides a suitable solution to better understand and simulate the hydrological processes in such basins at regional scale and its utilization in the melt runoff modelling e g tekeli et al 2005 udnaes et al 2007 terink et al 2015 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 in the ihr large river basins in uttarakhand himachal pradesh jammu and kashmir and sikkim e g krishna 2005 negi et al 2009 rathore et al 2015 shukla et al 2016 have been investigated to understand the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of sca wang et al 2008 kaur et al 2010 li et al 2017 these studies do not represent the snow cover dynamics at the catchment scale dietz et al 2012 however owing to the scarcity of data and difficulties in maintaining in situ meteorological observations most of the studies at these sites are often forced to extrapolate data e g air temperature collected at lower elevation sites heynen et al 2016 moore et al 2017 the uncertainties associated with extrapolating air temperature from low to high elevations lead to either underestimation or overestimation of sca in the resulting runoff singh et al 2008 kumar 2011 consequently spatially and temporally distributed information on air temperature and precipitation can be derived accurately by increasing the number of meteorological stations within the basin at different altitudes chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 this information is critical to understand how snowmelt rates vary along with different terrain factors since air temperature plays a critical role in distinguishing the form of precipitation between rainfall and snowfall as well as a significant determinant in the degree day models braithwaite 1984 dey et al 1989 hock 2000 it is essential to quantify the influencing factors accurately furthermore changes in the sca with elevation can be characterized precisely over glaciated catchments based on distributed temperature variations or gradients commonly referred as temperature lapse rates tlr singh 1991 kattel et al 2013 thayyen and dimri 2014 2018 córdova et al 2016 the variability in tlr is a crucial factor that needs to be established accurately in the complex and snow dominated mountain regions harlow et al 2004 grab 2013 erokhina et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that accumulation and depletion of snow largely depend on latitude altitude topography and weather conditions prevailing in the basin jain et al 2009 kour et al 2016 however the explicit linkage of snow cover dynamics with topography temperature and precipitation changes in the ihr is rarely investigated therefore in the present study we attempt to understand the dynamics of seasonal snow cover and the control of climate and topography on it we also establish basin wide temperature gradients and critical temperature thresholds isotherms that have the potential to understand the basin scale snow cover dynamics and also important for glacier mass balance and glacio hydrological simulations in ungauged basins 2 study area the chorabari glacier basin is a small ungauged basin situated in the mandakini river garhwal himalaya fig 1 it receives 1200 mm of rainfall during the indian summer monsoon ism kumar et al 2018b the glacier is 7 5 km in length with a total glacierized area is 6 6 km2 and the catchment area is 15 4 km2 the elevation range until the base campsite is 3895 to 6420 m fig 1 the avalanche fed glacier accumulation zone is comprised of two cirques originating from the prominent peaks of kedar and bhartekhunta at an elevation of 6940 and 6578 m respectively bhambri et al 2016 the ablation zone of the glacier is characterized by several crevasses few supraglacial lakes thick debris cover produced by valley wall erosion and unconsolidated loose sediments transported from the left and right lateral moraines the detailed geology and geomorphology of the study area can also be found in kumar et al 2016 3 data and methods 3 1 data used in the himalaya mountain shadows and cloud cover are considerably observed during the peak ism months july and august which pose an enormous challenge in estimating accurate sca over the glaciated region hence satellite imageries with 10 cloud cover were used for the estimation of sca since fewer images were available for the years 2011 and 2013 therefore the trend of snow cover depletion patterns has been estimated only from the available images table s1 in total 73 multispectral landsat 5 and 8 tm and oli 30 m resolution satellite imageries were acquired from the united states geological survey usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov for the years 2009 2015 barring 2012 table s1 also one sentinel 2 msi image for the year 2017 was used for validation of methods and results advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem version 2 with a 30 m resolution were obtained from japan space systems jss http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp in the absence of higher resolution data aster gdem is known to provide better results for topographic analysis in mountain regions frey and paul 2012 yue et al 2015 and has an accuracy of 15 1 m tachikawa et al 2011 the catchment and glacier boundary was demarcated using liss iv linear imaging self scanning sensor 5 m resolution september 2013 scene of resourcesat 2 and aster gdem the meteorological data observed at base camp bc 3820 m was available since 2009 kumar et al 2016 2018 while two new automatic weather stations awss were established at rambara camp rc 2760 m and advanced base camp abc 4270 m fig 1 in october 2011 by centre for glaciology wadia institute of himalayan geology fig s1 field data for the years 2011 2014 used in this study were collected at these stations the aws located at rc was damaged during the catastrophic flood of june 2013 due to unprecedented rainfall fig s1f bhambri et al 2016 the break in the time series of meteorological data has occurred after this event the bc station was removed in may 2015 for calibration of sensors and relocation of the station as the old site was prone to sliding fig s1e further the available daily wind speed data from the three awss was analyzed for the years 2012 bc and rc and 2013 abc 3 2 processing of satellite data to understand the spatiotemporal variations in sca snow and non snow covered surfaces were classified using the normalized difference snow index ndsi eq 1 generally a threshold value of 0 40 is used to differentiate the boundary between snow and non snow pixels hall et al 1995 xiao et al 2001 before calculations of ndsi the digital numbers dn of all satellite images were converted to their corresponding top of the atmosphere toa reflectance values gupta et al 2005 1 n d s i g r e e n r e f l e c t a n c e s w i r r e f l e c t a n c e g r e e n r e f l e c t a n c e s w i r r e f l e c t a n c e however during the visual examination of each ndsi image with the corresponding satellite image heterogeneity impurities in the snow cover a mixture of dry and wet snow was discovered thus the reflectance of some pixels in the sca was reduced to 0 37 similar values based on the visual interpretation were used by hall et al 1995 gupta et al 2005 kulkarni et al 2006 burns and nolin 2014 the typical ndsi frequency distribution for snow and non snow surfaces with the bimodal and unimodal character for summer and winter season respectively is given in fig 2 furthermore validation of ndsi thresholds similar to paul et al 2016 was carried out using landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 msi images for the year 2017 and no substantial changes were observed fig s2 the images collected during winter months have shadows and the catchment is completely covered with snow producing higher ndsi reflectance value than non snow covered areas therefore to avoid such errors band ratio red shortwave infrared swir technique was adopted for the delineation of snow and non snow covered areas in the shadowed region rott and markl 1989 bronge and bronge 1999 gupta et al 2007 paul et al 2004 in the present study visual interpretation for each image was carried out and the threshold values obtained for the band ratio method range from 1 5 to 2 for snow during winters the gdem was classified into seven elevation zones with an interval of 500 m the area of each elevation zone was computed to study the effect of first order morphometry on the sca we generated both aspect and slope maps using aster gdem the aspect map displays the general orientation of the area in eight directions similarly a slope map was generated for eight classes at an interval of 10 the coefficient of variation cv was determined to understand the seasonal and annual variability in sca at each elevation zone aspect and slope the seasonal variability cv was estimated from all the images available in each year while the annual variability cv was determined using the mean values for the respective years 2009 2015 we also estimated the distribution of land surface temperature lst using landsat 8 oli thermal band girona mata et al 2019 for selected images from the year 2014 the average elevation corresponding to 0 c lst was obtained using landsat 8 oli product and aster gdem 3 3 processing of meteorological data and error estimation in the last two decades awss have been used worldwide to collect meteorological data for glaciological studies e g oerlemans 2000 pellicciotti et al 2008 petersen and pellicciotti 2011 kumar et al 2018c the development of aws networks has significantly reduced the errors and the temporal delay between meteorological measurements and the visualization of measured variables at remote sites such as in the himalaya for both summer and winter seasons although when aws malfunctions it generally leads to discontinuous meteorological data for all the parameters fortunately the air temperature data for the years 2011 october december 2012 and 2013 were available for all three stations data for rc is till june 2013 enabling the development of linear equations to fill the data gaps fig 3 therefore minimum maximum and mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean data for rc station june 2013 to december 2014 has been computed statistically using the dimensionless pearson correlation coefficient pcc with stations bc and abc eq 2 the linear relationships equations between air temperature records of each station to the other are provided in table 1 2 pearson correlation coefficient pcc i 1 n t i r1 t i m1 t i r2 t i m2 i 1 n t i r1 t i m1 2 i 1 n t i r1 t i m2 2 where ti r1 and ti r2 are the ith values of air temperature data and ti m1 and ti m2 are the daily mean of temperature data for any two aws for uncertainty estimation in our analysis several standard error estimation indices including bias bias percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse were computed bias was applied to evaluate the systematic difference oc in temperatures obtained from two data sources observed and computed the pbias was calculated to estimate the relative difference in percentage between the observed and the computed data the rmse was computed to quantify the average error magnitude oc between the observed and the computed values the measure of fit between the observed and computed values was assessed using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse if the value of nse is 0 and 1 it indicates deviations between observed and computed values if nse is negative predictions are very poor and the average observed value is a better estimate than the model prediction nash and sutcliffe 1970 these statistical indexes were computed as follows 3 bias bias i 1 n t i o t i c i 1 n t i o 4 percentbias pbias i 1 n t i o t i c i 1 n t i o 100 5 root mean square error rmse i 1 n t i o t i c 2 n 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 i 1 n t i o t i c 2 i 1 n t i o t m 2 where ti o is the observed and ti c is computed daily temperatures respectively on the ith day tm is the average of the given year or season and n is the number of daily temperature values therefore using the above equations eqs 3 6 the possibilities of the error in the estimation of air temperature were determined table 2 as reflected by the bias of mean temperature tmean there are no significant changes between the observed and computed temperatures at different aws elevations also the nse was found to be high 0 99 between bc and abc as compared to rc and bc stations 0 96 which suggests a good match between computed and observed aws data fig 4 the data for all three stations provide a similar trend throughout the study period i e fall or rise in air temperature of one station corresponds to the fall or rise in temperature of the other two stations with variable magnitude the performance evaluation of air temperature tmin tmax and tmean estimations for the years 2012 and 2013 suggest that the computations are good and can be utilized for further analysis table s2 the relation between mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean and altitude of the awss are analyzed on the annual and monthly scale over the period 2012 2013 to establish the temperature gradients dt dz in the basin table 3 linear correlation and regressions were also applied to analyze these temperature gradients fig s3 similarly the wind speed for all the stations was analyzed to understand the monthly distribution through box and whisker plots for the years 2012 and 2013 the tlrs along with the critical air temperature may be used to determine the solid or liquid form of precipitation at a particular elevation the precipitation form i e rain and snow usually depends on critical air temperature thresholds u s a c e 1956 which is typically in the range of 0 5 5 c depending on the geographical location and climate martinec and rango 1986 the studies indicate that the contribution of snow and glacier melt begins at 0 2 c for the himalayan region singh et al 2008 bocchiola et al 2010 senese et al 2014 therefore we considered that the melting of snow cover and phase of precipitation varies as follows if tmean 0 c melting of snow cover starts and precipitation is considered as rain if tmean 0 c melting of snow cover stops and precipitation is considered as snow similar conditions can be applied for 1 and 2 c critical air temperatures thus to ascertain the contributing area for melt runoff generation within a glacierized basin the elevation zones isotherms corresponding to 0 1 and 2 c temperature thresholds or critical temperatures eq 7 were constructed for each month using monthly tlr computed with reference to the highest station abc 7 h h a b c t i t a b c δ t where ti corresponds to 0 1 and 2 c air temperature with respect to the temperature at index or reference station i e tabc for the present study δt is the computed temperature lapse rate in c 100 m 1 h is the elevation of the point where temperature is to be considered as 0 1 and 2 c m habc is elevation of the station at abc m this elevation may be considered as the transient snowline for that month the overall methodology implied in this study is given as a flowchart in fig 5 the 0 c isotherms derived from air temperature data and lst were compared to understand the variations in ground based observations and satellite derived products 4 results 4 1 distribution and variability of sca the present study shows that snow starts to melt at the beginning of the melt season in early may and continues to melt until the end of the ablation season in late september fig 6 and fig s4 no significant change is observed in the inter annual trend of snow cover melt during the glacier ablation season may september the mean sca observed at the end of the ablation season as a percentage of the total basin area for the elevation zones i to vii during the years 2009 2015 was 1 8 17 27 12 7 and 3 respectively table 4 a fig 7 a while the mean sca observed as a percentage of the area of each elevation zone during the years 2009 2015 was 40 47 72 87 78 76 and 82 respectively table 4a the maximum and minimum extent of sca was observed in zone iv i e 5000 5500 m and i 3799 4000 m respectively on average 74 of the catchment area is covered by snow during the study period although snow and glacier melting during the post monsoon period is common no snow cover was observed in the elevation zones 5000 m over the glacier surface by the end of september fig 6 and fig s4 this is because solid precipitation at lower zones is rarely observed during the ism the annual mean sca for all the elevation zones along with the total sca for each year are presented in table 4 a our result indicates large inter annual variability in the sca and varies from a minimum of 53 in 2013 to a maximum of 83 in 2011 table 4a the variation in sca estimated through cv within each elevation zone indicates that 5000 7000 m are the least variable followed by 4500 5000 m the high variability is observed in the zones below 4500 m for the study period fig 8 a table 4a the analysis of the distribution of sca and its variability at each elevation zone shows that the zone iv 5000 5500 m plays a crucial role in governing the snow cover within the basin throughout the year the precipitation in the form of rainfall is predominant in the elevation zones i to iv while the elevation zones v to vii experience no significant changes in snow cover distribution however the satellite images during april and november for the year 2015 depicts small changes in snow cover of the elevation zones v and vi fig 6 and fig s4 thus the aerial extent of sca is restricted to the altitudes above zone iv during and at the end of the ablation season suggesting that snowfall may be precipitating at higher reaches and there is no accumulation at altitudes below 5500 m during the ablation season our results indicate no changes in sca at altitudes above zone iv while the sca below this is depleting throughout the ablation season even in extreme rainfall events like june 2013 the sca for the year 2013 is abnormally low and indicates changes in sca even above the elevation zone iv fig 7a which may be attributed to the very heavy rainfall rain on snow event during june 2013 leading to rapid melting of the snow cover since the study area is south oriented the mean sca in the southern aspect covers nearly 52 of the total area southwest 21 south 19 and southeast 12 table 4b fig 7b the sca for north northeast east northwest and west aspects as a percentage of the total basin area is 2 5 8 1 and 7 respectively the eastern aspect has higher variability cv in comparison to the western aspect fig 8b statistical analysis suggests that sca on the eastern aspect has the highest variability followed by the northeast and southeast aspects the western aspects showed the least variability because it faces the solar radiation for the maximum duration fig 7b fig s5 and the accumulated snow is melted swiftly the maximum sca is observed in the southern aspects se s and sw furthermore the north and west aspects are completely snow covered throughout the year with respect to the area of that aspect while all other aspects experience variable response the slope wise distribution of sca shows that the zones ii iii iv and v have an sca of 12 15 16 14 respectively as a percent of the total basin area followed by zone i vi vii and viii having an sca of 5 9 3 and 0 respectively table 4c fig 7c further the annual sca for each slope for each year indicates that the year 2013 had the lowest sca the cv shows that the zone viii and i have the highest variability followed by zone vii and ii while zone iii depicts the least variability fig 8c the variability in the distribution of sca for slope also suggests that the highest slope has maximum variability which may be owing to frequent avalanches in this region zones vii and viii similarly the zones i and ii have considerable variability because these slopes are usually exposed to solar radiation and experience rapid melting 4 2 distribution and variability in air temperature and wind here we focus on the distribution of meteorological variables that have the highest influence on the melting of snow and ice therefore the mean monthly values of air temperature were computed from the combined time series for the years 2012 2014 the mean air temperatures within the basin rc bc and abc demonstrate that july has a maximum temperature of 10 7 c and january has a minimum temperature of 4 6 c the mean air temperature observed for all three awss follows the same annual cycle with an average temperature of 3 8 c while the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures within the basin were 9 0 and 0 8 c respectively table 5 a box and whisker plots reflect monthly statistics mean maximum minimum quartile 1 and quartile 3 fig 9 that shows all three stations experience relatively low temperature tmin tmax tmean changes during the ism june september and considerable variability during the winter season november april the annual temperature range for tmax varies from 6 8 to 18 6 c 0 5 to 12 5 c and 2 to 11 6 c while for tmin it varies from 1 6 to 12 4 c 10 2 to 7 6 c and 11 8 to 5 4 c for rc bc and abc respectively similarly the annual range for tmean varies from 1 1 to 14 8 c 6 3 to 9 8 c and 8 8 to 7 6 c for rc bc and abc respectively the mean range of tmin tmax tmean for all three stations can be seen from table 5 a the mean wind speed at rc bc and abc were observed to be 7 4 9 4 and 5 2 km h 1 respectively while the maximum mean monthly wind speed was 9 5 12 2 and 6 8 km h 1 respectively table 5b similarly the minimum mean monthly wind speed observed was 5 6 5 9 and 3 6 km h 1 at rc bc and abc respectively the monthly statistics of wind speed suggest that the maximum wind occurred at bc followed by rc and abc fig 10 also the mean wind speed was found to be low during the summer season june september as compared to the winters 4 3 establishment of temperature gradients in the basin the completed daily time series for each station were further utilized to compute the monthly seasonal and annual gradients dt dz between mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean and respective elevation for each station table 3 the results show that the vertical temperature gradient for the whole basin based on the mean annual air temperature is linear decreasing linearly with increasing elevation the annual mean lapse rate of tmin tmax and tmean were 6 1 5 3 and 6 0 c km 1 respectively table 6 the tlr for each month varied with different extents throughout the year fig 11 a it is observed that the mean monthly tlr for three stations ranges from 4 6 to 7 1 4 4 to 6 0 and 4 8 to 6 7 c for tmin tmax and tmean respectively table 6 the mean values of tlr for the snowmelt season june september were computed to be 5 0 4 7 and 5 1 c km 1 for tmin tmax and tmean respectively fig 11a the seasonal cycle for the study period 2012 2014 shows that tlr of tmax is lower than the tlr for tmin table 6 as the annual range of tmin is larger than that for tmax for all three stations table 5 studies representing the prevailing weather conditions over glacierized basins during the ablation season also indicate that the variability coefficient of variation cv for tmin is higher as compared to tmax srivastava et al 2014 while the variability in tmean and other meteorological parameters is given by singh et al 2005 2007 kumar et al 2014 and shea et al 2015 at different altitudes we also observed that monthly tlr values begin to reduce in may and are drastically lower during the ism june september as compared to the mean annual tlr during july and august the tlr is approximately constant for tmin tmax and tmean fig 11a table 6 such variations in tlr for june to september can be expected because of rain and cloud cover in the area singh 1991 i e the persistent cloud cover during the ism leads to lowering of the diurnal temperature range dtr for tmin tmax and tmean fig 9 also the tlr for maximum temperature has a bimodal distribution with two peaks in may and november this could be due to the fact that may is the beginning of the summer season and the temperature is high with clear sky conditions as the westerlies have retreated and the ism has not yet set in while in november we again find clear sky conditions as the ism has completely retreated and the westerlies have not completely penetrated into the region thus the dtr is high for the months of may and november fig 9 4 4 reconstruction of elevation responsible for melt runoff generation using isotherms the extent of snow cover in the basin reaches its highest elevation in july and august for the critical temperature isotherms 0 1 and 2 c and then begins to move downwards fig 11b the 0 1 and 2 c isotherms during the peak ablation season average for july august were at 5389 5237 and 5086 m respectively therefore validating that precipitation occurs as rain or rain on snow up to the elevation zone iv during the ism the area of the basin above this highest transient snowline or the highest critical temperature isotherm is considered to be the zone of equilibrium line altitude ela where snow cover remains persistent throughout the year thus the ela for chorabari glacier could lie in the elevation zone iv with 0 1 and 2 c isotherms at 5425 5274 and 5122 m respectively at the end of september fig 12 similarly studies consider satellite derived lst as an input parameter in runoff models in the absence of in situ data to understand the spatial distribution of the thermal state of the land surface chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 therefore 0 c isotherms using lst from landsat images were derived for comparison the 0 c isotherms established using the lst for 16th may 23rd october and 10th december 2014 are at an elevation of 4306 4874 and 4162 m respectively fig s6 however the results have large variations 300 500 m between them which could be attributed to the fact that the 0 c isotherms from lst of a particular day and time would not represent the monthly conditions i e if we take daily lst and derive a mean monthly lst for computing the 0 c isotherms this may be comparable to isotherms established using in situ mean air temperature 5 discussion monitoring snow cover variability in space and time is essential for understanding the snowmelt processes and crucial for the development of spatially distributed runoff simulation models and future scenarios the topography of the region is an essential parameter in the distribution of snow singh et al 1995 the snowline movement also provides information on the extent of snow cover the persistence of snow in the basin and its depletion with time the seasonal and annual variability in the sca and snowline controls the microclimatic conditions of the region which is crucial for the sustainability of the ecosystem and environment in the basin singh et al 2003 mountainous areas have their microclimatic system despite the influence of large scale weather systems like the ism and westerlies several studies in the himalayan region have suggested that altitude aspect and slope are the critical factors in controlling the weather systems and microclimatic conditions singh et al 2003 jain et al 2009 gurung et al 2017 further the snow depletion curve sdc for chorabari glacier depicts that snow remains for a longer time at higher elevations kumar et al 2018a for comparison the elevation wise snow depletion pattern for the chenab basin in the western himalaya illustrates that the trend of depletion is similar to that of the present study i e the least sca is observed in july and august the snowline for the western himalaya during july and august lies in the elevation zone of 3600 4300 m kour et al 2016 while in central himalaya the snowline was observed at 5000 5500 m for the same period this reflects that the inter basin variations in depletion of sca are controlled by the geographical location latitude and distribution of winter precipitation westerlies the western himalaya receives a much higher amount of winter precipitation snowfall as compared to the central himalaya which is dominated by the summer precipitation rainfall the lower elevation of snowline in the western himalaya also indicates better health of the glaciers as compared to central himalaya in terms of nourishment accumulation of snow the variation in distribution or redistribution of snow may occur due to gravity wind or avalanche induced preferential deposition of snow during winter when the basin is totally covered with snow and the wind speed is high the preferential deposition does not affect the extent of sca though it may influence the snow depth freudiger et al 2017 as the temperature starts increasing from april peripheral snow melting at lower elevations starts to occur but due to heavy moisture content it restricts the wind driven distribution in our study area the avalanches are confined to the higher reaches accumulation zone and do not affect the extent of sca in the ablation zone this is evident in fig s4 where we can see that the sca is continuously depleting from april and a slight increase in a few years is observed during may which is due to snowfall events in the basin however statistical modelling for snow depth or snow water equivalent swe could not be incorporated in the present study but would be beneficial for future attempts in association with improved topographical information high resolution dem and ground based information of snow depth and other meteorological data like solar radiation incoming and outgoing for this region the sca above the elevation zone iv was found to be persistent throughout the season suggesting that the ela of chorabari glacier lies within this zone fig 6 and fig 11 this corroborates with the study by dobhal et al 2013 specifying that the ela for chorabari glacier is at an elevation of 5070 m therefore in the absence of field based mass balance observations monitoring of variability in sca can be useful for identifying demarcating the ela of a glacier this information can be further improved by classifying the elevation zones at a scale of 100 m or better with the help of high resolution dem to further understand the temperature variability the tlrs assessed in the present study were compared to the standard vertical mean temperature gradient the annual mean tlr 6 0 c is lower than the generally used value of 6 5 c km 1 singh 1991 wang et al 2017 generally a single tlr value is used to interpolate temperature data for the whole basin which in most cases are not homogenous besides these temperature stations in many instances are placed at lower altitudes in the basin and may not be representative for the entire altitudinal distribution further studies show that there are significant variations in the distribution of tlr on the northern and southern slopes of himalaya kattel et al 2013 2015 guo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 thayyen and dimri 2018 however most of the studies provide seasonal tlrs and few studies report the monthly tlrs thus we have compared our study with other studies in himalaya which have accessed tlrs on a monthly scale fig 11c the bimodal distribution of tlr similar to our study has been reported from other parts of the himalaya e g nepal qinling mountains in china upper ganga basin in the central himalaya and sutlej and beas basins in the western himalaya which have similar climatic conditions fig 11c further it is also observed that the tlr during the ism july september is almost constant in eastern and central himalaya fig 11c while tlrs for western himalaya show considerable deviations this is due to the impact and magnitude of the ism over the eastern and central himalaya during this period the ela based on ground observations and temperature isotherms is above 5000 m therefore precipitation during the ism occurs as rainfall up to the elevation zone iv 5000 5500 m while it may occur as snowfall above this elevation however during may and october few events of solid precipitation were observed which result in bringing the extent of snow cover to lower elevations for a few days fig s4 these events are generally related to the westerlies or sometimes local recycling of moisture in the region kumar et al 2018a verma et al 2018 furthermore a significant reduction in sca was observed during the early ablation period may june which led to a rise in meltwater discharge kumar et al 2016 2018b indicating the availability of meltwater discharge for various socio economic applications is highly dependent on the seasonal distribution of snow cover in the region further it is important to highlight the fact that the study area is a very small glacierized basin 15 km2 therefore to interpolate remotely sensed data lst swe sca etc available at a coarse resolution e g modis 250 m would lead to large uncertainty in the results another important factor is that a large cloud cover persists over the study area during the ism which would lead to further uncertainty in the estimation of lst therefore we cannot consider lst as a proxy for the present study understanding hydrological processes and hydrological changes in ungauged himalayan basins provides important insights into future water availability for downstream regions furthermore the contribution of melt runoff varies significantly among basins adding even more complexity to hydrological responses to climate change therefore modelling and predicting the runoff from ungauged basins is a big challenge which can be addressed by calibrating a hydrological model for a gauged basin using observed data and then applying the model to the ungauged basin by transferring the model parameters merz and blöschl 2004 sivapalan 2003 arora et al 2005 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 6 concluding remarks the proper understanding of the spatial distribution of air temperature within the basin requires at least a few operational awss located at different elevation zones this will help to reduce the data gaps in high altitude regions for future studies the statistics and methods used for filling the data gaps and validation of the data from one meteorological station aws to the other can be applied to other studies in data scarce regions the inter basin variations in depletion of sca are controlled by the geographical location latitude topography elevation aspect and slope and distribution pattern of winter precipitation in the ihr the broader understanding of snow cover dynamics and its relationship with climatic variables provides an opportunity for parameterization calibration of melt runoff models over ungauged himalayan basins the annual temperature lapse rates tlrs for the tmin tmax and tmean are significantly lower than the standard adiabatic or environmental lapse rate 6 5 c km 1 therefore we recommend the use of observed or measured tlr for applications in hydrological modelling glacier mass balance estimations and other related studies in the mountainous basins monthly critical temperature isotherms were established for evaluating the snowmelt contributing area within the basin these isotherms could help in demarcating the ela for mass balance estimations it can also be utilized for melt runoff computations and assessment of changes in sca under the global climate change scenarios the information generated in this study is important for policymakers in the ungauged himalayan basins for assessment of melt runoff contribution to the total streamflow and improve the runoff forecasting credit

5541,himalayan glaciers exert considerable influence on basin hydrology and its response to climate change melt runoff generated from ungauged himalayan basins uhb requires an understanding of snow and ice cover extent along with prevailing meteorological conditions therefore an estimation of seasonal snow cover distribution topographic elevation aspect and slope and climatic variability was carried out using satellite data and meteorological observations from three automatic weather stations awss located at different elevations in an uhb chorabari glacier results suggest that the topography and the meteorological conditions of the basin influence the dynamics of snow cover and the corresponding processes responsible for the melt runoff generation the snow cover area sca has high variability in the elevation range of 3799 5000 m indicating that as glacier ablation begins sca below this elevation primarily contributes to the melt runoff likewise the eastern aspect and the slopes 0 10 and 70 80 show higher variability further the annual distribution of air temperature gradients dt dz or temperature lapse rates tlrs exhibits a bimodal pattern the mean annual tlr for the basin is 6 0 c km 1 which is lower than the traditionally used adiabatic or environmental lapse rate 6 5 c km 1 we also established the role of tlrs in the dynamics of sca which is an important parameter used for the computation of melt runoff the 0 c isotherm established indicates that the elevation zone above 5000 5500 m has persistent snow cover throughout the year and snow cover below this zone contributes to the melt runoff during the ablation season therefore validating the equilibrium line altitude ela of chorabari glacier lies within this zone since the tlr and sca vary with space and time our study in an ungauged glacierized basin of river ganga could be useful for policymakers as well as other researchers working on the regional hydrology keywords snow cover temperature lapse rate equilibrium line altitude automatic weather stations ungauged himalayan basins 1 introduction hydrometeorological observations are required for understanding the hydrological processes and modelling the estimates of streamflow it is essential for the planning and management of water resources at the basin scale however many processes that are of interest from a hydrologic point of view are difficult to observe routinely and unambiguously loukas and vasiliades 2014 most of the basins in the himalayan region are ungauged or poorly gauged due to complex terrain harsh environment and inaccessibility han et al 2019 these regions have a large volume of freshwater stored as snow and glaciers that melts during summer and provides critical flow of water in the pro glacial rivers sustaining downstream ecosystem agricultural practices hydroelectric power generation and urban water supplies seidel et al 1994 singh and jain 2003 immerzeel et al 2009 though major river basins in india have been gauged for determination of hydrological variables medium and small sized himalayan catchments are mostly ungauged kothyari and garde 1991 kothyari 2004 various studies have simulated runoff generation processes for ungauged basins with estimated snow cover area sca snow water equivalent swe or glacier area changes but scarce in situ measurements lead to large uncertainties since snowmelt is a significant contributor to total runoff singh et al 2008 it is essential to understand the extent and melting pattern of sca for hydrological studies in the mountainous regions gupta et al 2005 minora et al 2015 mukhopadhyay and khan 2017 also the variability of sca has an impact on the timing and magnitude of the snowmelt runoff srivastava et al 2014 generally the information on snow cover extent and its variability is obtained through limited field survey and snowfall data recorded at the meteorological stations however they provide point based information and do not represent the whole basin particularly in the undulated and high relief topography like the himalaya therefore the use of remote sensing in combination with in situ observations provides a suitable solution to better understand and simulate the hydrological processes in such basins at regional scale and its utilization in the melt runoff modelling e g tekeli et al 2005 udnaes et al 2007 terink et al 2015 chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 in the ihr large river basins in uttarakhand himachal pradesh jammu and kashmir and sikkim e g krishna 2005 negi et al 2009 rathore et al 2015 shukla et al 2016 have been investigated to understand the spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of sca wang et al 2008 kaur et al 2010 li et al 2017 these studies do not represent the snow cover dynamics at the catchment scale dietz et al 2012 however owing to the scarcity of data and difficulties in maintaining in situ meteorological observations most of the studies at these sites are often forced to extrapolate data e g air temperature collected at lower elevation sites heynen et al 2016 moore et al 2017 the uncertainties associated with extrapolating air temperature from low to high elevations lead to either underestimation or overestimation of sca in the resulting runoff singh et al 2008 kumar 2011 consequently spatially and temporally distributed information on air temperature and precipitation can be derived accurately by increasing the number of meteorological stations within the basin at different altitudes chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 this information is critical to understand how snowmelt rates vary along with different terrain factors since air temperature plays a critical role in distinguishing the form of precipitation between rainfall and snowfall as well as a significant determinant in the degree day models braithwaite 1984 dey et al 1989 hock 2000 it is essential to quantify the influencing factors accurately furthermore changes in the sca with elevation can be characterized precisely over glaciated catchments based on distributed temperature variations or gradients commonly referred as temperature lapse rates tlr singh 1991 kattel et al 2013 thayyen and dimri 2014 2018 córdova et al 2016 the variability in tlr is a crucial factor that needs to be established accurately in the complex and snow dominated mountain regions harlow et al 2004 grab 2013 erokhina et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that accumulation and depletion of snow largely depend on latitude altitude topography and weather conditions prevailing in the basin jain et al 2009 kour et al 2016 however the explicit linkage of snow cover dynamics with topography temperature and precipitation changes in the ihr is rarely investigated therefore in the present study we attempt to understand the dynamics of seasonal snow cover and the control of climate and topography on it we also establish basin wide temperature gradients and critical temperature thresholds isotherms that have the potential to understand the basin scale snow cover dynamics and also important for glacier mass balance and glacio hydrological simulations in ungauged basins 2 study area the chorabari glacier basin is a small ungauged basin situated in the mandakini river garhwal himalaya fig 1 it receives 1200 mm of rainfall during the indian summer monsoon ism kumar et al 2018b the glacier is 7 5 km in length with a total glacierized area is 6 6 km2 and the catchment area is 15 4 km2 the elevation range until the base campsite is 3895 to 6420 m fig 1 the avalanche fed glacier accumulation zone is comprised of two cirques originating from the prominent peaks of kedar and bhartekhunta at an elevation of 6940 and 6578 m respectively bhambri et al 2016 the ablation zone of the glacier is characterized by several crevasses few supraglacial lakes thick debris cover produced by valley wall erosion and unconsolidated loose sediments transported from the left and right lateral moraines the detailed geology and geomorphology of the study area can also be found in kumar et al 2016 3 data and methods 3 1 data used in the himalaya mountain shadows and cloud cover are considerably observed during the peak ism months july and august which pose an enormous challenge in estimating accurate sca over the glaciated region hence satellite imageries with 10 cloud cover were used for the estimation of sca since fewer images were available for the years 2011 and 2013 therefore the trend of snow cover depletion patterns has been estimated only from the available images table s1 in total 73 multispectral landsat 5 and 8 tm and oli 30 m resolution satellite imageries were acquired from the united states geological survey usgs http earthexplorer usgs gov for the years 2009 2015 barring 2012 table s1 also one sentinel 2 msi image for the year 2017 was used for validation of methods and results advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem version 2 with a 30 m resolution were obtained from japan space systems jss http gdem ersdac jspacesystems or jp in the absence of higher resolution data aster gdem is known to provide better results for topographic analysis in mountain regions frey and paul 2012 yue et al 2015 and has an accuracy of 15 1 m tachikawa et al 2011 the catchment and glacier boundary was demarcated using liss iv linear imaging self scanning sensor 5 m resolution september 2013 scene of resourcesat 2 and aster gdem the meteorological data observed at base camp bc 3820 m was available since 2009 kumar et al 2016 2018 while two new automatic weather stations awss were established at rambara camp rc 2760 m and advanced base camp abc 4270 m fig 1 in october 2011 by centre for glaciology wadia institute of himalayan geology fig s1 field data for the years 2011 2014 used in this study were collected at these stations the aws located at rc was damaged during the catastrophic flood of june 2013 due to unprecedented rainfall fig s1f bhambri et al 2016 the break in the time series of meteorological data has occurred after this event the bc station was removed in may 2015 for calibration of sensors and relocation of the station as the old site was prone to sliding fig s1e further the available daily wind speed data from the three awss was analyzed for the years 2012 bc and rc and 2013 abc 3 2 processing of satellite data to understand the spatiotemporal variations in sca snow and non snow covered surfaces were classified using the normalized difference snow index ndsi eq 1 generally a threshold value of 0 40 is used to differentiate the boundary between snow and non snow pixels hall et al 1995 xiao et al 2001 before calculations of ndsi the digital numbers dn of all satellite images were converted to their corresponding top of the atmosphere toa reflectance values gupta et al 2005 1 n d s i g r e e n r e f l e c t a n c e s w i r r e f l e c t a n c e g r e e n r e f l e c t a n c e s w i r r e f l e c t a n c e however during the visual examination of each ndsi image with the corresponding satellite image heterogeneity impurities in the snow cover a mixture of dry and wet snow was discovered thus the reflectance of some pixels in the sca was reduced to 0 37 similar values based on the visual interpretation were used by hall et al 1995 gupta et al 2005 kulkarni et al 2006 burns and nolin 2014 the typical ndsi frequency distribution for snow and non snow surfaces with the bimodal and unimodal character for summer and winter season respectively is given in fig 2 furthermore validation of ndsi thresholds similar to paul et al 2016 was carried out using landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 msi images for the year 2017 and no substantial changes were observed fig s2 the images collected during winter months have shadows and the catchment is completely covered with snow producing higher ndsi reflectance value than non snow covered areas therefore to avoid such errors band ratio red shortwave infrared swir technique was adopted for the delineation of snow and non snow covered areas in the shadowed region rott and markl 1989 bronge and bronge 1999 gupta et al 2007 paul et al 2004 in the present study visual interpretation for each image was carried out and the threshold values obtained for the band ratio method range from 1 5 to 2 for snow during winters the gdem was classified into seven elevation zones with an interval of 500 m the area of each elevation zone was computed to study the effect of first order morphometry on the sca we generated both aspect and slope maps using aster gdem the aspect map displays the general orientation of the area in eight directions similarly a slope map was generated for eight classes at an interval of 10 the coefficient of variation cv was determined to understand the seasonal and annual variability in sca at each elevation zone aspect and slope the seasonal variability cv was estimated from all the images available in each year while the annual variability cv was determined using the mean values for the respective years 2009 2015 we also estimated the distribution of land surface temperature lst using landsat 8 oli thermal band girona mata et al 2019 for selected images from the year 2014 the average elevation corresponding to 0 c lst was obtained using landsat 8 oli product and aster gdem 3 3 processing of meteorological data and error estimation in the last two decades awss have been used worldwide to collect meteorological data for glaciological studies e g oerlemans 2000 pellicciotti et al 2008 petersen and pellicciotti 2011 kumar et al 2018c the development of aws networks has significantly reduced the errors and the temporal delay between meteorological measurements and the visualization of measured variables at remote sites such as in the himalaya for both summer and winter seasons although when aws malfunctions it generally leads to discontinuous meteorological data for all the parameters fortunately the air temperature data for the years 2011 october december 2012 and 2013 were available for all three stations data for rc is till june 2013 enabling the development of linear equations to fill the data gaps fig 3 therefore minimum maximum and mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean data for rc station june 2013 to december 2014 has been computed statistically using the dimensionless pearson correlation coefficient pcc with stations bc and abc eq 2 the linear relationships equations between air temperature records of each station to the other are provided in table 1 2 pearson correlation coefficient pcc i 1 n t i r1 t i m1 t i r2 t i m2 i 1 n t i r1 t i m1 2 i 1 n t i r1 t i m2 2 where ti r1 and ti r2 are the ith values of air temperature data and ti m1 and ti m2 are the daily mean of temperature data for any two aws for uncertainty estimation in our analysis several standard error estimation indices including bias bias percent bias pbias and root mean square error rmse were computed bias was applied to evaluate the systematic difference oc in temperatures obtained from two data sources observed and computed the pbias was calculated to estimate the relative difference in percentage between the observed and the computed data the rmse was computed to quantify the average error magnitude oc between the observed and the computed values the measure of fit between the observed and computed values was assessed using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse if the value of nse is 0 and 1 it indicates deviations between observed and computed values if nse is negative predictions are very poor and the average observed value is a better estimate than the model prediction nash and sutcliffe 1970 these statistical indexes were computed as follows 3 bias bias i 1 n t i o t i c i 1 n t i o 4 percentbias pbias i 1 n t i o t i c i 1 n t i o 100 5 root mean square error rmse i 1 n t i o t i c 2 n 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 i 1 n t i o t i c 2 i 1 n t i o t m 2 where ti o is the observed and ti c is computed daily temperatures respectively on the ith day tm is the average of the given year or season and n is the number of daily temperature values therefore using the above equations eqs 3 6 the possibilities of the error in the estimation of air temperature were determined table 2 as reflected by the bias of mean temperature tmean there are no significant changes between the observed and computed temperatures at different aws elevations also the nse was found to be high 0 99 between bc and abc as compared to rc and bc stations 0 96 which suggests a good match between computed and observed aws data fig 4 the data for all three stations provide a similar trend throughout the study period i e fall or rise in air temperature of one station corresponds to the fall or rise in temperature of the other two stations with variable magnitude the performance evaluation of air temperature tmin tmax and tmean estimations for the years 2012 and 2013 suggest that the computations are good and can be utilized for further analysis table s2 the relation between mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean and altitude of the awss are analyzed on the annual and monthly scale over the period 2012 2013 to establish the temperature gradients dt dz in the basin table 3 linear correlation and regressions were also applied to analyze these temperature gradients fig s3 similarly the wind speed for all the stations was analyzed to understand the monthly distribution through box and whisker plots for the years 2012 and 2013 the tlrs along with the critical air temperature may be used to determine the solid or liquid form of precipitation at a particular elevation the precipitation form i e rain and snow usually depends on critical air temperature thresholds u s a c e 1956 which is typically in the range of 0 5 5 c depending on the geographical location and climate martinec and rango 1986 the studies indicate that the contribution of snow and glacier melt begins at 0 2 c for the himalayan region singh et al 2008 bocchiola et al 2010 senese et al 2014 therefore we considered that the melting of snow cover and phase of precipitation varies as follows if tmean 0 c melting of snow cover starts and precipitation is considered as rain if tmean 0 c melting of snow cover stops and precipitation is considered as snow similar conditions can be applied for 1 and 2 c critical air temperatures thus to ascertain the contributing area for melt runoff generation within a glacierized basin the elevation zones isotherms corresponding to 0 1 and 2 c temperature thresholds or critical temperatures eq 7 were constructed for each month using monthly tlr computed with reference to the highest station abc 7 h h a b c t i t a b c δ t where ti corresponds to 0 1 and 2 c air temperature with respect to the temperature at index or reference station i e tabc for the present study δt is the computed temperature lapse rate in c 100 m 1 h is the elevation of the point where temperature is to be considered as 0 1 and 2 c m habc is elevation of the station at abc m this elevation may be considered as the transient snowline for that month the overall methodology implied in this study is given as a flowchart in fig 5 the 0 c isotherms derived from air temperature data and lst were compared to understand the variations in ground based observations and satellite derived products 4 results 4 1 distribution and variability of sca the present study shows that snow starts to melt at the beginning of the melt season in early may and continues to melt until the end of the ablation season in late september fig 6 and fig s4 no significant change is observed in the inter annual trend of snow cover melt during the glacier ablation season may september the mean sca observed at the end of the ablation season as a percentage of the total basin area for the elevation zones i to vii during the years 2009 2015 was 1 8 17 27 12 7 and 3 respectively table 4 a fig 7 a while the mean sca observed as a percentage of the area of each elevation zone during the years 2009 2015 was 40 47 72 87 78 76 and 82 respectively table 4a the maximum and minimum extent of sca was observed in zone iv i e 5000 5500 m and i 3799 4000 m respectively on average 74 of the catchment area is covered by snow during the study period although snow and glacier melting during the post monsoon period is common no snow cover was observed in the elevation zones 5000 m over the glacier surface by the end of september fig 6 and fig s4 this is because solid precipitation at lower zones is rarely observed during the ism the annual mean sca for all the elevation zones along with the total sca for each year are presented in table 4 a our result indicates large inter annual variability in the sca and varies from a minimum of 53 in 2013 to a maximum of 83 in 2011 table 4a the variation in sca estimated through cv within each elevation zone indicates that 5000 7000 m are the least variable followed by 4500 5000 m the high variability is observed in the zones below 4500 m for the study period fig 8 a table 4a the analysis of the distribution of sca and its variability at each elevation zone shows that the zone iv 5000 5500 m plays a crucial role in governing the snow cover within the basin throughout the year the precipitation in the form of rainfall is predominant in the elevation zones i to iv while the elevation zones v to vii experience no significant changes in snow cover distribution however the satellite images during april and november for the year 2015 depicts small changes in snow cover of the elevation zones v and vi fig 6 and fig s4 thus the aerial extent of sca is restricted to the altitudes above zone iv during and at the end of the ablation season suggesting that snowfall may be precipitating at higher reaches and there is no accumulation at altitudes below 5500 m during the ablation season our results indicate no changes in sca at altitudes above zone iv while the sca below this is depleting throughout the ablation season even in extreme rainfall events like june 2013 the sca for the year 2013 is abnormally low and indicates changes in sca even above the elevation zone iv fig 7a which may be attributed to the very heavy rainfall rain on snow event during june 2013 leading to rapid melting of the snow cover since the study area is south oriented the mean sca in the southern aspect covers nearly 52 of the total area southwest 21 south 19 and southeast 12 table 4b fig 7b the sca for north northeast east northwest and west aspects as a percentage of the total basin area is 2 5 8 1 and 7 respectively the eastern aspect has higher variability cv in comparison to the western aspect fig 8b statistical analysis suggests that sca on the eastern aspect has the highest variability followed by the northeast and southeast aspects the western aspects showed the least variability because it faces the solar radiation for the maximum duration fig 7b fig s5 and the accumulated snow is melted swiftly the maximum sca is observed in the southern aspects se s and sw furthermore the north and west aspects are completely snow covered throughout the year with respect to the area of that aspect while all other aspects experience variable response the slope wise distribution of sca shows that the zones ii iii iv and v have an sca of 12 15 16 14 respectively as a percent of the total basin area followed by zone i vi vii and viii having an sca of 5 9 3 and 0 respectively table 4c fig 7c further the annual sca for each slope for each year indicates that the year 2013 had the lowest sca the cv shows that the zone viii and i have the highest variability followed by zone vii and ii while zone iii depicts the least variability fig 8c the variability in the distribution of sca for slope also suggests that the highest slope has maximum variability which may be owing to frequent avalanches in this region zones vii and viii similarly the zones i and ii have considerable variability because these slopes are usually exposed to solar radiation and experience rapid melting 4 2 distribution and variability in air temperature and wind here we focus on the distribution of meteorological variables that have the highest influence on the melting of snow and ice therefore the mean monthly values of air temperature were computed from the combined time series for the years 2012 2014 the mean air temperatures within the basin rc bc and abc demonstrate that july has a maximum temperature of 10 7 c and january has a minimum temperature of 4 6 c the mean air temperature observed for all three awss follows the same annual cycle with an average temperature of 3 8 c while the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures within the basin were 9 0 and 0 8 c respectively table 5 a box and whisker plots reflect monthly statistics mean maximum minimum quartile 1 and quartile 3 fig 9 that shows all three stations experience relatively low temperature tmin tmax tmean changes during the ism june september and considerable variability during the winter season november april the annual temperature range for tmax varies from 6 8 to 18 6 c 0 5 to 12 5 c and 2 to 11 6 c while for tmin it varies from 1 6 to 12 4 c 10 2 to 7 6 c and 11 8 to 5 4 c for rc bc and abc respectively similarly the annual range for tmean varies from 1 1 to 14 8 c 6 3 to 9 8 c and 8 8 to 7 6 c for rc bc and abc respectively the mean range of tmin tmax tmean for all three stations can be seen from table 5 a the mean wind speed at rc bc and abc were observed to be 7 4 9 4 and 5 2 km h 1 respectively while the maximum mean monthly wind speed was 9 5 12 2 and 6 8 km h 1 respectively table 5b similarly the minimum mean monthly wind speed observed was 5 6 5 9 and 3 6 km h 1 at rc bc and abc respectively the monthly statistics of wind speed suggest that the maximum wind occurred at bc followed by rc and abc fig 10 also the mean wind speed was found to be low during the summer season june september as compared to the winters 4 3 establishment of temperature gradients in the basin the completed daily time series for each station were further utilized to compute the monthly seasonal and annual gradients dt dz between mean air temperature tmin tmax and tmean and respective elevation for each station table 3 the results show that the vertical temperature gradient for the whole basin based on the mean annual air temperature is linear decreasing linearly with increasing elevation the annual mean lapse rate of tmin tmax and tmean were 6 1 5 3 and 6 0 c km 1 respectively table 6 the tlr for each month varied with different extents throughout the year fig 11 a it is observed that the mean monthly tlr for three stations ranges from 4 6 to 7 1 4 4 to 6 0 and 4 8 to 6 7 c for tmin tmax and tmean respectively table 6 the mean values of tlr for the snowmelt season june september were computed to be 5 0 4 7 and 5 1 c km 1 for tmin tmax and tmean respectively fig 11a the seasonal cycle for the study period 2012 2014 shows that tlr of tmax is lower than the tlr for tmin table 6 as the annual range of tmin is larger than that for tmax for all three stations table 5 studies representing the prevailing weather conditions over glacierized basins during the ablation season also indicate that the variability coefficient of variation cv for tmin is higher as compared to tmax srivastava et al 2014 while the variability in tmean and other meteorological parameters is given by singh et al 2005 2007 kumar et al 2014 and shea et al 2015 at different altitudes we also observed that monthly tlr values begin to reduce in may and are drastically lower during the ism june september as compared to the mean annual tlr during july and august the tlr is approximately constant for tmin tmax and tmean fig 11a table 6 such variations in tlr for june to september can be expected because of rain and cloud cover in the area singh 1991 i e the persistent cloud cover during the ism leads to lowering of the diurnal temperature range dtr for tmin tmax and tmean fig 9 also the tlr for maximum temperature has a bimodal distribution with two peaks in may and november this could be due to the fact that may is the beginning of the summer season and the temperature is high with clear sky conditions as the westerlies have retreated and the ism has not yet set in while in november we again find clear sky conditions as the ism has completely retreated and the westerlies have not completely penetrated into the region thus the dtr is high for the months of may and november fig 9 4 4 reconstruction of elevation responsible for melt runoff generation using isotherms the extent of snow cover in the basin reaches its highest elevation in july and august for the critical temperature isotherms 0 1 and 2 c and then begins to move downwards fig 11b the 0 1 and 2 c isotherms during the peak ablation season average for july august were at 5389 5237 and 5086 m respectively therefore validating that precipitation occurs as rain or rain on snow up to the elevation zone iv during the ism the area of the basin above this highest transient snowline or the highest critical temperature isotherm is considered to be the zone of equilibrium line altitude ela where snow cover remains persistent throughout the year thus the ela for chorabari glacier could lie in the elevation zone iv with 0 1 and 2 c isotherms at 5425 5274 and 5122 m respectively at the end of september fig 12 similarly studies consider satellite derived lst as an input parameter in runoff models in the absence of in situ data to understand the spatial distribution of the thermal state of the land surface chen et al 2017 han et al 2019 therefore 0 c isotherms using lst from landsat images were derived for comparison the 0 c isotherms established using the lst for 16th may 23rd october and 10th december 2014 are at an elevation of 4306 4874 and 4162 m respectively fig s6 however the results have large variations 300 500 m between them which could be attributed to the fact that the 0 c isotherms from lst of a particular day and time would not represent the monthly conditions i e if we take daily lst and derive a mean monthly lst for computing the 0 c isotherms this may be comparable to isotherms established using in situ mean air temperature 5 discussion monitoring snow cover variability in space and time is essential for understanding the snowmelt processes and crucial for the development of spatially distributed runoff simulation models and future scenarios the topography of the region is an essential parameter in the distribution of snow singh et al 1995 the snowline movement also provides information on the extent of snow cover the persistence of snow in the basin and its depletion with time the seasonal and annual variability in the sca and snowline controls the microclimatic conditions of the region which is crucial for the sustainability of the ecosystem and environment in the basin singh et al 2003 mountainous areas have their microclimatic system despite the influence of large scale weather systems like the ism and westerlies several studies in the himalayan region have suggested that altitude aspect and slope are the critical factors in controlling the weather systems and microclimatic conditions singh et al 2003 jain et al 2009 gurung et al 2017 further the snow depletion curve sdc for chorabari glacier depicts that snow remains for a longer time at higher elevations kumar et al 2018a for comparison the elevation wise snow depletion pattern for the chenab basin in the western himalaya illustrates that the trend of depletion is similar to that of the present study i e the least sca is observed in july and august the snowline for the western himalaya during july and august lies in the elevation zone of 3600 4300 m kour et al 2016 while in central himalaya the snowline was observed at 5000 5500 m for the same period this reflects that the inter basin variations in depletion of sca are controlled by the geographical location latitude and distribution of winter precipitation westerlies the western himalaya receives a much higher amount of winter precipitation snowfall as compared to the central himalaya which is dominated by the summer precipitation rainfall the lower elevation of snowline in the western himalaya also indicates better health of the glaciers as compared to central himalaya in terms of nourishment accumulation of snow the variation in distribution or redistribution of snow may occur due to gravity wind or avalanche induced preferential deposition of snow during winter when the basin is totally covered with snow and the wind speed is high the preferential deposition does not affect the extent of sca though it may influence the snow depth freudiger et al 2017 as the temperature starts increasing from april peripheral snow melting at lower elevations starts to occur but due to heavy moisture content it restricts the wind driven distribution in our study area the avalanches are confined to the higher reaches accumulation zone and do not affect the extent of sca in the ablation zone this is evident in fig s4 where we can see that the sca is continuously depleting from april and a slight increase in a few years is observed during may which is due to snowfall events in the basin however statistical modelling for snow depth or snow water equivalent swe could not be incorporated in the present study but would be beneficial for future attempts in association with improved topographical information high resolution dem and ground based information of snow depth and other meteorological data like solar radiation incoming and outgoing for this region the sca above the elevation zone iv was found to be persistent throughout the season suggesting that the ela of chorabari glacier lies within this zone fig 6 and fig 11 this corroborates with the study by dobhal et al 2013 specifying that the ela for chorabari glacier is at an elevation of 5070 m therefore in the absence of field based mass balance observations monitoring of variability in sca can be useful for identifying demarcating the ela of a glacier this information can be further improved by classifying the elevation zones at a scale of 100 m or better with the help of high resolution dem to further understand the temperature variability the tlrs assessed in the present study were compared to the standard vertical mean temperature gradient the annual mean tlr 6 0 c is lower than the generally used value of 6 5 c km 1 singh 1991 wang et al 2017 generally a single tlr value is used to interpolate temperature data for the whole basin which in most cases are not homogenous besides these temperature stations in many instances are placed at lower altitudes in the basin and may not be representative for the entire altitudinal distribution further studies show that there are significant variations in the distribution of tlr on the northern and southern slopes of himalaya kattel et al 2013 2015 guo et al 2016 wang et al 2017 thayyen and dimri 2018 however most of the studies provide seasonal tlrs and few studies report the monthly tlrs thus we have compared our study with other studies in himalaya which have accessed tlrs on a monthly scale fig 11c the bimodal distribution of tlr similar to our study has been reported from other parts of the himalaya e g nepal qinling mountains in china upper ganga basin in the central himalaya and sutlej and beas basins in the western himalaya which have similar climatic conditions fig 11c further it is also observed that the tlr during the ism july september is almost constant in eastern and central himalaya fig 11c while tlrs for western himalaya show considerable deviations this is due to the impact and magnitude of the ism over the eastern and central himalaya during this period the ela based on ground observations and temperature isotherms is above 5000 m therefore precipitation during the ism occurs as rainfall up to the elevation zone iv 5000 5500 m while it may occur as snowfall above this elevation however during may and october few events of solid precipitation were observed which result in bringing the extent of snow cover to lower elevations for a few days fig s4 these events are generally related to the westerlies or sometimes local recycling of moisture in the region kumar et al 2018a verma et al 2018 furthermore a significant reduction in sca was observed during the early ablation period may june which led to a rise in meltwater discharge kumar et al 2016 2018b indicating the availability of meltwater discharge for various socio economic applications is highly dependent on the seasonal distribution of snow cover in the region further it is important to highlight the fact that the study area is a very small glacierized basin 15 km2 therefore to interpolate remotely sensed data lst swe sca etc available at a coarse resolution e g modis 250 m would lead to large uncertainty in the results another important factor is that a large cloud cover persists over the study area during the ism which would lead to further uncertainty in the estimation of lst therefore we cannot consider lst as a proxy for the present study understanding hydrological processes and hydrological changes in ungauged himalayan basins provides important insights into future water availability for downstream regions furthermore the contribution of melt runoff varies significantly among basins adding even more complexity to hydrological responses to climate change therefore modelling and predicting the runoff from ungauged basins is a big challenge which can be addressed by calibrating a hydrological model for a gauged basin using observed data and then applying the model to the ungauged basin by transferring the model parameters merz and blöschl 2004 sivapalan 2003 arora et al 2005 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 6 concluding remarks the proper understanding of the spatial distribution of air temperature within the basin requires at least a few operational awss located at different elevation zones this will help to reduce the data gaps in high altitude regions for future studies the statistics and methods used for filling the data gaps and validation of the data from one meteorological station aws to the other can be applied to other studies in data scarce regions the inter basin variations in depletion of sca are controlled by the geographical location latitude topography elevation aspect and slope and distribution pattern of winter precipitation in the ihr the broader understanding of snow cover dynamics and its relationship with climatic variables provides an opportunity for parameterization calibration of melt runoff models over ungauged himalayan basins the annual temperature lapse rates tlrs for the tmin tmax and tmean are significantly lower than the standard adiabatic or environmental lapse rate 6 5 c km 1 therefore we recommend the use of observed or measured tlr for applications in hydrological modelling glacier mass balance estimations and other related studies in the mountainous basins monthly critical temperature isotherms were established for evaluating the snowmelt contributing area within the basin these isotherms could help in demarcating the ela for mass balance estimations it can also be utilized for melt runoff computations and assessment of changes in sca under the global climate change scenarios the information generated in this study is important for policymakers in the ungauged himalayan basins for assessment of melt runoff contribution to the total streamflow and improve the runoff forecasting credit

5542,seasonal flow transitions between wet and dry conditions are a primary control on river conditions including biogeochemical processes and aquatic life history strategies in regions like california with highly seasonal flow patterns and immense interannual variability a rigorous approach is needed to accurately identify and quantify seasonal flow transitions from the annual flow regime drawing on signal processing theory this study develops a transferable approach to detect the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series using an iterative smoothing feature detection and windowing methodology the approach is shown to accurately identify and characterize seasonal flows across highly variable natural flow regimes in california a quantitative error assessment validated the accuracy of the approach finding that inaccuracies in seasonal timing identification did not exceed 10 with infrequent exceptions results for seasonal timing were also used to highlight the statistically distinct timing found across streams with varying climatic drivers in california the proposed approach improves understanding of spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and informs environmental water management efforts by delineating timing of seasonal flows keywords streamflow hydrology environmental flows time series analysis california 1 introduction streams and rivers in semi arid mediterranean climates are physically chemically and biologically driven by predictable seasonal periods of wet and dry conditions over an annual cycle gasith and resh 1999 seasonal flow regimes support predictable river processes such as disturbance regimes rood et al 2005 seasonal habitat provision aadland 1993 booker and acreman 2007 jacobson 2013 and native species life history cues yarnell et al 2010 while streamflow characteristics including magnitude duration frequency and rate of change are useful for describing components of the flow regime poff et al 1997 the timing of seasonal flow transitions within the annual flow regime is particularly important for understanding seasonally adapted ecological processes such as migration spawning or vegetation recruitment cambray 1991 greet et al 2011 poff and zimmerman 2010 it is critical to identify these distinct wet and dry conditions and when they occur across different flow regimes to improve understanding of physical climate and watershed controls on these seasonal transitions and their sensitivity to change numerical descriptors of the flow regime known as flow metrics are routinely quantified from daily streamflow time series to link streamflow patterns to river processes buttle 2011 poff and ward 1989 and biological response mazor et al 2017 olden and poff 2003 existing flow metrics used to identify and quantify the timing of seasonal flow transitions are limited especially across large regions and in hydrologically variable settings these measurements of timing are often simplified by calculating flow metrics within predetermined timing windows instead of identifying the occurrence of seasonal transitions and key events based on annual flow patterns the hydroecological integrity assessment process henriksen et al 2006 and the indicators of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1996 incorporate timing through calculations such as monthly average flows or the date of annual minimum and maximum flow however in variable flow regimes such as flashy rain sourced streams the timing of seasonal flow transitions varies significantly between water years and hydroclimatic settings lane et al 2018 this wide inter annual variability suggests that metrics describing a particular aspect of seasonal flow such as dry season flow magnitude cannot be accurately quantified based on the same months in each water year calculation of the annual maximum or minimum similarly may oversimplify understanding of seasonal flow components because these calculations do not account for annual or seasonal patterns of flow or events other than the most extreme conditions déry et al 2009 to better quantify flow regimes based on variable seasonal patterns signal processing techniques can be used to identify sub annual hydrologic patterns from daily flow time series signal processing theory provides well established techniques such as data smoothing peak detection and time windowing that have been applied in hydrology kusche et al 2009 mann 2004 and can be used to detect features from a time series of daily streamflow data time series smoothing is used to enhance certain frequencies i e the signal while attenuating others i e the noise and many smoothing techniques are available such as moving average exponential moving average empirical mode decomposition regression smoothing e g loess cleaveland and loader 1996 wavelet and splines janert 2010 smoothing functions generate fitted curves to time series data that emphasize different frequency signals depending on the function and level of smoothing pollock 1999 feature detection is used to extract peaks or valleys of interest from the smoothed data and can depend on attributes such as magnitude or slope schneider 2011 scholkmann et al 2012 dynamic windowing around a detected feature constrains further analysis to a particular period of interest and allows for increased resolution of subsequent analysis palshikar 2009 in previous work signal processing techniques have been applied to hydrologic time series for applications such as detecting long term trends letcher et al 2001 modeling hydrologic processes zhang et al 2016 and predicting future trends adamowski and sun 2010 cannas et al 2006 common techniques such as harmonic analysis using fourier or wavelet transform methods can be effective in analyzing hydrologic time series characteristics such as periodicity trends coherence and cross phase among deriving and response variables or complexity determined by wavelet entropy pasternack and hinnov 2003 sang 2013 additionally many techniques have been developed to identify baseflow recession hall 1968 recent attempts include identifying a consecutive number of days of negative slope in the hydrograph bart and hope 2014 combining requirements of negative slope with a percentile based magnitude threshold sawaske and freyberg 2014 or automatic identification of recession curves based on parameters balancing accuracy and coverage smith and schwartz 2017 while some methods share similarities with components of the proposed method to the authors knowledge there has not yet been a method developed to automatically isolate and quantify all major seasonal flow transitions from annual streamflow time series to identify ecologically significant flow transitions from the annual hydrograph this study applied signal processing methods to identify functional flows found in the highly seasonal mediterranean streams of california usa functional flows refer to sub annual aspects of the flow regime that support key ecological geomorphic or biogeochemical processes in riverine systems escobar arias and pasternack 2010 yarnell et al 2015 yarnell et al 2015 aggregated flow ecology literature to identify four functional flow components relevant to mediterranean streams with a distinct wet and dry season wet season initiation flows peak magnitude flows spring recession flows and dry season low flows building on those efforts and more recent work highlighting key functional flows specific to california yarnell et al 2020 this study identifies the timing of four functional flow components applicable to california s natural streamflow regimes fall pulse flow wet season flow encompassing both wet season baseflow and peak flow conditions spring recession and dry season baseflow fig 1 once the timings of functional flow transitions are identified from the annual hydrograph each functional flow component can be further quantified using additional flow metrics such as magnitude timing frequency duration or rate of change and can be used to design functional flow regimes in managed river systems yarnell et al 2020 drawing on signal processing theory this study develops an algorithm in the open source python programming language to calculate the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily flow time series allowing for improved characterization of seasonal flows this research addresses the following questions 1 is it possible to automatically identify timing of seasonal streamflow components from annual hydrographs and if so what is the level of error and 2 does the timing of seasonal flow components calculated through this study reveal distinctions among streams with varying climatic drivers using data from the highly seasonal streams of california as a testbed this study assesses the accuracy and limitations of the algorithm for quantifying functional flows across a wide range of natural flow regimes and climate conditions including flow regimes exhibiting snowmelt rain or mixed rain and snowmelt signatures to further achieve confidence in the results algorithm outputs are analyzed in the context of california hydrology and tested for the extent that results align with expectations for regional hydrologic regimes 2 methods the study design describes development calibration and performance assessment of the algorithm for detecting the timing of functional flow transitions from daily streamflow time series with algorithm steps summarized in fig 4 2 1 study region california has a mediterranean climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons as well as high interannual variability and spatial heterogeneity dettinger et al 2011 liu et al 2018 much of this variability stems from california s wide latitudinal extent 800 km and physiographic diversity with multiple mountain ranges and valleys of different sizes shapes and relief abatzoglou et al 2009 ladochy et al 2007 california rainfall is characterized by the capability of a limited number of high intensity storm events to contribute to the majority of annual precipitation dettinger et al 2011 found that 20 50 of california s long term rainfall average derives from these high precipitation storm events california s rivers and streams reflect the state s climatic and physiographic diversity ranging from small intermittent streams in the southwest deserts to larger snowmelt fed rivers draining the western slopes of the sierra nevada mountain range lane et al 2018 mount 1995 for this study nine natural hydrologic classes previously identified for california by lane et al 2018 were aggregated into three dominant stream types recognized throughout the state mount 1995 snowmelt rainfall and mixed snowmelt and rain sourced streams fig 2 snowmelt sourced flow regimes are largely controlled by the timing and rate of snowmelt which are driven by seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature rain sourced flow regimes are controlled by the intensity of winter rainfall and characteristics of individual storm events mixed source streams experience both rain driven flows in the winter and a snowmelt pulse in the spring or they occur in large drainages that receive both snowmelt and rainfall contributions from upstream 2 2 data streamflow data used for this analysis come from 223 gage stations with unimpaired or naturalized daily streamflow records in california refer to kennard et al 2010 for definitions of unimpaired and naturalized streamflow fig 2 unimpaired gage data was sourced from the dataset compiled by zimmerman et al 2017 who followed a 3 step protocol to obtain unimpaired daily streamflow their process designated gage stations as unimpaired based on 1 designation as a least disturbed site from a u s geological survey database of watershed attributes falcone et al 2010 2 status of unimpairment based on annual gage station reports and appearance of natural conditions from satellite imagery and 3 historical flow records that pre date anthropogenic disturbance such as dams and urbanization seven gages with simulated unimpaired i e naturalized daily streamflow data were also added to the dataset to cover the central valley region of california cdwr 2007 which was otherwise poorly represented by unimpaired gage stations a final screening of the annual hydrographs of the resulting dataset was performed and several gages were removed from the analysis that had flow patterns appearing irregular impaired or too low to exhibit seasonal patterns the resulting dataset of 223 reference gages includes periods of record as early as 1891 and as recent as 2015 with an average period of record of 34 years and a range of 6 to 65 years 2 3 seasonal flow detection algorithm development the following sections provide the theory and rationale for the seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda explain the signal processing methods applied and describe individual calculation steps additional description of signal processing methods is described in the supplemental materials 2 3 1 data smoothing data smoothing is a type of filtering in which low frequency components are retained while high frequency components are attenuated enabling detection of features of interest at different frequencies or time scales press and teukolsky 1990 common finite difference smoothing techniques include simple running averages weighted moving averages and exponential filters janert 2010 in this study a gaussian weighted moving average filter was used to generate a smoothed time series using the function gaussian filter1d from the scipy image processing package verveer 2003 in python this smoothing method was selected for its ability to retain local maxima in the output function while avoiding abrupt distortions in the filtered data the gaussian filter sets the weighting factors of the smoothing window wj according to a gaussian normal distribution 1 f x σ 1 2 π σ 2 e x p 1 2 x σ 2 such that any new streamflow observation that enters the smoothing window is only gradually added to the moving average and then gradually removed the standard deviation of the gaussian function σ dictates the width of the distribution and consequently the degree of smoothing applied in this study low and high levels of streamflow data smoothing were associated with σ 5 and σ 8 respectively for example a daily streamflow time series smoothed with a high standard deviation gaussian filter σ 12 fig 3 will dampen daily to weekly hydrologic variability while preserving major seasonal patterns alternatively a low standard deviation gaussian filter σ 4 fig 3 will preserve storm events occurring on weekly scales high levels of smoothing are often applied first in the algorithm to identify coarse resolution temporal patterns such as the distinction between the annual wet and dry season while removing the signal noise caused by individual storm events increasingly lower levels of smoothing are then applied to identify hydrologic features on finer temporal scales 2 3 2 splines splines are functions constructed from segments of polynomials between each time series observation that are constrained to be smooth at the junctions letcher et al 2001 splines which are used in the sfda for derivative estimation of smoothed streamflow have been shown to generate nearly optimal derivative estimates of noisy data such as streamflow time series due to low interpolation error craven and wahba 1979 ragozin 1983 thomas et al 2015 the sfda employs a cubic spline function three degrees of freedom for derivative estimates which is generally considered an optimal interpolation function for large time series carter and signorino 2010 kimball 1976 wahba 1978 for further explanation on spline fitting refer to hastie and tibshirani 1990 in this study derivative estimation using a cubic spline was performed on smoothed and windowed streamflow time series using the one dimensional univariate spline fitting function available from the scipy library in python jones et al 2001 2 4 seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda general steps the sfda consists of six general steps used to detect seasonal flow transitions although some applications may require either a subset of these steps or multiple iterations fig 4 steps are applied to each water year in a dataset which in california is defined as october 1 to september 30 step 1 fig 4a a high standard deviation gaussian filter g1 is applied to the observed daily streamflow time series to detect dominant peaks valleys or trends in the annual hydrograph depending on the level of smoothing different frequency patterns e g seasonal sub seasonal are attenuated or left intact step 2 fig 4b a hydrologic feature of interest is identified from g1 such as annual peak flow step 3 fig 4b a localized search window is set around the feature of interest to constrain subsequent analysis to a hydrologically relevant period e g 30 days before and after the feature of interest step 4 fig 4c within the search window a low standard deviation gaussian filter g2 is applied to the observed daily time series to extract high resolution hydrologic patterns e g individual storm events step 5 fig 4d a spline curve is fitted to smoothed data g2 and the derivative is taken to identify the slope of the hydrograph s1 step 6 fig 4d a feature of interest is characterized in one of two ways i directly from g2 using relevant flow characteristics i e magnitude or ii using the derivative of the spline curve s1 to detect peaks or valleys of interest based on slope or sign change triangles represent peak features of interest and the black diamond is the final selected feature the sfda steps are iterative and can be repeated multiple times to consistently and accurately identify flow transitions across water years and stream types for example the calculation of spring recession requires three iterations of smoothing and feature detection while the calculation for dry season start timing only requires one iteration the parameter values e g smoothing parameter σ window size or magnitude thresholds can be adjusted to suit the needs of particular flow regimes or hydrologic features of interest for example in flashy rain driven streams the start of the dry season is generally indicated by the last significant storm event of the water year which can be found using a low standard deviation gaussian filter that closely fits daily streamflow data meanwhile the start of the dry season in a snowmelt driven stream may be better identified by the general trend of flow reduction representing catchment drainage which is best represented with a high standard deviation gaussian filter to capture broader trends to contextualize the parameterization process the algorithm for the dry season start timing may be considered the dry season start timing is identified in the receding limb of the annual hydrograph through a combination of relative magnitude and slope which are determined by parameterization the start timing will be identified later in the water year for example if the relative magnitude threshold is reduced requiring lower magnitude or if the slope threshold is reduced requiring a flatter slope essentially creating more stringent hydrologic requirements further the degree of smoothing applied to raw daily streamflow dampens fluctuations in flow and can allow a stabilized slope to be detected earlier in the water year as the level of smoothing is increased the combinations of parameters for each algorithm were determined by expert opinion of the co authors to best achieve timing of the functional flows illustrated conceptually in fig 1 across a diversity of hydrologic inputs and this parameterization is available as default values in the sfda code 2 5 application of the sfda to functional flows in california four distinct applications of the sfda were used to calculate the timing of functional flow component transitions based on reference condition california streamflow gages fig 2 in these applications the sfda steps were repeated up to three times to accurately identify functional flow transitions across the variety of stream types found in california the parameter values e g smoothing parameter σ or window size were determined heuristically by the co authors for each functional flow component to achieve timing results aligning with the conceptual timing of functional flow transitions illustrated in fig 1 and described in yarnell et al 2020 in the calibration process parameters for each functional flow identification algorithm were empirically and incrementally adjusted to achieve hydrologically meaningful results for example the parameters for spring recession start timing smoothing parameter σ window sizes and magnitude thresholds were adjusted so that the timing would occur after wet season high flows but before flows had receded to baseflow conditions supplemental materials and associated online resources provide more information about the calculation of each functional flow timing metric how to download the sfda code and how to modify algorithm parameters to achieve desired results to demonstrate sfda application to a specific functional flow component the calculation of wet season start timing is described in section 2 5 1 the timing metrics from the sfda can be used to calculate additional functional flow metrics describing the magnitude duration frequency and rate of change of flow within each functional flow component e g baseflow magnitude or duration of the dry season yarnell et al 2020 the full suite of sfda based functional flow metrics can be visualized and downloaded at eflows ucdavis edu a website developed to view and interact with california s natural hydrology 2 5 1 functional flow calculation for wet season start timing wet season start timing delineates the portion of the water year during which streams receive the greatest inputs from storm runoff or snowmelt and flows are elevated above dry season baseflow levels yarnell et al 2020 the calculation for wet season start timing is presented as an example of the sfda application to california functional flows this calculation uses one iteration of the sfda steps fig 5 within each water year a high standard deviation gaussian filter g1 σ 10 is applied fig 5 step 1 to detect the water year s global peak p1 and preceding global valley v1 fig 5 step 2 a relative magnitude threshold m1 is then set based on the magnitude of p1 and v1 as an upper limit m1 γ p1 v1 where γ 0 2 to ensure that the wet season start timing is not set after flows have already increased during the water year fig 5 step 3 a spline curve is fit to g1 so that its derivative can be used as a hydrologic requirement in the final feature detection step finally searching backwards in time from p1 the date that discharge first falls below m1 and below a rate of change equaling δ p1 where δ 0 002 is selected as the wet season start timing fig 5 step 4 the values for γ and δ were adjusted for california reference streamflow based on the co authors expert opinions to achieve identification of the functional flows described conceptually in fig 1 and yarnell et al 2020 2 6 performance assessment the calibrated sfda was evaluated based on its ability to accurately determine the timing of functional flow transitions across all years in the california unimpaired streamflow dataset the analyzed results consist of four flow timing metrics calculated annually for each gage 6 65 years per gage performance assessment included 1 a comparison of results across stream types 2 visual inspection of results and 3 calculation of assessment indices to quantify issues in algorithm performance 2 6 1 comparison of functional flow timing results across stream types results were grouped by stream type rain snowmelt or mixed rain and snowmelt sourced and visualized with violin plots which use a rotated kernel density plot to depict the distribution of results distinct letters above the violin plots denote groups with statistically distinct mean values based on tukey s honestly significant difference statistical test with a confidence level of 95 abdi and williams 2010 groups with no statistical difference share the same letter above the violin plot results were interpreted according to the co authors expert knowledge of california streamflow hydrology and supported where possible with relevant region specific literature 2 6 2 visual performance assessment visual inspection of functional flow timing results was performed as a preliminary step to inform quantitative inspection section 2 6 3 the four annual flow timing metrics were reviewed for each water year in the dataset n 7475 years yielding 29 900 visual inspections accuracy was visually assessed based on the authors knowledge of california seasonal flow components and when they were expected to occur across a range of water year types results that appeared incorrect were tabulated grouped according to functional flow component and stream type and reviewed by multiple experts in california hydrology from the co author team to ensure consistency after performing the 29 900 visual inspections of the four timing metrics issues were characterized based on the bias in timing e g early or late timing and the stream type in which it occurred 2 6 3 quantitative analysis with assessment indices the purpose of this analysis was to quantify issues in algorithm performance observed during visual assessment the issues characterized during visual assessment were quantified using programmed rules defined to identify occurrence of each issue across the dataset for example one rule identified years in rain sourced streams in which dry season start timing was set after august 1 this was based on repeated observation that flow magnitude and slope generally decrease to baseflow levels in this stream type before august 1 and dry season start timing set after august 1 was usually inaccurate the developed rules were quantified across relevant stream types and resulting values were termed assessment indices many of the assessment indices attempt to quantify cases in which functional flow timing was either earlier or later than expected for a given water year and these issues with timing were often stream type specific for example seasonal timing metrics tend to occur later in the water year for snowmelt sourced streams than rain sourced streams so a dry season timing metric of march 1 could be considered anomalously early in snowmelt streams but normal in rain streams early or late occurrence was defined either through an empirical evidence based cut off point such as aug 1 or if possible through a relative hydrologic relationship such as the number of high flow events that occur before or after a particular timing metric is set other assessment indices quantify water year features that make characterization with the sfda difficult such as dry water years in which only one or two peak flow events occur table 1 lists performance assessment indices used to quantify issues in algorithm timing calculations based on final results from the sfda 3 results and discussion the sfda was found to consistently identify functional flow components across a wide range of hydrologic input data enabling quantitative differentiation across stream types based on the timing of seasonal functional flows example sfda timing results are presented in fig 6 for individual water years spanning a range of stream types rain mixed and snowmelt sourced streams and water year types dry moderate and wet years across a variety of watersheds illustrating the ability of the sfda to capture the timing of functional flow transitions in california across a diversity of hydrologic regimes 3 1 comparison of results across stream types 3 1 1 fall pulse flow timing the timing of the fall pulse flow marks the first peak flow of the water year when magnitude surpasses baseflow in a distinct pulse unlike the other functional flow components the fall pulse flow is constrained to only occur during a subset time of the water year oct 1 dec 15 when hydrologic requirements for relative magnitude and duration are met and it does not necessarily occur in each water year a fall pulse flow was identified in 60 65 of water years across all stream types although there were significant differences in event timing p 0 05 between snowmelt streams and other stream types wide overlap exists across all stream types fig 7 a this is due in part to large scale temperature and precipitation patterns that affect california streamflow early in the water year oct nov temperatures across the state including the sierra nevada mountains are often above freezing causing precipitation to fall as rain or rapidly melting snow lundquist et al 2008 serreze et al 1999 additionally atmospheric river events can cause correlated streamflow patterns across much of the state cayan and peterson 1989 which are most pronounced when all precipitation is falling as rain therefore a high degree of similarity is expected in the timing of fall pulse flows across all stream types further reason for the limited distinction among stream classes stems from the algorithm itself which detects events over a narrow search window of 75 days oct 1 dec 15 considered ecologically significant for california streams yarnell et al 2015 the upper and lower bounds of the violin plots span nearly the entire available time window of 75 days fig 7a indicating that fall pulse flow varies widely across all stream types these results broadly align with ahearn et al 2004 who state that the season of flushing flows in california typically begins in november 3 1 2 wet season start timing wet season start timing is the date that the water year begins to experience consistently elevated flows from either rainfall or snowmelt yarnell et al 2020 the differences in these values were statistically significant p 0 05 across the three stream types fig 7b the timing occurred three to four months later in snowmelt sourced streams average mar 4 than rain sourced streams average dec 12 and timing from mixed source streams occurred across a wide range of values whose mean dec 30 closely resembles rain sourced streams these differences were expected due to differing geographic and climatic drivers of wet season flow across california in rain sourced streams the timing of wet season flow closely reflects patterns of winter precipitation which occurs primarily during the winter months dec feb although these peak flows also experience high interannual variability in timing cayan and peterson 1989 dettinger 2011 in high elevation snowmelt sourced streams peak flows are initiated by the snowmelt pulse as air temperatures warm enough to melt snowpack in the spring in mixed source streams wet season start timing may be cued by either winter storms or a snowmelt pulse resulting in a wide range of possible values driven either by precipitation timing or temperature driven snowmelt fig 8 the proportion of streamflow driven by rain versus snow is an important consideration in mid and high elevation basins as runoff is expected to shift towards more rain driven flow with warming climate in the western united states hamlet et al 2005 stewart et al 2015 sultana and choi 2018 3 1 3 spring recession start timing the spring recession represents the seasonal transition from wet season high flows to dry season low flows the spring recession start timing is statistically distinct p 0 05 across the three california stream types with timing occurring progressively later in the water year from rain sourced to snowmelt sourced streams fig 7c this distinction in timing is expected due to climatic influences on hydrology that shift as streams progress from lower to higher elevations and snowpack provides increasing amounts of storage that delay streamflow response to precipitation aguado et al 1992 in california s highest elevations above 2300 m the spring recession is cued by a distinct temperature driven snowmelt pulse as the snowmelt influence diminishes and warming occurs earlier in lower elevation mixed source streams fig 2 the snowmelt pulse may arrive earlier or may not occur at all in dry years with very little snowpack relative to rainfall in rain sourced streams the spring recession is expected to occur after the last rain storm of the wet season which tends to occur several months earlier in the year than the snowmelt pulse on average the distribution of spring recession start timings in snowmelt sourced streams is relatively narrow with the majority of start dates occurring between may 23 and july 6 average june 6 indicating predictable recession timing in snowmelt streams regardless of water year type yarnell et al 2010 the most variability in spring recession start timing occurs in mixed source streams which due to their occurrence at mid elevation regions are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and snowpack lundquist et al 2004 stewart 2008 fig 8 demonstrates how a greater snowmelt pulse is associated with later spring recession timing occurring 31 days later in water year 1952 than in 1970 this finding aligns with other research on streamflow in the western us that has indicated both temperature and annual flow volume are significant drivers of spring snowmelt runoff timing aguado et al 1992 kormos et al 2016 adding to this variability snowmelt receiving streams in mid elevation regions of california have been subject to significant changes in the timing of snowmelt recession peaks due to climate warming stewart 2008 hamlet et al 2005 for example estimated peak accumulation of snowmelt runoff in mid elevation areas of california as occurring 15 45 days earlier throughout the last century which adds additional variation to the spring recession start timing results in mixed snowmelt and rain regimes although rain sourced streams also exhibit high variability in spring recession timing the average spring recession start timing across rain sourced streams april 7 broadly aligns with the generally accepted end of the rainy season for california liu et al 2018 3 1 4 dry season baseflow start timing the start timing of the dry season marks the beginning of the low flow low variability portion of the water year in which the rate of recession flows has stabilized and magnitudes reach baseflow level similar to spring recession start timing dry season start timing is statistically distinct among the three stream types p 0 05 and occurs gradually later on average from rain sourced june 6 to mixed source july 16 to snowmelt sourced streams august 7 fig 7d the timing distribution ranges more than 100 days in rain sourced streams which is consistent with the high inter annual variability of precipitation magnitude and timing and consequently streamflow exhibited in california dettinger et al 2011 despite high variability across rain sourced streams the average dry season start timing in these streams is surprisingly consistent from small to large streams for instance the average dry season start timing is june 8 in larger north coast streams average annual flow 23 cms and is similar in flashy ephemeral streams average annual flow 0 5 cms with an average start timing of may 27 from lane et al 2017 however interannual variability in dry season start timing within a single stream can be high suggesting that central tendencies do not represent dry season timing conditions well in rain sourced streams 3 2 performance assessment indices assessment indices were created to quantify the accuracy of the sfda for identifying the timing of functional flow transitions in california reference streamflow assessment indices are presented in table 1 and the following section highlights key issues and limitations for each functional flow the frequency of most identified issues was less than 10 except for snow early wet and mixed early spring which are explained in table 1 and below the methods presented here to identify hydrologic features and determine error differ from previous hydrologic studies which can often take advantage of validated training sets to determine accuracy cannas et al 2006 letcher et al 2001 smith and schwartz 2017 the heuristic methods used in this research are similar to other approaches that require some subjectivity for parameterization of peak detection palshikar 2009 and qualitative visual assessment methods are similar to approaches used to validate climate patterns in climate modeling studies that pair qualitative and quantitative model assessment gyalistras et al 1994 paul and hsu 2012 performance assessment based on validation of known hydrologic conditions employed in this study is similar to the approach of déry et al 2009 who assessed a new method of spring recession identification across different river types in their study region the proposed methods although subjective in the choice of parametrization present a consistent and repeatable way to identify functional flow components advancing previous methods of quantifying seasonal streamflow patterns 3 2 1 issues in sfda performance fig 9 presents common issues in the sfda for each functional flow component which were often attributed to uncommon hydrologic patterns or effects from smoothing filters that occasionally have the undesired effect of over dampening storm peaks while detecting broad hydrologic trends in some water years the first day of the water year oct 1 was identified as the date of the fall pulse flow which presents ambiguity as to whether the first day of the water year is an actual peak event or is instead part of a continual decline from a peak in the previous water year fig 9a this situation occurs most often in naturalized gage data with a 3 5 occurrence rate across all naturalized water years and an average occurrence rate of 1 across the entire dataset table 1 index wsi day1 both mixed and rain sourced streams experienced some water years in which a single large high flow event dominated the annual hydrograph such that start timings of wet season and spring recession were based on the same peak flow fig 9b this occurred in 4 of mixed source streams and 4 of rain sourced streams table 1 indices mixed spring wet rain spring wet and could result in anomalous functional flow metrics based on these rare hydrologic conditions in mixed source streams early identification of spring recession start timing was found with a frequency of 21 table 1 index mixed early spring sometimes due to the effect of over dampening rainstorm peaks with smoothing filters when attempting to detect broad hydrologic trends fig 9c conversely spring recession start timing occurred late in 10 of snowmelt stream water years when the algorithm was triggered by small peaks along the recession limb instead of the main snowmelt pulse table 1 index snow early spring the algorithm for dry season start timing assesses the change in magnitude and slope along the recession limb so dry water years with very little change in these features are more likely to have issues with component detection this was often the case when dry season start timing was identified late in the water year fig 9d which occurred in 10 of rain sourced water years table 1 index rain late dry these issues are expected to improve when sfda parameters are calibrated for smaller regions of streamflow data instead of applying the same set of parameters across a wide array of input data as was done in this statewide case study 4 conclusions this study developed an objective signal processing algorithm to address the need for a robust method to characterize the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series the seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda improved on existing methods that rely on fixed time steps through the novel application of established signal processing techniques to identify the timing of seasonal flow transitions the application to california streams demonstrated the ability of this approach to identify the timing of functional flow components from unimpaired daily streamflow time series across a wide range of climatic and geographic settings and extreme seasonal and interannual hydrologic variability results highlight hydrologic distinctions among varying drivers of streamflow such as progressively later timing of spring recession flow as streams shift from rainfall sourced to snowmelt sourced flow regimes limitations of the approach were determined through a combination of visual expert based assessment and quantitative performance assessment in general the percentage error in timing calculations did not exceed 10 across relevant water years for any assessment index with infrequent exceptions in a parallel effort functional flow metrics produced by the sfda for california reference gages are being extrapolated to ungaged streams to inform statewide environmental flow recommendations likewise the sfda has potential to be applied to other regions or countries sharing highly seasonal climates similar to california by adjusting algorithm parameters to suit local hydrology for instance the sfda metrics could be applied to assess shifts in streamflow due to climate change with particular focus on potential changes in timing of seasonal flows the proposed approach supports improved understanding of high resolution spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and can inform environmental water

5542,seasonal flow transitions between wet and dry conditions are a primary control on river conditions including biogeochemical processes and aquatic life history strategies in regions like california with highly seasonal flow patterns and immense interannual variability a rigorous approach is needed to accurately identify and quantify seasonal flow transitions from the annual flow regime drawing on signal processing theory this study develops a transferable approach to detect the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series using an iterative smoothing feature detection and windowing methodology the approach is shown to accurately identify and characterize seasonal flows across highly variable natural flow regimes in california a quantitative error assessment validated the accuracy of the approach finding that inaccuracies in seasonal timing identification did not exceed 10 with infrequent exceptions results for seasonal timing were also used to highlight the statistically distinct timing found across streams with varying climatic drivers in california the proposed approach improves understanding of spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and informs environmental water management efforts by delineating timing of seasonal flows keywords streamflow hydrology environmental flows time series analysis california 1 introduction streams and rivers in semi arid mediterranean climates are physically chemically and biologically driven by predictable seasonal periods of wet and dry conditions over an annual cycle gasith and resh 1999 seasonal flow regimes support predictable river processes such as disturbance regimes rood et al 2005 seasonal habitat provision aadland 1993 booker and acreman 2007 jacobson 2013 and native species life history cues yarnell et al 2010 while streamflow characteristics including magnitude duration frequency and rate of change are useful for describing components of the flow regime poff et al 1997 the timing of seasonal flow transitions within the annual flow regime is particularly important for understanding seasonally adapted ecological processes such as migration spawning or vegetation recruitment cambray 1991 greet et al 2011 poff and zimmerman 2010 it is critical to identify these distinct wet and dry conditions and when they occur across different flow regimes to improve understanding of physical climate and watershed controls on these seasonal transitions and their sensitivity to change numerical descriptors of the flow regime known as flow metrics are routinely quantified from daily streamflow time series to link streamflow patterns to river processes buttle 2011 poff and ward 1989 and biological response mazor et al 2017 olden and poff 2003 existing flow metrics used to identify and quantify the timing of seasonal flow transitions are limited especially across large regions and in hydrologically variable settings these measurements of timing are often simplified by calculating flow metrics within predetermined timing windows instead of identifying the occurrence of seasonal transitions and key events based on annual flow patterns the hydroecological integrity assessment process henriksen et al 2006 and the indicators of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1996 incorporate timing through calculations such as monthly average flows or the date of annual minimum and maximum flow however in variable flow regimes such as flashy rain sourced streams the timing of seasonal flow transitions varies significantly between water years and hydroclimatic settings lane et al 2018 this wide inter annual variability suggests that metrics describing a particular aspect of seasonal flow such as dry season flow magnitude cannot be accurately quantified based on the same months in each water year calculation of the annual maximum or minimum similarly may oversimplify understanding of seasonal flow components because these calculations do not account for annual or seasonal patterns of flow or events other than the most extreme conditions déry et al 2009 to better quantify flow regimes based on variable seasonal patterns signal processing techniques can be used to identify sub annual hydrologic patterns from daily flow time series signal processing theory provides well established techniques such as data smoothing peak detection and time windowing that have been applied in hydrology kusche et al 2009 mann 2004 and can be used to detect features from a time series of daily streamflow data time series smoothing is used to enhance certain frequencies i e the signal while attenuating others i e the noise and many smoothing techniques are available such as moving average exponential moving average empirical mode decomposition regression smoothing e g loess cleaveland and loader 1996 wavelet and splines janert 2010 smoothing functions generate fitted curves to time series data that emphasize different frequency signals depending on the function and level of smoothing pollock 1999 feature detection is used to extract peaks or valleys of interest from the smoothed data and can depend on attributes such as magnitude or slope schneider 2011 scholkmann et al 2012 dynamic windowing around a detected feature constrains further analysis to a particular period of interest and allows for increased resolution of subsequent analysis palshikar 2009 in previous work signal processing techniques have been applied to hydrologic time series for applications such as detecting long term trends letcher et al 2001 modeling hydrologic processes zhang et al 2016 and predicting future trends adamowski and sun 2010 cannas et al 2006 common techniques such as harmonic analysis using fourier or wavelet transform methods can be effective in analyzing hydrologic time series characteristics such as periodicity trends coherence and cross phase among deriving and response variables or complexity determined by wavelet entropy pasternack and hinnov 2003 sang 2013 additionally many techniques have been developed to identify baseflow recession hall 1968 recent attempts include identifying a consecutive number of days of negative slope in the hydrograph bart and hope 2014 combining requirements of negative slope with a percentile based magnitude threshold sawaske and freyberg 2014 or automatic identification of recession curves based on parameters balancing accuracy and coverage smith and schwartz 2017 while some methods share similarities with components of the proposed method to the authors knowledge there has not yet been a method developed to automatically isolate and quantify all major seasonal flow transitions from annual streamflow time series to identify ecologically significant flow transitions from the annual hydrograph this study applied signal processing methods to identify functional flows found in the highly seasonal mediterranean streams of california usa functional flows refer to sub annual aspects of the flow regime that support key ecological geomorphic or biogeochemical processes in riverine systems escobar arias and pasternack 2010 yarnell et al 2015 yarnell et al 2015 aggregated flow ecology literature to identify four functional flow components relevant to mediterranean streams with a distinct wet and dry season wet season initiation flows peak magnitude flows spring recession flows and dry season low flows building on those efforts and more recent work highlighting key functional flows specific to california yarnell et al 2020 this study identifies the timing of four functional flow components applicable to california s natural streamflow regimes fall pulse flow wet season flow encompassing both wet season baseflow and peak flow conditions spring recession and dry season baseflow fig 1 once the timings of functional flow transitions are identified from the annual hydrograph each functional flow component can be further quantified using additional flow metrics such as magnitude timing frequency duration or rate of change and can be used to design functional flow regimes in managed river systems yarnell et al 2020 drawing on signal processing theory this study develops an algorithm in the open source python programming language to calculate the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily flow time series allowing for improved characterization of seasonal flows this research addresses the following questions 1 is it possible to automatically identify timing of seasonal streamflow components from annual hydrographs and if so what is the level of error and 2 does the timing of seasonal flow components calculated through this study reveal distinctions among streams with varying climatic drivers using data from the highly seasonal streams of california as a testbed this study assesses the accuracy and limitations of the algorithm for quantifying functional flows across a wide range of natural flow regimes and climate conditions including flow regimes exhibiting snowmelt rain or mixed rain and snowmelt signatures to further achieve confidence in the results algorithm outputs are analyzed in the context of california hydrology and tested for the extent that results align with expectations for regional hydrologic regimes 2 methods the study design describes development calibration and performance assessment of the algorithm for detecting the timing of functional flow transitions from daily streamflow time series with algorithm steps summarized in fig 4 2 1 study region california has a mediterranean climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons as well as high interannual variability and spatial heterogeneity dettinger et al 2011 liu et al 2018 much of this variability stems from california s wide latitudinal extent 800 km and physiographic diversity with multiple mountain ranges and valleys of different sizes shapes and relief abatzoglou et al 2009 ladochy et al 2007 california rainfall is characterized by the capability of a limited number of high intensity storm events to contribute to the majority of annual precipitation dettinger et al 2011 found that 20 50 of california s long term rainfall average derives from these high precipitation storm events california s rivers and streams reflect the state s climatic and physiographic diversity ranging from small intermittent streams in the southwest deserts to larger snowmelt fed rivers draining the western slopes of the sierra nevada mountain range lane et al 2018 mount 1995 for this study nine natural hydrologic classes previously identified for california by lane et al 2018 were aggregated into three dominant stream types recognized throughout the state mount 1995 snowmelt rainfall and mixed snowmelt and rain sourced streams fig 2 snowmelt sourced flow regimes are largely controlled by the timing and rate of snowmelt which are driven by seasonal patterns of precipitation and temperature rain sourced flow regimes are controlled by the intensity of winter rainfall and characteristics of individual storm events mixed source streams experience both rain driven flows in the winter and a snowmelt pulse in the spring or they occur in large drainages that receive both snowmelt and rainfall contributions from upstream 2 2 data streamflow data used for this analysis come from 223 gage stations with unimpaired or naturalized daily streamflow records in california refer to kennard et al 2010 for definitions of unimpaired and naturalized streamflow fig 2 unimpaired gage data was sourced from the dataset compiled by zimmerman et al 2017 who followed a 3 step protocol to obtain unimpaired daily streamflow their process designated gage stations as unimpaired based on 1 designation as a least disturbed site from a u s geological survey database of watershed attributes falcone et al 2010 2 status of unimpairment based on annual gage station reports and appearance of natural conditions from satellite imagery and 3 historical flow records that pre date anthropogenic disturbance such as dams and urbanization seven gages with simulated unimpaired i e naturalized daily streamflow data were also added to the dataset to cover the central valley region of california cdwr 2007 which was otherwise poorly represented by unimpaired gage stations a final screening of the annual hydrographs of the resulting dataset was performed and several gages were removed from the analysis that had flow patterns appearing irregular impaired or too low to exhibit seasonal patterns the resulting dataset of 223 reference gages includes periods of record as early as 1891 and as recent as 2015 with an average period of record of 34 years and a range of 6 to 65 years 2 3 seasonal flow detection algorithm development the following sections provide the theory and rationale for the seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda explain the signal processing methods applied and describe individual calculation steps additional description of signal processing methods is described in the supplemental materials 2 3 1 data smoothing data smoothing is a type of filtering in which low frequency components are retained while high frequency components are attenuated enabling detection of features of interest at different frequencies or time scales press and teukolsky 1990 common finite difference smoothing techniques include simple running averages weighted moving averages and exponential filters janert 2010 in this study a gaussian weighted moving average filter was used to generate a smoothed time series using the function gaussian filter1d from the scipy image processing package verveer 2003 in python this smoothing method was selected for its ability to retain local maxima in the output function while avoiding abrupt distortions in the filtered data the gaussian filter sets the weighting factors of the smoothing window wj according to a gaussian normal distribution 1 f x σ 1 2 π σ 2 e x p 1 2 x σ 2 such that any new streamflow observation that enters the smoothing window is only gradually added to the moving average and then gradually removed the standard deviation of the gaussian function σ dictates the width of the distribution and consequently the degree of smoothing applied in this study low and high levels of streamflow data smoothing were associated with σ 5 and σ 8 respectively for example a daily streamflow time series smoothed with a high standard deviation gaussian filter σ 12 fig 3 will dampen daily to weekly hydrologic variability while preserving major seasonal patterns alternatively a low standard deviation gaussian filter σ 4 fig 3 will preserve storm events occurring on weekly scales high levels of smoothing are often applied first in the algorithm to identify coarse resolution temporal patterns such as the distinction between the annual wet and dry season while removing the signal noise caused by individual storm events increasingly lower levels of smoothing are then applied to identify hydrologic features on finer temporal scales 2 3 2 splines splines are functions constructed from segments of polynomials between each time series observation that are constrained to be smooth at the junctions letcher et al 2001 splines which are used in the sfda for derivative estimation of smoothed streamflow have been shown to generate nearly optimal derivative estimates of noisy data such as streamflow time series due to low interpolation error craven and wahba 1979 ragozin 1983 thomas et al 2015 the sfda employs a cubic spline function three degrees of freedom for derivative estimates which is generally considered an optimal interpolation function for large time series carter and signorino 2010 kimball 1976 wahba 1978 for further explanation on spline fitting refer to hastie and tibshirani 1990 in this study derivative estimation using a cubic spline was performed on smoothed and windowed streamflow time series using the one dimensional univariate spline fitting function available from the scipy library in python jones et al 2001 2 4 seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda general steps the sfda consists of six general steps used to detect seasonal flow transitions although some applications may require either a subset of these steps or multiple iterations fig 4 steps are applied to each water year in a dataset which in california is defined as october 1 to september 30 step 1 fig 4a a high standard deviation gaussian filter g1 is applied to the observed daily streamflow time series to detect dominant peaks valleys or trends in the annual hydrograph depending on the level of smoothing different frequency patterns e g seasonal sub seasonal are attenuated or left intact step 2 fig 4b a hydrologic feature of interest is identified from g1 such as annual peak flow step 3 fig 4b a localized search window is set around the feature of interest to constrain subsequent analysis to a hydrologically relevant period e g 30 days before and after the feature of interest step 4 fig 4c within the search window a low standard deviation gaussian filter g2 is applied to the observed daily time series to extract high resolution hydrologic patterns e g individual storm events step 5 fig 4d a spline curve is fitted to smoothed data g2 and the derivative is taken to identify the slope of the hydrograph s1 step 6 fig 4d a feature of interest is characterized in one of two ways i directly from g2 using relevant flow characteristics i e magnitude or ii using the derivative of the spline curve s1 to detect peaks or valleys of interest based on slope or sign change triangles represent peak features of interest and the black diamond is the final selected feature the sfda steps are iterative and can be repeated multiple times to consistently and accurately identify flow transitions across water years and stream types for example the calculation of spring recession requires three iterations of smoothing and feature detection while the calculation for dry season start timing only requires one iteration the parameter values e g smoothing parameter σ window size or magnitude thresholds can be adjusted to suit the needs of particular flow regimes or hydrologic features of interest for example in flashy rain driven streams the start of the dry season is generally indicated by the last significant storm event of the water year which can be found using a low standard deviation gaussian filter that closely fits daily streamflow data meanwhile the start of the dry season in a snowmelt driven stream may be better identified by the general trend of flow reduction representing catchment drainage which is best represented with a high standard deviation gaussian filter to capture broader trends to contextualize the parameterization process the algorithm for the dry season start timing may be considered the dry season start timing is identified in the receding limb of the annual hydrograph through a combination of relative magnitude and slope which are determined by parameterization the start timing will be identified later in the water year for example if the relative magnitude threshold is reduced requiring lower magnitude or if the slope threshold is reduced requiring a flatter slope essentially creating more stringent hydrologic requirements further the degree of smoothing applied to raw daily streamflow dampens fluctuations in flow and can allow a stabilized slope to be detected earlier in the water year as the level of smoothing is increased the combinations of parameters for each algorithm were determined by expert opinion of the co authors to best achieve timing of the functional flows illustrated conceptually in fig 1 across a diversity of hydrologic inputs and this parameterization is available as default values in the sfda code 2 5 application of the sfda to functional flows in california four distinct applications of the sfda were used to calculate the timing of functional flow component transitions based on reference condition california streamflow gages fig 2 in these applications the sfda steps were repeated up to three times to accurately identify functional flow transitions across the variety of stream types found in california the parameter values e g smoothing parameter σ or window size were determined heuristically by the co authors for each functional flow component to achieve timing results aligning with the conceptual timing of functional flow transitions illustrated in fig 1 and described in yarnell et al 2020 in the calibration process parameters for each functional flow identification algorithm were empirically and incrementally adjusted to achieve hydrologically meaningful results for example the parameters for spring recession start timing smoothing parameter σ window sizes and magnitude thresholds were adjusted so that the timing would occur after wet season high flows but before flows had receded to baseflow conditions supplemental materials and associated online resources provide more information about the calculation of each functional flow timing metric how to download the sfda code and how to modify algorithm parameters to achieve desired results to demonstrate sfda application to a specific functional flow component the calculation of wet season start timing is described in section 2 5 1 the timing metrics from the sfda can be used to calculate additional functional flow metrics describing the magnitude duration frequency and rate of change of flow within each functional flow component e g baseflow magnitude or duration of the dry season yarnell et al 2020 the full suite of sfda based functional flow metrics can be visualized and downloaded at eflows ucdavis edu a website developed to view and interact with california s natural hydrology 2 5 1 functional flow calculation for wet season start timing wet season start timing delineates the portion of the water year during which streams receive the greatest inputs from storm runoff or snowmelt and flows are elevated above dry season baseflow levels yarnell et al 2020 the calculation for wet season start timing is presented as an example of the sfda application to california functional flows this calculation uses one iteration of the sfda steps fig 5 within each water year a high standard deviation gaussian filter g1 σ 10 is applied fig 5 step 1 to detect the water year s global peak p1 and preceding global valley v1 fig 5 step 2 a relative magnitude threshold m1 is then set based on the magnitude of p1 and v1 as an upper limit m1 γ p1 v1 where γ 0 2 to ensure that the wet season start timing is not set after flows have already increased during the water year fig 5 step 3 a spline curve is fit to g1 so that its derivative can be used as a hydrologic requirement in the final feature detection step finally searching backwards in time from p1 the date that discharge first falls below m1 and below a rate of change equaling δ p1 where δ 0 002 is selected as the wet season start timing fig 5 step 4 the values for γ and δ were adjusted for california reference streamflow based on the co authors expert opinions to achieve identification of the functional flows described conceptually in fig 1 and yarnell et al 2020 2 6 performance assessment the calibrated sfda was evaluated based on its ability to accurately determine the timing of functional flow transitions across all years in the california unimpaired streamflow dataset the analyzed results consist of four flow timing metrics calculated annually for each gage 6 65 years per gage performance assessment included 1 a comparison of results across stream types 2 visual inspection of results and 3 calculation of assessment indices to quantify issues in algorithm performance 2 6 1 comparison of functional flow timing results across stream types results were grouped by stream type rain snowmelt or mixed rain and snowmelt sourced and visualized with violin plots which use a rotated kernel density plot to depict the distribution of results distinct letters above the violin plots denote groups with statistically distinct mean values based on tukey s honestly significant difference statistical test with a confidence level of 95 abdi and williams 2010 groups with no statistical difference share the same letter above the violin plot results were interpreted according to the co authors expert knowledge of california streamflow hydrology and supported where possible with relevant region specific literature 2 6 2 visual performance assessment visual inspection of functional flow timing results was performed as a preliminary step to inform quantitative inspection section 2 6 3 the four annual flow timing metrics were reviewed for each water year in the dataset n 7475 years yielding 29 900 visual inspections accuracy was visually assessed based on the authors knowledge of california seasonal flow components and when they were expected to occur across a range of water year types results that appeared incorrect were tabulated grouped according to functional flow component and stream type and reviewed by multiple experts in california hydrology from the co author team to ensure consistency after performing the 29 900 visual inspections of the four timing metrics issues were characterized based on the bias in timing e g early or late timing and the stream type in which it occurred 2 6 3 quantitative analysis with assessment indices the purpose of this analysis was to quantify issues in algorithm performance observed during visual assessment the issues characterized during visual assessment were quantified using programmed rules defined to identify occurrence of each issue across the dataset for example one rule identified years in rain sourced streams in which dry season start timing was set after august 1 this was based on repeated observation that flow magnitude and slope generally decrease to baseflow levels in this stream type before august 1 and dry season start timing set after august 1 was usually inaccurate the developed rules were quantified across relevant stream types and resulting values were termed assessment indices many of the assessment indices attempt to quantify cases in which functional flow timing was either earlier or later than expected for a given water year and these issues with timing were often stream type specific for example seasonal timing metrics tend to occur later in the water year for snowmelt sourced streams than rain sourced streams so a dry season timing metric of march 1 could be considered anomalously early in snowmelt streams but normal in rain streams early or late occurrence was defined either through an empirical evidence based cut off point such as aug 1 or if possible through a relative hydrologic relationship such as the number of high flow events that occur before or after a particular timing metric is set other assessment indices quantify water year features that make characterization with the sfda difficult such as dry water years in which only one or two peak flow events occur table 1 lists performance assessment indices used to quantify issues in algorithm timing calculations based on final results from the sfda 3 results and discussion the sfda was found to consistently identify functional flow components across a wide range of hydrologic input data enabling quantitative differentiation across stream types based on the timing of seasonal functional flows example sfda timing results are presented in fig 6 for individual water years spanning a range of stream types rain mixed and snowmelt sourced streams and water year types dry moderate and wet years across a variety of watersheds illustrating the ability of the sfda to capture the timing of functional flow transitions in california across a diversity of hydrologic regimes 3 1 comparison of results across stream types 3 1 1 fall pulse flow timing the timing of the fall pulse flow marks the first peak flow of the water year when magnitude surpasses baseflow in a distinct pulse unlike the other functional flow components the fall pulse flow is constrained to only occur during a subset time of the water year oct 1 dec 15 when hydrologic requirements for relative magnitude and duration are met and it does not necessarily occur in each water year a fall pulse flow was identified in 60 65 of water years across all stream types although there were significant differences in event timing p 0 05 between snowmelt streams and other stream types wide overlap exists across all stream types fig 7 a this is due in part to large scale temperature and precipitation patterns that affect california streamflow early in the water year oct nov temperatures across the state including the sierra nevada mountains are often above freezing causing precipitation to fall as rain or rapidly melting snow lundquist et al 2008 serreze et al 1999 additionally atmospheric river events can cause correlated streamflow patterns across much of the state cayan and peterson 1989 which are most pronounced when all precipitation is falling as rain therefore a high degree of similarity is expected in the timing of fall pulse flows across all stream types further reason for the limited distinction among stream classes stems from the algorithm itself which detects events over a narrow search window of 75 days oct 1 dec 15 considered ecologically significant for california streams yarnell et al 2015 the upper and lower bounds of the violin plots span nearly the entire available time window of 75 days fig 7a indicating that fall pulse flow varies widely across all stream types these results broadly align with ahearn et al 2004 who state that the season of flushing flows in california typically begins in november 3 1 2 wet season start timing wet season start timing is the date that the water year begins to experience consistently elevated flows from either rainfall or snowmelt yarnell et al 2020 the differences in these values were statistically significant p 0 05 across the three stream types fig 7b the timing occurred three to four months later in snowmelt sourced streams average mar 4 than rain sourced streams average dec 12 and timing from mixed source streams occurred across a wide range of values whose mean dec 30 closely resembles rain sourced streams these differences were expected due to differing geographic and climatic drivers of wet season flow across california in rain sourced streams the timing of wet season flow closely reflects patterns of winter precipitation which occurs primarily during the winter months dec feb although these peak flows also experience high interannual variability in timing cayan and peterson 1989 dettinger 2011 in high elevation snowmelt sourced streams peak flows are initiated by the snowmelt pulse as air temperatures warm enough to melt snowpack in the spring in mixed source streams wet season start timing may be cued by either winter storms or a snowmelt pulse resulting in a wide range of possible values driven either by precipitation timing or temperature driven snowmelt fig 8 the proportion of streamflow driven by rain versus snow is an important consideration in mid and high elevation basins as runoff is expected to shift towards more rain driven flow with warming climate in the western united states hamlet et al 2005 stewart et al 2015 sultana and choi 2018 3 1 3 spring recession start timing the spring recession represents the seasonal transition from wet season high flows to dry season low flows the spring recession start timing is statistically distinct p 0 05 across the three california stream types with timing occurring progressively later in the water year from rain sourced to snowmelt sourced streams fig 7c this distinction in timing is expected due to climatic influences on hydrology that shift as streams progress from lower to higher elevations and snowpack provides increasing amounts of storage that delay streamflow response to precipitation aguado et al 1992 in california s highest elevations above 2300 m the spring recession is cued by a distinct temperature driven snowmelt pulse as the snowmelt influence diminishes and warming occurs earlier in lower elevation mixed source streams fig 2 the snowmelt pulse may arrive earlier or may not occur at all in dry years with very little snowpack relative to rainfall in rain sourced streams the spring recession is expected to occur after the last rain storm of the wet season which tends to occur several months earlier in the year than the snowmelt pulse on average the distribution of spring recession start timings in snowmelt sourced streams is relatively narrow with the majority of start dates occurring between may 23 and july 6 average june 6 indicating predictable recession timing in snowmelt streams regardless of water year type yarnell et al 2010 the most variability in spring recession start timing occurs in mixed source streams which due to their occurrence at mid elevation regions are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and snowpack lundquist et al 2004 stewart 2008 fig 8 demonstrates how a greater snowmelt pulse is associated with later spring recession timing occurring 31 days later in water year 1952 than in 1970 this finding aligns with other research on streamflow in the western us that has indicated both temperature and annual flow volume are significant drivers of spring snowmelt runoff timing aguado et al 1992 kormos et al 2016 adding to this variability snowmelt receiving streams in mid elevation regions of california have been subject to significant changes in the timing of snowmelt recession peaks due to climate warming stewart 2008 hamlet et al 2005 for example estimated peak accumulation of snowmelt runoff in mid elevation areas of california as occurring 15 45 days earlier throughout the last century which adds additional variation to the spring recession start timing results in mixed snowmelt and rain regimes although rain sourced streams also exhibit high variability in spring recession timing the average spring recession start timing across rain sourced streams april 7 broadly aligns with the generally accepted end of the rainy season for california liu et al 2018 3 1 4 dry season baseflow start timing the start timing of the dry season marks the beginning of the low flow low variability portion of the water year in which the rate of recession flows has stabilized and magnitudes reach baseflow level similar to spring recession start timing dry season start timing is statistically distinct among the three stream types p 0 05 and occurs gradually later on average from rain sourced june 6 to mixed source july 16 to snowmelt sourced streams august 7 fig 7d the timing distribution ranges more than 100 days in rain sourced streams which is consistent with the high inter annual variability of precipitation magnitude and timing and consequently streamflow exhibited in california dettinger et al 2011 despite high variability across rain sourced streams the average dry season start timing in these streams is surprisingly consistent from small to large streams for instance the average dry season start timing is june 8 in larger north coast streams average annual flow 23 cms and is similar in flashy ephemeral streams average annual flow 0 5 cms with an average start timing of may 27 from lane et al 2017 however interannual variability in dry season start timing within a single stream can be high suggesting that central tendencies do not represent dry season timing conditions well in rain sourced streams 3 2 performance assessment indices assessment indices were created to quantify the accuracy of the sfda for identifying the timing of functional flow transitions in california reference streamflow assessment indices are presented in table 1 and the following section highlights key issues and limitations for each functional flow the frequency of most identified issues was less than 10 except for snow early wet and mixed early spring which are explained in table 1 and below the methods presented here to identify hydrologic features and determine error differ from previous hydrologic studies which can often take advantage of validated training sets to determine accuracy cannas et al 2006 letcher et al 2001 smith and schwartz 2017 the heuristic methods used in this research are similar to other approaches that require some subjectivity for parameterization of peak detection palshikar 2009 and qualitative visual assessment methods are similar to approaches used to validate climate patterns in climate modeling studies that pair qualitative and quantitative model assessment gyalistras et al 1994 paul and hsu 2012 performance assessment based on validation of known hydrologic conditions employed in this study is similar to the approach of déry et al 2009 who assessed a new method of spring recession identification across different river types in their study region the proposed methods although subjective in the choice of parametrization present a consistent and repeatable way to identify functional flow components advancing previous methods of quantifying seasonal streamflow patterns 3 2 1 issues in sfda performance fig 9 presents common issues in the sfda for each functional flow component which were often attributed to uncommon hydrologic patterns or effects from smoothing filters that occasionally have the undesired effect of over dampening storm peaks while detecting broad hydrologic trends in some water years the first day of the water year oct 1 was identified as the date of the fall pulse flow which presents ambiguity as to whether the first day of the water year is an actual peak event or is instead part of a continual decline from a peak in the previous water year fig 9a this situation occurs most often in naturalized gage data with a 3 5 occurrence rate across all naturalized water years and an average occurrence rate of 1 across the entire dataset table 1 index wsi day1 both mixed and rain sourced streams experienced some water years in which a single large high flow event dominated the annual hydrograph such that start timings of wet season and spring recession were based on the same peak flow fig 9b this occurred in 4 of mixed source streams and 4 of rain sourced streams table 1 indices mixed spring wet rain spring wet and could result in anomalous functional flow metrics based on these rare hydrologic conditions in mixed source streams early identification of spring recession start timing was found with a frequency of 21 table 1 index mixed early spring sometimes due to the effect of over dampening rainstorm peaks with smoothing filters when attempting to detect broad hydrologic trends fig 9c conversely spring recession start timing occurred late in 10 of snowmelt stream water years when the algorithm was triggered by small peaks along the recession limb instead of the main snowmelt pulse table 1 index snow early spring the algorithm for dry season start timing assesses the change in magnitude and slope along the recession limb so dry water years with very little change in these features are more likely to have issues with component detection this was often the case when dry season start timing was identified late in the water year fig 9d which occurred in 10 of rain sourced water years table 1 index rain late dry these issues are expected to improve when sfda parameters are calibrated for smaller regions of streamflow data instead of applying the same set of parameters across a wide array of input data as was done in this statewide case study 4 conclusions this study developed an objective signal processing algorithm to address the need for a robust method to characterize the timing of seasonal flow transitions from daily streamflow time series the seasonal flow detection algorithm sfda improved on existing methods that rely on fixed time steps through the novel application of established signal processing techniques to identify the timing of seasonal flow transitions the application to california streams demonstrated the ability of this approach to identify the timing of functional flow components from unimpaired daily streamflow time series across a wide range of climatic and geographic settings and extreme seasonal and interannual hydrologic variability results highlight hydrologic distinctions among varying drivers of streamflow such as progressively later timing of spring recession flow as streams shift from rainfall sourced to snowmelt sourced flow regimes limitations of the approach were determined through a combination of visual expert based assessment and quantitative performance assessment in general the percentage error in timing calculations did not exceed 10 across relevant water years for any assessment index with infrequent exceptions in a parallel effort functional flow metrics produced by the sfda for california reference gages are being extrapolated to ungaged streams to inform statewide environmental flow recommendations likewise the sfda has potential to be applied to other regions or countries sharing highly seasonal climates similar to california by adjusting algorithm parameters to suit local hydrology for instance the sfda metrics could be applied to assess shifts in streamflow due to climate change with particular focus on potential changes in timing of seasonal flows the proposed approach supports improved understanding of high resolution spatial and temporal trends in hydrologic processes and climate conditions across complex landscapes and can inform environmental water

5543,the impoundment and regulation information of reservoirs is essential for water resource management and hydrological analysis along the upper reach of yellow river in northern china a large number of reservoirs have been built or are being built while information about the distribution and impoundment of these reservoirs is rather limited here we compiled an inventory of reservoirs 0 01 km2 in two catchments in the upper reach of the yellow river and estimated the seasonal water storage variations of reservoirs associated with impoundment during 2000 and 2018 by using a suite of remote sensing observations the inventory of 149 reservoirs in the study region consists of 102 existing reservoirs built before 2000 retrieved from google earth high resolution imagery or available publications and 47 new reservoirs constructed during 2000 2018 which we detected by using time series analysis of ndwi derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis surface reflectance data to estimate water storage changes of all reservoirs associated with impoundment we combined representative inundation extents of reservoirs in each season of the year retrieved from sequential landsat images on the google earth engine gee platform and shoreline topography information derived from the shuttle radar topography mission dem data the results demonstrate significant seasonal variations mostly impoundment in autumn winter and release in spring summer as well as a rapid increasing trend of water storage held in reservoirs particularly in catchment a the headwater of the yellow river the total water storage increased by about 16 gt from 2000 to 2018 about 25 percent of which is due to impoundment of newly constructed reservoirs the remote sensing based results were validated by long term in situ water level data of 2 reservoirs and construction information of 14 new reservoirs uncertainty analysis shows acceptable accuracy in monitoring storage changes on the annual scale indicated by high confidence in area volume curves for most reservoirs 102 reservoirs with r2 of area volume curve higher than 0 9 while uncertainty is unneglectable on the seasonal scale in accordance with streamflow variation data from 2000 to 2016 provided by published literature our estimation indicates that the water resource in the upper yellow river has been more highly regulated by reservoir impoundment and the seasonal regulation exerts significant impact on catchment runoff process averagely about 17 of annual discharge keywords reservoir remote sensing water storage river discharge yellow river dem 1 introduction impounding water in reservoirs is one of the primary mechanisms for coping with the variability of water supply and demand the construction and operation of over 1 million dams have provided a variety of services important to a growing human population lehner et al 2011 globally water from reservoirs supplies an estimated 30 40 of irrigated areas dams 2000 contributes 20 of global hydroelectric power demirbas 2009 and serves numerous other beneficial functions including flood control navigation and recreation meanwhile reservoirs have significantly altered the hydrological cycle and also severely affected ecosystem dynamics and fluxes in river networks reservoirs change seasonal hydrologic regimes with monthly increases or decreases in streamflow up to 30 haddeland et al 2006 for examples in the brazos river basin in the united states with large and increasing water withdrawals and reservoirs vogl and lopes 2009 compared naturalized and anthropogenic impacted river flowing regimes and identified obvious decreases in the frequency of high flow events in spring and winter and increased summer low flows for the murrumbidgee river in australia kingsford and thomas 2004 described a river flow reduction to about one third of the natural median flow and the degradation of the major wetland caused by damming and subsequent water withdrawals given these significant alterations the impacts of reservoirs should be included in predictions of current and future water availability floods and droughts the new versions of some global models seek to take the impact of reservoirs into account bierkens 2015 the global characterization of reservoirs is an urgent need and also a main challenge for the development of global hydrological models however for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world their locations and storage information is either not measured or not readily available due to financial political or legal considerations particularly newly dammed reservoirs are of increasing concern to researchers because their non negligible influences on downstream river discharges but they remained poorly inventoried or monitored thus far this unbalanced spatial distribution of observational data makes it challenging to assess the impact of human alterations on the land hydrologic cycle which has been not fully represented in most of the current models in this context remote sensing is a promising tool to overcome the difficulty in accessing information about reservoirs the general procedure to monitor storage changes consists of associating water area and surface elevation frappart et al 2006 reservoir area stage volume relationships are especially interesting as they allow operational observation of stored volume variations annor et al 2009a duan and bastiaanssen 2013 eilander et al 2014 song et al 2013 through a combination of direct observations of elevation and surface area along with documented reservoir configurations at capacity gao et al 2012 estimated storage time series for 34 large size reservoirs globally however the above mentioned studies may be limited to certain large water bodies as a result of applied satellite altimetry measurements which were derived from narrow swath coarse cross track spacing long along track path length or short mission periods of the satellite altimeters alsdorf et al 2007 crétaux and birkett 2006 gao et al 2012 therefore the area stage volume relationship method from optical and altimetry observations might be insufficient to estimate catchment scale water storage variations with limited coverage on small and medium sized reservoirs especially for the newly dammed ones the main objective of this study is to quantify the water storage variations of catchment scale reservoirs on both seasonal and inter annual timescales especially considering the influences of year by year accumulated water stored in newly dammed reservoirs the yellow river located in northern china owns a large number of dams constructed for hydropower generation flood control and agricultural irrigation where natural river flows could be highly influenced by increased water impoundments and reservoir operation schemes we try to represent the alteration degree of natural streamflow conditions that might have been affected by dam construction since the year 2000 with this objectivity we firstly detected all newly constructed reservoirs in the catchments by using time series reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and then estimated the water storage changes of all reservoirs by deriving time series of inundation extents based on landsat data achieve accessible in the google earth engine gee platform pekel et al 2016 and reservoir waterlines based on multi source digital elevation models dems the document is organized as follows section 2 introduces the geographic and climatological conditions of the investigated catchments of the yellow river section 3 presents the data and method used for the compilation of reservoir inventory and estimations of reservoir storage changes sections 4 and 5 analyze the results uncertainties and discuss the influences of reservoir impoundment on the river discharge and section 6 concludes the study 2 study area the yellow river serves as an important water source for the arid and semi arid north western and northern china it is the second longest river in china and ranked as the sixth longest river of the world with the total length estimated to be approximately 5464 km and the drainage basin covering 75 3 104 km2 li et al 2015 this study focusses on two catchments denoted as catchment a and catchment b located in the upper reach and middle reach of the yellow river respectively fig 1 catchment a is the headwater region of the yellow river main stem extending from the northeastern tibetan plateau to the loess plateau with overall altitudinal drop up to 1000 m within this catchment dense streams are developed in the mountainous regions forming several major tributaries of the yellow river catchment b covering small scale mountains surrounding the tibetan plateau is the source region of the wei river the longest tributary of the yellow river both the catchment a and b comprise two important headwater areas of the yellow river due to influences of the southeast asia monsoon climate in the upper yellow river basin shows evident seasonality with approximately 85 of the annual precipitation falling during the wet summer wang et al 2007 prior studies show that the discharge of the yellow river has decreased in the past decades and intensified human activities are probably the main reason li et al 2017 the yellow river is highly regulated with a large number of reservoirs in the whole basin over 3000 reservoirs a registered number of 3147 was published in 2011 by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources have been constructed hundreds of dams were built on the main stem and major tributary channels directly regulating the streamflow 3 data and methods 3 1 data remote sensing observations have been widely used for monitoring surface water dynamics including satellite optical images feyisa et al 2014 pekel et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 song et al 2018 xu 2006 synthetic aperture radar sar data schumann and moller 2015 shen et al 2019a b etc this study combines the landsat and modis imagery to detect the time series of reservoir surface water extent considering the easy availability for the broad scale we used the modis time series data to identify newly impounded reservoirs in this study region the mod09a1 surface reflectance product from february 2000 to may 2018 accessed at the laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov was employed the mod09a1 v6 product provides the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 7 at 500 m resolution after the correction for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering each pixel in mod09a1 images contains the best possible l2g observation during an 8 day period which is selected on the criteria of high observation coverage low view angle absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosol loading vermote 2015 the temporal resolution of 8 days maximizes the coverage of cloud free data and maintains sufficient time sampling frequency for detection of land cover changes associated with newly impounded reservoirs to extract water inundation area of reservoirs time series landsat images accessible on the gee platform were used table 1 gee is a cloud based platform for planetary scale environmental data analysis with computational infrastructure optimized for geospatial data and a large repository of publicly available geospatial datasets including the united states geological survey usgs l1t landsat archive gorelick et al 2017 specifically we used the landsat data acquired from january 2000 to august 2018 that are assigned as landsat tier 1 in the usgs archive the usgs reorganized the landsat archive into a tiered collection landsat scenes with the highest data quality are placed into tier 1 and are considered suitable for time series analysis and the geo registration of tier 1 scenes is consistent and within a prescribed tolerance 12 m root mean square error rmse dwyer et al 2018 this tolerance is less than the width of 0 5 pixel can be considered sufficient for change detection townshend et al 1992 to assist the inundation area extraction we also referred to another landsat derived dataset the jrc global surface water mapping layers v1 0 a dataset with high resolution mapping results of global surface water which is also accessible on gee pekel et al 2016 it contains max extent maximum water inundation extent data which indicates anywhere water has ever been detected based on long term satellite observations acquired from march 1984 to october 2015 this dataset makes it possible to effectively mask out non water area of landsat images employed in this study two widely used dems the srtm dem acquired in february 2000 by airborne radar techniques and the aster dem data farr et al 2007 tachikawa et al 2011 both at a resolution of 30 m were used as the reservoir bathymetry reference to estimate the water storage variations of reservoirs specifically usgs srtm 1 arc second global dem data were the default dem in this study due to higher accuracy with absolute height accuracy better than 6 2 m in eurasia and consistent reference time of acquisition farr et al 2007 the aster gdem v2 which was produced from stereo scene pairs with an global average absolute height accuracy of 17 m at the 95 confidence level tachikawa et al 2011 was used as the backup dem in case of srtm dem capturing terrain of some reservoirs at high water levels aster dem may offer auxiliary terrain information below the reservoir water surface of srtm dem if the two dem data sets cannot provide the exposed reservoir bathymetry information of low water level the estimation of this month will be interpolated by the adjacent records with uncertainty considered it is worth to mention that the relative height accuracies of the two dem data that are directly associated with the reconstruction quality of reservoir storage variations are much lower than the global absolute accuracy estimates in addition some information about the registered capacity of large sized reservoirs such as nazixia reservoir jiudianxia reservoir wangjiaya reservoir and fengjiashan reservoir were collected from published literatures jianliang et al 2011 liu and su 2013 tongqing et al 1996 yang et al 2011 and the registered capacity of laxiwa reservoir and longyangxia reservoir were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn hhyl sngc 3 2 methodology with the aim of estimating water storage changes of reservoirs this study scheme consists of four major components 1 searching and inventorying reservoirs constructed before 2000 by manual traversal along the river segments on high resolution google earth imagery 2 identifying and supplementing newly impounded reservoirs during 2000 2018 by applying the breaks for additive season and trend bfast algorithm to modis ndwi time series 3 extracting inundation area of each reservoir based on landsat data 4 estimating impounded and regulated water storages of each reservoir by integrating the reservoir inundation area with dem bathymetry reference data 3 2 1 generation of initial reservoir inventory in the studied catchments in order to inventory the reservoirs constructed before 2000 hereafter referred to old reservoir inventory we mapped a representative spatial extent for each reservoir hereafter referred to study extents which includes the main water body of the reservoir and potential water body in case the water body extends providing study area for further estimation of inundation area and storage changes this inventorying process including three steps 1 to identify the locations of reservoirs we overlaid drainage networks on google earth imagery then visually identified dams along the drainage networks 2 to map the study extents of reservoirs based on landsat imagery we browsed historical 2000 2018 google earth images and mapped study extents with accordance to the long term changes of inundation areas 3 to check and correct the compiled data we further referred to the existing reservoir inventory data walter 2018 which provides water extents of each reservoir specifically we extracted the drainage networks by applying flow direction and flow accumulation calculation jenson and domingue 1988 after obtaining the flow accumulation of the study area using srtm dem data the drainage networks were determined directly based on the given threshold value in this study 600 km2 was selected as the threshold the extracted drainage networks are shown in fig 2 delineating primary and secondary tributaries of the yellow river in catchment a and the wei river in catchment b along the drainage networks we defined study extents of reservoirs with maximum inundation area width greater than a threshold 90 m 90 m 9 landsat pixels to filter out too small reservoirs when mapping study extents with accordance to historical images the located downstream ends of reservoirs were corresponding dams and the upstream ends were manually judged and edited at the locations where the widths of channels do not obviously differ from the connected natural river channels as the locations of upstream ends are changing the quantity of included river channels brought uncertainty of further estimation as discussed in section 5 2 3 2 2 identification of newly impounded reservoirs along the river segments reservoirs built after 2000 cannot be fully revealed from google earth images we identified reservoirs constructed during 2000 2018 hereafter referred to new reservoirs by detecting certain type of abrupt changes in ndwi time series obtained from modis images the detailed information of the applied method can be referred to zhang et al 2018 in short the algorithm is based on the main idea that impoundment of newly dammed reservoirs will lead to the conversion from land to water in the reservoir area causing a sudden rise of ndwi time series after reservoir impoundment such abrupt changes in time series can be detected by the bfast decomposition and break point detection verbesselt et al 2010a b watts and laffan 2014 further obtaining the location of newly impounded reservoirs and corresponding date of impoundment to improve the algorithm efficiency we limited the detection area to potential locations of new reservoirs specifically within the 5 km buffering area of the drainage networks and within the max extent water area based on jrc global surface water mapping layers the effectiveness of bfast detection largely depends on parameter settings such as the minimal interval of abrupt changes season model and maximum iteration times we referred to the study of zhang et al 2018 and applied the optimized parameter and threshold settings to conduct the bfast algorithm in the yellow river basin for many newly constructed reservoirs the newly appeared inundation areas are widened rivers caused by newly water impoundment after dam construction on river channels thus we applied bfast algorithm in a pixel by pixel procedure instead of region by region which is less exhaustive to avoid land to water converted pixels from being missed in detection pixels of area converted from land to water can be successfully identified as shown in fig 3 a considering the probable presence of detected false information which is not caused by new reservoir construction we manually inspected the detection results and excluded the abrupt changes caused by natural waterbody changes expanded area of existing reservoirs or newly appeared wet farm lands by overlaying them over google earth and the old reservoir inventory as shown in fig 3 b d 3 2 3 extraction of reservoir water inundation area in gee for each reservoir inundation extents were extracted from landsat images archived on gee this study employed segmentation of ndwi images to derive annual and seasonal representative inundation area for each reservoir for annual representation of area extraction we generated a composite landsat image for each year by applying the ee algorithms landsat simplecomposite method provided in gee this method computes a landsat toa top of atmosphere reflectance image from all available raw landsat scenes obtained in the year resulting in 18 cloud free annual composite images for each reservoir with accordance to a cloud score assigned at each pixel using specified algorithms for landsat data limited by the amount of available images in each season this method was unstable when compositing seasonal images thus each of 74 seasonal composite images of each reservoir was generated from median value at each pixel across the stack of all available landsat surface reflectance tier 1 data in the season based on the composite images ndwi was calculated and an initial threshold of 0 05 was used to segment the image into water area and non water area as shown in fig 2 the derived primary reservoir inundation extents may include missed water area caused by ice or clouds and false water area caused by mountain shadows or too low ndwi threshold the pixels of false water area were then masked out by referring to the water max extent area of jrc global surface water mapping layers 3 2 4 estimation of reservoir water impoundment and regulations this study estimated the shoreline elevation of each reservoir based on annual and seasonal primary inundation outlines and the dem as the bathymetry reference first cloud free annual inundation extents were integrated with dem for obtaining the general distribution of shoreline elevation and slope obtaining s t d a described below then this information was utilized to remove noise shoreline dem based on an assumption for each individual reservoir the seasonal magnitude of elevation as well as slope deviations among shoreline pixels should be uniform across the study period while noise not shoreline or special parts such as dams pixels increasing the deviations the threshold settings of removal are 1 t a i a v e a i 1 3 s t d a i 1 2 t a j a v e a j 1 2 s t d a 3 t s j a v e s j 1 2 s t d a where t a i a v e a i 1 and s t d a i 1 are the threshold in the i th removal of annual extent modifying the average and the standard deviation of values after the i 1 th removal respectively t s j t a j a v e s j 1 a v e a j 1 and s t d a are the threshold in the j th removal of seasonal extents the threshold in the j th removal of annual extents the average values after the j 1 th removal of seasonal extents the average values after the j 1 th removal of annual extents and the standard deviation of values in a high quality annual result manually chosen from annual removal results respectively for each reservoir the dem optimization shown in fig 2 contains a noise removing step and a missed parts patching step the dem based noise removal includes four steps 1 to erase region with too high or too low elevation or slope according to t a i in annual extents and then to use the result of a certain year that erased extents have least noise to obtain s t d a 2 to erase region with too high elevation or slope according to t a j in annual extents resulting shadow free annual water extents 3 to erase the region with too high elevation or slope according to t s j in seasonal extents resulting shadow free seasonal water extent which includes more missing extent caused by clouds unscanned pixels in etm imagery and over removal and 4 to remove pixels with too low elevation according to t s j in both annual and seasonal shoreline dem to remove outliners of missing extents in shoreline dem resulting noise removed shoreline dem generally for reservoirs across the entire study area considering a normal distribution of appeared noise pixels limited by t s j and t a j both ave 2 std the portion of removed shoreline pixels in each removal is about 5 of the remnants then the seasonal removal was executed for generally 5 times and annual for generally 1 time thus about 23 1 0 95 5 of seasonal shoreline pixels and about 5 1 0 95 1 of annual shoreline pixels were removed estimation of water level was based on the average elevation of noise removed shoreline dem the purpose of removing noise of too high or too low values separately high value first was to avoid over removal of low value noise specifically due to low threshold of ndwi extraction the result of primary inundation area contains non water area with high elevation and slope which may cause the removal of shoreline pixels mistaken as noise pixels the missed parts patching step was executed after the noise removing step after estimating water level complete dem of impounded area was required for estimating volume but missing extents caused by frozen area clouds and shadows exist as holes in reservoir dem as shown in fig 2 to patch up the missing extent we merged all noise removed water extents to extract dem of region ever detected as water in the study extent resulting complete dem of impounded area water storage was estimated by calculating the volume above reservoir dem and below the estimated water level plane to estimate water storage of a complete water area while excluding area with higher elevation than water level negative depth area such as land area and some frozen area water inundation area estimation was based on the area of water level plane intersect by reservoir dem fig 2 after applying the mentioned procedures estimation failed or resulted zero in some seasons as the success rate was limited by the number and quality of available landsat images and possibility that water level was lower than the surface of dem to obtain full time series of volume change water storage volume data in these missing seasons need to be rebuilt for each reservoir estimated inundation area and water storage was used to generate area volume curve according to a considerably robust relationship between a reservoir s storage volume and its area annor et al 2009b liebe et al 2005 sawunyama et al 2006 which can be expressed as 4 v a area b where v represents the reservoir water volume area is its inundation area and a and b the parameters to be determined after determining a and b by curve fitting missing volume was rebuilt by inundation area specifically missing inundation area data was filled with multi year average estimated area of the corresponding season then missing volume data was filled using area volume curve determined by successfully estimated data when executing curve fitting the coefficients of determination shows fitting effect of the relationship for each reservoir which was influenced by 1 the applicability of the relationship for local terrain as the relationship has higher applicability for reservoirs with terrain similar to a square pyramid diagonally cut in half 2 whether dem was more possibly acquired when water level was high thus terrain under water surface was not offered this can cause low applicability of the relationship and failed estimations of many seasons if a reservoir has low coefficient of determination r2 0 8 we used backup dem aster to recalculate seasonal water storage for newly impounded reservoirs we kept result calculated by default dem as estimation results unless the result calculated by backup dem showed significantly higher coefficients of determination due to more confidence that when dem was acquired more terrain was exposed above water surface and caused the applicability of the relationship for local terrain for existing reservoirs calculation result with higher coefficients of determination was chosen as estimation result 4 results and analyses 4 1 analyses of newly impounded and existing reservoirs this study identified 1289 pixels out of 3 369 270 examined pixels within the buffered area of the drainage network as areas converted from land to water by manual check with google earth and landsat imagery we inventoried a total of 47 newly constructed reservoirs as shown in fig 4 both newly impounded and existing reservoirs are mainly built in the area with high altitudinal drop compared to existing reservoirs dammed before 2000 most of the new reservoirs are distributed along the main stream shown as bold blue line in fig 4 instead of tributaries of the yellow river and wei river as shown in table 2 in catchment a about 50 of new reservoirs were constructed along the main stream of the yellow river while the percentage is only 6 3 for existing reservoirs in catchment b 42 new reservoirs are constructed along the main stream of the wei river while only 1 out of the total 22 existing reservoirs are constructed along the main stream and other 21 reservoirs are all located in its tributaries compared with the 102 existing reservoirs most of the 47 new reservoirs are built in medium sizes 1 10 km2 instead of in small or giant sizes table 3 in catchment a 80 new reservoirs have inundation area over 1 km2 larger than about 91 of existing reservoirs but no new reservoir has been built as large as 100 km2 while there are two such giant sized reservoirs constructed before 2000 in catchment b about 42 new reservoirs have inundation area over 1 km2 larger than 73 of existing reservoirs this comparison indicates that since 2000 a considerable amount of medium sized reservoirs has been constructed and the average size is markedly larger than that of previously built reservoirs the impoundment storage magnitude varies largely among new reservoirs built in different dates and with different sizes the magnitude of impoundment after the construction can be evaluated by the water storage volume estimation of the corresponding season table 4 generally about 77 of all 47 identified new reservoirs have increased water storage volume over 100 104 m3 in the newly impounded season while about 39 of them exceed 1000 104 m3 the magnitude of newly impoundment also varies among new reservoirs with different times of newly impoundment in catchment a about 55 of new reservoirs over 1000 104 m3 were newly impounded after 2008 in catchment b all new reservoirs with over 1000 104 m3 were newly impounded before 2004 some later constructed reservoirs have significantly larger impoundment than other reservoirs especially two large reservoirs with drastically increased impounded water volume over 10000 104 m3 in catchment a this helps to explain sudden rise in water storage volume change of newly impounded reservoirs in catchment a as mentioned in section 4 2 the accuracy of identified new reservoirs was evaluated by referring to published power generation time in the hydroelectric power stations of registered newly impounded reservoirs provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn hhyl sngc there is a total of 14 new reservoirs build after 2000 in the published records in comparison to our detected 47 new ones which indicates only a small part of new reservoirs are documented in the existed publication among the 14 reservoirs with registered impoundment times 11 of them were successfully identified within the date of detected break points in the ndwi time series table 5 with errors within the range of 1 3 seasons 3 were not detected and 2 were identified with biased impoundment time reasons for the failed detection are related to the size of the reservoir and the impounding time close to the beginning or ending of the time series which are discussed in section 5 1 4 2 interannual and seasonal variations of reservoir water impoundment this study examined the water storage variations of all 149 reservoirs in the studied catchments with one exception the exceptional reservoir panhe reservoir in catchment a cannot be estimated due to its half artificially constructed inner wall plate shaped terrain which is not captured in our used dem the estimated annual and seasonal water storages can indicate annual impounded water accumulation and intra annual regulations of reservoirs respectively the total volume changes of all studied reservoirs in the two investigated catchments are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the increasing water stored in reservoirs as shown in fig 5 indicates more highly regulated runoff process of the yellow river in the past 18 years from 2000 to 2018 the storage volumes of reservoirs in catchment a and catchment b show rapid increasing trends with linear rates of 0 211 km3 per year in catchment a and 0 0067 km3 per year in catchment b newly impounded reservoirs occupied considerable portions about 40 of the increment of all reservoirs in catchment a and about 70 in catchment b the amount of water stored in new reservoirs in catchment a shows nearly year to year steady increase during 2000 2018 for catchment b the amount of water volume stored in new reservoirs shows three distinctive stages a steady and slow increase during 2000 2003 relatively stable status during 2004 2013 and large inter annual variability in recent years 2015 2018 we also synthesized the time series of water storage variations at seasonal timescale as shown in fig 6 seasonal changes of reservoir water storage were significant the volume changes indicate that in the two catchments reservoirs mainly store water in autumn season 3 or winter season 4 and release in spring or summer season 1 or 2 one possible reason is that in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau the water demand due to agricultural irrigation has been mostly concentrated from spring to summer chen et al 2007 the total water storage variations of the catchments were dominated by the newly built large reservoirs as shown in fig 6 there was an abrupt increase of total water storage in newly built reservoirs in catchment a since the season 3 of 2014 the abrupt rise in this season was mainly caused by 1 considerable water impoundment 2 83 108 m3 of the newly built nazixia reservoir with registered total capacity of 7 33 108 m3 2 increased water impoundment of two earlier built new large reservoirs jiudianxia reservoir 9 08 108 m3 capacity with increased water volume of 3 17 108 m3 laxiwa reservoir 10 56 108 m3 capacity with increased water volume of 3 28 108 m3 comparison of volume change contribution among reservoirs indicates that the variations of total volume of catchment a shown in fig 6 c were dominated by longyangxia reservoir the largest reservoir with total capacity of 247 108 m3 in catchment b the variations of total volume shown in fig 6 d were mainly caused by the water impoundment of wangjiaya reservoir and fengjiashan reservoir with total capacity of 0 94 108 m3 and 3 89 108 m3 respectively 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainty analyses of identifying newly impounded reservoirs three of the 14 reservoirs with registered impoundment times were not successfully identified as mentioned in section 4 1 table 5 whether a reservoir could be identified largely depends on the size of the reservoir and the impounding time which affect whether the abrupt change of inundation area can be reflected in the ndwi time series and the number of pixels with such changes as shown by the example in fig 7 specifically daxia reservoir and zhiganglaka reservoir were not detected due to no significant newly expanded inundation areas but only insignificantly widened river their inundation area changes were too small to be detected daxia from about 200 m 13000 m to 250 m 13000 m and zhiganglaka from 200 m 7000 m to 250 m 7000 m compared with the 500 m 500 m pixel size of modis data the huangheyuan reservoir was not detected due to gradual impoundment in year 2001 which leads to a very short term gradual rise in the beginning of the ndwi time series as shown in fig 7 b the bfast method was unable to detect abrupt rise occurring at the starts or ends of the study period as the pre change of after change period is too short to be recognized as statistically significant in long term analysis bfast literature add here our tests indicate that abrupt changes occurring at least two years distance from the start end of the time series are safe to be detected for the small reservoirs such as zhiganglaka and banduo the mixed pixel effect may also lead to less arcuate estimate of abrupt change dates additionally the reference of registered power generation dates the exactly starting date may be different from the reference of remote sensing method statistically when most significant change occurred which may explain the difference between the registered impounding dates and the remote sensing detected dates 5 2 uncertainties of reservoir water storage estimation in this study we adopted multi source remote sensing observations to estimate the interannual and seasonal variations of impounded water volume of reservoirs unavoidably the estimated results are limited by the resolution of images landsat and dem accuracy major factors affecting the uncertainties in estimated water storage volume changes include 1 the accuracy of landsat derived reservoir outlines 2 the quantity of dem data over exposed terrain for calculation of submerged volume 3 the uncertainty of the statistical area volume relationship used in filling missing values in a few seasons the former two factors determine the accuracy of estimated reservoir water level and volume changes and the last factor accounts for the accuracy of filled data in the time series of water volume uncertainty source 1 when estimating water levels for each reservoir the average shoreline elevation changes were used to indicate reservoir water level changes in this procedure the water level uncertainty source includes 1 when defining study extents as the upstream ends were changing unless upstream ends was another dam some river channels were included as reservoir this influence on water levels is limited by the small portion of included channels in the shoreline and the influence on water storage is limited by its location of upstream end where water bodies are relatively narrow and the storage variation are not significant 2 when modeling the water level change by using a horizontally flat plane to intersect terrain is not mathematically strict thus water levels based on average shoreline elevations are representative values instead of comprehensively simulated measurements 3 when averaging the elevation of shoreline pixels as shoreline pixels can be a variety of land cover types the difference between estimated representative water level and actual water level was reduced by statistical noise removal as mentioned in section 3 2 to evaluate the accuracy estimated water levels were compared with in situ measured water levels only two reservoirs in the study area have official long term in situ water level data provided by the yrccmwr http www yrcc gov cn zxfw sqsz fig 8 a shows the comparison between the remote sensing derived water level and in situ measurements at longyangxia reservoir under the condition of employing all related images with 30 m spatial resolution the rmse of estimated water level time series is 5 02 m about 29 of the magnitude of intra annual water level change 17 m indicating the overall error of estimated water levels the difference between average estimated water level and average measured water level shows a systematic bias of 0 69 m indicating the influence of limited reliability of dem data and the mae after correcting systematic error is 3 54 m indicating the fluctuating error when estimating water level changes the accuracy of water level was influenced by the quantity of terrain information offered by the dem if dem was acquired at high water level terrain under water surface would not be depicted by applied dem and thus the accuracy would be significantly limited such as liujiaxia reservoir as shown in fig 8 b the elevation of water surface offered by dem relative elevation of 0 m was higher than many seasons this led to low accuracy in water level estimation the rmse of estimated water level time series is 6 18 m about 69 of the magnitude of intra annual water level change 9 m and the mae of estimated water level time series after correcting systematic bias of 4 46 m is 3 49 m to quantify the uncertainty of estimating water levels as in situ independent data in other reservoirs are not readily available due to financial political or legal considerations we used a comparison between water level results that are based on two independent dem observations fig 9 shows the consistency of estimated seasonal water levels in 30 chosen reservoirs which have close quantity of exposed terrain in two employed dem datasets for representativeness over the number of reservoirs the 30 chosen reservoirs have 10 each of reservoirs with inundation area between 0 01 0 1 km2 0 1 1 km2 and 1 10 km2 as 143 of 149 reservoirs have average seasonal inundation area in these ranges water level results from srtm 1 arc second global dem data and aster gdem v2 data have a coefficient of determination of over 0 99 while the correlation relationship is close to y 1 0 x b with a general bias b of about 1 36 m uncertainty source 2 when estimating storage volumes for each reservoir the volume above dem surface and below multi temporal water levels was calculated to indicate reservoir storage volume changes the reliability of dem influences the uncertainty of calculating storage volume using the estimated water level and the bathymetry dem as the underwater terrain is not provided in dem data existing storage volume when dem was acquired was not calculated the quantity of unexposed terrain increased the uncertainty of this study this scenario wouldn t change catchment scale estimated results because 1 when srtm dem data was acquired in february 2000 the reservoir water storages in the yellow river basin were mostly in lower water stages in the dry season as indicated by the drastically increasing days without flow 19 days in 1972 82 days in1982 and 260 days in 1998 zusman 2000 the remained water storage had limited basin wide influence 2 among 149 examined reservoirs for 47 reservoirs newly impounded after 2000 srtm dem offered sufficiently exposed terrain for volume estimation 3 for 14 of 102 existing reservoirs the estimation results of aster dem were chosen as final results according to r2 of area volume curves as described in section 3 2 the use of backup aster dem reduced the uncalculated water storage under dem surface and provided averagely 127 increment of estimated volume as shown in table 6 the chosen aster results have higher r2 of area volume curves thus also more confidence that dem captured low water level terrain which suits the relationship described terrain instead of high water level terrain with only the upper part of the terrain that the relationship has mathematically described the retrieval in these reservoirs was significant while a small portion 4 of 14 of reservoirs has slight decrement averagely 5 5 instead of increment for these reservoirs volumes based on aster dem were also kept as estimation results because the aster results were chosen due to higher r2 of area volume curve thus have less uncertainty from uncertainty source 3 and higher overall confidence as further expounded in this section to quantify the uncertainty caused by the calculation of seasonal and annual water storage for each reservoir each season and year an uncertain volume was calculated 5 v s t d s e a s o n a season e s t d s e a s o n 6 v s t d y e a r a year e s t d y e a r where a season and a year are the seasonal and annual inundation area estimated using water level and bathymetry dem respectively e s t d s e a s o n and e s t d y e a r are the standard deviations of elevations in seasonal and annual shoreline dem pixels when estimating water levels respectively the changes of v s t d s e a s o n and v s t d y e a r were added in figs 5 and 6 as error bars to illustrate the uncertainty of volume results the reason v s t d s e a s o n and v s t d y e a r was calculated to quantify the uncertainty is in the study area with high altitudinal drop a reservoir has an overall slope across the water surface and its terrain thus after averaging shoreline elevation to estimate water levels due to the overall slope depth would be underestimated near the upstream end and overestimated near the downstream end though this partly neutralized the effects on volume it brought uncertainty the absolute uncertainty without consideration of neutralized part can be described by multiplying the entire water surface area and the magnitude of shoreline elevation change across the reservoir which was represented by the standard deviation of shoreline elevation uncertainty source 3 when filling gaps in time series for each reservoir missing volume results were reconstructed according to the area volume curve among all 149 examined reservoirs averagely 32 26 of storage volume in seasonal time series were reconstructed to quantify the uncertainty caused by filling values in time series for each reservoir an uncertain volume v bias was calculated 7 v bias v a v e r e v ave where v ave is the average calculated volume of successfully estimated seasons and v a v e r e the area volume curve retrieved volumes in these seasons the changes of v bias were added in fig 6 as error bars to illustrate the uncertainty of seasonal volume results to describe the overall confidence of estimating storage volume changes we used 1 the value of r2 in the area volume curve of each reservoir to describe the confidence of estimation accuracy and 2 the portion that seasonal time series were filled to illustrate the uncertainty under conditions of different quantity of gaps appearing in time series table 7 the coefficients of determination r2 which were calculated in curve fitting when filling missing values in seasonal results were significantly lower in reservoirs where missing rate reached 50 higher r2 indicate higher applicability of area volume relationship and higher possibility that more terrain was offered by dem thus r2 also implies the confidence of the overall accuracy in estimating the long term storage volume changes which is affected by both the completion of time series and the quantity of terrain offered in bathymetry dem considering the area volume curves of longyangxia and liujiaxia this table describes the general confidence that for most reservoirs estimation results have accuracy between the results of longyangxia reservoir and liujiaxia reservoir according to the r2 of each reservoir 138 of 149 examined reservoirs was estimated with the value of r2 higher than 0 8 for 102 of 149 reservoirs with r2 higher than 0 9 and 57 of them between 0 95 0 99 we have confidence that the inner walls of most reservoirs are exposed when dem data was acquired such as longyangxia reservoir for the other 10 reservoirs with r2 between 0 6 0 8 the terrain of these reservoirs in dem data are more possibly describing the surface when water levels were high causing more uncertainty due to uncertainty source 1 and uncertainty source 2 such as liujiaxia reservoir to quantify the overall uncertainty of estimating interannual and seasonal storage volume changes for each reservoir a ratio of volume was calculated 8 ratio v std v max 100 where v std is the average of v s t d s e a s o n and v max the maximum seasonal estimated volume results indicating the reservoir capacity higher value of ratio shows higher uncertainty of water storage volume estimation generally using estimated water level with error about 0 15 0 30 pixel of employed data seasonal water storage change of each reservoir was estimated with 4 245 uncertainty compared with the historical maximum water storage table 8 according to the ratio of each reservoir 131 of 149 reservoirs have uncertain volume for 0 90 of the capacity 113 reservoirs have uncertain volume for 10 70 and many values of the ratio concentrates between 30 and 50 though most reservoirs have similar confidence of accuracy described by r2 of area volume curve the uncertainty varies among reservoirs during calculating the values of ratio was influenced by a balance between the pixel number of shoreline dem which causes higher accuracy of estimated water level but also higher standard deviation of shoreline elevation when reservoir was larger and the inundation area of the reservoir which causes higher value of uncertain volume when reservoir was larger as well as the terrain information offered by study data which causes higher values of v max when more terrain was exposed above water surface in dem in this study we use the analysis of v s t d y e a r v s t d s e a s o n v bias m i s s i n g r a t e r2 and ratio of reservoirs to describe the uncertainty of estimating seasonal water storage volume changes as for annual estimation results the major differences between seasonal and annual estimation results include 1 annual estimation results are considered to be more accurate than seasonal results as annual composite images were less affected by clouds and thus nearly no post processed filling values 2 water volume in annual results are reasonably higher than in seasonal results as the estimate method based on low ndwi threshold extracts maximum impoundment area after generating annual and seasonal composite images 5 3 the implication of reservoir impoundment in river discharge alternation to evaluate the magnitude of flow regulation resulting from water storage change of reservoirs and the long term alternation of local water resource we referred to previous research of streamflow wang et al 2018 and compared estimated water storage volume of studied reservoirs with the river discharge data based on in situ measurement by comparing relative increment as shown in fig 10 the cumulative total increment of reservoir water storage along the main stem and major tributaries had considerable contribution to the cumulative runoff increment the water storage of reservoirs in catchment a is highly consistent with the increase and decrease trend of the runoff in this area with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 576 quantitatively for each year from 2000 to 2016 the increased water storage relative to 2000 in reservoirs accounts for 262 537 average 87 of the yearly increased relative to 2000 water discharge variations in catchment a in contrast the total water storage volume increment of reservoirs in catchment b is equivalent to 14 10 average 2 of the water discharge increment from catchment a to catchment b according to the variation analysis by wang et al 2018 the average annual water discharge from 2000 to 2016 was about 26 km3 at the downstream end of catchment a xiaheyan station and 23 km3 near the downstream end of catchment b at the main stem of yellow river tongguan station compared with the general runoff measured at xiaheyan station which indicates the water discharge of upper yellow river the water storage of reservoirs in catchment a was 4 29 average 14 of the average annual water discharge in catchment b the drainage area of wei river the water storage of studied reservoirs had significant quarterly fluctuations as shown in section 4 2 in the upstream area of tongguan compared with the general runoff measured at tongguan station which indicates the water discharge of the upper and middle yellow river water storage of reservoirs in catchment b accounted for 0 17 0 80 average 0 61 of the average annual runoff while reservoirs in catchment a accounting for 5 33 with an average of 16 though the catchment b wei river is one of the largest tributaries of the yellow river the change of its reservoirs water storage had limited influence on the runoff change compared with catchment a 6 summary this study presents analysis on the distribution characteristics and the long term changes of the water storage of reservoirs built in two major catchments in the upper reach of the yellow river by using multi source remote sensing data we are able to detect the construction of new reservoirs and to estimate seasonal and annual changes of water storage associated with reservoir impoundment enabling evaluation of the impact of the reservoir regulation on river discharges and the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resource along the river we identified 47 new reservoirs built between 2000 and 2018 in the studied catchments with modis data together with the 102 reservoirs dammed before 2000 we provide quantitative estimation of the annual and seasonal water storage changes of 149 reservoirs from 2000 to 2018 by employing landsat images and the srtm dem data as well as aster gdem data the uncertainty of identifying new reservoirs and estimating water storage changes were discussed and evaluated with registered reservoir construction information and in situ water level data last we referred to streamflow variation data provided by published literature and evaluated reservoirs water impoundment impacts on river discharge alternation the main conclusions of this study are summarized as following 1 with considerable number of newly impounded reservoirs the water volume held in reservoirs demonstrated a remarkable increasing trend with significant seasonal variations during 2000 and 2018 2 in accordance with registered capacities of some reservoirs and runoff change process of two stations the water storage changes of large reservoirs are closely associated with river discharge variations and the impoundment of large reservoirs in catchment a shows a dominant role in affecting the discharge of the upper yellow river 3 although the applicability of area volume relationship shows high confidence of estimating reservoir water storage changes in the yellow river uncertainty analysis indicates unignorable estimation error for specific seasonal storage volume the remote sensing based reservoir detection and storage estimation used in this study can be transferred to applications in other basin wide regions the development of higher resolution shorter revisit cycle multi spectral image data such as sentinel 2 msi data available from 2015 and high accuracy dem data with reconstruction of underwater terrain will enable more accurate and detailed measurements of long term reservoir storage variations which can help evaluate the impact of human interferences on regional hydrologic process and provide scientific basis for catchment scale water resource management through regulating

5543,the impoundment and regulation information of reservoirs is essential for water resource management and hydrological analysis along the upper reach of yellow river in northern china a large number of reservoirs have been built or are being built while information about the distribution and impoundment of these reservoirs is rather limited here we compiled an inventory of reservoirs 0 01 km2 in two catchments in the upper reach of the yellow river and estimated the seasonal water storage variations of reservoirs associated with impoundment during 2000 and 2018 by using a suite of remote sensing observations the inventory of 149 reservoirs in the study region consists of 102 existing reservoirs built before 2000 retrieved from google earth high resolution imagery or available publications and 47 new reservoirs constructed during 2000 2018 which we detected by using time series analysis of ndwi derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis surface reflectance data to estimate water storage changes of all reservoirs associated with impoundment we combined representative inundation extents of reservoirs in each season of the year retrieved from sequential landsat images on the google earth engine gee platform and shoreline topography information derived from the shuttle radar topography mission dem data the results demonstrate significant seasonal variations mostly impoundment in autumn winter and release in spring summer as well as a rapid increasing trend of water storage held in reservoirs particularly in catchment a the headwater of the yellow river the total water storage increased by about 16 gt from 2000 to 2018 about 25 percent of which is due to impoundment of newly constructed reservoirs the remote sensing based results were validated by long term in situ water level data of 2 reservoirs and construction information of 14 new reservoirs uncertainty analysis shows acceptable accuracy in monitoring storage changes on the annual scale indicated by high confidence in area volume curves for most reservoirs 102 reservoirs with r2 of area volume curve higher than 0 9 while uncertainty is unneglectable on the seasonal scale in accordance with streamflow variation data from 2000 to 2016 provided by published literature our estimation indicates that the water resource in the upper yellow river has been more highly regulated by reservoir impoundment and the seasonal regulation exerts significant impact on catchment runoff process averagely about 17 of annual discharge keywords reservoir remote sensing water storage river discharge yellow river dem 1 introduction impounding water in reservoirs is one of the primary mechanisms for coping with the variability of water supply and demand the construction and operation of over 1 million dams have provided a variety of services important to a growing human population lehner et al 2011 globally water from reservoirs supplies an estimated 30 40 of irrigated areas dams 2000 contributes 20 of global hydroelectric power demirbas 2009 and serves numerous other beneficial functions including flood control navigation and recreation meanwhile reservoirs have significantly altered the hydrological cycle and also severely affected ecosystem dynamics and fluxes in river networks reservoirs change seasonal hydrologic regimes with monthly increases or decreases in streamflow up to 30 haddeland et al 2006 for examples in the brazos river basin in the united states with large and increasing water withdrawals and reservoirs vogl and lopes 2009 compared naturalized and anthropogenic impacted river flowing regimes and identified obvious decreases in the frequency of high flow events in spring and winter and increased summer low flows for the murrumbidgee river in australia kingsford and thomas 2004 described a river flow reduction to about one third of the natural median flow and the degradation of the major wetland caused by damming and subsequent water withdrawals given these significant alterations the impacts of reservoirs should be included in predictions of current and future water availability floods and droughts the new versions of some global models seek to take the impact of reservoirs into account bierkens 2015 the global characterization of reservoirs is an urgent need and also a main challenge for the development of global hydrological models however for the vast majority of reservoirs around the world their locations and storage information is either not measured or not readily available due to financial political or legal considerations particularly newly dammed reservoirs are of increasing concern to researchers because their non negligible influences on downstream river discharges but they remained poorly inventoried or monitored thus far this unbalanced spatial distribution of observational data makes it challenging to assess the impact of human alterations on the land hydrologic cycle which has been not fully represented in most of the current models in this context remote sensing is a promising tool to overcome the difficulty in accessing information about reservoirs the general procedure to monitor storage changes consists of associating water area and surface elevation frappart et al 2006 reservoir area stage volume relationships are especially interesting as they allow operational observation of stored volume variations annor et al 2009a duan and bastiaanssen 2013 eilander et al 2014 song et al 2013 through a combination of direct observations of elevation and surface area along with documented reservoir configurations at capacity gao et al 2012 estimated storage time series for 34 large size reservoirs globally however the above mentioned studies may be limited to certain large water bodies as a result of applied satellite altimetry measurements which were derived from narrow swath coarse cross track spacing long along track path length or short mission periods of the satellite altimeters alsdorf et al 2007 crétaux and birkett 2006 gao et al 2012 therefore the area stage volume relationship method from optical and altimetry observations might be insufficient to estimate catchment scale water storage variations with limited coverage on small and medium sized reservoirs especially for the newly dammed ones the main objective of this study is to quantify the water storage variations of catchment scale reservoirs on both seasonal and inter annual timescales especially considering the influences of year by year accumulated water stored in newly dammed reservoirs the yellow river located in northern china owns a large number of dams constructed for hydropower generation flood control and agricultural irrigation where natural river flows could be highly influenced by increased water impoundments and reservoir operation schemes we try to represent the alteration degree of natural streamflow conditions that might have been affected by dam construction since the year 2000 with this objectivity we firstly detected all newly constructed reservoirs in the catchments by using time series reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and then estimated the water storage changes of all reservoirs by deriving time series of inundation extents based on landsat data achieve accessible in the google earth engine gee platform pekel et al 2016 and reservoir waterlines based on multi source digital elevation models dems the document is organized as follows section 2 introduces the geographic and climatological conditions of the investigated catchments of the yellow river section 3 presents the data and method used for the compilation of reservoir inventory and estimations of reservoir storage changes sections 4 and 5 analyze the results uncertainties and discuss the influences of reservoir impoundment on the river discharge and section 6 concludes the study 2 study area the yellow river serves as an important water source for the arid and semi arid north western and northern china it is the second longest river in china and ranked as the sixth longest river of the world with the total length estimated to be approximately 5464 km and the drainage basin covering 75 3 104 km2 li et al 2015 this study focusses on two catchments denoted as catchment a and catchment b located in the upper reach and middle reach of the yellow river respectively fig 1 catchment a is the headwater region of the yellow river main stem extending from the northeastern tibetan plateau to the loess plateau with overall altitudinal drop up to 1000 m within this catchment dense streams are developed in the mountainous regions forming several major tributaries of the yellow river catchment b covering small scale mountains surrounding the tibetan plateau is the source region of the wei river the longest tributary of the yellow river both the catchment a and b comprise two important headwater areas of the yellow river due to influences of the southeast asia monsoon climate in the upper yellow river basin shows evident seasonality with approximately 85 of the annual precipitation falling during the wet summer wang et al 2007 prior studies show that the discharge of the yellow river has decreased in the past decades and intensified human activities are probably the main reason li et al 2017 the yellow river is highly regulated with a large number of reservoirs in the whole basin over 3000 reservoirs a registered number of 3147 was published in 2011 by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources have been constructed hundreds of dams were built on the main stem and major tributary channels directly regulating the streamflow 3 data and

extent considering the easy availability for the broad scale we used the modis time series data to identify newly impounded reservoirs in this study region the mod09a1 surface reflectance product from february 2000 to may 2018 accessed at the laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov was employed the mod09a1 v6 product provides the surface spectral reflectance of terra modis bands 1 7 at 500 m resolution after the correction for atmospheric conditions such as gasses aerosols and rayleigh scattering each pixel in mod09a1 images contains the best possible l2g observation during an 8 day period which is selected on the criteria of high observation coverage low view angle absence of clouds or cloud shadow and aerosol loading vermote 2015 the temporal resolution of 8 days maximizes the coverage of cloud free data and maintains sufficient time sampling frequency for detection of land cover changes associated with newly impounded reservoirs to extract water inundation area of reservoirs time series landsat images accessible on the gee platform were used table 1 gee is a cloud based platform for planetary scale environmental data analysis with computational infrastructure optimized for geospatial data and a large repository of publicly available geospatial datasets including the united states geological survey usgs l1t landsat archive gorelick et al 2017 specifically we used the landsat data acquired from january 2000 to august 2018 that are assigned as landsat tier 1 in the usgs archive the usgs reorganized the landsat archive into a tiered collection landsat scenes with the highest data quality are placed into tier 1 and are considered suitable for time series analysis and the geo registration of tier 1 scenes is consistent and within a prescribed tolerance 12 m root mean square error rmse dwyer et al 2018 this tolerance is less than the width of 0 5 pixel can be considered sufficient for change detection townshend et al 1992 to assist the inundation area extraction we also referred to another landsat derived dataset the jrc global surface water mapping layers v1 0 a dataset with high resolution mapping results of global surface water which is also accessible on gee pekel et al 2016 it contains max extent maximum water inundation extent data which indicates anywhere water has ever been detected based on long term satellite observations acquired from march 1984 to october 2015 this dataset makes it possible to effectively mask out non water area of landsat images employed in this study two widely used dems the srtm dem acquired in february 2000 by airborne radar techniques and the aster dem data farr et al 2007 tachikawa et al 2011 both at a resolution of 30 m were used as the reservoir bathymetry reference to estimate the water storage variations of reservoirs specifically usgs srtm 1 arc second global dem data were the default dem in this study due to higher accuracy with absolute height accuracy better than 6 2 m in eurasia and consistent reference time of acquisition farr et al 2007 the aster gdem v2 which was produced from stereo scene pairs with an global average absolute height accuracy of 17 m at the 95 confidence level tachikawa et al 2011 was used as the backup dem in case of srtm dem capturing terrain of some reservoirs at high water levels aster dem may offer auxiliary terrain information below the reservoir water surface of srtm dem if the two dem data sets cannot provide the exposed reservoir bathymetry information of low water level the estimation of this month will be interpolated by the adjacent records with uncertainty considered it is worth to mention that the relative height accuracies of the two dem data that are directly associated with the reconstruction quality of reservoir storage variations are much lower than the global absolute accuracy estimates in addition some information about the registered capacity of large sized reservoirs such as nazixia reservoir jiudianxia reservoir wangjiaya reservoir and fengjiashan reservoir were collected from published literatures jianliang et al 2011 liu and su 2013 tongqing et al 1996 yang et al 2011 and the registered capacity of laxiwa reservoir and longyangxia reservoir were provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn hhyl sngc 3 2 methodology with the aim of estimating water storage changes of reservoirs this study scheme consists of four major components 1 searching and inventorying reservoirs constructed before 2000 by manual traversal along the river segments on high resolution google earth imagery 2 identifying and supplementing newly impounded reservoirs during 2000 2018 by applying the breaks for additive season and trend bfast algorithm to modis ndwi time series 3 extracting inundation area of each reservoir based on landsat data 4 estimating impounded and regulated water storages of each reservoir by integrating the reservoir inundation area with dem bathymetry reference data 3 2 1 generation of initial reservoir inventory in the studied catchments in order to inventory the reservoirs constructed before 2000 hereafter referred to old reservoir inventory we mapped a representative spatial extent for each reservoir hereafter referred to study extents which includes the main water body of the reservoir and potential water body in case the water body extends providing study area for further estimation of inundation area and storage changes this inventorying process including three steps 1 to identify the locations of reservoirs we overlaid drainage networks on google earth imagery then visually identified dams along the drainage networks 2 to map the study extents of reservoirs based on landsat imagery we browsed historical 2000 2018 google earth images and mapped study extents with accordance to the long term changes of inundation areas 3 to check and correct the compiled data we further referred to the existing reservoir inventory data walter 2018 which provides water extents of each reservoir specifically we extracted the drainage networks by applying flow direction and flow accumulation calculation jenson and domingue 1988 after obtaining the flow accumulation of the study area using srtm dem data the drainage networks were determined directly based on the given threshold value in this study 600 km2 was selected as the threshold the extracted drainage networks are shown in fig 2 delineating primary and secondary tributaries of the yellow river in catchment a and the wei river in catchment b along the drainage networks we defined study extents of reservoirs with maximum inundation area width greater than a threshold 90 m 90 m 9 landsat pixels to filter out too small reservoirs when mapping study extents with accordance to historical images the located downstream ends of reservoirs were corresponding dams and the upstream ends were manually judged and edited at the locations where the widths of channels do not obviously differ from the connected natural river channels as the locations of upstream ends are changing the quantity of included river channels brought uncertainty of further estimation as discussed in section 5 2 3 2 2 identification of newly impounded reservoirs along the river segments reservoirs built after 2000 cannot be fully revealed from google earth images we identified reservoirs constructed during 2000 2018 hereafter referred to new reservoirs by detecting certain type of abrupt changes in ndwi time series obtained from modis images the detailed information of the applied method can be referred to zhang et al 2018 in short the algorithm is based on the main idea that impoundment of newly dammed reservoirs will lead to the conversion from land to water in the reservoir area causing a sudden rise of ndwi time series after reservoir impoundment such abrupt changes in time series can be detected by the bfast decomposition and break point detection verbesselt et al 2010a b watts and laffan 2014 further obtaining the location of newly impounded reservoirs and corresponding date of impoundment to improve the algorithm efficiency we limited the detection area to potential locations of new reservoirs specifically within the 5 km buffering area of the drainage networks and within the max extent water area based on jrc global surface water mapping layers the effectiveness of bfast detection largely depends on parameter settings such as the minimal interval of abrupt changes season model and maximum iteration times we referred to the study of zhang et al 2018 and applied the optimized parameter and threshold settings to conduct the bfast algorithm in the yellow river basin for many newly constructed reservoirs the newly appeared inundation areas are widened rivers caused by newly water impoundment after dam construction on river channels thus we applied bfast algorithm in a pixel by pixel procedure instead of region by region which is less exhaustive to avoid land to water converted pixels from being missed in detection pixels of area converted from land to water can be successfully identified as shown in fig 3 a considering the probable presence of detected false information which is not caused by new reservoir construction we manually inspected the detection results and excluded the abrupt changes caused by natural waterbody changes expanded area of existing reservoirs or newly appeared wet farm lands by overlaying them over google earth and the old reservoir inventory as shown in fig 3 b d 3 2 3 extraction of reservoir water inundation area in gee for each reservoir inundation extents were extracted from landsat images archived on gee this study employed segmentation of ndwi images to derive annual and seasonal representative inundation area for each reservoir for annual representation of area extraction we generated a composite landsat image for each year by applying the ee algorithms landsat simplecomposite method provided in gee this method computes a landsat toa top of atmosphere reflectance image from all available raw landsat scenes obtained in the year resulting in 18 cloud free annual composite images for each reservoir with accordance to a cloud score assigned at each pixel using specified algorithms for landsat data limited by the amount of available images in each season this method was unstable when compositing seasonal images thus each of 74 seasonal composite images of each reservoir was generated from median value at each pixel across the stack of all available landsat surface reflectance tier 1 data in the season based on the composite images ndwi was calculated and an initial threshold of 0 05 was used to segment the image into water area and non water area as shown in fig 2 the derived primary reservoir inundation extents may include missed water area caused by ice or clouds and false water area caused by mountain shadows or too low ndwi threshold the pixels of false water area were then masked out by referring to the water max extent area of jrc global surface water mapping layers 3 2 4 estimation of reservoir water impoundment and regulations this study estimated the shoreline elevation of each reservoir based on annual and seasonal primary inundation outlines and the dem as the bathymetry reference first cloud free annual inundation extents were integrated with dem for obtaining the general distribution of shoreline elevation and slope obtaining s t d a described below then this information was utilized to remove noise shoreline dem based on an assumption for each individual reservoir the seasonal magnitude of elevation as well as slope deviations among shoreline pixels should be uniform across the study period while noise not shoreline or special parts such as dams pixels increasing the deviations the threshold settings of removal are 1 t a i a v e a i 1 3 s t d a i 1 2 t a j a v e a j 1 2 s t d a 3 t s j a v e s j 1 2 s t d a where t a i a v e a i 1 and s t d a i 1 are the threshold in the i th removal of annual extent modifying the average and the standard deviation of values after the i 1 th removal respectively t s j t a j a v e s j 1 a v e a j 1 and s t d a are the threshold in the j th removal of seasonal extents the threshold in the j th removal of annual extents the average values after the j 1 th removal of seasonal extents the average values after the j 1 th removal of annual extents and the standard deviation of values in a high quality annual result manually chosen from annual removal results respectively for each reservoir the dem optimization shown in fig 2 contains a noise removing step and a missed parts patching step the dem based noise removal includes four steps 1 to erase region with too high or too low elevation or slope according to t a i in annual extents and then to use the result of a certain year that erased extents have least noise to obtain s t d a 2 to erase region with too high elevation or slope according to t a j in annual extents resulting shadow free annual water extents 3 to erase the region with too high elevation or slope according to t s j in seasonal extents resulting shadow free seasonal water extent which includes more missing extent caused by clouds unscanned pixels in etm imagery and over removal and 4 to remove pixels with too low elevation according to t s j in both annual and seasonal shoreline dem to remove outliners of missing extents in shoreline dem resulting noise removed shoreline dem generally for reservoirs across the entire study area considering a normal distribution of appeared noise pixels limited by t s j and t a j both ave 2 std the portion of removed shoreline pixels in each removal is about 5 of the remnants then the seasonal removal was executed for generally 5 times and annual for generally 1 time thus about 23 1 0 95 5 of seasonal shoreline pixels and about 5 1 0 95 1 of annual shoreline pixels were removed estimation of water level was based on the average elevation of noise removed shoreline dem the purpose of removing noise of too high or too low values separately high value first was to avoid over removal of low value noise specifically due to low threshold of ndwi extraction the result of primary inundation area contains non water area with high elevation and slope which may cause the removal of shoreline pixels mistaken as noise pixels the missed parts patching step was executed after the noise removing step after estimating water level complete dem of impounded area was required for estimating volume but missing extents caused by frozen area clouds and shadows exist as holes in reservoir dem as shown in fig 2 to patch up the missing extent we merged all noise removed water extents to extract dem of region ever detected as water in the study extent resulting complete dem of impounded area water storage was estimated by calculating the volume above reservoir dem and below the estimated water level plane to estimate water storage of a complete water area while excluding area with higher elevation than water level negative depth area such as land area and some frozen area water inundation area estimation was based on the area of water level plane intersect by reservoir dem fig 2 after applying the mentioned procedures estimation failed or resulted zero in some seasons as the success rate was limited by the number and quality of available landsat images and possibility that water level was lower than the surface of dem to obtain full time series of volume change water storage volume data in these missing seasons need to be rebuilt for each reservoir estimated inundation area and water storage was used to generate area volume curve according to a considerably robust relationship between a reservoir s storage volume and its area annor et al 2009b liebe et al 2005 sawunyama et al 2006 which can be expressed as 4 v a area b where v represents the reservoir water volume area is its inundation area and a and b the parameters to be determined after determining a and b by curve fitting missing volume was rebuilt by inundation area specifically missing inundation area data was filled with multi year average estimated area of the corresponding season then missing volume data was filled using area volume curve determined by successfully estimated data when executing curve fitting the coefficients of determination shows fitting effect of the relationship for each reservoir which was influenced by 1 the applicability of the relationship for local terrain as the relationship has higher applicability for reservoirs with terrain similar to a square pyramid diagonally cut in half 2 whether dem was more possibly acquired when water level was high thus terrain under water surface was not offered this can cause low applicability of the relationship and failed estimations of many seasons if a reservoir has low coefficient of determination r2 0 8 we used backup dem aster to recalculate seasonal water storage for newly impounded reservoirs we kept result calculated by default dem as estimation results unless the result calculated by backup dem showed significantly higher coefficients of determination due to more confidence that when dem was acquired more terrain was exposed above water surface and caused the applicability of the relationship for local terrain for existing reservoirs calculation result with higher coefficients of determination was chosen as estimation result 4 results and analyses 4 1 analyses of newly impounded and existing reservoirs this study identified 1289 pixels out of 3 369 270 examined pixels within the buffered area of the drainage network as areas converted from land to water by manual check with google earth and landsat imagery we inventoried a total of 47 newly constructed reservoirs as shown in fig 4 both newly impounded and existing reservoirs are mainly built in the area with high altitudinal drop compared to existing reservoirs dammed before 2000 most of the new reservoirs are distributed along the main stream shown as bold blue line in fig 4 instead of tributaries of the yellow river and wei river as shown in table 2 in catchment a about 50 of new reservoirs were constructed along the main stream of the yellow river while the percentage is only 6 3 for existing reservoirs in catchment b 42 new reservoirs are constructed along the main stream of the wei river while only 1 out of the total 22 existing reservoirs are constructed along the main stream and other 21 reservoirs are all located in its tributaries compared with the 102 existing reservoirs most of the 47 new reservoirs are built in medium sizes 1 10 km2 instead of in small or giant sizes table 3 in catchment a 80 new reservoirs have inundation area over 1 km2 larger than about 91 of existing reservoirs but no new reservoir has been built as large as 100 km2 while there are two such giant sized reservoirs constructed before 2000 in catchment b about 42 new reservoirs have inundation area over 1 km2 larger than 73 of existing reservoirs this comparison indicates that since 2000 a considerable amount of medium sized reservoirs has been constructed and the average size is markedly larger than that of previously built reservoirs the impoundment storage magnitude varies largely among new reservoirs built in different dates and with different sizes the magnitude of impoundment after the construction can be evaluated by the water storage volume estimation of the corresponding season table 4 generally about 77 of all 47 identified new reservoirs have increased water storage volume over 100 104 m3 in the newly impounded season while about 39 of them exceed 1000 104 m3 the magnitude of newly impoundment also varies among new reservoirs with different times of newly impoundment in catchment a about 55 of new reservoirs over 1000 104 m3 were newly impounded after 2008 in catchment b all new reservoirs with over 1000 104 m3 were newly impounded before 2004 some later constructed reservoirs have significantly larger impoundment than other reservoirs especially two large reservoirs with drastically increased impounded water volume over 10000 104 m3 in catchment a this helps to explain sudden rise in water storage volume change of newly impounded reservoirs in catchment a as mentioned in section 4 2 the accuracy of identified new reservoirs was evaluated by referring to published power generation time in the hydroelectric power stations of registered newly impounded reservoirs provided by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn hhyl sngc there is a total of 14 new reservoirs build after 2000 in the published records in comparison to our detected 47 new ones which indicates only a small part of new reservoirs are documented in the existed publication among the 14 reservoirs with registered impoundment times 11 of them were successfully identified within the date of detected break points in the ndwi time series table 5 with errors within the range of 1 3 seasons 3 were not detected and 2 were identified with biased impoundment time reasons for the failed detection are related to the size of the reservoir and the impounding time close to the beginning or ending of the time series which are discussed in section 5 1 4 2 interannual and seasonal variations of reservoir water impoundment this study examined the water storage variations of all 149 reservoirs in the studied catchments with one exception the exceptional reservoir panhe reservoir in catchment a cannot be estimated due to its half artificially constructed inner wall plate shaped terrain which is not captured in our used dem the estimated annual and seasonal water storages can indicate annual impounded water accumulation and intra annual regulations of reservoirs respectively the total volume changes of all studied reservoirs in the two investigated catchments are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the increasing water stored in reservoirs as shown in fig 5 indicates more highly regulated runoff process of the yellow river in the past 18 years from 2000 to 2018 the storage volumes of reservoirs in catchment a and catchment b show rapid increasing trends with linear rates of 0 211 km3 per year in catchment a and 0 0067 km3 per year in catchment b newly impounded reservoirs occupied considerable portions about 40 of the increment of all reservoirs in catchment a and about 70 in catchment b the amount of water stored in new reservoirs in catchment a shows nearly year to year steady increase during 2000 2018 for catchment b the amount of water volume stored in new reservoirs shows three distinctive stages a steady and slow increase during 2000 2003 relatively stable status during 2004 2013 and large inter annual variability in recent years 2015 2018 we also synthesized the time series of water storage variations at seasonal timescale as shown in fig 6 seasonal changes of reservoir water storage were significant the volume changes indicate that in the two catchments reservoirs mainly store water in autumn season 3 or winter season 4 and release in spring or summer season 1 or 2 one possible reason is that in the semi arid areas of the loess plateau the water demand due to agricultural irrigation has been mostly concentrated from spring to summer chen et al 2007 the total water storage variations of the catchments were dominated by the newly built large reservoirs as shown in fig 6 there was an abrupt increase of total water storage in newly built reservoirs in catchment a since the season 3 of 2014 the abrupt rise in this season was mainly caused by 1 considerable water impoundment 2 83 108 m3 of the newly built nazixia reservoir with registered total capacity of 7 33 108 m3 2 increased water impoundment of two earlier built new large reservoirs jiudianxia reservoir 9 08 108 m3 capacity with increased water volume of 3 17 108 m3 laxiwa reservoir 10 56 108 m3 capacity with increased water volume of 3 28 108 m3 comparison of volume change contribution among reservoirs indicates that the variations of total volume of catchment a shown in fig 6 c were dominated by longyangxia reservoir the largest reservoir with total capacity of 247 108 m3 in catchment b the variations of total volume shown in fig 6 d were mainly caused by the water impoundment of wangjiaya reservoir and fengjiashan reservoir with total capacity of 0 94 108 m3 and 3 89 108 m3 respectively 5 discussions 5 1 uncertainty analyses of identifying newly impounded reservoirs three of the 14 reservoirs with registered impoundment times were not successfully identified as mentioned in section 4 1 table 5 whether a reservoir could be identified largely depends on the size of the reservoir and the impounding time which affect whether the abrupt change of inundation area can be reflected in the ndwi time series and the number of pixels with such changes as shown by the example in fig 7 specifically daxia reservoir and zhiganglaka reservoir were not detected due to no significant newly expanded inundation areas but only insignificantly widened river their inundation area changes were too small to be detected daxia from about 200 m 13000 m to 250 m 13000 m and zhiganglaka from 200 m 7000 m to 250 m 7000 m compared with the 500 m 500 m pixel size of modis data the huangheyuan reservoir was not detected due to gradual impoundment in year 2001 which leads to a very short term gradual rise in the beginning of the ndwi time series as shown in fig 7 b the bfast method was unable to detect abrupt rise occurring at the starts or ends of the study period as the pre change of after change period is too short to be recognized as statistically significant in long term analysis bfast literature add here our tests indicate that abrupt changes occurring at least two years distance from the start end of the time series are safe to be detected for the small reservoirs such as zhiganglaka and banduo the mixed pixel effect may also lead to less arcuate estimate of abrupt change dates additionally the reference of registered power generation dates the exactly starting date may be different from the reference of remote sensing method statistically when most significant change occurred which may explain the difference between the registered impounding dates and the remote sensing detected dates 5 2 uncertainties of reservoir water storage estimation in this study we adopted multi source remote sensing observations to estimate the interannual and seasonal variations of impounded water volume of reservoirs unavoidably the estimated results are limited by the resolution of images landsat and dem accuracy major factors affecting the uncertainties in estimated water storage volume changes include 1 the accuracy of landsat derived reservoir outlines 2 the quantity of dem data over exposed terrain for calculation of submerged volume 3 the uncertainty of the statistical area volume relationship used in filling missing values in a few seasons the former two factors determine the accuracy of estimated reservoir water level and volume changes and the last factor accounts for the accuracy of filled data in the time series of water volume uncertainty source 1 when estimating water levels for each reservoir the average shoreline elevation changes were used to indicate reservoir water level changes in this procedure the water level uncertainty source includes 1 when defining study extents as the upstream ends were changing unless upstream ends was another dam some river channels were included as reservoir this influence on water levels is limited by the small portion of included channels in the shoreline and the influence on water storage is limited by its location of upstream end where water bodies are relatively narrow and the storage variation are not significant 2 when modeling the water level change by using a horizontally flat plane to intersect terrain is not mathematically strict thus water levels based on average shoreline elevations are representative values instead of comprehensively simulated measurements 3 when averaging the elevation of shoreline pixels as shoreline pixels can be a variety of land cover types the difference between estimated representative water level and actual water level was reduced by statistical noise removal as mentioned in section 3 2 to evaluate the accuracy estimated water levels were compared with in situ measured water levels only two reservoirs in the study area have official long term in situ water level data provided by the yrccmwr http www yrcc gov cn zxfw sqsz fig 8 a shows the comparison between the remote sensing derived water level and in situ measurements at longyangxia reservoir under the condition of employing all related images with 30 m spatial resolution the rmse of estimated water level time series is 5 02 m about 29 of the magnitude of intra annual water level change 17 m indicating the overall error of estimated water levels the difference between average estimated water level and average measured water level shows a systematic bias of 0 69 m indicating the influence of limited reliability of dem data and the mae after correcting systematic error is 3 54 m indicating the fluctuating error when estimating water level changes the accuracy of water level was influenced by the quantity of terrain information offered by the dem if dem was acquired at high water level terrain under water surface would not be depicted by applied dem and thus the accuracy would be significantly limited such as liujiaxia reservoir as shown in fig 8 b the elevation of water surface offered by dem relative elevation of 0 m was higher than many seasons this led to low accuracy in water level estimation the rmse of estimated water level time series is 6 18 m about 69 of the magnitude of intra annual water level change 9 m and the mae of estimated water level time series after correcting systematic bias of 4 46 m is 3 49 m to quantify the uncertainty of estimating water levels as in situ independent data in other reservoirs are not readily available due to financial political or legal considerations we used a comparison between water level results that are based on two independent dem observations fig 9 shows the consistency of estimated seasonal water levels in 30 chosen reservoirs which have close quantity of exposed terrain in two employed dem datasets for representativeness over the number of reservoirs the 30 chosen reservoirs have 10 each of reservoirs with inundation area between 0 01 0 1 km2 0 1 1 km2 and 1 10 km2 as 143 of 149 reservoirs have average seasonal inundation area in these ranges water level results from srtm 1 arc second global dem data and aster gdem v2 data have a coefficient of determination of over 0 99 while the correlation relationship is close to y 1 0 x b with a general bias b of about 1 36 m uncertainty source 2 when estimating storage volumes for each reservoir the volume above dem surface and below multi temporal water levels was calculated to indicate reservoir storage volume changes the reliability of dem influences the uncertainty of calculating storage volume using the estimated water level and the bathymetry dem as the underwater terrain is not provided in dem data existing storage volume when dem was acquired was not calculated the quantity of unexposed terrain increased the uncertainty of this study this scenario wouldn t change catchment scale estimated results because 1 when srtm dem data was acquired in february 2000 the reservoir water storages in the yellow river basin were mostly in lower water stages in the dry season as indicated by the drastically increasing days without flow 19 days in 1972 82 days in1982 and 260 days in 1998 zusman 2000 the remained water storage had limited basin wide influence 2 among 149 examined reservoirs for 47 reservoirs newly impounded after 2000 srtm dem offered sufficiently exposed terrain for volume estimation 3 for 14 of 102 existing reservoirs the estimation results of aster dem were chosen as final results according to r2 of area volume curves as described in section 3 2 the use of backup aster dem reduced the uncalculated water storage under dem surface and provided averagely 127 increment of estimated volume as shown in table 6 the chosen aster results have higher r2 of area volume curves thus also more confidence that dem captured low water level terrain which suits the relationship described terrain instead of high water level terrain with only the upper part of the terrain that the relationship has mathematically described the retrieval in these reservoirs was significant while a small portion 4 of 14 of reservoirs has slight decrement averagely 5 5 instead of increment for these reservoirs volumes based on aster dem were also kept as estimation results because the aster results were chosen due to higher r2 of area volume curve thus have less uncertainty from uncertainty source 3 and higher overall confidence as further expounded in this section to quantify the uncertainty caused by the calculation of seasonal and annual water storage for each reservoir each season and year an uncertain volume was calculated 5 v s t d s e a s o n a season e s t d s e a s o n 6 v s t d y e a r a year e s t d y e a r where a season and a year are the seasonal and annual inundation area estimated using water level and bathymetry dem respectively e s t d s e a s o n and e s t d y e a r are the standard deviations of elevations in seasonal and annual shoreline dem pixels when estimating water levels respectively the changes of v s t d s e a s o n and v s t d y e a r were added in figs 5 and 6 as error bars to illustrate the uncertainty of volume results the reason v s t d s e a s o n and v s t d y e a r was calculated to quantify the uncertainty is in the study area with high altitudinal drop a reservoir has an overall slope across the water surface and its terrain thus after averaging shoreline elevation to estimate water levels due to the overall slope depth would be underestimated near the upstream end and overestimated near the downstream end though this partly neutralized the effects on volume it brought uncertainty the absolute uncertainty without consideration of neutralized part can be described by multiplying the entire water surface area and the magnitude of shoreline elevation change across the reservoir which was represented by the standard deviation of shoreline elevation uncertainty source 3 when filling gaps in time series for each reservoir missing volume results were reconstructed according to the area volume curve among all 149 examined reservoirs averagely 32 26 of storage volume in seasonal time series were reconstructed to quantify the uncertainty caused by filling values in time series for each reservoir an uncertain volume v bias was calculated 7 v bias v a v e r e v ave where v ave is the average calculated volume of successfully estimated seasons and v a v e r e the area volume curve retrieved volumes in these seasons the changes of v bias were added in fig 6 as error bars to illustrate the uncertainty of seasonal volume results to describe the overall confidence of estimating storage volume changes we used 1 the value of r2 in the area volume curve of each reservoir to describe the confidence of estimation accuracy and 2 the portion that seasonal time series were filled to illustrate the uncertainty under conditions of different quantity of gaps appearing in time series table 7 the coefficients of determination r2 which were calculated in curve fitting when filling missing values in seasonal results were significantly lower in reservoirs where missing rate reached 50 higher r2 indicate higher applicability of area volume relationship and higher possibility that more terrain was offered by dem thus r2 also implies the confidence of the overall accuracy in estimating the long term storage volume changes which is affected by both the completion of time series and the quantity of terrain offered in bathymetry dem considering the area volume curves of longyangxia and liujiaxia this table describes the general confidence that for most reservoirs estimation results have accuracy between the results of longyangxia reservoir and liujiaxia reservoir according to the r2 of each reservoir 138 of 149 examined reservoirs was estimated with the value of r2 higher than 0 8 for 102 of 149 reservoirs with r2 higher than 0 9 and 57 of them between 0 95 0 99 we have confidence that the inner walls of most reservoirs are exposed when dem data was acquired such as longyangxia reservoir for the other 10 reservoirs with r2 between 0 6 0 8 the terrain of these reservoirs in dem data are more possibly describing the surface when water levels were high causing more uncertainty due to uncertainty source 1 and uncertainty source 2 such as liujiaxia reservoir to quantify the overall uncertainty of estimating interannual and seasonal storage volume changes for each reservoir a ratio of volume was calculated 8 ratio v std v max 100 where v std is the average of v s t d s e a s o n and v max the maximum seasonal estimated volume results indicating the reservoir capacity higher value of ratio shows higher uncertainty of water storage volume estimation generally using estimated water level with error about 0 15 0 30 pixel of employed data seasonal water storage change of each reservoir was estimated with 4 245 uncertainty compared with the historical maximum water storage table 8 according to the ratio of each reservoir 131 of 149 reservoirs have uncertain volume for 0 90 of the capacity 113 reservoirs have uncertain volume for 10 70 and many values of the ratio concentrates between 30 and 50 though most reservoirs have similar confidence of accuracy described by r2 of area volume curve the uncertainty varies among reservoirs during calculating the values of ratio was influenced by a balance between the pixel number of shoreline dem which causes higher accuracy of estimated water level but also higher standard deviation of shoreline elevation when reservoir was larger and the inundation area of the reservoir which causes higher value of uncertain volume when reservoir was larger as well as the terrain information offered by study data which causes higher values of v max when more terrain was exposed above water surface in dem in this study we use the analysis of v s t d y e a r v s t d s e a s o n v bias m i s s i n g r a t e r2 and ratio of reservoirs to describe the uncertainty of estimating seasonal water storage volume changes as for annual estimation results the major differences between seasonal and annual estimation results include 1 annual estimation results are considered to be more accurate than seasonal results as annual composite images were less affected by clouds and thus nearly no post processed filling values 2 water volume in annual results are reasonably higher than in seasonal results as the estimate method based on low ndwi threshold extracts maximum impoundment area after generating annual and seasonal composite images 5 3 the implication of reservoir impoundment in river discharge alternation to evaluate the magnitude of flow regulation resulting from water storage change of reservoirs and the long term alternation of local water resource we referred to previous research of streamflow wang et al 2018 and compared estimated water storage volume of studied reservoirs with the river discharge data based on in situ measurement by comparing relative increment as shown in fig 10 the cumulative total increment of reservoir water storage along the main stem and major tributaries had considerable contribution to the cumulative runoff increment the water storage of reservoirs in catchment a is highly consistent with the increase and decrease trend of the runoff in this area with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 576 quantitatively for each year from 2000 to 2016 the increased water storage relative to 2000 in reservoirs accounts for 262 537 average 87 of the yearly increased relative to 2000 water discharge variations in catchment a in contrast the total water storage volume increment of reservoirs in catchment b is equivalent to 14 10 average 2 of the water discharge increment from catchment a to catchment b according to the variation analysis by wang et al 2018 the average annual water discharge from 2000 to 2016 was about 26 km3 at the downstream end of catchment a xiaheyan station and 23 km3 near the downstream end of catchment b at the main stem of yellow river tongguan station compared with the general runoff measured at xiaheyan station which indicates the water discharge of upper yellow river the water storage of reservoirs in catchment a was 4 29 average 14 of the average annual water discharge in catchment b the drainage area of wei river the water storage of studied reservoirs had significant quarterly fluctuations as shown in section 4 2 in the upstream area of tongguan compared with the general runoff measured at tongguan station which indicates the water discharge of the upper and middle yellow river water storage of reservoirs in catchment b accounted for 0 17 0 80 average 0 61 of the average annual runoff while reservoirs in catchment a accounting for 5 33 with an average of 16 though the catchment b wei river is one of the largest tributaries of the yellow river the change of its reservoirs water storage had limited influence on the runoff change compared with catchment a 6 summary this study presents analysis on the distribution characteristics and the long term changes of the water storage of reservoirs built in two major catchments in the upper reach of the yellow river by using multi source remote sensing data we are able to detect the construction of new reservoirs and to estimate seasonal and annual changes of water storage associated with reservoir impoundment enabling evaluation of the impact of the reservoir regulation on river discharges and the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resource along the river we identified 47 new reservoirs built between 2000 and 2018 in the studied catchments with modis data together with the 102 reservoirs dammed before 2000 we provide quantitative estimation of the annual and seasonal water storage changes of 149 reservoirs from 2000 to 2018 by employing landsat images and the srtm dem data as well as aster gdem data the uncertainty of identifying new reservoirs and estimating water storage changes were discussed and evaluated with registered reservoir construction information and in situ water level data last we referred to streamflow variation data provided by published literature and evaluated reservoirs water impoundment impacts on river discharge alternation the main conclusions of this study are summarized as following 1 with considerable number of newly impounded reservoirs the water volume held in reservoirs demonstrated a remarkable increasing trend with significant seasonal variations during 2000 and 2018 2 in accordance with registered capacities of some reservoirs and runoff change process of two stations the water storage changes of large reservoirs are closely associated with river discharge variations and the impoundment of large reservoirs in catchment a shows a dominant role in affecting the discharge of the upper yellow river 3 although the applicability of area volume relationship shows high confidence of estimating reservoir water storage changes in the yellow river uncertainty analysis indicates unignorable estimation error for specific seasonal storage volume the remote sensing based reservoir detection and storage estimation used in this study can be transferred to applications in other basin wide regions the development of higher resolution shorter revisit cycle multi spectral image data such as sentinel 2 msi data available from 2015 and high accuracy dem data with reconstruction of underwater terrain will enable more accurate and detailed measurements of long term reservoir storage variations which can help evaluate the impact of human interferences on regional hydrologic process and provide scientific basis for catchment scale water resource management through regulating

5544,field studies are valuable because of the insufficient number of field performance data in low impact development lid related research four typical lid facilities in northwest china were built and monitored these facilities differ in their impervious pervious bottom inflow underlying surface media types and combinations the water volume reduction of impervious rain garden filled with native loess decreases by approximately 20 when the total daily rainfall levels gradually increase from light to heavy several technical measures such as media modification setting internal storage area reducing drainage area and increasing media thickness have been taken to improve the runoff regulation effect the volume reduction rate in light and medium sized rainfall daily rainfall totals 25 mm is above 68 2 for two improved facilities namely mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the median values of inflow total suspended solid tss event mean concentrations emc are reduced from 43 5 to 68 5 mg l to 22 4 24 3 mg l in accordance with the class iv limits of surface water environmental quality standards total nitrogen tn 1 5 mg l total phosphorus tp 0 3 mg l the probabilities of the effluent tn concentration exceeding the iv limit are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 for the three facilities the exceedance probabilities for tp are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 the weighted results indicate that the annual load reduction rate is more stable than the fluctuating concentration removal which is above 60 an approach to estimate the total scale of lid construction was established on the basis of rainfall level proportion land use types and monitored data when native loess and mixed media rain garden are applied in building areas and layered media bioswale is applied in road area the lid implementation cost is approximately 36 0 billion cny until 2030 for xi an city keywords low impact development rainfall levels exceedance probability load reduction cost 1 introduction the significant increase in the amount of impervious surfaces increases the urban surface runoff and decreases the confluence time prosdocimi et al 2015 in the past decades several extreme rainfall events have generated unprecedented surface runoff which increases urban flood risks and thus leads to traffic interruptions significant economic losses and even deaths hammond et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 flood risk in urban areas should be reduced by minimizing the adverse effects of land cover change and by improving drainage capacity stormwater runoff pollution control and rainfall harvesting are also challenging at present non point source nps pollution has great spatial temporal variability randomness and uncertainty due to the high variability of driving forces and heterogeneity of human activities thus nps has become a major challenge and topic in water quality protection moges et al 2018 wang et al 2018 low impact development lid facilities are designed to reduce the risk from storm water flooding capture pollutants by utilizing vegetation soil and their associated microbial communities and facilitate groundwater recharge these facilities have proven effective in reducing runoff volumes and runoff pollutant concentration such as sediments and metals qin et al 2013 davis et al 2009 however the results from different scale studies showed that the levels of pollutant removal vary and are not always acceptable for different facilities in particular poor removal and leaching of nutrients such as nitrate no3 n and total phosphorus tp remain as major obstacles in the widespread adoption of lid facilities davis et al 2001 maurakami et al 2008 yang et al 2013 the potential for lid facility clogging and long term pollutant removal capabilities are important issues the evolution of hydraulic conductivity over time has been studied in relation to several key design parameters e g media type filter depth vegetation type and system sizing the biofilters clog over time and their average hydraulic conductivity decreases by a factor of 3 6 over 72 weeks of testing coustumer et al 2012 the lid facilities that have been designed to accelerate infiltration rates for draining runoff quickly reduce retention time and in completion of bio processes for pollutant remediation transformation yang et al 2009 the bioretention design parameters in specific areas have been determined by the design of the inflow load media combination and perforated pipe height under regional hydrogeological conditions an internal water storage area iws has been provided at the bottom of the lid facility to improve the operational efficiency this modified design sets up the underdrain pipe elevation higher than a traditional under drainage configuration and improves the removal efficiency of nitrates dietz and clausen 2006 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 the composition and ratio of the media in the bioretention system are particularly important for the function of the system in order to develop modified bioretention media of high infiltration adsorption and water retention capacity the main methods are i to adjust the proportion of clay silt and sand in the soil ii to add a certain proportion of organic matter ii to add modifiers for increasing adsorption capacity of the media o reilly et al 2012 however the composition and properties of bioretention media have different standards under varying soil conditions the application methods and leaching risks in loess areas also need to be solved urgently field studies are valuable because of the insufficient number of field performance data in lid related research this study aimed to i clarify the total annual runoff control rate under different rainfall levels ii reveal the characteristics of pollutant adsorption and leaching for typical lid facilities iii estimate the annual influent effluent average concentration and pollutant load reduction rate and iv propose a method to estimate the scale and cost of lid application in the future urban built up areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area

study area table 1 and figs 1 and 2 tongde community native soil rain garden two rain gardens pervious and impervious were constructed in the study area and their media composed of 20 cm ponding and 50 cm native loess from top to bottom the bottom of the pervious rain garden had no waterproof treatment and the rain water was directly infiltrated in situ the bottom of the impervious rain garden was laid with waterproof geomembrane with a polyvinyl chloride perforated tube drainage d 75 mm wrapped in permeable geotextile and a layer of gravel as covering kangding community mixed media rain garden the facility was cylindrical with a diameter of 5 5 m and a depth of 0 65 m media the vertical structure comprised the ponding media 60 native loess 30 sand 5 water treatment residual wtr 5 sawdust by volume and gravel layer waterproof treatment was applied at the bottom of the facility with a pvc perforated tube drainage d 110 mm wrapped in permeable geotextile and a layer of gravel as

native loess 20 cm blast furnace slag layer 2 5 mm level and 50 cm gravel layer geotextile was laid between the layers and geotextile and impervious membrane were laid in the bottom of the tank and the side near the lane 2 2 monitoring overview four typical lid bioretention facilities namely pervious native loess rain garden impervious native loess rain garden 40 rainfall events were monitored mixed media rain garden 23 rainfall events were monitored and layered media bioswale 35 rainfall events were monitored were selected for rainfall process monitoring in the study area from 2015 to 2018 table 2 2 3 data collection and analysis hydrological data were monitored by small weather station water flow data were monitored through liquid level gauge pipeline flowmeter water quality samples were collected by water quality automatic sampler and these samples were brought back to the laboratory for indicator testing inflow outflow and overflow were monitored by a triangular notched weir at the facility s inflow catchment channel outflow and overflow drainage pipes these water level data were converted to flow by using eq 1 zhang et al 2004 water samples were collected at 0 5 10 20 30 60 90 and 120 min interval and the volume of each sample was approximately 500 ml if the rainfall had taken a long time then the number of post sampling could be increased appropriately and the sampling interval could be extended if rainfall occurred over a relatively short period then the number of sampling could be decreased but should not be 6 samples 1 q 8 15 μ tan θ 2 2 g h 5 2 where q is the

provide multiple benefits for urban ecosystems they reduce the costs associated with water treatment gray infrastructure and energy consumption and thus generate economic benefits the environmental benefits come from the mitigation of air pollution and climate change they also provide social benefits such as enhancing livability and urban green space and educating and improving the health of the public the costs and benefits associated with the construction of these infrastructures should be analyzed to help make sound construction decisions under increased cost of rainwater infrastructure construction zhang et al 2017 the monetization of environmental economic and social benefit for lid facilities should be considered comprehensively and the design scale and optimization distribution of lid facilities should be further studied the technical guide for sponge city construction adopted a statistical analysis of the daily rainfall data of 200 cities in china from 1983 to 2012 and gave a map of different control indicators across the country for roughly dividing the chinese mainland into five districts the minimum and maximum limits of the total runoff control rate α are 85 α 90 in zone i 80 α 85 in zone ii 75 α 85 in zone iii 70 α 85 in zone iv and 60 α 85 in zone v all localities should refer to this limit and determine the total runoff control targets in the region in accordance with local conditions for determining the total annual runoff control rate in fengxi new city xixian new area the unit price of the bioretention facility is estimated as 150 800 cny m2 in this guide mohurd 2014 when the amount of rainfall is less than the designed value the phenomenon that rainwater is discharged directly without control should not appear in lid facilities at the same time the guidelines stipulate that the annual runoff pollutant in terms of tss reduction rate should not be 60 the bioretention facilities should be dispersed and the scale should not be too large the ratio of bioretention facilities to the catchment area is generally 5 10 payne et al 2014 there are a lot of studies on estimating the application scale of lid facility by using the model but the calibration and validation based on the measured data is lacking in the present study the total cost of lid construction in the study area was estimated by studying the frequency distribution statistics of different rainfall levels the prediction of urban development land area and the monitored data in general the following five steps can be followed i identify the proportion of different rainfall levels in study area using historical rainfall data nearly 30 years ii predict each underlying surface area of the study area in the future from statistical yearbook iii set water volume and pollutant load control objectives following the technical guide for sponge city construction or targets in the region in accordance with local hydrogeological conditions iv calculate the proportion and total area of the lid facilities on the basis of the monitored data the annual pollutant load reduction rate by eq 4 and the weighted total annual runoff control rate by eq 5 5 r v w e i g h t e d p light r v l i g h t p moderate r v m o d e r a t e p heavy r v h e a v y where rv weighted is the weighted annual volume reduction rate p is the proportion of different rainfall levels in the total number of rainfall events and r is the water reduction rate of facilities in different rainfall levels v calculate the application area of a facility by increasing or decreasing in the same scale to achieve the water volume and pollutant load reduction rate equal to target values eqs 6 and 7 on the basis of the actual discharge ratio dr and monitored data of the facility 6 d r 85 0 85 r v w e i g h t e d d r monitored 7 d r 60 0 6 r l d r monitored where dr85 is the corresponding facility dr when the total annual runoff control rate is 85 dr60 is the corresponding facility dr when the pollutant load reduction rate is 60 drmonitored is the dr of the facility that is already monitored and rl is the annual pollutant load reduction rate vi estimate the total costs of lid facilities construction in the study area on the basis of the unit cost 3 2 water regulation effect under different rainfall levels different lid facilities vary in different aspects such as rainwater sources discharge ratio surface shape ponding depth media combination and thickness bottom treatment and infiltration rate the runoff regulation effects of these facilities are affected by the antecedent dry days adds and rainfall conditions e g duration and intensity the precipitation standards set by the national meteorological department divided 24 h rainfall into light 0 1 10 mm moderate 10 25 mm heavy 25 50 mm and storm 50 100 mm water regulation of four typical lid facilities under different rainfall levels were calculated table 3 among the 40 rainfall events monitored for pervious native loess rain garden from 2015 only the rainfall events on august 2 2015 and august 25 2016 exhibit an overflow phenomenon the average rainfall intensities of the two rainfalls are 3 1 10 6 and 2 1 10 6 m s respectively the stable infiltration rate of this rain garden is 0 497 mm min the overflow time and volume of the rain garden can be generalized to the relationship between the average rainfall intensity and the stable infiltration rate catchment area and ponding depth jia et al 2016 the measured results show that the two rainfall events august 2 2015 and august 25 2016 exhibit an overflow phenomenon therefore the method can be used to predict whether overflow occurs in the rain garden jiang et al 2017 however inflow and infiltration are complicated in the flood simulation of regional lid just considering design storms infiltration rates and the runoff contribution area ratio of the rain garden to predict overflow under different storms is inadequate storm water management model swmm is a universally applied distributed rainfall runoff management model the process of surface production and convergence is expressed as a water balance problem of a nonlinear reservoir the affecting parameters of the convergence process of catchment areas are different natures of catchment areas e g water permeable area impervious area and impervious water storage area storage depth slope manning coefficient and area width tao et al 2017 proposed a confluent method that combines the equal flow time line method the method assumes that the different catchment areas flow to the exit at different times and divides the catchment area according to the time of flow to the exit in accordance with the time difference between different catchment areas to the exit the final runoff process line is finally superimposed at the staggered time combining this method with the nonlinear reservoir method can simulate the regional convergence problem accurately in addition the infiltration formulas used in the swmm model are the horton green ampt and the curve number method developed by the soil conservation service the infiltration capacity of the soil is strong in the initial stage of rainfall as the rainfall continues the infiltration capacity of the soil gradually decreases and the infiltration rate of the surface rainfall also decreases what s more a certain error occurs between the stable infiltration and the actual situation during the rainfall process the infiltration rate is consistent with the rainfall intensity when the rainfall intensity is lower than the infiltration rate at a certain time and the infiltration process is the actual soil infiltration rate when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate so how to simulate the processes of runoff confluence and infiltration for a single facility under the limited parameter condition which requires more reliable data and further research the bottom of the impervious native loess rain garden can be treated with impervious membrane or cement and other building materials the perforated pipe is placed at the bottom of the gravel layer and the treated runoff enters the perforated pipe on the one hand the infiltrated runoff can be collected for reuse on the other hand this method is convenient for monitoring and quantitative analysis of the water quality and volume control effects and providing data support for the design construction and effect evaluation of lid facilities in sponge cities under the three intensities of light moderate and heavy rainfall levels the average water reduction rates of impervious native loess rain garden are 86 9 65 4 and 39 4 respectively this finding indicates that rain garden with native losses as the media shows a downward trend with the increase in rainfall intensity and the water regulation effect decreases by nearly 20 when the rainfall intensity gradually increases the denitrification efficiency can be improved by setting the submerged zone and supplementing the carbon source zinger et al 2013 in addition the height of the submerged zone should consider the duration and frequency of the drying period rainfall interval the study finds that the minimum submerged zone height of 300 mm can resist the drought for five consecutive weeks payne et al 2014 compared with impervious native loess rain garden the water volume reduction of mixed media rain garden still increased under the intensity of moderate and heavy rainfall despite an increase in infiltration rate and contribution area given the small confluence ratio 5 1 and the large media thickness 1 35 m the water volume reduction rate of layered media bioswale is more than 64 and the average value can reach more than 86 3 3 pollutant concentration variation in influent and effluent stormwater fig 3 presents the probability plots for all pollutants based on storm event mean concentrations emcs drawing steps are as follows 1 the data is sorted first 2 correction frequency i 0 375 n 0 25 were calculated i 1 2 n 3 drawing xi i 0 375 n 0 25 on the normal probability paper one by one and 4 the points distribution were observed if these points in a straight line it is assumed that the data is obtained from the normal population these plots were used to evaluate the differences between inflow and outflow pollutant concentrations and characterize the outflow concentration for all monitored storm events when the rainfall event had no outflow or the concentration could not be detected the pollutant concentration was measured by the lower limit of the pollutant concentration detection the lower detection limits of ss tn tp and cod were 2 0 05 0 01 and 10 mg l respectively the causes of urban nps pollution are complex the influencing factors include climatic conditions e g runoff depth rainfall intensity duration dry length and air pollution pollutant characteristics underlying surface characteristics and surface cleaning frequency tss removal is dominated by sediment and filtration by the bioretention media he et al 2017 found that the accumulation of street dust in the lid construction area is 7 82 33 36 g m2 and the runoff erosion rate of street dust is 0 9 62 7 the mass of tss reduction for rainfall flushing by lid facilities accounts for 13 1 16 7 of street dust accumulation and tss output accounts for 0 6 3 8 of street dust accumulation when overflow occurs the inflow tss emcs are in the ranges of 6 414 mg l median 63 mg l 8 357 mg l median 43 5 mg l and 9 3 311 8 mg l median 68 5 mg l for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale respectively the outflow tss emcs are in the ranges of 2 176 mg l median 23 mg l 2 122 mg l median 22 4 mg l and 2 255 mg l median 24 3 mg l and the results showed good removal effect the nitrogen treatment and transformation processes in lid facilities result from particulate organic nitrogen pon sedimentation filtration and mineralization nh4 n adsorption ion exchange microbial uptake nitrification and denitrification for nitrogen under anoxic conditions pon removed by filtration correlates with tss removal and the reduction of pon emcs is positively correlated with that of tss r2 0 91 p 0 05 li and davis 2014 surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 set the limits of tn tp and cod i v as follows tn 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 mg l tp 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 mg l and cod 15 15 20 30 40 mg l probability plots of tn tp and cod were drawn for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale in accordance with the standard limits of surface water environmental quality standards class iv tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 3 mg l and cod 30 mg l the probabilities that the influent tn concentration exceeds the iv limit are 84 5 77 0 and 53 3 those for the effluent tn concentration exceeding the iv limit are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 tn exceedance probabilities of three facilities decreased by 51 8 34 7 and 33 5 the probabilities that the influent tp concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 42 7 2 1 and 22 5 those for the effluent tp concentration exceeding the class iv limit are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 for this mixed media rain garden the probability of tp concentration exceeding the class iv limit for effluent is greater than that for influent on the one hand the operation of mixed media rain garden is unstable in only one year of operation on the other hand the mixed media rain garden increases the infiltration rate ks 4 1 10 5 m s compared with the native loess ks 6 5 10 6 m s which may cause leaching of pollutants from the system meanwhile inflow for mixed media rain garden comes from the new community roof runoff as a result the system receives limited pollutants and the average concentration of incoming phosphorus pollutants is only 0 12 mg l statistical results show that outflow tp concentration is higher than inflow tp concentration however the average concentration of tp outflow is only 0 09 mg l which is better than the class ii limit of surface water environmental quality standards the probabilities that the cod concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 81 8 66 1 and 74 1 the probabilities that the effluent cod concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 50 3 47 4 and 39 0 it also has a certain removal effect 3 4 comparison of influent and effluent water quality and annual pollutant mass loads given the limited monitoring data about rainfall runoff annual runoff pollutant loads were estimated in accordance with the proportion of monitoring rainfall in annual total rainfall volume liu and davis 2014 the average annual rainfall of the study area is 520 mm the total rainfall amounts of the monitored rainfall events of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 605 6 353 9 and 554 7 mm respectively the drainage areas are 260 332 and 225 m2 the weighted annual emc removal annual load reduction and their masses were calculated eq 8 and fig 4 emcin out is the inflow outflow cumulative mass divided by the cumulative volume over monitored rainfall events 8 l in o u t m p a d where lin out represents the annual inflow outflow pollutant mass loads per unit drainage area kg ha year m is the overall cumulative inflow outflow pollutant mass measured during this study kg p is the average annual rainfall in the study area 520 mm year a is the site drainage area ha and d is the total rainfall depth measured during the study duration mm sampling and analysis of surface soil 10 25 cm of lid facilities were divided in three periods dry season months 12 2 normal season months 3 5 and wet season months 6 9 the toc contents of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 1 61 0 99 and 1 66 their tn contents are 2 01 1 88 and 2 78 g kg their tp contents are 1 22 1 25 and 1 12 g kg the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of these three facilities are 8 0 5 3 and 6 0 respectively the decomposition of organic carbon in soil is affected by the carbon and nitrogen balance of soil microbes thus the c n of soil largely affects its decomposition rate the reason is that the c n of microbial decomposition of organic matter is approximately 25 1 if c n is too high then the decomposition of microorganisms is slow and the effective nitrogen in the soil is consumed ren et al 2006 wu and li 2017 studied the effect of c n on the denitrification effect of different media materials on denitrification filter the influent tn concentration is 21 6 mg l in consideration of the economy and purification effect the optimal c n ratio is 4 1 under this condition the quartz sump and the bioceramic filter effluent tn average concentrations are 10 mg l and 5 mg l respectively and nitrite contents are 0 5 mg l or less in the current study the annual runoff pollutant purification effect of the lid system was estimated through the monitored total rainfall events and the system influent and effluent concentrations and water flow the results show that impervious native loess rain garden and its operation effect is relatively stable the annual average concentration removal rates of tss tn tp cod no3 n and nh4 n are 47 1 48 8 41 2 32 7 39 5 and 58 9 respectively the load reduction rate is greater than 59 7 the mixed media rain garden is modified soil sand sawdust wtr 6 3 0 5 0 5 and increased infiltration rate 4 1 10 5 m s however this kind of action results in reduced retention time and in completion of bio processes for pollutant remediation transformation in addition pollutant leaching may occur due to the newly built and accelerated infiltration bioretention facility mean concentrations of inflow and outflow events were calculated though cumulative mass divided by the cumulative volume over 23 monitored rainfall events the average pollution concentration and annual inflow load per unit area of this mixed media rain garden are smaller than those of the two other facilities from the rainfall event on august 20 2017 the system operation has stabilized relatively and load reduction rates for all pollution are above 65 4 in terms of the pollutant concentration removal the average concentration removal of cod and no3 n are negative for layered media bioswale visibly the media structure and their operating time are the main reasons for leaching the high reduction rate of the water volume for layered media bioswale also causes the high pollution load reduction rate of above 90 3 5 estimation of the scale and cost of lid application in xi an 3 5 1 rainfall distribution and future urban construction land area in the study area the method in section 3 1 is applied to estimate the scale and cost of lid application in xi an city using the 30 year rainfall data 1989 2018 in the region the construction land area in 2017 is 625 3 km2 the proportion of rainfall in different levels in the study area was calculated among the annual rainfall events the volume proportions of heavy storm 100 200 mm storm 50 99 9 mm heavy moderate and light in the total 30 years of rainfall account for 0 71 7 16 24 36 38 51 and 29 26 respectively meanwhile the proportions in different levels account for 0 07 1 18 8 04 27 32 and 63 38 of the total number of rainfall events urban development land can be classified as functional areas namely residential land a public building land b industrial land c road and transportation facilities land d and green space land e mohurd 2010 on the basis of the average growth rate of construction land in xi an from 2002 to 2017 the total scale of construction land and its proportion of different functional areas in 2025 and 2030 were derived construction land area data were collected from the china urban construction statistical yearbook 2002 2017 mohurd 2019 the average increases in residential public building industrial road and green space are nearly 4 5 7 2 2 8 10 9 and 4 0 km2 year respectively the total construction land areas of xi an in 2025 and 2030 are approximately 860 1 and 1006 8 km2 respectively the proportions of different rainfall levels that accounted for the total annual rainfall events and different urban functional zones that accounted for the total scale of construction land in 2030 are shown in fig 5 the underlying surface compositions of various functional zones of urban development lands include green land building coverage road square and paving rates in the construction of sponge cities the underlying surface areas have different proportions in different urban functional zones a certain underlying surface area is the sum of the areas in each functional zone taking the sponge pilot city in xixian new area as an example the proportions of green land in residential public building industrial road and green space are 30 35 25 10 and 85 respectively by analogy the total area of buildings roads and paving in the development area in 2025 and 2030 was calculated the areas of various underlying surface types are shown in table 4 3 5 2 construction scale and cost forecast the proportion of different rainfall levels in the study area accounts for the total annual rainfall events and the water reduction rate of three typical lid facilities impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the weighted total annual runoff control rate can be obtained by weighting calculation eq 5 in terms of pollutant load reduction the ss load reduction rate can reach more than 60 after the facility runs stably in terms of water volume reduction the total annual runoff control rate of 85 was taken as the control target and the corresponding catchment area and dr of the bioretention facility were estimated by the weighted total annual runoff control rate eq 6 the total areas of lid facilities in 2025 and 2030 were predicted in accordance with the predicted dr for 85 annual water volume reduction rate and the impervious surface area of the construction land when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c the road area uses layered media bioswale d including two scenarios namely b d combination and c d combination in the two situations future area predictions for different lid facilities and their implementation costs were predicted table 5 the implementation costs of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 195 273 and 537 cny m2 these costs include excavation media gravel and other fillers as well as materials such as geotextile and perforated tubes which exclude the cost of land and the construction of inflow outflow triangles due to monitoring needs monitoring equipment and other operation and maintenance costs on the basis of the monitored rainfall data the weighted total annual runoff control rates of the three lid facilities impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 72 1 81 7 and 92 3 respectively when the total annual runoff control rate of 85 is targeted the scale of impervious native loess rain garden and mixed media rain garden should be appropriately increased and the scale of layered media bioswale should be appropriately decreased the drs corresponding to the 85 total annual runoff control rate of the three facilities are 10 1 15 1 and 6 1 respectively therefore in order to achieve this goal the scale of impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c should be 18 8 km2 and 13 5 km2 respectively in the building area and the scale of layered media bioswale d in the road area should be 60 1 km2 if special requirements some special pollutants or special requirements for the purification of pollutants are absent and the soil has good infiltration performance k greater than 10 6 m s then rain garden filled with native loess can effectively regulate rainfall runoff from the source for areas with limited construction area or heavy runoff pollution certain improvements should be made to the lid facilities such improvements primarily include the improvement in media and structural optimization design for example the traditional bioretention soil media uses a ratio of 30 60 sand 20 30 topsoil and 20 40 organic matter v v mde 2000 to increase infiltration specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the bioretention media biochar cocoon fly ash and water treatment residues were added in a mixed or layered manner to the above mentioned traditional bioretention soil media tian et al 2019 kandel et al 2017 o neill and davis 2012 structural optimization such as denitrification efficiency was performed by setting the submerged zone and supplementing the carbon source brown and hunt 2011 as the construction area and unit cost increase the investment cost increases accordingly when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c the road area uses layered media bioswale d by 2030 if a total runoff control rate of 85 is achieved then the total cost of the b d and c d combinations will be approximately 36 0 billion cny zhan and chui 2016 applied a proposed framework to assess the benefit of lid practices for hong kong land area of 1108 km2 the 30 year lid implementation cost is 55 8 billion usd and the economic and environmental benefits are 5 3 and 1 2 billion usd respectively the mean and median social benefits are 35 1 and 49 6 billion usd respectively subtracting the 30 year lid implementation cost produces a median positive net benefit and a mean negative net benefit sensitivity analyses show that the net benefit is sensitive to the willingness to pay of hong kong people wang et al 2016 found that optimized transportation link and management maintenance of lid measures contributed to their benefits through life cycle cost and environmental impact assessments in the current study the proposed approach to estimate the total cost of lid construction in the study area has limitations and the strategy only considers the regulation effects of several typical source facilities the regional lid constructions need to consider the overall effect of the source midway end which may be addressed in future studies 4 conclusions the study of lids for stormwater management is inadequate to date to fill this gap the methodological framework for quantifying and evaluating the city wide lid implementation using monitored results and statistical data is established in the current study the proposed framework considers rainfall level proportion land use type total annual runoff control and pollutant load reduction rate if no special requirement is given for the purification effect of pollutants and the soil infiltration performance is more than 10 6 m s then the rain garden filled with native loess can effectively regulate runoff from the source in the hydrological characteristics of northwestern china for areas with limited construction area or heavy runoff pollution certain improvements should be made to the lid facilities when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden and mixed media rain garden the road area uses layered media bioswale by 2030 a total runoff control rate of 85 will be achieved the extent of impervious native loess or mixed media rain garden should be 18 8 km2 and 13 5 km2 respectively and the extent of layered media bioswale should be 60 1 km2 considering the construction scale and unit area cost the total investment of the two scenarios will be approximately 36 0 billion cny the mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale improve the water regulation effect by setting internal water storage area reducing the drainage area and increasing the thickness of the media the water volume reduction rate of medium and light rainfall 25 mm is above 68 2 for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the probabilities that the effluent tn concentration exceeds the iv limit of surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 respectively the effluent exceedance probabilities for tp are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 the effluent exceedance probabilities for cod are 50 3 47 4 and 39 0 the annual pollutant load reduction rates of the facilities are above 60 even so preventing pollutant leaching is critical for these improved lid facilities therefore the monetization of environmental economic and social benefit for lid facilities should be considered comprehensively and the design scale and optimization distribution of lid facilities should be further studied credit authorship contribution statement chunbo jiang data curation writing original draft jiake li conceptualization methodology software writing original draft

5544,field studies are valuable because of the insufficient number of field performance data in low impact development lid related research four typical lid facilities in northwest china were built and monitored these facilities differ in their impervious pervious bottom inflow underlying surface media types and combinations the water volume reduction of impervious rain garden filled with native loess decreases by approximately 20 when the total daily rainfall levels gradually increase from light to heavy several technical measures such as media modification setting internal storage area reducing drainage area and increasing media thickness have been taken to improve the runoff regulation effect the volume reduction rate in light and medium sized rainfall daily rainfall totals 25 mm is above 68 2 for two improved facilities namely mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the median values of inflow total suspended solid tss event mean concentrations emc are reduced from 43 5 to 68 5 mg l to 22 4 24 3 mg l in accordance with the class iv limits of surface water environmental quality standards total nitrogen tn 1 5 mg l total phosphorus tp 0 3 mg l the probabilities of the effluent tn concentration exceeding the iv limit are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 for the three facilities the exceedance probabilities for tp are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 the weighted results indicate that the annual load reduction rate is more stable than the fluctuating concentration removal which is above 60 an approach to estimate the total scale of lid construction was established on the basis of rainfall level proportion land use types and monitored data when native loess and mixed media rain garden are applied in building areas and layered media bioswale is applied in road area the lid implementation cost is approximately 36 0 billion cny until 2030 for xi an city keywords low impact development rainfall levels exceedance probability load reduction cost 1 introduction the significant increase in the amount of impervious surfaces increases the urban surface runoff and decreases the confluence time prosdocimi et al 2015 in the past decades several extreme rainfall events have generated unprecedented surface runoff which increases urban flood risks and thus leads to traffic interruptions significant economic losses and even deaths hammond et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 flood risk in urban areas should be reduced by minimizing the adverse effects of land cover change and by improving drainage capacity stormwater runoff pollution control and rainfall harvesting are also challenging at present non point source nps pollution has great spatial temporal variability randomness and uncertainty due to the high variability of driving forces and heterogeneity of human activities thus nps has become a major challenge and topic in water quality protection moges et al 2018 wang et al 2018 low impact development lid facilities are designed to reduce the risk from storm water flooding capture pollutants by utilizing vegetation soil and their associated microbial communities and facilitate groundwater recharge these facilities have proven effective in reducing runoff volumes and runoff pollutant concentration such as sediments and metals qin et al 2013 davis et al 2009 however the results from different scale studies showed that the levels of pollutant removal vary and are not always acceptable for different facilities in particular poor removal and leaching of nutrients such as nitrate no3 n and total phosphorus tp remain as major obstacles in the widespread adoption of lid facilities davis et al 2001 maurakami et al 2008 yang et al 2013 the potential for lid facility clogging and long term pollutant removal capabilities are important issues the evolution of hydraulic conductivity over time has been studied in relation to several key design parameters e g media type filter depth vegetation type and system sizing the biofilters clog over time and their average hydraulic conductivity decreases by a factor of 3 6 over 72 weeks of testing coustumer et al 2012 the lid facilities that have been designed to accelerate infiltration rates for draining runoff quickly reduce retention time and in completion of bio processes for pollutant remediation transformation yang et al 2009 the bioretention design parameters in specific areas have been determined by the design of the inflow load media combination and perforated pipe height under regional hydrogeological conditions an internal water storage area iws has been provided at the bottom of the lid facility to improve the operational efficiency this modified design sets up the underdrain pipe elevation higher than a traditional under drainage configuration and improves the removal efficiency of nitrates dietz and clausen 2006 nabiul afrooz and boehm 2017 the composition and ratio of the media in the bioretention system are particularly important for the function of the system in order to develop modified bioretention media of high infiltration adsorption and water retention capacity the main methods are i to adjust the proportion of clay silt and sand in the soil ii to add a certain proportion of organic matter ii to add modifiers for increasing adsorption capacity of the media o reilly et al 2012 however the composition and properties of bioretention media have different standards under varying soil conditions the application methods and leaching risks in loess areas also need to be solved urgently field studies are valuable because of the insufficient number of field performance data in lid related research this study aimed to i clarify the total annual runoff control rate under different rainfall levels ii reveal the characteristics of pollutant adsorption and leaching for typical lid facilities iii estimate the annual influent effluent average concentration and pollutant load reduction rate and iv propose a method to estimate the scale and cost of lid application in the future urban built up areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study area

respectively the infiltration rate of undisturbed soil is nearly 0 16 2 13 m d 1 85 10 6 2 46 10 5 m s as measured by double ring four typical lid facilities were constructed and monitored in the study area table 1 and figs 1 and 2 tongde community native soil rain garden two rain gardens pervious and impervious were constructed in the study area and their media composed of 20 cm ponding and 50 cm native loess from top to bottom the bottom of the pervious rain garden had no waterproof treatment and the rain water was directly infiltrated in situ the bottom of the impervious rain garden

the side near the lane 2 2 monitoring overview four typical lid bioretention facilities namely pervious native loess rain garden impervious native loess rain garden 40 rainfall events were monitored mixed media rain garden 23 rainfall events were monitored and layered media bioswale 35 rainfall events were monitored were selected for rainfall process monitoring in the study area from 2015 to 2018 table 2 2 3 data collection and analysis hydrological data were monitored by small weather station water flow data were monitored through liquid level gauge pipeline flowmeter water quality samples were collected by water quality automatic sampler and these samples were brought back to the laboratory for indicator testing inflow outflow and overflow were monitored by a triangular notched weir at the facility s inflow catchment channel outflow and overflow drainage pipes these water level data were converted to flow by using eq 1 zhang et al 2004 water samples were collected at 0 5 10 20 30 60 90 and 120 min interval and the volume of each sample was approximately 500 ml if the rainfall had taken a long time then the number of post sampling could be increased appropriately and the sampling interval could be extended if rainfall occurred over a relatively short period then the number of sampling could be decreased but should not be 6 samples 1 q 8 15 μ tan θ 2 2 g h 5 2 where q is the

provide multiple benefits for urban ecosystems they reduce the costs associated with water treatment gray infrastructure and energy consumption and thus generate economic benefits the environmental benefits come from the mitigation of air pollution and climate change they also provide social benefits such as enhancing livability and urban green space and educating and improving the health of the public the costs and benefits associated with the construction of these infrastructures should be analyzed to help make sound construction decisions under increased cost of rainwater infrastructure construction zhang et al 2017 the monetization of environmental economic and social benefit for lid facilities should be considered comprehensively and the design scale and optimization distribution of lid facilities should be further studied the technical guide for sponge city construction adopted a statistical analysis of the daily rainfall data of 200 cities in china from 1983 to 2012 and gave a map of different control indicators across the country for roughly dividing the chinese mainland into five districts the minimum and maximum limits of the total runoff control rate α are 85 α 90 in zone i 80 α 85 in zone ii 75 α 85 in zone iii 70 α 85 in zone iv and 60 α 85 in zone v all localities should refer to this limit and determine the total runoff control targets in the region in accordance with local conditions for determining the total annual runoff control rate in fengxi new city xixian new area the unit price of the bioretention facility is estimated as 150 800 cny m2 in this guide mohurd 2014 when the amount of rainfall is less than the designed value the phenomenon that rainwater is discharged directly without control should not appear in lid facilities at the same time the guidelines stipulate that the annual runoff pollutant in terms of tss reduction rate should not be 60 the bioretention facilities should be dispersed and the scale should not be too large the ratio of bioretention facilities to the catchment area is generally 5 10 payne et al 2014 there are a lot of studies on estimating the application scale of lid facility by using the model but the calibration and validation based on the measured data is lacking in the present study the total cost of lid construction in the study area was estimated by studying the frequency distribution statistics of different rainfall levels the prediction of urban development land area and the monitored data in general the following five steps can be followed i identify the proportion of different rainfall levels in study area using historical rainfall data nearly 30 years ii predict each underlying surface area of the study area in the future from statistical yearbook iii set water volume and pollutant load control objectives following the technical guide for sponge city construction or targets in the region in accordance with local hydrogeological conditions iv calculate the proportion and total area of the lid facilities on the basis of the monitored data the annual pollutant load reduction rate by eq 4 and the weighted total annual runoff control rate by eq 5 5 r v w e i g h t e d p light r v l i g h t p moderate r v m o d e r a t e p heavy r v h e a v y where rv weighted is the weighted annual volume reduction rate p is the proportion of different rainfall levels in the total number of rainfall events and r is the water reduction rate of facilities in different rainfall levels v calculate the application area of a facility by increasing or decreasing in the same scale to achieve the water volume and pollutant load reduction rate equal to target values eqs 6 and 7 on the basis of the actual discharge ratio dr and monitored data of the facility 6 d r 85 0 85 r v w e i g h t e d d r monitored 7 d r 60 0 6 r l d r monitored where dr85 is the corresponding facility dr when the total annual runoff control rate is 85 dr60 is the corresponding facility dr when the pollutant load reduction rate is 60 drmonitored is the dr of the facility that is already monitored and rl is the annual pollutant load reduction rate vi estimate the total costs of lid facilities construction in the study area on the basis of the unit cost 3 2 water regulation effect under different rainfall levels different lid facilities vary in different aspects such as rainwater sources discharge ratio surface shape ponding depth media combination and thickness bottom treatment and infiltration rate the runoff regulation effects of these facilities are affected by the antecedent dry days adds and rainfall conditions e g duration and intensity the precipitation standards set by the national meteorological department divided 24 h rainfall into light 0 1 10 mm moderate 10 25 mm heavy 25 50 mm and storm 50 100 mm water regulation of four typical lid facilities under different rainfall levels were calculated table 3 among the 40 rainfall events monitored for pervious native loess rain garden from 2015 only the rainfall events on august 2 2015 and august 25 2016 exhibit an overflow phenomenon the average rainfall intensities of the two rainfalls are 3 1 10 6 and 2 1 10 6 m s respectively the stable infiltration rate of this rain garden is 0 497 mm min the overflow time and volume of the rain garden can be generalized to the relationship between the average rainfall intensity and the stable infiltration rate catchment area and ponding depth jia et al 2016 the measured results show that the two rainfall events august 2 2015 and august 25 2016 exhibit an overflow phenomenon therefore the method can be used to predict whether overflow occurs in the rain garden jiang et al 2017 however inflow and infiltration are complicated in the flood simulation of regional lid just considering design storms infiltration rates and the runoff contribution area ratio of the rain garden to predict overflow under different storms is inadequate storm water management model swmm is a universally applied distributed rainfall runoff management model the process of surface production and convergence is expressed as a water balance problem of a nonlinear reservoir the affecting parameters of the convergence process of catchment areas are different natures of catchment areas e g water permeable area impervious area and impervious water storage area storage depth slope manning coefficient and area width tao et al 2017 proposed a confluent method that combines the equal flow time line method the method assumes that the different catchment areas flow to the exit at different times and divides the catchment area according to the time of flow to the exit in accordance with the time difference between different catchment areas to the exit the final runoff process line is finally superimposed at the staggered time combining this method with the nonlinear reservoir method can simulate the regional convergence problem accurately in addition the infiltration formulas used in the swmm model are the horton green ampt and the curve number method developed by the soil conservation service the infiltration capacity of the soil is strong in the initial stage of rainfall as the rainfall continues the infiltration capacity of the soil gradually decreases and the infiltration rate of the surface rainfall also decreases what s more a certain error occurs between the stable infiltration and the actual situation during the rainfall process the infiltration rate is consistent with the rainfall intensity when the rainfall intensity is lower than the infiltration rate at a certain time and the infiltration process is the actual soil infiltration rate when the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate so how to simulate the processes of runoff confluence and infiltration for a single facility under the limited parameter condition which requires more reliable data and further research the bottom of the impervious native loess rain garden can be treated with impervious membrane or cement and other building materials the perforated pipe is placed at the bottom of the gravel layer and the treated runoff enters the perforated pipe on the one hand the infiltrated runoff can be collected for reuse on the other hand this method is convenient for monitoring and quantitative analysis of the water quality and volume control effects and providing data support for the design construction and effect evaluation of lid facilities in sponge cities under the three intensities of light moderate and heavy rainfall levels the average water reduction rates of impervious native loess rain garden are 86 9 65 4 and 39 4 respectively this finding indicates that rain garden with native losses as the media shows a downward trend with the increase in rainfall intensity and the water regulation effect decreases by nearly 20 when the rainfall intensity gradually increases the denitrification efficiency can be improved by setting the submerged zone and supplementing the carbon source zinger et al 2013 in addition the height of the submerged zone should consider the duration and frequency of the drying period rainfall interval the study finds that the minimum submerged zone height of 300 mm can resist the drought for five consecutive weeks payne et al 2014 compared with impervious native loess rain garden the water volume reduction of mixed media rain garden still increased under the intensity of moderate and heavy rainfall despite an increase in infiltration rate and contribution area given the small confluence ratio 5 1 and the large media thickness 1 35 m the water volume reduction rate of layered media bioswale is more than 64 and the average value can reach more than 86 3 3 pollutant concentration variation in influent and effluent stormwater fig 3 presents the probability plots for all pollutants based on storm event mean concentrations emcs drawing steps are as follows 1 the data is sorted first 2 correction frequency i 0 375 n 0 25 were calculated i 1 2 n 3 drawing xi i 0 375 n 0 25 on the normal probability paper one by one and 4 the points distribution were observed if these points in a straight line it is assumed that the data is obtained from the normal population these plots were used to evaluate the differences between inflow and outflow pollutant concentrations and characterize the outflow concentration for all monitored storm events when the rainfall event had no outflow or the concentration could not be detected the pollutant concentration was measured by the lower limit of the pollutant concentration detection the lower detection limits of ss tn tp and cod were 2 0 05 0 01 and 10 mg l respectively the causes of urban nps pollution are complex the influencing factors include climatic conditions e g runoff depth rainfall intensity duration dry length and air pollution pollutant characteristics underlying surface characteristics and surface cleaning frequency tss removal is dominated by sediment and filtration by the bioretention media he et al 2017 found that the accumulation of street dust in the lid construction area is 7 82 33 36 g m2 and the runoff erosion rate of street dust is 0 9 62 7 the mass of tss reduction for rainfall flushing by lid facilities accounts for 13 1 16 7 of street dust accumulation and tss output accounts for 0 6 3 8 of street dust accumulation when overflow occurs the inflow tss emcs are in the ranges of 6 414 mg l median 63 mg l 8 357 mg l median 43 5 mg l and 9 3 311 8 mg l median 68 5 mg l for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale respectively the outflow tss emcs are in the ranges of 2 176 mg l median 23 mg l 2 122 mg l median 22 4 mg l and 2 255 mg l median 24 3 mg l and the results showed good removal effect the nitrogen treatment and transformation processes in lid facilities result from particulate organic nitrogen pon sedimentation filtration and mineralization nh4 n adsorption ion exchange microbial uptake nitrification and denitrification for nitrogen under anoxic conditions pon removed by filtration correlates with tss removal and the reduction of pon emcs is positively correlated with that of tss r2 0 91 p 0 05 li and davis 2014 surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 set the limits of tn tp and cod i v as follows tn 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 mg l tp 0 02 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 mg l and cod 15 15 20 30 40 mg l probability plots of tn tp and cod were drawn for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale in accordance with the standard limits of surface water environmental quality standards class iv tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 3 mg l and cod 30 mg l the probabilities that the influent tn concentration exceeds the iv limit are 84 5 77 0 and 53 3 those for the effluent tn concentration exceeding the iv limit are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 tn exceedance probabilities of three facilities decreased by 51 8 34 7 and 33 5 the probabilities that the influent tp concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 42 7 2 1 and 22 5 those for the effluent tp concentration exceeding the class iv limit are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 for this mixed media rain garden the probability of tp concentration exceeding the class iv limit for effluent is greater than that for influent on the one hand the operation of mixed media rain garden is unstable in only one year of operation on the other hand the mixed media rain garden increases the infiltration rate ks 4 1 10 5 m s compared with the native loess ks 6 5 10 6 m s which may cause leaching of pollutants from the system meanwhile inflow for mixed media rain garden comes from the new community roof runoff as a result the system receives limited pollutants and the average concentration of incoming phosphorus pollutants is only 0 12 mg l statistical results show that outflow tp concentration is higher than inflow tp concentration however the average concentration of tp outflow is only 0 09 mg l which is better than the class ii limit of surface water environmental quality standards the probabilities that the cod concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 81 8 66 1 and 74 1 the probabilities that the effluent cod concentration exceeds the class iv limit are 50 3 47 4 and 39 0 it also has a certain removal effect 3 4 comparison of influent and effluent water quality and annual pollutant mass loads given the limited monitoring data about rainfall runoff annual runoff pollutant loads were estimated in accordance with the proportion of monitoring rainfall in annual total rainfall volume liu and davis 2014 the average annual rainfall of the study area is 520 mm the total rainfall amounts of the monitored rainfall events of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 605 6 353 9 and 554 7 mm respectively the drainage areas are 260 332 and 225 m2 the weighted annual emc removal annual load reduction and their masses were calculated eq 8 and fig 4 emcin out is the inflow outflow cumulative mass divided by the cumulative volume over monitored rainfall events 8 l in o u t m p a d where lin out represents the annual inflow outflow pollutant mass loads per unit drainage area kg ha year m is the overall cumulative inflow outflow pollutant mass measured during this study kg p is the average annual rainfall in the study area 520 mm year a is the site drainage area ha and d is the total rainfall depth measured during the study duration mm sampling and analysis of surface soil 10 25 cm of lid facilities were divided in three periods dry season months 12 2 normal season months 3 5 and wet season months 6 9 the toc contents of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 1 61 0 99 and 1 66 their tn contents are 2 01 1 88 and 2 78 g kg their tp contents are 1 22 1 25 and 1 12 g kg the carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of these three facilities are 8 0 5 3 and 6 0 respectively the decomposition of organic carbon in soil is affected by the carbon and nitrogen balance of soil microbes thus the c n of soil largely affects its decomposition rate the reason is that the c n of microbial decomposition of organic matter is approximately 25 1 if c n is too high then the decomposition of microorganisms is slow and the effective nitrogen in the soil is consumed ren et al 2006 wu and li 2017 studied the effect of c n on the denitrification effect of different media materials on denitrification filter the influent tn concentration is 21 6 mg l in consideration of the economy and purification effect the optimal c n ratio is 4 1 under this condition the quartz sump and the bioceramic filter effluent tn average concentrations are 10 mg l and 5 mg l respectively and nitrite contents are 0 5 mg l or less in the current study the annual runoff pollutant purification effect of the lid system was estimated through the monitored total rainfall events and the system influent and effluent concentrations and water flow the results show that impervious native loess rain garden and its operation effect is relatively stable the annual average concentration removal rates of tss tn tp cod no3 n and nh4 n are 47 1 48 8 41 2 32 7 39 5 and 58 9 respectively the load reduction rate is greater than 59 7 the mixed media rain garden is modified soil sand sawdust wtr 6 3 0 5 0 5 and increased infiltration rate 4 1 10 5 m s however this kind of action results in reduced retention time and in completion of bio processes for pollutant remediation transformation in addition pollutant leaching may occur due to the newly built and accelerated infiltration bioretention facility mean concentrations of inflow and outflow events were calculated though cumulative mass divided by the cumulative volume over 23 monitored rainfall events the average pollution concentration and annual inflow load per unit area of this mixed media rain garden are smaller than those of the two other facilities from the rainfall event on august 20 2017 the system operation has stabilized relatively and load reduction rates for all pollution are above 65 4 in terms of the pollutant concentration removal the average concentration removal of cod and no3 n are negative for layered media bioswale visibly the media structure and their operating time are the main reasons for leaching the high reduction rate of the water volume for layered media bioswale also causes the high pollution load reduction rate of above 90 3 5 estimation of the scale and cost of lid application in xi an 3 5 1 rainfall distribution and future urban construction land area in the study area the method in section 3 1 is applied to estimate the scale and cost of lid application in xi an city using the 30 year rainfall data 1989 2018 in the region the construction land area in 2017 is 625 3 km2 the proportion of rainfall in different levels in the study area was calculated among the annual rainfall events the volume proportions of heavy storm 100 200 mm storm 50 99 9 mm heavy moderate and light in the total 30 years of rainfall account for 0 71 7 16 24 36 38 51 and 29 26 respectively meanwhile the proportions in different levels account for 0 07 1 18 8 04 27 32 and 63 38 of the total number of rainfall events urban development land can be classified as functional areas namely residential land a public building land b industrial land c road and transportation facilities land d and green space land e mohurd 2010 on the basis of the average growth rate of construction land in xi an from 2002 to 2017 the total scale of construction land and its proportion of different functional areas in 2025 and 2030 were derived construction land area data were collected from the china urban construction statistical yearbook 2002 2017 mohurd 2019 the average increases in residential public building industrial road and green space are nearly 4 5 7 2 2 8 10 9 and 4 0 km2 year respectively the total construction land areas of xi an in 2025 and 2030 are approximately 860 1 and 1006 8 km2 respectively the proportions of different rainfall levels that accounted for the total annual rainfall events and different urban functional zones that accounted for the total scale of construction land in 2030 are shown in fig 5 the underlying surface compositions of various functional zones of urban development lands include green land building coverage road square and paving rates in the construction of sponge cities the underlying surface areas have different proportions in different urban functional zones a certain underlying surface area is the sum of the areas in each functional zone taking the sponge pilot city in xixian new area as an example the proportions of green land in residential public building industrial road and green space are 30 35 25 10 and 85 respectively by analogy the total area of buildings roads and paving in the development area in 2025 and 2030 was calculated the areas of various underlying surface types are shown in table 4 3 5 2 construction scale and cost forecast the proportion of different rainfall levels in the study area accounts for the total annual rainfall events and the water reduction rate of three typical lid facilities impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the weighted total annual runoff control rate can be obtained by weighting calculation eq 5 in terms of pollutant load reduction the ss load reduction rate can reach more than 60 after the facility runs stably in terms of water volume reduction the total annual runoff control rate of 85 was taken as the control target and the corresponding catchment area and dr of the bioretention facility were estimated by the weighted total annual runoff control rate eq 6 the total areas of lid facilities in 2025 and 2030 were predicted in accordance with the predicted dr for 85 annual water volume reduction rate and the impervious surface area of the construction land when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c the road area uses layered media bioswale d including two scenarios namely b d combination and c d combination in the two situations future area predictions for different lid facilities and their implementation costs were predicted table 5 the implementation costs of impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 195 273 and 537 cny m2 these costs include excavation media gravel and other fillers as well as materials such as geotextile and perforated tubes which exclude the cost of land and the construction of inflow outflow triangles due to monitoring needs monitoring equipment and other operation and maintenance costs on the basis of the monitored rainfall data the weighted total annual runoff control rates of the three lid facilities impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale are 72 1 81 7 and 92 3 respectively when the total annual runoff control rate of 85 is targeted the scale of impervious native loess rain garden and mixed media rain garden should be appropriately increased and the scale of layered media bioswale should be appropriately decreased the drs corresponding to the 85 total annual runoff control rate of the three facilities are 10 1 15 1 and 6 1 respectively therefore in order to achieve this goal the scale of impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c should be 18 8 km2 and 13 5 km2 respectively in the building area and the scale of layered media bioswale d in the road area should be 60 1 km2 if special requirements some special pollutants or special requirements for the purification of pollutants are absent and the soil has good infiltration performance k greater than 10 6 m s then rain garden filled with native loess can effectively regulate rainfall runoff from the source for areas with limited construction area or heavy runoff pollution certain improvements should be made to the lid facilities such improvements primarily include the improvement in media and structural optimization design for example the traditional bioretention soil media uses a ratio of 30 60 sand 20 30 topsoil and 20 40 organic matter v v mde 2000 to increase infiltration specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the bioretention media biochar cocoon fly ash and water treatment residues were added in a mixed or layered manner to the above mentioned traditional bioretention soil media tian et al 2019 kandel et al 2017 o neill and davis 2012 structural optimization such as denitrification efficiency was performed by setting the submerged zone and supplementing the carbon source brown and hunt 2011 as the construction area and unit cost increase the investment cost increases accordingly when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden b or mixed media rain garden c the road area uses layered media bioswale d by 2030 if a total runoff control rate of 85 is achieved then the total cost of the b d and c d combinations will be approximately 36 0 billion cny zhan and chui 2016 applied a proposed framework to assess the benefit of lid practices for hong kong land area of 1108 km2 the 30 year lid implementation cost is 55 8 billion usd and the economic and environmental benefits are 5 3 and 1 2 billion usd respectively the mean and median social benefits are 35 1 and 49 6 billion usd respectively subtracting the 30 year lid implementation cost produces a median positive net benefit and a mean negative net benefit sensitivity analyses show that the net benefit is sensitive to the willingness to pay of hong kong people wang et al 2016 found that optimized transportation link and management maintenance of lid measures contributed to their benefits through life cycle cost and environmental impact assessments in the current study the proposed approach to estimate the total cost of lid construction in the study area has limitations and the strategy only considers the regulation effects of several typical source facilities the regional lid constructions need to consider the overall effect of the source midway end which may be addressed in future studies 4 conclusions the study of lids for stormwater management is inadequate to date to fill this gap the methodological framework for quantifying and evaluating the city wide lid implementation using monitored results and statistical data is established in the current study the proposed framework considers rainfall level proportion land use type total annual runoff control and pollutant load reduction rate if no special requirement is given for the purification effect of pollutants and the soil infiltration performance is more than 10 6 m s then the rain garden filled with native loess can effectively regulate runoff from the source in the hydrological characteristics of northwestern china for areas with limited construction area or heavy runoff pollution certain improvements should be made to the lid facilities when the building area uses impervious native loess rain garden and mixed media rain garden the road area uses layered media bioswale by 2030 a total runoff control rate of 85 will be achieved the extent of impervious native loess or mixed media rain garden should be 18 8 km2 and 13 5 km2 respectively and the extent of layered media bioswale should be 60 1 km2 considering the construction scale and unit area cost the total investment of the two scenarios will be approximately 36 0 billion cny the mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale improve the water regulation effect by setting internal water storage area reducing the drainage area and increasing the thickness of the media the water volume reduction rate of medium and light rainfall 25 mm is above 68 2 for impervious native loess rain garden mixed media rain garden and layered media bioswale the probabilities that the effluent tn concentration exceeds the iv limit of surface water environmental quality standards gb 3838 2002 are 32 7 42 3 and 19 8 respectively the effluent exceedance probabilities for tp are 18 5 6 5 and 8 9 the effluent exceedance probabilities for cod are 50 3 47 4 and 39 0 the annual pollutant load reduction rates of the facilities are above 60 even so preventing pollutant leaching is critical for these improved lid facilities therefore the monetization of environmental economic and social benefit for lid facilities should be considered comprehensively and the design scale and optimization distribution of lid facilities should be further studied credit authorship contribution statement chunbo jiang data curation writing original draft jiake li conceptualization methodology software writing original draft
