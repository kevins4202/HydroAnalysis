7985,study area iran study focus iran once a pioneer of sustainable water management is currently facing water bankruptcy aggressive exhaustion of non renewable water has led to a suite of environmental and socio economic problems across the country nevertheless the understanding of iran s water loss is still incomplete due to a lack of conclusive data in this study we employ satellite gravimetry observations in situ and globally precipitation data and gauged groundwater level to investigate the total water storage tws loss in iran over the last two decades new hydrological insights for the region we quantify iran s water loss using a data driven approach supported by a monte carlo simulation our analysis indicates tws loss of 211 34 km3 twice iran s annual water consumption within the 2003 2019 period the mean groundwater level has dropped significantly at a rate of 28 1 4 cm yr this tremendous water loss happened despite an overall increased relative precipitation rate of 4 9 0 02 km3 yr thus the tws loss can only be explained by drastic overexploitation of non renewable water resources two major extreme events occurred during the study period namely the 2007 drought and early 2019 floods the former resulted in a total 115 0 6 km3 water loss one third of the long term annual precipitation approximately the same amount was brought back by a series of extreme precipitation events leading to floods in early 2019 our results raise critical issues regarding unsustainable water management in iran and highlight the crucial role of spaceborne measurements for understanding short term and long term water availability change in the absence of sufficient ground data graphical abstract ga1 keywords water storage satellite gravimetry

knowledge of iran s water bankruptcy problem at the national scale is still very limited due to the lack of conclusive ground data filling this knowledge gap and developing a deep understanding of the level of water loss across iran will be an essential step towards addressing this significant national problem estimation of total water storage tws defined as the sum of all storage components such as surface water soil moisture snow water and groundwater provides valuable insight into the water resources availability at the regional scale syed et al 2005 riegger and tourian 2014 tourian et al

rodell et al 2007 lorenz et al 2015 evaluation of tws can also be done using land surface models lsms or hydrological models the performance of these models however varies in different parts of the world which can make them unreliable for water management and decision making purposes especially during extreme events like droughts or floods e g long et al 2013 2014 felfelani et al 2017 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission launched in march 2002 caused a quantum leap in the hydrological understanding of continental scale systems tapley et al 2004 grace maps the time variable gravity field by observing the relative motion between the centers of mass of two satellites measured with a highly accurate inter satellite k band microwave link for the first time grace observations allow us to determine the continental water storage at monthly to inter annual time scales which was the ambition of hydrologists for a long time lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 therefore grace has attracted considerable attention in the hydrology community wahr et al 1998 rodell and famiglietti 1999 lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 grace s success necessitated a continuation and encouraged the launch of the grace follow on grace fo mission in may 2018 grace tws observations have been previously employed for water resources monitoring in iran over the last two decades voss et al 2013 reported an alarming loss at a rate of about 2 7 cm yr in the north central middle east including the tigris and euphrates river basins and western iran from 2003 to 2009 a similar negative trend was also reported in joodaki et al 2014 over western iran and eastern iraq from 2003 to 2012 by subtracting contributions from soil moisture snow canopy storage and river storage groundwater depletion was found to represent approximately 60 of the total volume of water lost voss et al 2013 joodaki et al 2014 merging the global land data assimilation system gldas model and satellite altimetry data as a prior data with grace tws forootan et al 2014 estimated a negative average trend of about 1 5 cm yr over central and northwestern iran during the 2005 2011 period a recent study by rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 has shown that the trend values obtained from grace after removing soil moisture from gldas correlated well with the observed groundwater level variations in 4 sub watersheds in iran the aforementioned studies have assessed water loss in iran over a short time period and did not include the grace fo observations moreover satellite gravimetric data have not been investigated together with groundwater level observations gauged via a country wide dense network of piezometric wells this study provides the first estimate of total water storage loss twsl together with the uncertainty in iran over the last two decades the analysis incorporates the measurements of tws from grace and grace fo precipitation from a dense network of rain gauges together with globally gridded datasets and also groundwater level from piezometric wells the results of our analysis are reported for the entire country and for the first time over its 30 major river basins our analysis shows significant twsl over the whole country recently the massive flood events in early 2019 took place in a large area of iran yadollahie 2019 which brought a considerable amount of water to the system this study for the first time quantifies the contribution of these events to the tws recover of iran furthermore using a dense network of piezometric wells we quantify groundwater depletion as one of the leading representative indicators of anthropogenic activities and water bankruptcy 2 the study region iran has an area of about 1 7million km2 and is located in the south west of asia fig 1 a the country s main water bodies include the world s largest by area inland water body called the caspian sea in the north the persian gulf and the sea of oman in the south and lake urmia in the northwest two large mountain ranges cover 60 of the area the alborz chain running from the northwest to the northeast along the southern edge of the caspian sea and the zagros range which runs from the northwest southward to the shores of the persian gulf the central part of the country is covered by two large deserts dasht e kavir about 77 600 km2 and the lut desert dasht e lut about 51 800 km2 which are the world s 24th and 25th largest deserts iran is divided into six main water basins which are subdivided into 30 major river basins the characteristics of the river basins are listed in table 1 the first digit in the basin s id represents the number out of 6 major basins in iran and the second indicates the sub basins in terms of climate iran is located in the subtropical high pressure belt of the earth however the variety of topographic regions with heights varying from 25 m to 5600 m has led to a wide range of climates across the country most of the country is arid 65 to semi arid 20 with sweltering summers in the central and southern coastal regions while only 15 is humid mainly at regions close to the caspian sea and partly in areas close to the persian gulf and sea of oman madani 2014 fig 1 d using the data from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc the long term 1960 2016 mean annual precipitation for the entire country is around 225 mm 370 km3 while precipitation can be as low as 50 mm year in deserts and exceed 1500 mm year in the northern side of the alborz mountain range and the coastal areas of the caspian sea fig 1 e in terms of annual precipitation iran ranked 158 among 189 countries over the 1960 2016 period using gpcc as the reference dataset around 30 of the total precipitation falls in the form of snow mousavi 2005 but this share seems to be declining over the last decade araghi and mousavi baygi 2020 about 70 of the precipitation is lost through evaporation lehane 2014 3 data 3 1 precipitation in this study precipitation data from a dense network of 2850 stations covering 1983 2013 has been collected such a network is installed and maintained by iran s meteorological organization irimo and iran s water resources management company iwrm fig 1 c illustrates the distribution of gauges throughout iran continuous in situ observations up to the end of 2019 are available only for a limited number of rain gauges less than 400 which does not provide a desirably dense network of measurements therefore we evaluate the performance of 10 gridded precipitation datasets that include observations from 1983 to the end of 2013 over iran s basins table 2 the datasets perform inconsistently over different regions saemian et al 2021 the discrepancies in performance might arise due to the diverse climate of iran and the inhomogeneous distribution of rain gauges see fig s7 thus at each basin we assess the performance of these datasets using the in situ observations and select the best group of them see section 4 2 for more details the ensemble mean of the selected datasets at each basin is then used for calculating the long term monthly mean 1983 2002 and precipitation anomaly over the study period 2003 2019 to compute the reference in situ dataset we first perform quality control and homogeneity tests for all the stations the four tests namely the buishand range test buishand 1982 the von neumann ratio test von neumann 1941 the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1986 and the pettit test pettit 1979 are used to check the homogeneity in order to identify the inconsistencies we have applied the double mass curve test searcy and hardison 1960 the above mentioned tests are described in section 1 of the supplementary materials based on the aforementioned tests we have excluded 19 stations from our assessments the remaining stations do not show data outages within 1983 2013 during this period at each month we average gauge values for each 0 5 0 5 grid cells in order to reduce the uncertainty from gauge measurements only grid cells containing at least three gauges are considered in the estimation adler et al 2003 xue et al 2013 please see the distribution of cells with and without data in fig s4 two basins 47 and 46 suffer from sparsity of gauged cells these spatial gaps are located at two large deserts dasht e kavir and the lut desert described in section 2 where we expect limited precipitation variation therefore the gauged cells of these two basins can be generalized to the whole basin the gridded datasets are classified into three classes gauge based satellite based and reanalysis products see table 2 all gridded precipitation datasets are re sampled to 0 5 0 5 using nearest neighbor interpolation to be consistent with the gridded data from ground data all datasets have been briefly introduced in section 2 of the supplementary material 3 2 groundwater level data this study relies on the groundwater observations of 13 879 piezometric wells from iwrm http wrs wrm ir amar last access 20 april 2020 with the most updated available data up to june 2017 fig 1 b we selected the wells covering 2003 2016 with less than 12 months gap well observations after 2016 were not available at the time of writing the paper we first apply quality control and eliminated outliers and biases for each group of wells within their corresponding aquifer to fill the gaps we use spline interpolation in order to estimate the time series of mean groundwater level anomaly gwla at each basin the time series of gwl at each well is standardized using its mean and standard deviation the standardization enables us to merge wells that carry different properties tourian et al 2015 then in each aquifer we calculate the ensemble mean of all standardized levels and multiply the obtained time series by the average of the well s standard deviations before standardization finally to determine the time series of mean groundwater level anomaly and the corresponding uncertainty at each basin we have employed the weighted least squares estimation using the area of the aquifers as the weights the method is depicted schematically in two main steps in fig s8 3 3 grace and grace follow on we use satellite gravimetry to track total water storage anomaly twsa we use the grace and the grace fo level 02 spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 96 from itsg grace2018 which is the latest gravity field model computed by he institute of geodesy at graz university of technology itsg graz mayer g√ºrr et al 2018 kvas et al 2019 have shown that the time series from itsg grace2018 is consistent with the current release rl06 of the official grace processing centers csr gfz and jpl moreover itsg grace2018 slightly outperforms the official solutions in the noise of mid to high degrees spherical harmonics the data covers the period from january 2003 to the end of 2019 with a gap of about one year july 2017 may 2018 which is the gap between grace and the grace fo the degree 2 and order 0 coefficient c 20 in these grace fields is replaced by the c 20 coefficient derived from satellite laser ranging slr solutions cheng et al 2013 in order to account for the change in the earth s center of mass the degree 1 coefficients are replaced according to swenson et al 2008 to calculate geoid anomalies we remove the long term 2004 2010 mean of spherical harmonics as an estimation of the static gravity field due to the correlated colored noise in the level 02 products we use a gaussian filter of radius 400 km for filtering devaraju 2015 the smoothing causes damages to the signal via leakage e g chen et al 2006 klees et al 2008 to mitigate this issue we apply the data driven method of deviation proposed by vishwakarma et al 2017 which has been shown to restore the lost signal to a large extent for small catchments finally the twsa time series are calculated for iran and its 30 major river basins at monthly steps see fig s2 grace measurement suffers from gaps mainly after 2011 22 months in total to fill these gaps we have employed spline interpolation for the time series of each basin bibi et al 2021 tourian et al 2021 the uncertainty is obtained by the conventional error propagation of the full error variance covariance matrices provided by itsg wahr et al 2006 it should be noted that basins in the coastal regions in the north of iran are still prone to leakage and the leakage correction would not guarantee to remove all leakages this happens due to the strong negative signal from caspian sea several studies have investigated the challenge of small scale grace applications e g longuevergne et al 2010 huang et al 2015 fig s2 compares the result from the post processing proposed in this study with the csr mascon rl06 version 2 in general in all catchments the twsa estimation follows two mascons products well the correlation between the time series used in this study and the mascons are provided in each basin moreover we have compared twsa using the official grace processing centers csr gfz and jpl with itsg grace2018 in fig s6 4 methodology 4 1 trend analysis the long term behavior of twsa and gwla time series over iran and many of its basins are not necessarily represented by a linear trend cf fig 2 figs s2 s5 twsa time series experienced a new equilibrium level after the 2007 drought tourian et al 2015 moreover the floods in 2019 increased the tws leading to a positive effect on twsa time series a linear trend via least squares fitting fails to capture its non linearity especially for the weak positive trend observed from early 2019 onwards see fig s3 therefore to quantify the water loss or gain from the twsa and groundwater level anomaly we need to extract the nonlinear trend of the time series fig 2 a presents the time series of the twsa over iran within the study period with its uncertainty shown as gray envelope we obtain the long term nonlinear signal using the singular spectrum analysis ssa with a 2 year window the 2 year window results in the minimum linear trend left in the seasonal signal after removing the ssa non linear trend see fig s9 ssa is a model free nonparametric time series analysis method that decomposes a time series into interpretable components blewitt and lavall√©e 2002 however the ssa method does not deliver any uncertainty for the estimated non linear trend therefore to obtain a realistic uncertainty we perturb storage and groundwater time series according to their stochastic information using a monte carlo simulation mooney 1997 metropolis and ulam 1949 to perturb we assume a normal distribution for each monthly value see fig s11 centered at the signal with the estimated uncertainties sections 3 2 and 3 3 as its standard deviation we then simulate 10 000 realizations of the time series to acquire a comprehensive representation of all possible realizations fig 2 b then for each realizations we apply ssa to obtain the non linear trend fig 2 b if we consider the study region as a bucket we can estimate the total water loss or gain from each of the non linear realization by subtracting the last value from the first value fig 2 c to calculate the average annual rate of water loss or gain we divide the result from subtraction by 17 years which corresponds to the total number of years in the study period 2003 2019 the twsl from all realizations form a normal distribution according to the monte carlo simulation assumption see the bottom left of fig 2 c finally the mean of all 10 000 realizations would be the representative tws loss or gain and their three standard deviation would be its uncertainty 4 2 precipitation analysis we quantify relative gain or deficit in precipitation within the past 17 years 2003 2019 gain deficit is considered to be the precipitation higher lower than a reference which is defined as the long term monthly mean from 1983 to 2002 to this end we first analyze the datasets to nominate the most reliable precipitation data of each basin as error measure at each basin we subtracted the monthly gauged precipitation throughout 1983 2013 from the corresponding values in the gridded precipitation datasets saemian et al 2021 showed that the pixel to pixel comparison the method used in this study and the alternative approach of evaluating errors at gauges called point to pixel result in the same ranking among datasets in iran it should be noted that to calculate the monthly values from precipitation datasets at each basin we have included only the grid cells with measurements in the in situ dataset colored cells in fig s4 to evaluate the results we do not rely on any standard metric like nash sutcliffe root mean square of errors rmse or bias as they provide only a summary rather than a full view of the error instead we look at the whole distribution of the error which allows us to evaluate errors in all quantiles the errors contain both negative and positive values and are typically biased and not centered at zero we fold the error over its median referred to as over median folded error omfe and then build its cumulative distribution function cdf fig 3 b shows the cdf of 10 precipitation datasets over the lake urmia basin they perform similarly with 55 70 of the omfe below 10 mm at each basin we select the precipitation datasets with omfe at 90 th percentile less than 15 of the mean annual precipitation of the basin with the mean taken from gpcc see fig 3 b the selected datasets are shown in fig 3 a for each basin we calculate the ensemble mean and its corresponding uncertainty of the selected datasets using the weighted least squares method the omfe values at 90 quantile from the selected datasets are employed as their weight in the weighted least squares adjustment we quantified water input stability at each basin by the precipitation anomaly Œ¥p t y m for the period of 2003 2019 with respect to its climatology long term monthly mean 1983 2002 1 Œ¥ p t y m p t y m 1 20 y 1983 2002 p t y m where p is the precipitation t y m represent the discrete time month m varying from 1 to 12 and year y varying from 1983 to 2002 the anomalies Œ¥p t y m represent the gain or deficit in precipitation at each month relative to the long term monthly mean we then obtain the long term mean annual anomaly by 2 Œ¥ p 1 17 y 2003 2019 m 1 12 Œ¥ p t y m 5 results fig 4 a presents the time series of grace twsa over iran from 2003 to 2019 the time evolution of the twsl relative to the initial epoch is shown in fig 4 b the larger uncertainties around 2015 and 2017 are related to the battery issue at the end of the grace mission the tws exhibited a weak positive trend from 2003 to 2005 which brought about 23 km3 water to the system the short lived positive trend in tws was followed by a continuous negative trend from 2006 to 2016 triggered by the drought in 2007 during which iran has lost about 256 km3 water corresponding to a rate of about 23 25 km3 yr the negative trend ended in early 2017 and twsa showed a weak positive trend from 2017 to the end of 2019 within 2017 2019 tws gained about 31 km3 at a rate of about 10 3 km3 yr overall since 2003 iran has lost 211 34 km3 of its tws at an average rate of about 12 2 km3 yr this water amount corresponds to about half of lake erie s volume https www epa gov greatlakes physical features great lakeswww epa gov one of the great lakes in north america moreover least squares spectral analysis lssa method wells et al 1985 revealed that the annual amplitude amounted to 7 4 cm over the study period 2003 2019 which represents 122 km3 of water the annual tws variation has not remained constant within the last two decades and has followed three main phases i e from 2003 to 2007 with 8 5 cm from 2008 to 2015 with 7 4 cm and finally from 2016 to 2019 with 9 cm the smaller annual variation throughout 2008 2015 is mainly driven by a continuous decrease in the precipitation cf fig s1 and fig 4 given a normal situation without drought or flood periods the annual tws variation seems to vary within 8 5 9 cm 140 148 km3 the basin wise distribution of the twsl rates and relative precipitation gain or deficit in iran over the last 17 years 2003 2019 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively fig 5 a presents the result of both rates of twsl in terms of water height colors and volumetric circular disks all major basins suffer from a significant water loss within 2003 2019 varying between 0 07 and 1 8 km3 yr the maximum twsl rate has occurred in the central desert 47 at a rate of 1 8 0 26 km3 yr followed by namak lake 41 lut desert 46 and sefidrood 13 each at a rate of more than 1 km3 yr ghareghoom 60 in the southeast of iran has experienced the minimum water loss 0 07 0 05 km3 yr due to the inevitable post processing process described in section 3 3 and the coarse spatial resolution of grace e g rowlands et al 2005 longuevergne et al 2010 lorenz et al 2014 vishwakarma et al 2018 the final results carry uncertainties and errors therefore grace observations should not be over interpreted especially in small catchments like talesh 12 or haraz sefidrood 14 it is noteworthy that for the same period the water input reflects a different picture fig 5 b relative to climatology the water resource system has gained water from precipitation at a total rate of 10 28 0 03 km3 yr in 17 basins about 54 of the area while in the 13 other basins about 46 of the area the total rate is 5 42 0 03 km3 yr overall the whole country has gained water from precipitation at the rate of 4 86 0 02 km3 yr the karun basin 23 has experienced the maximum amount of gain at a rate of 1 87 0 25 km3 yr while the adjacent karkheh basin 22 shows the maximum deficit at a rate of 1 0 11 km3 yr generally these results are mirrored by in situ observations shown in fig 5 d the discrepancies in some basins like 23 43 60 and 13 can be explained by the lack of sufficient in situ gauge with long covering 1983 2019 observations we calculated the gain or loss at 380 gauge stations gauged from 1983 to the end of 2019 with less than one year data outages within 2003 2019 gauge results match very well the gridded data sets fig 5 b the poor density of stations in the middle and eastern parts of the country is due to two vast deserts namely the lut desert 46 and central desert 47 in the middle of the iranian plateau besides the tws gain or loss it is crucial to scrutinize how the water status evolved within 2003 2019 the drought event around 2007 2008 and the heavy rainfall in 2019 are two significant events that had a notable influence on the evolution fig 6 eleven basins with an area of about 40 of the country have remained in deficit after the 2007 drought including karkheh 22 lake urmia 30 and helle 25 in general about 25 of the whole country 6 basins including lut desert 46 karkheh 22 and hamun hirmand 52 have never experienced a gain in the relative precipitation during 2003 2019 almost all basins underwent heavy rainfall in early 2019 fig s1 considering the long term mean for the period 1983 2002 as the reference the whole country gained around 115 0 8 km3 water in 2019 the central desert 47 received the maximum gain with about 1 04 0 05 km3 followed by the namak lake 41 the mand 26 the karun 23 and the lut basin 46 all gaining more than 0 4 km3 water comparing fig 5 b and c such a heavy rainfall led to a change in the gain deficit pattern in three basins 20 of the total area namely mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 and the central desert 47 moreover significant changes in gaining or losing water status are observed in karkheh 22 karun 23 and lut desert 46 cf the last two sub figures in fig 6 to properly interpret the water loss from satellite gravimetry we need to look at the mean annual precipitation gain or deficit from 2003 to 2019 relative to their climatology determined within the reference period 1983 2002 fig 7 a shows gaining or losing water status in percentage representing alarming rainfall deficit in basins hamun hirmand 52 khaf 51 and helle 25 by more than 10 in the northern and central major basins we observe a general gain by more than 10 of their mean annual precipitation the percentage values of the total water loss with respect to the corresponding amplitude of the twsa signal trend to variability ratio gives a sense how relevant the trend is with respect to the natural variability rahmstorf and coumou 2011 lehmann et al 2015 considering the root mean squared rms of the twsa as the amplitude the trend to variability varies between 8 and 14 per year fig 7 b all the obtained results are associated with uncertainties which we have tried to address in this study fig 8 a illustrates the rate of water loss together with their uncertainty despite their size the lut desert 46 and central desert 47 show high uncertainty due to the weak signal which does not go beyond the grace noise level the basin wise gain or loss from precipitation and their corresponding uncertainty are shown in fig 8 b the gain or loss of five basins namely sefidrood 13 mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 lake urmia 30 and central desert 47 is undecided as their error bar contains the zero level it is remarkable that basins like aras 11 karun 23 namak lake 41 and ghareghoom 60 have gained more than 1 km3 water while grace senses a negative trend it should be noted that the grace estimates for small basins like aras 11 talesh 12 haraz sefidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and atrak river 17 are prone to leakage such added uncertainty however will marginally affect the estimates of the trend since the water stored as surface water soil moisture canopy water and snow equivalent water is negligible in an arid to semi arid climate of iran abou zaki et al 2019 van camp et al 2010 the negative trend in grace and simultaneous precipitation gain can only be explained by increased groundwater extraction more than 90 of iran s water is allocated to the agricultural sectors and farming relies heavily on groundwater for irrigation madani 2014 the number of wells in the time period 1971 2013 has dramatically increased from just over 47 000 to nearly 789 000 noor 2017 moreover reliance on groundwater has increased steadily during droughts it should be noted that in the basins with considerable soil moisture content like the coastal basins with humid climate and mountainous regions the assumption of negligible surface water and soil moisture contribution to the tws may not hold and needs to be investigated to quantify the drop rate of the mean groundwater level we analyzed groundwater level data from the piezometric stations fig 1 b fig 9 represents the relative annual loss or gain rate of the groundwater level of the major basins in iran including their uncertainties given the unknown storage coefficients of aquifers results are reported in cm as an absolute volume quantification is not possible the heterogeneous behavior of different aquifers in each basin resulted in large uncertainty values compared to those from grace or precipitation groundwater level has been dropped in most main river basins of iran except for the basins near the caspian sea namely talesh 12 haraz sefiidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and south baluchestan 29 see fig 10 b the maximum loss has occurred in the mehran kal 27 at the rate of 47 7 6 cm yr followed by saghand 49 abarghoo sirjan 44 ghareghoom 60 and namak lake 41 based on the piezometric well observations more than 90 of the aquifers show negative trends within the study period while in 35 of them the groundwater level has dropped more than 40 cm yr fig 10 a depict the tws loss rate using the grace observation within 2003 2016 which is the same period of gwla data fig 10 b the annual rate of the mean groundwater level drop in this study is consistent with a recent estimation by noori et al 2021 fig 11 a represents the groundwater level anomaly gwla time series for entire iran together with the twsa from grace over the period from 2003 to the end of 2016 we observe that the gwla is highly correlated with twsa corr 0 97 the mean gwla in iran has dropped dramatically during the last two decades triggered by the drought in 2007 considering the period from 2003 to 2016 the mean groundwater shows a significant negative trend of about 28 1 4 cm yr while this rate was about 8 1 3 3 cm yr and 25 3 1 9 cm yr before and after 2008 respectively the high correlation and the same trend behavior between twsa and gwla highlight the notable contribution of groundwater depletion in iran s twsl observed by grace the green and red background in fig 11 a refer to the two distinct patterns observed in the scatter plot of the twsa versus groundwater level fig 11 b except for the humid regions about 15 of the country with considerable contribution from soil moisture anomaly rahmani et al 2016 and the variation in lake urmia in the northwest tourian et al 2015 ashraf et al 2019 the gwsa is the dominant compartment of the twsa in most of iran therefore the scatter points slope implicitly reveals the storativity or the storage coefficient since it maps the water table to the volume quantity for an unconfined aquifer which most aquifers in iran are the storage coefficient is approximately equal to the specific yield two distinct slopes the green line from 2003 to 2007 about 0 072 and the red one from 2008 to 2016 0 04 implicitly indicates that the acceleration in groundwater loss in last years brought the groundwater to a deeper level with a different soil structure fig 11 b another likely reason can be that groundwater extraction in many regions of iran has become more challenging and expensive as the groundwater drops also below a certain level there may not be even much water left for extraction at least for a period of time in each year 6 discussion this study quantifies the twsl in iran s 30 major river basins over the last 17 years 2003 2019 the findings based on grace observations show a significant water loss in all basins of iran leading to a twsl of 211 34 km3 fig 4 at a rate of 12 2 km3 yr our findings are consistent with those reported by previous studies focusing on different time periods e g voss et al 2013 forootan et al 2014 joodaki et al 2014 ashraf et al 2021 panahi et al 2020 the total water consumption in iran is estimated at about 96 km3 khoosefi 2018 hence our analysis shows that iran has lost more than twice of its annual water consumption over the last two decades most of the water has been lost during 2008 2016 triggered by one of the two most severe droughts of the last 50 years in the middle east due to the coarse spatial resolution of grace the results over smaller basins come with inherent uncertainty moreover the results in the caspian sea coastal region are prone to leakage error due to the strong negative trend in the signal of the caspian sea using the piezometric wells observations two recent studies namely ashraf et al 2021 and noori et al 2021 estimated iran s groundwater storage depletion within 2002 2015 to be around 75 km3 based on our analysis iran has lost about 241 km3 of its tws within 2003 2015 considering tws as the sum of groundwater surface water soil moisture and snow water we can derive an estimate of about 166 km3 for the water loss from the surface soil and snow in iran within 2003 2015 the shrinkage of the lake urmia about 11 km3 and the reported d r ying up lakes like lake hamun and lake bakhtegan narrowing of permanent rivers width and the disappearance of seasonal rivers are only a few shreds of evidence in agreement with this estimate in 17 basins despite a water gain from precipitation within the study period the tws has dropped these basins covering about 55 of the whole country are mostly located along with the mountainous areas excluding the heavy rainfall of early 2019 still 15 basins out of 17 show gain in precipitation the coastal basins talesh 12 haraz sefiidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and south baluchestan 29 show a positive overall rate in the time series of their groundwater level this observation suggests that a considerable amount of water from precipitation in these basins has infiltrated into deeper soil layers and has recharged aquifers the water loss seen by grace in these five basins can be explained by a possible significant amount of runoff into the caspian sea basins 12 14 15 16 or into the sea of oman basin 29 and evapotranspiration from vast agricultural fields on the other hand in 60 of the basins mentioned above the discrepancies between the water storage loss seen by grace and the gain from precipitation can be explained with the considerable negative rate of groundwater loss see fig 10 these basins were among the top 15 in groundwater loss indicating a remarkable contribution of anthropogenic effects mainly via expanding agricultural activities groundwater storage loss can be investigated via data assimilation techniques to some extent e g li et al 2019 moreover groundwater storage can be estimated from the mean groundwater level using the storage coefficients nevertheless due to the lack of accurate storage coefficients it is impossible to quantify the contribution of the groundwater to the twsl for each basin however the high correlation 0 97 between groundwater drop and twsa fig 11 indicates a substantial contribution of water withdrawal from agricultural wells in the observed negative trend tourian et al 2015 reached the same conclusion over the lake urmia basin using the correlation between gwla and twsa it should be noted that however for more convincing conclusion one would need to estimate gwsa and conduct a causality analysis we highlight that the piezometric wells observations are limited mainly to the groundwater level in aquifers these aquifers are located in the plains excluding groundwater flow in mountainous terrains in case the measurements in mountainous regions were available we would expect a higher rate of groundwater withdrawal due to the bedrocks steeper slope however since the main groundwater level fluctuations occur in irrigated plains the contribution of groundwater depletion in the mountainous regions in the estimation of total groundwater decline should be negligible considering the potential role of the surface groundwater interaction it should be noted that the accelerated increase in the water withdrawals over the recent years would result in the decrease of the groundwater contribution to the baseflow this decline has already been observed in the lake urmia basin by vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 and needs to be further investigated in other basins especially in mountainous regions in an arid to a semi arid region like iran groundwater is a precious resource functioning as the backbone of irrigated farming the alarming accelerated rate of groundwater withdrawal after the 2007 drought continued till the end of 2016 maghrebi et al 2020 assessed iran s agricultural activities within 1981 2013 using agricultural area production data from iran s ministry of agriculture jihad ministry of energy and ministry of roads and urban development our results from piezometric wells confirm the finding from maghrebi et al 2020 that the groundwater over exploitation for agriculture and consequently irrigated agricultural production increased despite declining water availability during 2003 2016 since the rate of recharge is slower than the pumping many aquifers would be in danger of being depleted and their water content never be recovered like aquifers in the agriculturally active regions of the world such as high plain scanlon et al 2012 and central valley aquifers famiglietti et al 2011 in the united states or the north china plain feng et al 2013 the observed decrease of groundwater extraction in many parts of iran fig s5 is attributable to the physical constraints and the inefficiency of pumping due to high groundwater depth or low water quality and not necessarily to groundwater conservation and monitoring efforts across the country madani 2014 tourian et al 2015 ashraf et al 2017 2021 noori et al 2021 lake urmia in northwestern iran is one of the largest lakes in the middle east this hypersaline lake has shrunk drastically over the last two decades to less than 30 of its original surface area and it lost more than 30 of its water volume from 1995 to 2015 based on the results presented in fig 8 and fig 9 the basin has lost water at a rate of 0 7 0 05 km3 yr one of the top 6 river basins in losing water storage in iran over the study period fig 5 a although the overall deficit from precipitation over the last two decades is mild the basin has suffered from a long period of persistent water loss from 2007 onwards fig 6 the expansion of agricultural land khazaei et al 2019 together with water loss from precipitation put pressure on this basin s water resources and encouraged increased groundwater use this study has quantified the tws loss within the last two decades over iran and its 30 major river basins together with the analysis of the precipitation and the groundwater level the alarming values reported in this study justify further investigations to be conducted to understand the underlying reasons the country wide analysis of the hydro climatic variables like temperature vegetation indices and evapotranspiration must be conducted along with the assessment of the long term impacts of water resources management strategies adopted by the decision makers such as dam construction and inter basin water transfers further studies can also benefit from the focused investigation of the interactions of the water resources in the border basins 7 conclusions this study quantified water loss in iran and its 30 major river basins over the last two decades using observations from satellite gravimetry grace and grace fo precipitation datasets gauged and global gridded and groundwater from piezometric wells we used a monte carlo simulation method to quantify the non linear trend and stochasticity of the tws data to interpret the twsl we determined gain or loss in water status from precipitation taking precipitation as the primary input to the water system we selected a set of precipitation datasets with the best performance for each basin using observations from a dense network of rain gauges we also computed the groundwater level depletion from 13 879 piezometric wells over the last two decades in summary the study results suggest that iran s twsl was about 211 34 km3 over the 2003 2019 period with an average rate of 12 2 km3 yr which is significant for a country with limited water resources availability the water loss rate varied between 0 07 to 1 8 km3 yr in the 30 major basins with the highest depletion in the central desert basin 47 and the lowest in the ghareghoom basin 60 the variation of tws was 7 4 cm occurring in three main phases i e from 2003 to 2007 8 5 cm from 2008 to 2015 7 4 cm and finally from 2016 to 2019 9 cm a significant deficit in water input in 2008 2010 2013 and 2014 led to the smaller annual variation of water storage throughout 2008 2015 given a normal situation without drought periods the annual variation of tws over entire iran seemed to vary within 8 5 9 cm overall the whole country has gained water from precipitation at the rate of 4 9 0 02 km3 yr with respect to a long term 1983 2002 reference about 46 of iran showed precipitation deficit with the overall rate of 5 4 0 03 km3 yr and 54 of the country gained water with the overall rate of 10 3 0 03 km3 yr the karun bain 23 experienced the largest gain 1 9 0 25 km3 yr while its neighboring karkheh basin 22 had the largest deficit of 1 0 11 km3 yr among the major basins our analysis highlights two significant extreme periods namely the 2007 drought and early 2019 flood the drought period changed the status of at least five basins from water gain to water loss it aggravated the deficit in 9 basins and resulted in a total deficit of 115 0 6 km3 on the other hand iran gained the same amount of water 115 0 8 km3 from the floods in early 2019 however these floods did not remedy water scarcity since a large portion of flood water did not recharge groundwater however it positively contributed to water resources in all major basins especially the mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 and central desert 47 basins 20 of the total area the mean groundwater level of iran showed a significant negative trend of about 28 1 4 cm yr highly correlated corr 0 97 with the grace twsa from 2003 to 2016 the high correlation and similar trend behavior between twsa and gwl indicates a notable contribution of groundwater depletion in the grace water storage decline groundwater level declined at a rate of 8 1 3 3 cm yr before 2007 and accelerated 25 3 1 9 cm yr after the 2007 drought the maximum water depletion occurred in the mehran kal 27 at the rate of 4 35 cm yr followed by the saghand 49 abarghoo sirjan 44 ghareghoom 60 and namak lake 41 basins about 35 of aquifers were mined at a rate of more than 40 cm yr we derived an estimate of about 166 km3 for iran s water loss from surface soil and snow water during 2003 2015 this is obtained by subtracting the estimate of groundwater storage loss from recent studies of ashraf et al 2021 and noori et al 2021 75 km3 from our estimate of water storage loss over the same period 241 km3 we observed two distinct patterns in the relationship between the twsa and groundwater level one with a slope of 0 07 over 2003 2007 and the other with a slope of 0 04 during 2008 2016 this finding suggests that accelerated groundwater loss in recent years brought the groundwater level to a deeper level with a different soil structure credit authorship contribution

7985,study area iran study focus iran once a pioneer of sustainable water management is currently facing water bankruptcy aggressive exhaustion of non renewable water has led to a suite of environmental and socio economic problems across the country nevertheless the understanding of iran s water loss is still incomplete due to a lack of conclusive data in this study we employ satellite gravimetry observations in situ and globally precipitation data and gauged groundwater level to investigate the total water storage tws loss in iran over the last two decades new hydrological insights for the region we quantify iran s water loss using a data driven approach supported by a monte carlo simulation our analysis indicates tws loss of 211 34 km3 twice iran s annual water consumption within the 2003 2019 period the mean groundwater level has dropped significantly at a rate of 28 1 4 cm yr this tremendous water loss happened despite an overall increased relative precipitation rate of 4 9 0 02 km3 yr thus the tws loss can only be explained by drastic overexploitation of non renewable water resources two major extreme events occurred during the study period namely the 2007 drought and early 2019 floods the former resulted in a total 115 0 6 km3 water loss one third of the long term annual precipitation approximately the same amount was brought back by a series of extreme precipitation events leading to floods in early 2019 our results raise critical issues regarding unsustainable water management in iran and highlight the crucial role of spaceborne

trend was also reported in joodaki et al 2014 over western iran and eastern iraq from 2003 to 2012 by subtracting contributions from soil moisture snow canopy storage and river storage groundwater depletion was found to represent approximately 60 of the total volume of water lost voss et al 2013 joodaki et al 2014 merging the global land data assimilation system gldas model and satellite altimetry data as a prior data with grace tws forootan et al 2014 estimated a negative average trend of about 1 5 cm yr over central and northwestern iran during the 2005 2011 period a recent study by rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 has shown that the trend values obtained from grace after removing soil moisture from gldas correlated well with the observed groundwater level variations in 4 sub watersheds in iran the aforementioned studies have assessed water loss in iran over a short time period and did not include the grace fo observations moreover satellite gravimetric data have not been investigated together with groundwater level observations gauged via a country wide dense network of piezometric wells this study provides the first estimate of total water storage loss twsl together with the uncertainty in iran over the last two decades the analysis incorporates the measurements of tws from grace and grace fo precipitation from a dense network of rain gauges together with globally gridded datasets and also groundwater level from piezometric wells the results of our analysis are reported for the entire country and for the first time over its 30 major river basins our analysis shows significant twsl over the whole country recently the massive flood events in early 2019 took place in a large area of iran yadollahie 2019 which brought a considerable amount of water to the system this study for the first time quantifies the contribution of these events to the tws recover of iran furthermore using a dense network of piezometric wells we quantify groundwater depletion as one of the leading representative indicators of anthropogenic activities and water bankruptcy 2 the study region iran has an area of about 1 7million km2 and is located in the south west of asia fig 1 a the country s main water bodies include the world s largest by area inland water body called the caspian sea in the north the persian gulf and the sea of oman in the south and lake urmia in the northwest two large mountain ranges cover 60 of the area the alborz chain running from the northwest to the northeast along the southern edge of the caspian sea and the zagros range which runs from the northwest southward to the shores of the persian gulf the central part of the country is covered by two large deserts dasht e kavir about 77 600 km2 and the lut desert dasht e lut about 51 800 km2 which are the world s 24th and 25th largest deserts iran is divided into six main water basins which are subdivided into 30 major river basins the characteristics of the river basins are listed in table 1 the first digit in the basin s id represents the number out of 6 major basins in iran and the second indicates the sub basins in terms of climate iran is located in the subtropical high pressure belt of the earth however the variety of topographic regions with heights varying from 25 m to 5600 m has led to a wide range of climates across the country most of the country is arid 65 to semi arid 20 with sweltering summers in the central and southern coastal regions while only 15 is humid mainly at regions close to the caspian sea and partly in areas close to the persian gulf and sea of oman madani 2014 fig 1 d using the data from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc the long term 1960 2016 mean annual precipitation for the entire country is around 225 mm 370 km3 while precipitation can be as low as 50 mm year in deserts and exceed 1500 mm year in the northern side of the alborz mountain range and the coastal areas of the caspian sea fig 1 e in terms of annual precipitation iran ranked 158 among 189 countries over the 1960 2016 period using gpcc as the reference dataset around 30 of the total precipitation falls in the form of snow mousavi 2005 but this share seems to be declining over the last decade araghi and mousavi baygi 2020 about 70 of the precipitation is lost through evaporation lehane 2014 3 data 3 1 precipitation in this study precipitation data from a dense network of 2850 stations covering 1983 2013 has been collected such a network is installed and maintained by iran s meteorological organization irimo and iran s water resources management company iwrm fig 1 c illustrates the distribution of gauges throughout iran continuous in situ observations up to the end of 2019 are available only for a limited number of rain gauges less than 400 which does not provide a desirably dense network of measurements therefore we evaluate the performance of 10 gridded precipitation datasets that include observations from 1983 to the end of 2013 over iran s basins table 2 the datasets perform inconsistently over different regions saemian et al 2021 the discrepancies in performance might arise due to the diverse climate of iran and the inhomogeneous distribution of rain gauges see fig s7 thus at each basin we assess the performance of these datasets using the in situ observations and select the best group of them see section 4 2 for more details the ensemble mean of the selected datasets at each basin is then used for calculating the long term monthly mean 1983 2002 and precipitation anomaly over the study period 2003 2019 to compute the reference in situ dataset we first perform quality control and homogeneity tests for all the stations the four tests namely the buishand range test buishand 1982 the von neumann ratio test von neumann 1941 the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1986 and the pettit test pettit 1979 are used to check the homogeneity in order to identify the inconsistencies we have applied the double mass curve test searcy and hardison 1960 the above mentioned tests are described in section 1 of the supplementary materials based on the aforementioned tests we have excluded 19 stations from our assessments the remaining stations do not show data outages within 1983 2013 during this period at each month we average gauge values for each 0 5 0 5 grid cells in order to reduce the uncertainty from gauge measurements only grid cells containing at least three gauges are considered in the estimation adler et al 2003 xue et al 2013 please see the distribution of cells with and without data in fig s4 two basins 47 and 46 suffer from sparsity of gauged cells these spatial gaps are located at two large deserts dasht e kavir and the lut desert described in section 2 where we expect limited precipitation variation therefore the gauged cells of these two basins can be generalized to the whole basin the gridded datasets are classified into three classes gauge based satellite based and reanalysis products see table 2 all gridded precipitation datasets are re sampled to 0 5 0 5 using nearest neighbor interpolation to be consistent with the gridded data from ground data all datasets have been briefly introduced in section 2 of the supplementary material 3 2 groundwater level data this study relies on the groundwater observations of 13 879 piezometric wells from iwrm http wrs wrm ir amar last access 20 april 2020 with the most updated available data up to june 2017 fig 1 b we selected the wells covering 2003 2016 with less than 12 months gap well observations after 2016 were not available at the time of writing the paper we first apply quality control and eliminated outliers and biases for each group of wells within their corresponding aquifer to fill the gaps we use spline interpolation in order to estimate the time series of mean groundwater level anomaly gwla at each basin the time series of gwl at each well is standardized using its mean and standard deviation the standardization enables us to merge wells that carry different properties tourian et al 2015 then in each aquifer we calculate the ensemble mean of all standardized levels and multiply the obtained time series by the average of the well s standard deviations before standardization finally to determine the time series of mean groundwater level anomaly and the corresponding uncertainty at each basin we have employed the weighted least squares estimation using the area of the aquifers as the weights the method is depicted schematically in two main steps in fig s8 3 3 grace and grace follow on we use satellite gravimetry to track total water storage anomaly twsa we use the grace and the grace fo level 02 spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 96 from itsg grace2018 which is the latest gravity field model computed by he institute of geodesy at graz university of technology itsg graz mayer g√ºrr et al 2018 kvas et al 2019 have shown that the time series from itsg grace2018 is consistent with the current release rl06 of the official grace processing centers csr gfz and jpl moreover itsg grace2018 slightly outperforms the official solutions in the noise of mid to high degrees spherical harmonics the data covers the period from january 2003 to the end of 2019 with a gap of about one year july 2017 may 2018 which is the gap between grace and the grace fo the degree 2 and order 0 coefficient c 20 in these grace fields is replaced by the c 20 coefficient derived from satellite laser ranging slr solutions cheng et al 2013 in order to account for the change in the earth s center of mass the degree 1 coefficients are replaced according to swenson et al 2008 to calculate geoid anomalies we remove the long term 2004 2010 mean of spherical harmonics as an estimation of the static gravity field due to the correlated colored noise in the level 02 products we use a gaussian filter of radius 400 km for filtering devaraju 2015 the smoothing causes damages to the signal via leakage e g chen et al 2006 klees et al 2008 to mitigate this issue we apply the data driven method of deviation proposed by vishwakarma et al 2017 which has been shown to restore the lost signal to a large extent for small catchments finally the twsa time series are calculated for iran and its 30 major river basins at monthly steps see fig s2 grace measurement suffers from gaps mainly after 2011 22 months in total to fill these gaps we have employed spline interpolation for the time series of each basin bibi et al 2021 tourian et al 2021 the uncertainty is obtained by the conventional error propagation of the full error variance covariance matrices provided by itsg wahr et al 2006 it should be noted that basins in the coastal regions in the north of iran are still prone to leakage and the leakage correction would not guarantee to remove all leakages this happens due to the strong negative signal from caspian sea several studies have investigated the challenge of small scale grace applications e g longuevergne et al 2010 huang et al 2015 fig s2 compares the result from the post processing proposed in this study with the csr mascon rl06 version 2 in general in all catchments the twsa estimation follows two mascons products well the correlation between the time series used in this study and the mascons are provided in each basin moreover we have compared twsa using the official grace processing centers csr gfz and jpl with itsg grace2018 in fig s6 4 methodology 4 1 trend analysis the long term behavior of twsa and gwla time series over iran and many of its basins are not necessarily represented by a linear trend cf fig 2 figs s2 s5 twsa time series experienced a new equilibrium level after the 2007 drought tourian et al 2015 moreover the floods in 2019 increased the tws leading to a positive effect on twsa time series a linear trend via least squares fitting fails to capture its non linearity especially for the weak positive trend observed from early 2019 onwards see fig s3 therefore to quantify the water loss or gain from the twsa and groundwater level anomaly we need to extract the nonlinear trend of the time series fig 2 a presents the time series of the twsa over iran within the study period with its uncertainty shown as gray envelope we obtain the long term nonlinear signal using the singular spectrum analysis ssa with a 2 year window the 2 year window results in the minimum linear trend left in the seasonal signal after removing the ssa non linear trend see fig s9 ssa is a model free nonparametric time series analysis method that decomposes a time series into interpretable components blewitt and lavall√©e 2002 however the ssa method does not deliver any uncertainty for the estimated non linear trend therefore to obtain a realistic uncertainty we perturb storage and groundwater time series according to their stochastic information using a monte carlo simulation mooney 1997 metropolis and ulam 1949 to perturb we assume a normal distribution for each monthly value see fig s11 centered at the signal with the estimated uncertainties sections 3 2 and 3 3 as its standard deviation we then simulate 10 000 realizations of the time series to acquire a comprehensive representation of all possible realizations fig 2 b then for each realizations we apply ssa to obtain the non linear trend fig 2 b if we consider the study region as a bucket we can estimate the total water loss or gain from each of the non linear realization by subtracting the last value from the first value fig 2 c to calculate the average annual rate of water loss or gain we divide the result from subtraction by 17 years which corresponds to the total number of years in the study period 2003 2019 the twsl from all realizations form a normal distribution according to the monte carlo simulation assumption see the bottom left of fig 2 c finally the mean of all 10 000 realizations would be the representative tws loss or gain and their three standard deviation would be its uncertainty 4 2 precipitation analysis we quantify relative gain or deficit in precipitation within the past 17 years 2003 2019 gain deficit is considered to be the precipitation higher lower than a reference which is defined as the long term monthly mean from 1983 to 2002 to this end we first analyze the datasets to nominate the most reliable precipitation data of each basin as error measure at each basin we subtracted the monthly gauged precipitation throughout 1983 2013 from the corresponding values in the gridded precipitation datasets saemian et al 2021 showed that the pixel to pixel comparison the method used in this study and the alternative approach of evaluating errors at gauges called point to pixel result in the same ranking among datasets in iran it should be noted that to calculate the monthly values from precipitation datasets at each basin we have included only the grid cells with measurements in the in situ dataset colored cells in fig s4 to evaluate the results we do not rely on any standard metric like nash sutcliffe root mean square of errors rmse or bias as they provide only a summary rather than a full view of the error instead we look at the whole distribution of the error which allows us to evaluate errors in all quantiles the errors contain both negative and positive values and are typically biased and not centered at zero we fold the error over its median referred to as over median folded error omfe and then build its cumulative distribution function cdf fig 3 b shows the cdf of 10 precipitation datasets over the lake urmia basin they perform similarly with 55 70 of the omfe below 10 mm at each basin we select the precipitation datasets with omfe at 90 th percentile less than 15 of the mean annual precipitation of the basin with the mean taken from gpcc see fig 3 b the selected datasets are shown in fig 3 a for each basin we calculate the ensemble mean and its corresponding uncertainty of the selected datasets using the weighted least squares method the omfe values at 90 quantile from the selected datasets are employed as their weight in the weighted least squares adjustment we quantified water input stability at each basin by the precipitation anomaly Œ¥p t y m for the period of 2003 2019 with respect to its climatology long term

uncertainties around 2015 and 2017 are related to the battery issue at the end of the grace mission the tws exhibited a weak positive trend from 2003 to 2005 which brought about 23 km3 water to the system the short lived positive trend in tws was followed by a continuous negative trend from 2006 to 2016 triggered by the drought in 2007 during which iran has lost about 256 km3 water corresponding to a rate of about 23 25 km3 yr the negative trend ended in early 2017 and twsa showed a weak positive trend from 2017 to the end of 2019 within 2017 2019 tws gained about 31 km3 at a rate of about 10 3 km3 yr overall since 2003 iran has lost 211 34 km3 of its tws at an average rate of about 12 2 km3 yr this water amount corresponds to about half of lake erie s volume https www epa gov greatlakes physical features great lakeswww epa gov one of the great lakes in north america moreover least squares spectral analysis lssa method wells et al 1985 revealed that the annual amplitude amounted to 7 4 cm over the study period 2003 2019 which represents 122 km3 of water the annual tws variation has not remained constant within the last two decades and has followed three main phases i e from 2003 to 2007 with 8 5 cm from 2008 to 2015 with 7 4 cm and finally from 2016 to 2019 with 9 cm the smaller annual variation throughout 2008 2015 is mainly driven by a continuous decrease in the precipitation cf fig s1 and fig 4 given a normal situation without drought or flood periods the annual tws variation seems to vary within 8 5 9 cm 140 148 km3 the basin wise distribution of the twsl rates and relative precipitation gain or deficit in iran over the last 17 years 2003 2019 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively fig 5 a presents the result of both rates of twsl in terms of water height colors and volumetric circular disks all major basins suffer from a significant water loss within 2003 2019 varying between 0 07 and 1 8 km3 yr the maximum twsl rate has occurred in the central desert 47 at a rate of 1 8 0 26 km3 yr followed by namak lake 41 lut desert 46 and sefidrood 13 each at a rate of more than 1 km3 yr ghareghoom 60 in the southeast of iran has experienced the minimum water loss 0 07 0 05 km3 yr due to the inevitable post processing process described in section 3 3 and the coarse spatial resolution of grace e g rowlands et al 2005 longuevergne et al 2010 lorenz et al 2014 vishwakarma et al 2018 the final results carry uncertainties and errors therefore grace observations should not be over interpreted especially in small catchments like talesh 12 or haraz sefidrood 14 it is noteworthy that for the same period the water input reflects a different picture fig 5 b relative to climatology the water resource system has gained water from precipitation at a total rate of 10 28 0 03 km3 yr in 17 basins about 54 of the area while in the 13 other basins about 46 of the area the total rate is 5 42 0 03 km3 yr overall the whole country has gained water from precipitation at the rate of 4 86 0 02 km3 yr the karun basin 23 has experienced the maximum amount of gain at a rate of 1 87 0 25 km3 yr while the adjacent karkheh basin 22 shows the maximum deficit at a rate of 1 0 11 km3 yr generally these results are mirrored by in situ observations shown in fig 5 d the discrepancies in some basins like 23 43 60 and 13 can be explained by the lack of sufficient in situ gauge with long covering 1983 2019 observations we calculated the gain or loss at 380 gauge stations gauged from 1983 to the end of 2019 with less than one year data outages within 2003 2019 gauge results match very well the gridded data sets fig 5 b the poor density of stations in the middle and eastern parts of the country is due to two vast deserts namely the lut desert 46 and central desert 47 in the middle of the iranian plateau besides the tws gain or loss it is crucial to scrutinize how the water status evolved within 2003 2019 the drought event around 2007 2008 and the heavy rainfall in 2019 are two significant events that had a notable influence on the evolution fig 6 eleven basins with an area of about 40 of the country have remained in deficit after the 2007 drought including karkheh 22 lake urmia 30 and helle 25 in general about 25 of the whole country 6 basins including lut desert 46 karkheh 22 and hamun hirmand 52 have never experienced a gain in the relative precipitation during 2003 2019 almost all basins underwent heavy rainfall in early 2019 fig s1 considering the long term mean for the period 1983 2002 as the reference the whole country gained around 115 0 8 km3 water in 2019 the central desert 47 received the maximum gain with about 1 04 0 05 km3 followed by the namak lake 41 the mand 26 the karun 23 and the lut basin 46 all gaining more than 0 4 km3 water comparing fig 5 b and c such a heavy rainfall led to a change in the gain deficit pattern in three basins 20 of the total area namely mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 and the central desert 47 moreover significant changes in gaining or losing water status are observed in karkheh 22 karun 23 and lut desert 46 cf the last two sub figures in fig 6 to properly interpret the water loss from satellite gravimetry we need to look at the mean annual precipitation gain or deficit from 2003 to 2019 relative to their climatology determined within the reference period 1983 2002 fig 7 a shows gaining or losing water status in percentage representing alarming rainfall deficit in basins hamun hirmand 52 khaf 51 and helle 25 by more than 10 in the northern and central major basins we observe a general gain by more than 10 of their mean annual precipitation the percentage values of the total water loss with respect to the corresponding amplitude of the twsa signal trend to variability ratio gives a sense how relevant the trend is with respect to the natural variability rahmstorf and coumou 2011 lehmann et al 2015 considering the root mean squared rms of the twsa as the amplitude the trend to variability varies between 8 and 14 per year fig 7 b all the obtained results are associated with uncertainties which we have tried to address in this study fig 8 a illustrates the rate of water loss together with their uncertainty despite their size the lut desert 46 and central desert 47 show high uncertainty due to the weak signal which does not go beyond the grace noise level the basin wise gain or loss from precipitation and their corresponding uncertainty are shown in fig 8 b the gain or loss of five basins namely sefidrood 13 mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 lake urmia 30 and central desert 47 is undecided as their error bar contains the zero level it is remarkable that basins like aras 11 karun 23 namak lake 41 and ghareghoom 60 have gained more than 1 km3 water while grace senses a negative trend it should be noted that the grace estimates for small basins like aras 11 talesh 12 haraz sefidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and atrak river 17 are prone to leakage such added uncertainty however will marginally affect the estimates of the trend since the water stored as surface water soil moisture canopy water and snow equivalent water is negligible in an arid to semi arid climate of iran abou zaki et al 2019 van camp et al 2010 the negative trend in grace and simultaneous precipitation gain can only be explained by increased groundwater extraction more than 90 of iran s water is allocated to the agricultural sectors and farming relies heavily on groundwater for irrigation madani 2014 the number of wells in the time period 1971 2013 has dramatically increased from just over 47 000 to nearly 789 000 noor 2017 moreover reliance on groundwater has increased steadily during droughts it should be noted that in the basins with considerable soil moisture content like the coastal basins with humid climate and mountainous regions the assumption of negligible surface water and soil moisture contribution to the tws may not hold and needs to be investigated to quantify the drop rate of the mean groundwater level we analyzed groundwater level data from the piezometric stations fig 1 b fig 9 represents the relative annual loss or gain rate of the groundwater level of the major basins in iran including their uncertainties given the unknown storage coefficients of aquifers results are reported in cm as an absolute volume quantification is not possible the heterogeneous behavior of different aquifers in each basin resulted in large uncertainty values compared to those from grace or precipitation groundwater level has been dropped in most main river basins of iran except for the basins near the caspian sea namely talesh 12 haraz sefiidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and south baluchestan 29 see fig 10 b the maximum loss has occurred in the mehran kal 27 at the rate of 47 7 6 cm yr followed by saghand 49 abarghoo sirjan 44 ghareghoom 60 and namak lake 41 based on the piezometric well observations more than 90 of the aquifers show negative trends within the study period while in 35 of them the groundwater level has dropped more than 40 cm yr fig 10 a depict the tws loss rate using the grace observation within 2003 2016 which is the same period of gwla data fig 10 b the annual rate of the mean groundwater level drop in this study is consistent with a recent estimation by noori et al 2021 fig 11 a represents the groundwater level anomaly gwla time series for entire iran together with the twsa from grace over the period from 2003 to the end of 2016 we observe that the gwla is highly correlated with twsa corr 0 97 the mean gwla in iran has dropped dramatically during the last two decades triggered by the drought in 2007 considering the period from 2003 to 2016 the mean groundwater shows a significant negative trend of about 28 1 4 cm yr while this rate was about 8 1 3 3 cm yr and 25 3 1 9 cm yr before and after 2008 respectively the high correlation and the same trend behavior between twsa and gwla highlight the notable contribution of groundwater depletion in iran s twsl observed by grace the green and red background in fig 11 a refer to the two distinct patterns observed in the scatter plot of the twsa versus groundwater level fig 11 b except for the humid regions about 15 of the country with considerable contribution from soil moisture anomaly rahmani et al 2016 and the variation in lake urmia in the northwest tourian et al 2015 ashraf et al 2019 the gwsa is the dominant compartment of the twsa in most of iran therefore the scatter points slope implicitly reveals the storativity or the storage coefficient since it maps the water table to the volume quantity for an unconfined aquifer which most aquifers in iran are the storage coefficient is approximately equal to the specific yield two distinct slopes the green line from 2003 to 2007 about 0 072 and the red one from 2008 to 2016 0 04 implicitly indicates that the acceleration in groundwater loss in last years brought the groundwater to a deeper level with a different soil structure fig 11 b another likely reason can be that groundwater extraction in many regions of iran has become more challenging and expensive as the groundwater drops also below a certain level there may not be even much water left for extraction at least for a period of time in each year 6 discussion this study quantifies the twsl in iran s 30 major river basins over the last 17 years 2003 2019 the findings based on grace observations show a significant water loss in all basins of iran leading to a twsl of 211 34 km3 fig 4 at a rate of 12 2 km3 yr our findings are consistent with those reported by previous studies focusing on different time periods e g voss et al 2013 forootan et al 2014 joodaki et al 2014 ashraf et al 2021 panahi et al 2020 the total water consumption in iran is estimated at about 96 km3 khoosefi 2018 hence our analysis shows that iran has lost more than twice of its annual water consumption over the last two decades most of the water has been lost during 2008 2016 triggered by one of the two most severe droughts of the last 50 years in the middle east due to the coarse spatial resolution of grace the results over smaller basins come with inherent uncertainty moreover the results in the caspian sea coastal region are prone to leakage error due to the strong negative trend in the signal of the caspian sea using the piezometric wells observations two recent studies namely ashraf et al 2021 and noori et al 2021 estimated iran s groundwater storage depletion within 2002 2015 to be around 75 km3 based on our analysis iran has lost about 241 km3 of its tws within 2003 2015 considering tws as the sum of groundwater surface water soil moisture and snow water we can derive an estimate of about 166 km3 for the water loss from the surface soil and snow in iran within 2003 2015 the shrinkage of the lake urmia about 11 km3 and the reported d r ying up lakes like lake hamun and lake bakhtegan narrowing of permanent rivers width and the disappearance of seasonal rivers are only a few shreds of evidence in agreement with this estimate in 17 basins despite a water gain from precipitation within the study period the tws has dropped these basins covering about 55 of the whole country are mostly located along with the mountainous areas excluding the heavy rainfall of early 2019 still 15 basins out of 17 show gain in precipitation the coastal basins talesh 12 haraz sefiidrood 14 haraz 15 gharesoo 16 and south baluchestan 29 show a positive overall rate in the time series of their groundwater level this observation suggests that a considerable amount of water from precipitation in these basins has infiltrated into deeper soil layers and has recharged aquifers the water loss seen by grace in these five basins can be explained by a possible significant amount of runoff into the caspian sea basins 12 14 15 16 or into the sea of oman basin 29 and evapotranspiration from vast agricultural fields on the other hand in 60 of the basins mentioned above the discrepancies between the water storage loss seen by grace and the gain from precipitation can be explained with the considerable negative rate of groundwater loss see fig 10 these basins were among the top 15 in groundwater loss indicating a remarkable contribution of anthropogenic effects mainly via expanding agricultural activities groundwater storage loss can be investigated via data assimilation techniques to some extent e g li et al 2019 moreover groundwater storage can be estimated from the mean groundwater level using the storage coefficients nevertheless due to the lack of accurate storage coefficients it is impossible to quantify the contribution of the groundwater to the twsl for each basin however the high correlation 0 97 between groundwater drop and twsa fig 11 indicates a substantial contribution of water withdrawal from agricultural wells in the observed negative trend tourian et al 2015 reached the same conclusion over the lake urmia basin using the correlation between gwla and twsa it should be noted that however for more convincing conclusion one would need to estimate gwsa and conduct a causality analysis we highlight that the piezometric wells observations are limited mainly to the groundwater level in aquifers these aquifers are located in the plains excluding groundwater flow in mountainous terrains in case the measurements in mountainous regions were available we would expect a higher rate of groundwater withdrawal due to the bedrocks steeper slope however since the main groundwater level fluctuations occur in irrigated plains the contribution of groundwater depletion in the mountainous regions in the estimation of total groundwater decline should be negligible considering the potential role of the surface groundwater interaction it should be noted that the accelerated increase in the water withdrawals over the recent years would result in the decrease of the groundwater contribution to the baseflow this decline has already been observed in the lake urmia basin by vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 and needs to be further investigated in other basins especially in mountainous regions in an arid to a semi arid region like iran groundwater is a precious resource functioning as the backbone of irrigated farming the alarming accelerated rate of groundwater withdrawal after the 2007 drought continued till the end of 2016 maghrebi et al 2020 assessed iran s agricultural activities within 1981 2013 using agricultural area production data from iran s ministry of agriculture jihad ministry of energy and ministry of roads and urban development our results from piezometric wells confirm the finding from maghrebi et al 2020 that the groundwater over exploitation for agriculture and consequently irrigated agricultural production increased despite declining water availability during 2003 2016 since the rate of recharge is slower than the pumping many aquifers would be in danger of being depleted and their water content never be recovered like aquifers in the agriculturally active regions of the world such as high plain scanlon et al 2012 and central valley aquifers famiglietti et al 2011 in the united states or the north china plain feng et al 2013 the observed decrease of groundwater extraction in many parts of iran fig s5 is attributable to the physical constraints and the inefficiency of pumping due to high groundwater depth or low water quality and not necessarily to groundwater conservation and monitoring efforts across the country madani 2014 tourian et al 2015 ashraf et al 2017 2021 noori et al 2021 lake urmia in northwestern iran is one of the largest lakes in the middle east this hypersaline lake has shrunk drastically over the last two decades to less than 30 of its original surface area and it lost more than 30 of its water volume from 1995 to 2015 based on the results presented in fig 8 and fig 9 the basin has lost water at a rate of 0 7 0 05 km3 yr one of the top 6 river basins in losing water storage in iran over the study period fig 5 a although the overall deficit from precipitation over the last two decades is mild the basin has suffered from a long period of persistent water loss from 2007 onwards fig 6 the expansion of agricultural land khazaei et al 2019 together with water loss from precipitation put pressure on this basin s water resources and encouraged increased groundwater use this study has quantified the tws loss within the last two decades over iran and its 30 major river basins together with the analysis of the precipitation and the groundwater level the alarming values reported in this study justify further investigations to be conducted to understand the underlying reasons the country wide analysis of the hydro climatic variables like temperature vegetation indices and evapotranspiration must be conducted along with the assessment of the long term impacts of water resources management strategies adopted by the decision makers such as dam construction and inter basin water transfers further studies can also benefit from the focused investigation of the interactions of the water resources in the border basins 7 conclusions this study quantified water loss in iran and its 30 major river basins over the last two decades using observations from satellite gravimetry grace and grace fo precipitation datasets gauged and global gridded and groundwater from piezometric wells we used a monte carlo simulation method to quantify the non linear trend and stochasticity of the tws data to interpret the twsl we determined gain or loss in water status from precipitation taking precipitation as the primary input to the water system we selected a set of precipitation datasets with the best performance for each basin using observations from a dense network of rain gauges we also computed the groundwater level depletion from 13 879 piezometric wells over the last two decades in summary the study results suggest that iran s twsl was about 211 34 km3 over the 2003 2019 period with an average rate of 12 2 km3 yr which is significant for a country with limited water resources availability the water loss rate varied between 0 07 to 1 8 km3 yr in the 30 major basins with the highest depletion in the central desert basin 47 and the lowest in the ghareghoom basin 60 the variation of tws was 7 4 cm occurring in three main phases i e from 2003 to 2007 8 5 cm from 2008 to 2015 7 4 cm and finally from 2016 to 2019 9 cm a significant deficit in water input in 2008 2010 2013 and 2014 led to the smaller annual variation of water storage throughout 2008 2015 given a normal situation without drought periods the annual variation of tws over entire iran seemed to vary within 8 5 9 cm overall the whole country has gained water from precipitation at the rate of 4 9 0 02 km3 yr with respect to a long term 1983 2002 reference about 46 of iran showed precipitation deficit with the overall rate of 5 4 0 03 km3 yr and 54 of the country gained water with the overall rate of 10 3 0 03 km3 yr the karun bain 23 experienced the largest gain 1 9 0 25 km3 yr while its neighboring karkheh basin 22 had the largest deficit of 1 0 11 km3 yr among the major basins our analysis highlights two significant extreme periods namely the 2007 drought and early 2019 flood the drought period changed the status of at least five basins from water gain to water loss it aggravated the deficit in 9 basins and resulted in a total deficit of 115 0 6 km3 on the other hand iran gained the same amount of water 115 0 8 km3 from the floods in early 2019 however these floods did not remedy water scarcity since a large portion of flood water did not recharge groundwater however it positively contributed to water resources in all major basins especially the mehran kal 27 south baluchestan 29 and central desert 47 basins 20 of the total area the mean groundwater level of iran showed a significant negative trend of about 28 1 4 cm yr highly correlated corr 0 97 with the grace twsa from 2003 to 2016 the high correlation and similar trend behavior between twsa and gwl indicates a notable contribution of groundwater depletion in the grace water storage decline groundwater level declined at a rate of 8 1 3 3 cm yr before 2007 and accelerated 25 3 1 9 cm yr after the 2007 drought the maximum water depletion occurred in the mehran kal 27 at the rate of 4 35 cm yr followed by the saghand 49 abarghoo sirjan 44 ghareghoom 60 and namak lake 41 basins about 35 of aquifers were mined at a rate of more than 40 cm yr we derived an estimate of about 166 km3 for iran s water loss from surface soil and snow water during 2003 2015 this is obtained by subtracting the estimate of groundwater storage loss from recent studies of ashraf et al 2021 and noori et al 2021 75 km3 from our estimate of water storage loss over the same period 241 km3 we observed two distinct patterns in the relationship between the twsa and groundwater level one with a slope of 0 07 over 2003 2007 and the other with a slope of 0 04 during 2008 2016 this finding suggests that accelerated groundwater loss in recent years brought the groundwater level to a deeper level with a different soil structure credit authorship contribution

groundwater flow systems and the presence of surface water bodies like small canals streams and tile drainage systems van roosmalen et al 2007 found that the groundwater and hydrological response to climate change varied substantially between two danish catchments assuming that differences in topsoil and aquifer types governed the impact signal while mustafa et al 2019 speculated that differences in the spatial pattern of recharge and groundwater level changes were results of surface water effects dams et al 2012 and erler et al 2019 found that the largest groundwater level response was located between streams upstream areas and at locations with deep groundwater tables respectively none of these studies did however quantify the spatial climate change sensitivity of the groundwater

cretaceous aquifers are present secondly because of large regional differences in precipitation across the country stisen et al 2012 thus denmark presents a needed large scale setting amanambu et al 2020 with diverse conditions in geology aquifer types and climatology the objective of this study is therefore to 1 quantify the spatial climate sensitivity of shallow and deep hydraulic heads in denmark 2 link the resulting climate sensitivity to the governing hydrogeological setting thus identifying the main contributors to the sensitivity in this study the danish national water resources model is forced by 21 climate model projections from the eurocordex project jacob et al 2014 taylor et al 2012a for 1971 2100 bias corrected using a distribution based scaling approach pasten zapata et al 2019 piani et al 2010 for two concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 first the future projections from climate model forcing precipitation and pot evapotranspiration section 4 2 and hydrological model impact response water balance section 4 3 and hydraulic heads section 4 4 and their statistical significance section 4 5 are assessed when the difference in climate projections and impacts are identified the spatial climate sensitivity is estimated and the spatial climate sensitivity is coupled with knowledge of the governing hydrogeology section 4 6 2 area of study denmark is located in northern europe and has humid and temperate climate conditions annual precipitation is 860 mm y 2000 2009 and is unevenly distributed across the country with western jutland receiving the largest amounts of rain 1100 mm y and zealand somewhat less 700 mm y annual temperature averages are 8 9 oc while potential evapotranspiration lies around 560 mm y topography is generally low relief with the highest elevations primarily found around the jutland ridge and moraine hills on funen and local hills on zealand the south islands and western jutland are very flat while northern jutland is characterized by a relatively flat topography of marine sediments land use is predominantly agricultural where the main crops are wheat barley maize and grass where more than 50 of the agricultural fields are estimated to be tile drained olesen 2009 soil types are dominantly sandy in the west and sandy clay soils clayey sand soils dominate in the east consequently irrigation is used extensively in the western part of the country jutland to investigate the impact of climate change across different types of geology denmark is divided into six regions west jutland east jutland north jutland funen zealand and the south islands from which results will be reported fig 1 divisions are based on near surface geology fig 1b and natural catchment boundaries the shallow geology in denmark is primarily influenced by the latest glacial advances through the weichselian where the main advance of glacial ice sheets reached midway through jutland forming the north south trending main stationary line this line separates the peninsula into two by the jutland ridge houmark nielsen and kjaer 2003 kj√¶r et al 2003 in western jutland the shallow geology is dominated by glacial outwash sediments and hills with relics from older glaciation events to the east eastern jutland the moraine deposits clayey till dominate the surface geology these types of clayey tills are also dominating the shallow geology on funen zealand and the southern islands in the topographical low areas of denmark post glacial deposits younger than 13 000 years are often seen in the form of freshwater sand clays and organic rich peat and gyttja or shallow marine deposits now elevated above sea level today these post glacial deposits are overlain surface waters like rivers lakes or fjords and act as groundwater discharge zones in high areas and often within a few tens of kilometres from the coastal zone aeolian sands have formed and migrated over the surface in post glacial time the general thickness of the quaternary layers across the danish area is most often between 0 and 100 m and includes important aquifers for groundwater abstraction a few of these glacial aquifers are of regional extent but most are sub regional an important part of the quaternary aquifers is the buried valleys that cut through the glacial deposits but in some areas also the pre quaternary stratigraphy the deeper up to 250 m bsl and pre quaternary geology fig 1c is dominated by large sedimentary basins where the youngest sediments are located to the southwest and the oldest sediments are found in the north and east as a result of fault movements danish pre quaternary aquifers consist of carbonate rocks of late cretaceous age skrivekridt m√∏ns klint fm paleocene chalk from danien bryozoan chalk stevns klint fm and copenhagen chalk fm and selandien chalk deposits of lellinge green sand fm and kerteminde marl the carbonate aquifers are the most important deep freshwater aquifers on zealand the north eastern part of jutland and locally at funen at the central and south western part of the jutlandian peninsula sand deposits of especially miocene age constitute the deeper freshwater aquifers in denmark the drinking water reserve is entirely groundwater dependent with 1 3 abstracted from carbonate chalk and limestone aquifers and 2 3 from quaternary and miocene aquifers 3 methods 3 1 the national water resources model this study is based on the national water resources model for denmark also referred to as the dk model the background and setup of the model will only be reported in a condensed form as the development of the national model has already been reported previously in the literature henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 the national model was originally setup in 2003 henriksen and sonnenborg 2003 and has since undergone several updates h√∏jberg et al 2015 h√∏jberg et al 2010 refsgaard et al 2011 the model covers the entire denmark and is subdivided into seven subdomain models three subdomains cover the jutland peninsula dk4 6 one covers the island or funen dk3 one covers zealand and one covers the southern islands the last subdomain is the small baltic sea island of bornholm dk7 not shown and not included in this analysis through the years extensive work has been done to create harmonized and national covering dataset for the main variables used in groundwater modelling a list of the dataset used in the national model can be seen in s table 1 the dk model is generated in the framework of the fully integrated physically based distributed mike she hydrological model the mike she code was originally designed by abbott et al 1986 and continuously updated by the danish hydrological institute dhi graham and butts 2005 fig 2 is modular and includes several numerical engines of various complexity for the different flow components in this case the water cycle is described by an evapotranspiration component a linear reservoir drain formulation 2d overland flow component and a 2 layer unsaturated zone formulation kristensen and jensen 1975 the river flow is defined by routing in mike hydro and the saturated zone is described by a 3d finite difference solution based on darcy s law dhi 2019 the update of the national model in 2019 included an update of observational data and several improvements in the setup and calibration stisen et al 2019 for the model setup three main changes were made first a larger mapping of the hydrogeology of jutland led by the environmental agency of denmark mst made it possible to improve and update the hydrogeological model for jutland mst 2021 secondly to ensure consistency between subdomain models several near surface parameters were regionalized e g root depths drain depth and time constant and leakage coefficients the location of the drainage system in denmark is largely unknown and therefore drainage is incorporated in the entire area representing both artificial drains and natural drains not represented due to scale in the new dk model the drainage parameterization time constant and depth furthermore differentiates between land use topography and soil type drains are however only active when groundwater levels are above drain level thirdly the previous version of the dk model relied on an older river formulation engine mike11 this was changed to the new mike hydro dhi 2021 and additional river branches were added in the calibration scheme three steps were revised first a new calibration procedure was implemented using simultaneous calibration of all subdomain models dk1 dk6 based on one joint parametrisation secondly the total amount of irrigation applied was included as a calibration target thirdly an outlier identification scheme for hydraulic head observations was added the calibration of the model is performed using the calibration tool pest doherty 2002 more than 300 discharge stations and 25 000 groundwater intakes are included during the calibration equal weight was sought between groundwater level observations and river flow measurements groundwater levels were evaluated by rmse root mean square error while river flow was evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 and both total and summer water balance error and irrigation amounts were evaluated by mean error me a kling gupta efficiency value of 1 indicates a perfect match of observations while any values above 0 41 are better than the mean flow knoben et al 2019 the calibration was done on the period of 2000 2010 and validated on the period 1995 1999 see stisen et al 2019 for more information on the national model as the model is used for climate change impact assessment the model is applied for conditions on which it is not calibrated causing deteriorating performance and introducing uncertainty pasten zapata et al 2022 under review refsgaard et al 2014 seibert 2003 to assess the robustness of the model on periods with substantially different climatic conditions than during calibration hydrological models are tested on periods with a similar footprint as the future climate that they are used to assess this is referred to as a differential split sample test kleme≈° 1986 however often observational data with such a climatic signature are unavailable therefore models are routinely tested on the most pronounced wet dry years in the observational dataset refsgaard et al 2014 in this case the three driest years 1996 1997 and 2003 are compared with the performance of the three wettest years 1994 1998 1999 for both groundwater and stream performance 3 2 climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios used in this study are generated by pasten zapata et al 2019 and the global and regional circulation gcm rcm models originate from the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 and the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012a a total of 21 climate change cc model scenarios are applied 16 of the cc models are run with the rcp8 5 concentration scenario and 5 with the rcp4 5 concentration scenario three of the models are the same combination of gcm and rcm but run with different initial conditions an overview of the models can be seen in s table 1 all cc models are generally reported as one ensemble of possible futures covering both concentration scenarios however split ensemble values are when appropriate given in the text and or available in the supplementary material pasten zapata et al 2019 bias corrected the gcm rcm climate model data to denmark by means of a distribution based scaling dbs approach piani et al 2010 for precipitation and temperature precipitation and temperature distributions in the reference period 1991 2010 for observational data and climate model data were fitted by a double gamma distribution the upper tail was set to 90th percentile and a normal distribution respectively the bias correction is then done by removing the bias between the gcm rcm data distribution and the observational data distribution assuming a constant bias in time chen et al 2015 the same bias correction is then perturbed onto the future data the distribution fitting and bias correction are done on each climate grid for denmark 10 km and 20 km grid for precipitation and temperature respectively and each climate model potential evapotranspiration is also needed for the hydrological modelling but is not a direct output from the climate models potential evapotranspiration can be estimated using temperature dependent approaches such as oudin oudin et al 2005 hamon hamon 1963 or thornwaite thornthwaite 1948 as recommended by e g jayathilake and smith 2020 kodja et al 2020 and oudin et al 2005 it can also be estimated using additional gcm rcm data e g radiation as inputs to potential evapotranspiration equations like penman monteith monteith 1965 penman 1948 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 or makkink makkink 1957 as demonstrated by e g seaby et al 2013 however the quality and subsequent bias correction of these inputs additional gcm rcm data can be problematic in this study the calculation of potential evapotranspiration was based on the temperature dependent oudin formula oudin et al 2005 to increase reliability the resulting potential evapotranspiration was bias corrected using estimated potential evapotranspiration calculated by the makkink formula for observed climate variables scharling 2001 again the bias correction is done on each climate grid for denmark 20 km grid and each climate model 3 3 study terminologies to aid the reader a few terms and definitions are given in this section the following terminology is used when referring to time periods for climate model and observation data 1 historical refers to data from observations during 1991 2010 2 present covers the period 1980 2010 and refers to data from cc models 3 future covers the period 2071 2100 and refers to data from cc models the historical period and the present period are different due to missing observational datasets from before 1991 the historical period is therefore shorter than the climate model periods changes in the climate signal are illustrated in the paper as either change in absolute values future present relative change future present present in or change factor future present furthermore the following approaches are used when assessing the climate change response in the hydrological model the q5 and q95 describe the upper and lower quantile of the data extremes in this study the q5 is the wet extreme and q95 is the dry extreme significance in changes in mean refers to a statistically significant two sample t test while a statistically significant variance is assessed with the barlett variance test both with an alpha 0 05 4 results 4 1 calibration results calibration of the danish national groundwater model has already been described elsewhere however a short overview of the performance is given here the distribution of mean errors for all groundwater intakes in denmark is shown in fig 3a for the calibration and validation period generally the performance on the groundwater levels is good the curves are centred around zero error for 50 of the boreholes meaning that errors are equally distributed and no systematic biases exist out of the 25 929 groundwater wells in the calibration period the majority 77 of stations have absolute mean errors below 5 m a few observations outer tails show large mean errors probably related to non representative measurements or local settings not included or represented at the model scale 500 500 m performance in the validation period is still acceptable but decreasing compared to the calibration period the distribution of the kling gupta kge performance of the discharge stations is seen in fig 3c for both calibration and validation periods 306 stations are used for calibration of the model during the calibration period the median kge is 0 69 during the validation period this value is 0 72 which corresponds to 75 of the stations having performance better than 0 54 and 0 58 respectively generally the performance of the model is best on the larger discharge stations and deteriorates for smaller catchments the median water balance error is 12 for both calibration and validation the distribution curves for the water balance results for the entire year and the summer period can be seen in s fig 1 the result of the differential split sample test dsst can be seen for the groundwater heads on fig 3b and for the kge in fig 3d for the groundwater levels the model performs just as good on the dry and wet years as on the entire calibration and validation period both have 76 of stations with absolute mean errors below 5 m for the stream flow performance the kge and water balance for the wet year is the same as for the calibration median of 0 69 for kge and 12 for water balance the performance deteriorates somewhat for the dry year with a kge median of 0 56 75 of the stations having performance better than 0 41 and a water balance median of 16 the groundwater modelling thus shows a solid performance during the dsst that corresponds to the performance reached during validitaion and calibration similarly for the kge and water balance during the wet years while the dry year shows an acceptable but poorer performance thus there is an increasing uncertainty on stream discharge projections during dry situations 4 2 projected climate model changes and spatial patterns the focus in this study is the climate change effect on hydrology and in this case study the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are the cc model inputs that mainly control the hydrological model response furthermore as mentioned in section 3 2 the potential evapotranspiration is calculated from the temperature and the distribution of these two variables are therefore similar the focus is therefore on the projected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and detailed information on temperature projections is therefore not reported here generally the temperature projection for denmark is a 4 degrees increase for the rcp8 5 and 2 1 degrees for the rcp4 5 with standard deviations of 0 8 and 0 5 respectively pasten zaquypata et al 2019 the change in precipitation as simulated by the climate models from the present to the future is shown in fig 4 the change in absolute value is shown as mm per year and the figure also includes mean changes absolute mean changes standard deviation across the 21 maps as well as the annual mean of the historical observational data set the annual precipitation in the historical period is 874 mm y and the ensemble mean change from present to future is 139 mm y 17 from the figure there is a clear overweight of cc models that project increasing precipitation where only one model projects a decrease in annual precipitation hence causing the mean change and mean absolute change to be very similar and the standard deviation is relatively low the size of the change is however different for the cc models ranging from 241 mm y for the wettest model to 11 mm y for the driest spatially the distribution of the change does not follow any pre defined pattern across the climate models there is no indication that the areas with historically high precipitation western jutland receive more precipitation than areas with historically low precipitation zealand and funen this is also evident from the change factors s fig 2 where the high precipitation area of southwest jutland has a low change factor compared to the rest of the country when looking at ensemble mean change of precipitation for the six areas s table 2 it is clear that even though future precipitation in jutland generally is higher especially west and north the change factor from present to future is not higher than the other areas when looking at the change in s table 2 the increase in jutland is in fact a little lower than observed on the islands the standard deviation does however show a larger spread in the projected precipitation changes for the areas in jutland the standard deviation from the spatial maps also shows that the climate model uncertainties are higher in some places e g north west jutland compared to others e g falster lolland figs 5 and 6 show the absolute change in precipitation mm per month for winter december february january and summer june july august respectively change factor maps are supplied in s fig 3 and s fig 4 the historical precipitation during the winter season is 89 mm month and the ensemble change is 23 mm month 31 as seen from the annual change maps the change in winter precipitation shows a clear overweight of increasing precipitation projections there is thus limited difference between model projections this is also seen in the relatively small standard deviation again as for the annual precipitation change there is no clear evidence of similar spatial structures in the change between ensemble members the historical summer precipitation is 70 mm month with an ensemble mean change of 4 mm month 6 from fig 6 there are now large differences between the models on a national scale 13 models project increasing summer precipitation while 8 projects a decrease in precipitation this gives rise to a relatively large standard deviation on the change again there is no apparent spatial structure for the change across the models from the change factors s fig 2 s fig 3 and s fig 4 it can be seen that the standard deviation normalized by the change factor increases when looking at the seasonal changes compared to the entire year the level of agreement between the models is thus higher on annual basis and is lower for the winter and even more so for the summer period the change in potential evapotranspiration as simulated by the climate models from the present to the future is shown in fig 7 the annual historical potential evapotranspiration is 565 mm y and the ensemble mean change is 121 mm y all climate models project increasing potential evapotranspiration ranging from 57 mm y to 189 mm y with a low standard deviation between models in contrast to the precipitation the spatial distribution across denmark is very uniform within each of the climate models the projected changes for summer and winter can be seen in s fig 5 and s fig 6 the summer and winter historical potential evapotranspiration are 1079 and 92 mm month respectively and thus large seasonal differences are already present this difference is naturally correlated to the high temperatures during summer compared to winter as for the annual values all cc models show an increase in potential evapotranspiration during summer and winter however the changes in the summer are very high 230 mm y compared to winter 33 mm y again the spatial distribution across denmark is fairly uniform within each cc model s fig 5 and s fig 6 4 3 projected water balance the changes in climate across denmark have large effects on the water balance in the different geographical regions this impact is assessed by running the national groundwater resources model forced with each of the 21 climate datasets of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration for both the present and future time slices the simulated changes in water balance components for the six geo regions of denmark are shown in fig 8 in s table 2 the ensemble mean of the change for each emission scenario is shown for the data set in fig 8 together with the standard deviation future absolute values of the water balance components can be seen in s fig 7 the actual evapotranspiration shows a future ensemble mean of 652 mm y corresponding to an increase of 16 from present conditions the projected changes are twice as high for rcp8 5 18 compared to the rcp4 5 scenarios 8 s table 2 the actual evapotranspiration is not only governed by the available water from precipitation but also predominantly potential evapotranspiration calculated from temperature from the climate models the increases mainly occur during summer fig 8 where temperatures are highest following the tendencies seen for potential evapotranspiration fig 7 s fig 5 and s fig 6 the changes are more or less similar across the six regions but slightly higher for funen and the south islands the projected future groundwater recharge is estimated to an average of 366 mm y corresponding to an increase of 18 again rcp8 5 has the highest projected change 21 compared to rcp4 5 8 the future recharge estimates resemble the precipitation input where north and west jutland have the highest ensemble recharge values 430 mm y and 530 mm y respectively followed by east jutland 360 mm y and the islands are lower 270 320 mm y winter recharge is clearly the governing factor as summer recharge values are very low s fig 7 fig 8 due to the high evapotranspiration during summer the relative changes in the recharge component are higher for the islands than for jutland the future ensemble drainflow is projected to 148 mm y s table 6 corresponding to an increase of 22 from the present day conditions the largest amount of drainflow is present in western jutland 244 mm y while the other areas are substantially lower 115 158 mm y the largest relative increase in drainflow occurs for the southern islands and zealand seasonally the drainflow component is predominantly occurring during winter and it is also during this season that a large increase in drainage is found average future baseflow groundwater discharge to rivers increases to 90 mm y 7 increase again the rcp8 5 has the highest changes 5 15 while rcp4 5 simulations are substantially lower 0 5 however large differences between the regions are observed for jutland the future baseflow component s fig 7 is in the range of 95 220 mm y while the islands have much lower amounts 7 43 mm y the future change fig 8 is highest for western jutland 10 mm y followed by eastern and northern jutland 7 8 mm y while the changes are very low for the other areas 0 5 2 mm y due to the slower response of the groundwater seasonal differences are less pronounced and the baseflow component and the baseflow changes are present in both summer and winter for overland flow the future ensemble mean increases 49 to 26 mm y with values between 18 and 35 mm y for the regions where the highest values are found for the southern islands and eastern jutland the largest changes in overland flow relatively occur on zealand rcp8 5 89 rcp4 5 37 and funen rcp8 5 62 rcp4 5 24 and smallest in western jutland rcp8 5 37 rcp4 5 13 the absolute volumes are however small and small changes are therefore exaggerated when looking at relative increases seasonally overland flow is more pronounced during winter and it is also during winter that the largest change occurs the stream discharge is the combined fluxes of drain flow baseflow and overland flow during winter drainflow is the dominant process while during summer baseflow has the largest influence the overland flow component of the stream discharge is very small the future projected discharge is estimated to be 265 mm y corresponding to an increase of 21 rcp8 5 25 rcp4 5 9 however large variations between regions are found ensemble drain flow of western jutland is very high 483 mm y followed by eastern and northern jutland 277 334 mm y where the islands show relatively small values 151 179 mm y however zealand and the southern islands show the largest relative change 30 33 while the others are somewhat lower 11 19 irrigation is only present in jutland and is only a small part of the overall water balance 1 5 the future amount of irrigation is projected to be 7 mm y corresponding to an increase of 41 rcp8 5 40 53 rcp4 5 22 34 this average however covers the fact that western jutland has a much higher ensemble irrigation amount 16 mm y than the other two jutland areas 1 9 2 4 mm y the irrigation increases substantially especially for east jutland but also for the other areas seasonally irrigation is only active during summer irrigation increases despite higher precipitation due to the dependency on increasing temperature and potential evapotranspiration during summer reflected by the high summer actual evapotranspiration as seen in fig 8c 4 3 1 uncertainty changes and propagation the uncertainty of the projected changes in the water balance components can also be evaluated based on the standard deviation of the 21 cc model results fig 8 for actual evapotranspiration the spread of the model projections is fairly constant same standard deviation across the six areas in general the standard deviation of the water balance components precipitation recharge drainflow discharge baseflow fall into two groups the islands funen zealand and the southern islands and the three regions in jutland the standard deviation of the islands is lower than those estimated for the regions in jutland in all cases except for precipitation western jutland has the highest standard deviation of all regions comparison of the standard deviation across regions with different means is however awkward therefore the coefficient of variation is calculated for all six regions fig 9 the coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is therefore also sometimes referred to as the relative standard deviation fig 9 shows the coefficient of variation for the six areas for the changes in the variable from present to future the figure highlights that there is an enhanced uncertainty on the change in the variables in jutland compared to the other areas as seen in fig 8 the uncertainties are also slightly elevated on funen compared to the two other islands the figure also shows how the uncertainty grows through the progradation in the hydrological model for all areas in denmark the coefficient of variation for the change is larger on the output of the model recharge discharge drains baseflow and overland flow than on the precipitation input the only exception is the actual evapotranspiration where there is a higher level of agreement between the models smaller uncertainty the temperature variation between the models are generally small meaning the temperature projection uncertainty is low pasten zapata et al 2019 the same was seen for the potential evapotranspiration fig 7 the act evapotranspiration is to a large degree driven by temperature pot evapotranspiration and therefore show relatively low coefficients 4 3 2 climate sensitivity the climate sensitivity is here defined as the response in the water balance component due to changes in precipitation and is evaluated for the different areas of denmark the climate sensitivity is calculated as the mm change pr mm change in precipitation from present to future for all climate models within each component and region instead of a regional mean a median ensemble sensitivity is then calculated due to outliers sensitivity values of 0 7 e g for evapotranspiration on the south islands means that for a 1 mm y change in precipitation the evapotranspiration increases by 0 7 mm y the climate sensitivity of the water balance components can be seen in table 1a it should be noted that a high sensitivity implies that the absolute change in the component is large it is therefore to be expected that climate sensitivity is less for second order processes components that are dependent on previous processes in the water cycle or mainly dependent on other climate variables such as temperature and pet compared to first order processes components that are directly affected by precipitation thus small flow components may have very large relative change but their overall sensitivity compared to the entire system is low however differences between the regions can still be assessed because some of the components are subcomponents of each other the summed sensitivity values in the row sum does not equal 1 therefore to compare differences in sensitivities across regions the percentage values of the climate sensitivity to the summed sensitivity are given in parentheses showing the contribution of that component to the summed sensitivity the high climate sensitivity in west jutland compared to the other regions table 2 originates from a large sensitivity in drainflow and baseflow while the sensitivity in evapotranspiration is low the high sensitivity in east jutland is also due to high discharge sensitivity drainflow and baseflow but evaporation sensitivity is higher while recharge is lower on funen a large part of the climate sensitivity is due to the highest climate sensitivity for evapotranspiration of the regions and while recharge sensitivity is still high most of the subsequent flow components have low sensitivity compared to the other regions for the south islands the evapotranspiration sensitivity is also elevated while discharge and drainflow play a large part of the sensitivity here the overland and baseflow response is close to non existent while evapotranspiration sensitivity is still high on zealand recharge sensitivity decreases here while a higher baseflow and overland flow contribution is seen the response in north jutland sensitivities is very similar to zealand with a little higher recharge and baseflow sensitivity generally for these flow components sum the most climate sensitive area is west jutland followed by east jutland for the south islands the overall sensitivity is substantially lowered compared to the other regions the islands generally have higher evapotranspiration climate sensitivity while the mainland has large baseflow sensitivity 4 4 projected groundwater levels the changes in precipitation and overall water balance as a result of climate change may also migrate through the groundwater system spatial differences in the responses are a combination of hydrogeology and climate changes over the areas the response in groundwater level from the 21 climate models is here investigated for both the phreatic groundwater table fig 10 and the main deeper groundwater aquifer in the region s fig 8 positive changes indicate wetter conditions meaning a groundwater table closer to the surface seasonal maps are not created here as the groundwater system may be delayed in response to the climatic inputs from the surface and winter summer plots are thus not logical instead the upper and lower percentile q95 and q5 of the groundwater level is analysed these low high groundwater levels are representative of situations typically occurring in summer winter the phreatic groundwater level in the historical period is on average 2 4 m below ground surface and from present to future a change in ensemble mean of 12 cm is estimated fig 10 this means that the phreatic groundwater table will be closer to the surface in the future the size of the change differs substantially between the climate models from 17 cm to 44 cm the spatial diversity for mean phreatic groundwater level change is relatively large reflected in a standard deviation of 16 cm across the country while the majority of models predict higher groundwater levels some also predict a reduction even for the wettest models top row in fig 10 there are areas where groundwater levels decrease in the future and the location of these areas are not always consistent across models e g cc model 12 and cc model 09 predict lower groundwater level in west and east jutland respectively it is however also evident from the mean change mean absolute change and standard deviation that there are certain areas in denmark that experience larger change and where uncertainties are higher than others e g in central jutland and northern zealand looking at the mean ensemble changes in the phreatic water level for the 21 models for the different areas in denmark fig 11 some general signals can be recognized for the phreatic water level the signal across the three variables mean q95 and q5 is diverse only for the south islands the changes in ensemble mean 3 5 cm are low across all three variables northern jutland has the largest change in mean 18 cm followed by east and west jutland 12 16 cm and zealand 9 cm mean funen has an ensemble mean change of zero indicating that while some climate models project increase for this area a comparable number of models project decreases q5 means are comparable across all the islands 5 7 cm and similarly across jutland where values are substantially higher 15 19 cm for q95 high values are found for north and east jutland and zealand 14 20 cm smaller mean values for west jutland 6 cm the ensemble q95 change phreatic for funen is the only one being negative for the deeper aquifers s fig 8 the historical hydraulic head is 17 m above sea level and the mean change to the future is 14 cm higher groundwater level again the different projections are diverse ranging from 12 cm to 56 cm overall the signal for the deep groundwater level changes across the regions can be seen in s fig 8 are somewhat similar to the response of the shallow aquifers fig 11 with similar high changes and low changes regions but with especially elevated values for zealand for all variables mean q95 and q5 high means 19 27 cm are found for zealand and north jutland east and west jutland have changes 9 15 cm except for q5 in west jutland which is quite low 4 cm while the remaining areas all have similar mean change 2 7 cm 4 4 1 uncertainties in the phreatic water level the standard deviation for the three variables is different for all areas except for the south islands that are low across all three variables for the means standard deviations are highest in jutland and zealand q95 standard deviations are distributed similarly to the means across the regions except for the q95 of funen and east jutland which is elevated compared to the mean in comparison standard deviation decreases for q5 for all regions relatively the highest values are still found for jutland in the deep aquifer the highest standard deviations are generally found for zealand and jutland while funen shows smaller standard deviations and the southern islands experience the smallest standard deviation as for the changes for the deep groundwater level standard deviations are similar for all variables mean q95 and q5 within each region s table 3 uncertainties expressed through ensemble variability are thus comparable across both mean and extreme situations q5 and q95 within the region 4 4 2 climate sensitivity the climate sensitivity of the phreatic and deep groundwater levels can also be calculated when comparing the diversity in projected spatial changes with the projected changes in precipitation it is clear that while precipitation plays an important role the geology and hydrology of the settings are sometimes crucial for the impact response e g the projected precipitation change for the southern islands was found to be the largest of all the regions both in absolute and relative change s table 2 but the groundwater response is small similar precipitation changes were registered on zealand but here the groundwater impact is a lot higher the climate sensitivity is thus again different for different areas of denmark the distribution of the sensitivity can here be examined by climate sensitivity maps these maps can be made for all climate models as shown in s fig 7 and s fig 10 the ensemble mean for all of these sensitivity maps is shown in fig 12 just like for the water balance components the climate sensitivity is calculated as the change in component this time in cm change in precipitation mm y e g the mean response in the phreatic of 0 13 which means that when future precipitation increases with 1 mm y the median change in the groundwater level as a response is 0 13 cm the map is an illustration of the response of the hydrological model to a change and there is no distinction between e g a wet or dry climate model the means for the regions can be seen in table 1b from the phreatic surface fig 12a it is clear that there are areas in denmark where the climate sensitivity is very high including central and eastern jutland northern jutland and some areas on zealand less sensitive areas are western and south jutland funen and the southern islands generally several features are recognisable on all sensitivity maps no matter of climate model s fig 7 indicating that the sensitivity is also governed by the hydrological model hydrogeological setting a very similar pattern is seen in the deeper aquifer fig 12b however here also areas in funen west south islands and south eastern jutland have higher climate sensitivity on average the climate sensitivity is a little higher for the deeper aquifers than for the phreatic mainly due to a large increase in sensitivity on zealand table 1 thus the deep aquifer response is larger than the surface near hydraulic head response in this region 4 5 statistical significance of future projections to investigate the significance of the climate change impact for all 21 cc models the 30 year mean for the present is compared to the 30 year mean for the future the results from the climate models are tested for significance for both changes in mean and changes in variance significant changes in mean indicate that there is a general shift in climate from present to future while a significant change in variance indicates an increase in climate model uncertainty i e the spread among the projections the changes in variance will be affected by the bias correction as cc model inputs are forced to be similar to observations during the present period but may still diverge during the future the results of this analysis are given for each region in s table 4 for all six regions significant changes in mean and variance are registered in both precipitation evapotranspiration drain flow discharge irrigation when applicable and recharge this means that for all these variables the change is significant despite climate model uncertainties increasing from present to future for the baseflow component all regions have significant changes in the mean while zealand as the only one does not have a significant change in the variance as well for the mean phreatic and deep groundwater level both zealand south islands west and north jutland have significant changes in both mean and variance however for funen the ensemble changes in mean are not significant for either the shallow and deep groundwater and also not significant for the deeper groundwater in west jutland thus in these two cases a substantial increase in precipitation 125 131 mm y cannot be predicted to a significant increase in groundwater level for both west and east jutland phreatic q95 and deep q5 also does not significantly change 4 6 governing hydrogeological conditions the reasons for the above mentioned differences in water balance climate sensitivities and groundwater change response are either due to differences in the input precipitation evapotranspiration temperature in the future projections or due to the hydrogeological settings of the areas several hydrogeological factors may will influence the propagation of this climatic signal and cause cc impact to differ between regions including land use soil type depth of the phreatic surface drainage system and geology the mean characteristics of the six regions are summed in table 2 looking at the differences in climate input fig 8 there are generally four groups 1 the south islands with largest precipitation change 140 mm y and relatively small uncertainty 3 north jutland with a large precipitation change 140 mm y and uncertainty 3 funen and zealand with a medium precipitation change 130 mm y 4 west and east jutland with a lower precipitation change 120 mm y 4 6 1 the upper subsurface for the upper subsurface the surface near features and processes are governing the climate change response an important factor that controls the water flow near the surface is the drainage system as mentioned drains are present in the model across the entire region except for surface water bodies but they are only active when groundwater levels exceed drain level in that case the water draining from the area is determined by a drainage time constant the depth to the phreatic surface in the reference period the proximity to drain level and the time constant for the models are shown in fig 13 and means for the regions are found in table 2 when comparing the climate insensitive areas of the phreatic groundwater level fig 12 with the proximity to drain level there is a clear reverse correlation between the two table 2 this means that the climate change impact of a change in precipitation is damped because of the draining of the saturated zone thus as the phreatic groundwater level is already close to or above drain level in the reference period an increase in precipitation will result in groundwater being removed by drainage resulting in less rise in groundwater levels than otherwise expected corresponding to less sensitivity to climate change for groundwater levels in contrast for the phreatic surface the most climate sensitive areas are found where the near surface groundwater level is deeper like in central mid east and northern jutland and northern zealand no clear correlation to the distribution of the drain time constant or the climate sensitive insensitive areas are immediately apparent indicating that the drain time constant may not be a main limiting factor the south islands has the lowest phreatic climate sensitivity of the regions table 2 thus the large precipitation change 144 mm y fig 8 does not result in large phreatic groundwater level increases s table 3 as the majority of groundwater table in this area is already close to drain levels 85 of the area table 2 the large change in climate input is routed through the drainage system and logically a very large increase in drainage was also registered in the water balance change for this area s table 2 and the climate sensitivity of drainflow discharge was found to be high compared to a neglectable sensitivity for overland baseflow table 1 this also leads to the lower climate impact uncertainty fig 9 for this area because the response in the hydrological model for this area will be similar across most climate models as the majority of climate models predict increases in water quantities thus more drain flow will always be generated at the expense of other climate change impacts due to the proximity to the drain level this causes the standard deviation across climate models to be smaller compared to the mean smaller coefficient of variation the closeness of the phreatic groundwater table to the surface also has another important impact namely the availability of water for evapotranspiration a shallower groundwater table means a potential for more evapotranspiration and thus less infiltrating water and therefore climate sensitivity and change in evapotranspiration fig 8 and table 1 was also high the high precipitation changes combined with the relatively small change in the system most water goes through few water balance compartments thus lead to a generally low climate sensitivity for the region table 1 funen and zealand are very similar in climatic input but differ in phreatic climate sensitivity and groundwater level response where funen has close to no change in groundwater level zealand projects an ensemble mean of 10 cm and twice as high climate sensitivity as in the case with the south island funen has an overall shallower phreatic surface and 7 more of the area are close to the drain than zealand but a higher increase or sensitivity in drain flow is not found on funen compared to zealand however funen has a large evapotranspiration change and the highest climate sensitivity of evapotranspiration of the regions strong response to precipitation changes funen already has larger evapotranspiration than zealand in the present and the difference between the two areas are increased in the future s table 2 this is due to the specific combination of a shallow groundwater table below drain level but very close to the root zone table 2 on funen compared to zealand which means the root zone water uptake due to higher future potential evapotranspiration in some areas and cc scenarios can increase to the point where mean groundwater level changes decrease or are dampened thus creating small positive and negative changes close to zero in mean phreatic groundwater levels s table 3 fig 11 leading to a small groundwater climate change signal and climate sensitivity for funen compared to zealand west and east jutland both experience similar precipitation changes but again the climate sensitivity and groundwater level response is not the same east jutland has a much higher groundwater climate sensitivity than west table 2 and a somewhat higher groundwater level change s table 3 fig 11 these two areas are quite similar both in drain depth and of area close to drain the depth to groundwater table is however 50 cm lower in the east than in the west as seen from the high standard deviation for the groundwater table of east jutland the depth to the phreatic surface is very deep for some areas east and shallow for others south leaving more room from groundwater level increases before drainage is activated thus resulting in a higher groundwater climate sensitivity for west jutland the most sensitive areas are close to the ridge at the mid jutland high fig 12 and on the glaciofluvial sand and gravel deposits fig 1 where groundwater tables are deeper fig 13 furthermore due to the soils and geology the areas are very different the sandy soil and subsurface of west jutland mean that the root zone is generally shallower than the phreatic surface causing the climate sensitivity of act evapotranspiration to be the lowest of the regions table 1 but also the irrigation in the future to rise s table 2 the connection between the subsurface and the surface water is strong leading to the highest general water balance climate sensitivity and highest for baseflow drains and discharge of the regions the connectivity may potentially also be the cause of effective routing of groundwater increases to the surface water as indicated by the high baseflow in the area s fig 7 north jutland has the second largest precipitation increase the phreatic groundwater level is the deepest of the regions and the region also experiences the largest increase in phreatic groundwater level and high climate sensitivity as for east jutland the groundwater level is very shallow in some places and quite deep in others leading to low climate sensitivity around the fjords and higher in the highland where groundwater tables are much deeper than drain level the proximity of the phreatic groundwater level to the drain level also explains the projected change in q5 fig 11 for the q5 wet extreme the groundwater level rises closer to or above drain level and thus the response is again limited by drainage thus causing a lower standard deviation s table 3 fig 11 for this variable for the areas where the q5 are above drain level zealand funen south islands table 2 in contrast the q95 dry extreme represents the lower position of the groundwater table which may be located below the drain level for several of the region s uncertainty increases in for this variable especially for funen east and north jutland s table 3 and fig 11 this may be related to larger summer precipitation uncertainties fig 6 as the q95 mainly occurs during dry periods of summertime 4 6 2 the deep subsurface sensitivity to change in climate for the deeper groundwater will be controlled both by input recharge and the large scale groundwater flow system geology thus for the deeper aquifer there are not the same limiting factors like drainage and evapotranspiration as seen for the phreatic surface larger climate change sensitivity for the deeper system was also observed than for the near surface system table 1 and all variables mean q5 and q95 were found to show the same type of response however as for the phreatic surface many areas are still sensitive insensitive to climate change this is a result of the linkage between the upper groundwater systems and lower aquifer recharge if additional drainage flow evapotranspiration is created in the near surface environment less recharge to the deeper groundwater system is generated causing a damped climate change impact signal to propagate through the system however as seen from table 1 the most sensitive regions are now both zealand followed by east and north jutland thus the sensitivity is shifted in the deep aquifer compared to the phreatic and for zealand the sensitivity increases it is also evident from fig 12 that there are areas in the regions where the climate sensitivity is now more widespread e g the eastern part of the south islands and east jutland and the northern part of zealand and north jutland the reason for this may be related to the aquifer type as all these areas have larger chalk aquifers from danien and the upper cretaceous fig 1c and these large chalk aquifers are especially widespread on zealand this may be an indication that these chalk aquifers may be more susceptible to climate change impacts 5 discussion 5 1 projected future climate model changes future temperatures across europe are projected to increase most pronounced in the mediterranean summer and the northeast winter kjellstr√∂m et al 2018 with low inter model spread matte et al 2019 for the potential evapotranspiration and indirectly temperature in this study a high agreement was also found between models the potential evapotranspiration was projected to increase for all models with an ensemble change of 121 mm y corresponding to 21 by 2100 ranging from 10 33 the spatial distribution of the change and uncertainty across denmark was found to be fairly uniform for the potential evapotranspiration these changes in potential evapotranspiration are similar to values reported by seaby et al 2013 van roosmalen et al 2007 for smaller catchment studies in denmark using older generations of climate models and scenarios sres ipcc 2000 projected precipitation by the climate models is generally reported by the ipcc ipcc 2013 to be more varying within regions and seasons than temperature christensen et al 2019 but a higher agreement between projected precipitation for the different ensemble models is found in south and north europe where the precipitation signal is decreasing and increasing respectively matte et al 2019 for central europe the signal is not as clear denmark is located at the dividing line between north and central and is therefore potentially prone to diverging climate model signals and thus higher uncertainty in climate impact projections generally the future projected precipitation changes over denmark annually and during winter shows wetter conditions only one model have decreasing annual precipitation values the ensemble annual mean change is projected to be 139 mm y corresponding to 17 by the end of the century this precipitation change is larger than the projected change over denmark for previous climate models and emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 seaby et al 2013 found changes of 6 19 in annual increase precipitation for 9 climate models 2 of decreasing trends 11 to 16 and one with a non changing trend for denmark while van roosmalen et al 2007 found changes of 9 16 for two larger danish catchments in jutland and zealand even though the cc models in this study are fairly in agreement concerning the direction for annual and winter precipitation changes large disagreements are encountered for the summer months where some cc models project increasing precipitation amounts and some decreasing leading to large uncertainties of the dry season estimates this is clearly illustrated by the coefficient of variation that increases by 41 46 for winter and annual precipitations whereas for the mean summer precipitation changes of up to 200 are found figs 5 and 6 this seasonal effect was also seen in a study by matte et al 2019 where climate model robustness from the eurocordex database jacob et al 2014 was evaluated across europe using a range of noise metrics and thresholds they found that the trustworthiness of the climate model precipitation signal was high over denmark during winter but decreased during summer to a level indicating that the change signal may be untrustworthy for this season due to inter member noise the trustworthiness of future winter precipitation between cc models is important for groundwater recharge as this is the season where the groundwater recharge primarily occurs even though the signal of mean precipitation changes for denmark is in good agreement across the models there are large differences in the spatial distribution of the changes and none of them seems to follow the historical tendencies for wet areas to become increasingly wetter compared to dry areas as seen in historical datasets karlsson et al 2014 piniewski et al 2017 investigated climate change signals across two large basins in poland for a range of eurocordex climate models they similarly found that the spatial variation of the precipitation change is large and that it varies substantially between the climate models this causes a significant reduction in robustness assessed by a robustness score for future precipitation projections in large parts of the catchments even in areas with the large ensemble mean changes in denmark the spatial uncertainty of the precipitation change is generally higher in jutland than in the other areas of denmark and the reasons for this difference is currently unknown differences in spatial climate change projections can be a consequence of multiple issues knutti and sedl√°ƒçek 2013 vidale et al 2003 among these different representations of physical processes limitations of cc models to describe local rainfall events e g cloud bursts and coarse resolution e g the inability of the rcm inputs to capture smaller scale variations for denmark the large uncertainty in jutland could be related to the fact that the climatology of the areas towards the west is predominantly governed by the larger westerly wind systems from the north sea and the atlantic ocean which may be simulated differently by the cc models it is however clear that more focus on the spatial issues is required in the future to secure robust climate change projections as input to impact assessments and to avoid constraining future water resources management and adaptation kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 5 2 projected future hydrology and groundwater changes the climate change impact on the hydrological system in denmark showed an ensemble mean change towards wetter conditions with actual evapotranspiration increasing between 14 and 17 recharge increasing between 13 and 27 and discharge increasing between 11 and 33 from the present to the future across the regions thus large spatial differences in the water balance change were observed illustrating that the diverse flow systems of the six regions responded differently to climate change this illustrates that transferring or inferring climate change impacts from one region to another is very problematic the temporal seasonally difference in the climate change impact showed that largest change in the water balance components occurred during the winter season except for evapotranspiration which was dominating during summer causing little recharge to occur thus the climate impact on the winter is the dominant source of groundwater recharge and the groundwater system the migration of the climate change in the hydrological impact models showed that except the baseflow component most hydrological water balance components increase in relative size more than the precipitation for all water balance components except actual evapotranspiration all showed increasing uncertainty compared to the rainfall input in many cases the relative uncertainty coefficient of variation increased by more than 50 as the hydrological model uncertainty is added to the climate forcing uncertainty refsgaard et al 2013 refsgaard et al 2016 but still even when taking climate model uncertainty into account all water balance components were found to increase significantly from present to future conditions for all six danish regions climatic changes are thus present and significant for the hydrological cycle for all parts of denmark the changes in the groundwater system were even more diverse across the regions than the water balance components the ensemble mean phreatic groundwater levels were found to increase between 0 and 18 cm while deeper groundwater levels increased by 2 24 cm the groundwater response was significant in all regions except for funen and the deeper groundwater in east jutland 5 3 hydrogeology and climate change sensitivity the investigation of the climate change sensitivity showed that the impact of climatic change on both groundwater levels and water balance components is larger in some regions than in others fig 12 it is e g surprising that large precipitation increases do not lead to higher groundwater levels in all regions e g the largest precipitation changes did not lead to large groundwater level changes south islands this underpins the necessity to propagate climatic data through an appropriate impact model as the resulting response in groundwater to precipitation changes are not straightforward and depend on multiple hydrogeological factors the sensitivity and the coupling to the hydrology geomorphologies and geology of the different regions in denmark showed that among the hydrogeological factors the most decisive for the upper subsurface were two overall factors 1 phreatic surface elevation relative to the drainage system level and 2 phreatic surface elevation relative to root depth the first factor was shown to substantially dampen the phreatic groundwater level response e g any groundwater level rise is removed by the drainage system if groundwater levels are already very close to drain level thus generating a large drainflow water balance component potentially dampening the climate response on sub drain components of the water balance south islands or groundwater level changes are restricted if groundwater levels are within a certain distance from the drain level west jutland the second factor was shown to play an important role in cases where the phreatic surface was close to root depth but still not very close to drain level in this case the water available for evapotranspiration by the vegetation increased and damped the climate change response through the entire groundwater and water balance system funen thus the climate sensitivity was highest in locations with deep phreatic surfaces the connection between the location of the phreatic surface and land surface elevation and the climate response corresponds with findings from other studies dams et al 2012 applied a wetspa modflow model forced with 28 climate models for a lowland belgian catchment they found that the largest projected groundwater level changes were located between streams and in upstream areas where the depth to the groundwater table are deeper and closely connected to land elevation similarly erler et al 2019 simulated future groundwater level changes in ontario canada using the integrated hydrogeosphere model finding that locations with groundwater tables deeper than 2 m experienced the largest climate change response they also found very little or no change in groundwater levels close to terrain or surface water bodies the latter was also registered by mustafa et al 2019 in a case study in bangladesh the response in the deeper subsurface was found to be very similar to the responses found for the phreatic surface likely due to the strong connection between upper aquifer changes and lower aquifer recharge under climate forcing indications were also found that the chalk aquifers on zealand north and east jutland have a higher climate change response than the other aquifer types in denmark these upper cretaceous and danien chalk layers are characterised by high hydraulic conductivity and highly pumped aquifers these chalk types are not present elsewhere in denmark 5 4 consequences of hydrological model setup the location of the current phreatic surface is co dependent on soil type drainage shallow geology underlying geology transmissivity and topography especially the connection to topography is evident from the maps figs 1a and 13a while the depth of the root zone is dependent on soil type and vegetation this of course means that all these co dependencies are part of determining the current conditions and thus indirectly represented by the root depth and phreatic level the potential climate change response this also means that the way the hydrological model is set up e g root zone and vegetation will have a potentially larger impact than expected on the climate change projection produced by the model the deeper subsurface response mimicked the phreatic surface responses thus correct simulations of present day phreatic conditions are important as the location of the phreatic surface can play a large role in determining the climate response of the entire system similarly the way the drainage system is implemented in the model also have a large effect in this case drainage is implemented across the entire areas both compensating for natural small streams and branches not accounted for due to resolution and representing the tile drainage system in the agricultural areas differentiated by adjusting drain depth and constant however the true location of these draining features is unknown and thus in reality even more heterogeneity in the upper subsurface is likely present than captured here in this study future land use changes and other anthropogenic changes e g farm management have not been considered however changing land use and root zone dynamics may have a potential effect on the climate sensitivity of groundwater levels in certain areas of the country the effects of land use changes must be superimposed on the climatic signal in the literature the influence of land use changes to projected water balance and groundwater levels are diverse likely depending on governing local hydrological processes and type of land use conversion e g the difference in crops or new leave out areas several studies have shown that the impact of land use changes on water balance terms and groundwater response is relatively small compared to the impact of climate changes e g bisselink et al 2018 labrousse et al 2020 neupane and kumar 2015 torabi haghighi et al 2020 zipper et al 2018 with larger influence for extreme events karlsson et al 2016 other studies report more substantial land use change responses e g ahiablame et al 2017 tong et al 2012 karlsson et al 2016 investigated the influence on groundwater level and stream discharge using four climate models and four future land use scenarios for a danish catchment on funen at the end of the century the study found that land use had negligible influence on mean groundwater level and stream discharge but would influence the high shallow groundwater level extremes and stream discharge high flows to a larger degree thus wet extreme projections shown in the present study may to some degree be mitigated by future unknown land use adaptation measures the present study only investigated the impacts and responses of water quantity while water quality issues have been omitted quality issues have been shown to be more affected by land use changes olesen et al 2019 seidenfaden et al 2022 in review trang et al 2017 in this model setup a 2 layer solution for the unsaturated zone is used and this means that the capillary fringe in the unsaturated zone is not represented as it e g would be if using a full richards equation for unsaturated zone flow for a national model it is still unrealistic to run the entire modelling area with a richards equation due to the high computational burden using a full richards equation would potentially increase the effect of soil type as capillary forces in sand versus clay would be differentiated potentially leading to more less drainflow creation in areas of sandy or clayey soils thus the impact of shallow geology may be underestimated in this study 5 5 limitations and uncertainties in this study only climate model uncertainty 21 climate models is considered when investigating the climate sensitive areas and the propagation of uncertainty through the hydrological model the additional uncertainty arising from downscaling bias correction e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 and natural variability is thus not accounted for neither is the emission scenario uncertainty e g fischer et al 2014 covered as only 2 emission scenarios are represented both these factors may introduce additional uncertainty in the projections used when forcing the hydrological model still several studies have shown that the climate model uncertainty dominates over the other uncertainty sources in impact assessments of most variables e g hawkins and sutton 2011 joseph et al 2018 refsgaard et al 2016 seaby et al 2013 in this study the climate change scenarios are defined based on projected time frames representing a diversity of different global change levels however it is also possible to investigate specific warming scenarios king and harrington 2018 as demonstrated by e g collados lara et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration approach used may also influence the hydrological impact modelling result to what degree results are affected by the choice of calculation method are divergent in literature some studies find large differences in potential evapotranspiration estimation using different calculation methods prudhomme and williamson 2013 seiller and anctil 2016 williamson et al 2016 especially during dry seasons dallaire et al 2021 however lemaitre basset et al 2021 found that the uncertainty from the potential evapotranspiration calculation method was minor when compared to the uncertainty originating from rcp gcm and rcm lemaitre basset et al 2021 forcing data uncertainty are however unlikely to affect the climate sensitive areas as these were shown to be mainly controlled by the hydrological model the climate sensitivity is here calculated using the change in the variable normalized by the change in precipitation this is of course a simplification as the response in the hydrological variables are also dependent on other factors like evapotranspiration and temporal distribution of the precipitation change this simplification will sometimes cause outliers e g where a small annual precipitation change is associated with a large change in groundwater level s fig 7 cc model 16 similarly the climate sensitivity of actual evapotranspiration is also controlled to a large extent by other factors potential evapotranspiration than precipitation another approach is to use the changes in precipitation subtracted by potential evapotranspiration however this may introduce an underestimation of the net precipitation as potential evapotranspiration is not always reached on an annual basis it should be noted that a high climate sensitivity in this study is the degree of response to changing climatic conditions and not a measure of vulnerability areas with low climate sensitivity may still be vulnerable to climate change due to other issues not covered in this study e g increased abstraction demands or saltwater intrusion along the coastline baena ruiz et al 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2018 other known uncertainties in the hydrological impact modelling like geological model e g sonnenborg et al 2015 hydrological model structure e g karlsson et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 calibration e g dams et al 2015 and parameter uncertainty e g brigode et al 2013 poulin et al 2011 are unfortunately beyond the scope of this study goderniaux et al 2015 reported the highest uncertainty for the groundwater levels originating from the calibration of the hydrological model compared to the climate model and natural variability uncertainties while her et al 2019 found that the uncertainty from the parameterization of the hydrological model may be dominant for slow flow components a thorough investigation of these uncertainty sources would be a very relevant next step especially erroneous representation of geology and the unsaturated zone dynamics could be expected to be important sources of uncertainty for the climate sensitivity of groundwater levels 5 6 implication for water managers and groundwater professionals when water managers and consultants are performing local climate impact assessments a handful of climate models are often only chosen for analysis due to limitations in time and cost models are routinely being chosen to represent the best spread in climate model uncertainty end members based on annual precipitation and temperature projection results from this study however shows that while annual precipitation values may be similar between two or more cc models seasonal projected changes may not likewise similar annual precipitation changes do not result in the same spatial pattern of the change thus the cc model s chosen for a specific area may be of huge importance to the climate change assessment results when investigating the resulting groundwater level projections it was also clear that the distribution of the change across denmark was not the same for the climate models even for models with similar annual precipitation projections this shows that choosing a subset of climate change models based on annual and or national estimated value may lead to erroneous estimations of local climate change impact assessments 6 conclusions this study investigates the climate sensitivity of the hydrological cycle through the water balance components and groundwater levels in the phreatic and deep aquifers of denmark using 21 climate change models the study area covers multiple aquifers in six regions across denmark with diverse geologies and hydrogeological characteristics and does thus give a unique possibility for comparing climate change responses for multiple different settings the main important conclusions were large regional differences in climate change forcing non consistent spatial distribution of change and impacts diverging responses in the hydrological system were observed large increases in precipitation and recharge does not necessarily lead to large increases in groundwater levels for denmark the region with the highest increase in future precipitation and recharge gave one of the smallest changes in both the shallow and deep aquifer spatial climate change sensitivity is therefore extremely important when evaluating climate impact on the hydrological cycle large differences in seasonal precipitation projections were found in cc models with similar annual changes the seasonal response of the water balance components to climate change was different in denmark the largest climate impact was occurring during winter for all flow components and recharge while the largest change was registered in summer for actual evapotranspiration and irrigation during summer evapotranspiration is high and infiltration low oppositely for winter winter is therefore the most important time for groundwater recharge and the groundwater system temporal differences in the climate response are thus extremely important the main contributors to the diverging response to climate forcing across the regions of multiple aquifers as stated above were found to be climate sensitivities are low when the cc response in the hydrological model is restricted by drains or dampened by increasing actual evapotranspiration climate sensitivities are high in areas where the phreatic zone is deep and possibly at locations of high conductive deep chalk aquifers credit authorship contribution statement seidenfaden i k conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft writing

costal groundwater systems chang et al 2016 iyalomhe et al 2015 luoma 2014 oude essink et al 2010 pulido velazquez et al 2018 few studies have however analyzed the spatial climate sensitivity of groundwater levels and the connection to hydrogeological settings dams et al 2015 erler et al 2019 mustafa et al 2019 van roosmalen et al 2007 e g surface near processes small and large scale groundwater flow systems and the presence of surface water bodies like small canals streams and tile drainage systems van roosmalen et al 2007 found that the groundwater and hydrological response to climate change varied substantially between two danish catchments assuming that differences in topsoil and aquifer types governed the impact signal while mustafa et al 2019 speculated that differences in the spatial pattern of recharge and groundwater level changes were results of surface water effects dams et al 2012 and erler et al 2019 found that the largest groundwater level response was located between streams upstream areas and at locations with deep groundwater tables respectively none of these studies did however quantify the spatial climate change sensitivity of the groundwater levels or investigated the underlying reasons for these patterns systematically this study will therefore be the first attempt to quantify climate sensitivity of groundwater levels covering multiple aquifer systems typically shallow and deep and types linking the sensitivities to the hydrogeological setting furthermore the study is conducted on a national scale denmark denmark presents an ideal setting for this investigation first because the geology in denmark covers a range of different settings geologically both quaternary sedimentary formations deep neogene aquifers and fissured cretaceous aquifers are present secondly because of large regional differences in precipitation across the country stisen et al 2012 thus denmark presents a needed large scale setting amanambu et al 2020 with diverse conditions in geology aquifer types and climatology the objective of this study is therefore to 1 quantify the spatial climate sensitivity of shallow and deep hydraulic heads in denmark 2 link the resulting climate sensitivity to the governing hydrogeological setting thus identifying the main contributors to the sensitivity in this study the danish national water resources model is forced by 21 climate model projections from the eurocordex project jacob et al 2014 taylor et al 2012a for 1971 2100 bias corrected using a distribution based scaling approach pasten zapata

located in northern europe and has humid and temperate climate conditions annual precipitation is 860 mm y 2000 2009 and is unevenly distributed across the country with western jutland receiving the largest amounts of rain 1100 mm y and zealand somewhat less 700 mm y annual temperature averages are 8 9 oc while potential evapotranspiration lies around 560 mm y topography is generally low relief with the highest elevations primarily found around the jutland ridge and moraine hills on funen and local hills on zealand the south islands and western jutland are very flat while northern jutland is characterized by a relatively flat topography of marine sediments land use is predominantly agricultural where the main crops are wheat barley maize and grass where more than 50 of the agricultural fields are estimated to be tile drained olesen 2009 soil types are dominantly sandy in the west and sandy clay soils clayey sand soils dominate in the east consequently irrigation is used extensively in the western part of the country jutland to investigate the impact of climate change across different types of geology denmark is divided into six regions west jutland east jutland north jutland funen zealand and the south islands from which results will be reported fig 1 divisions are based on near surface geology fig 1b and natural catchment boundaries the shallow geology in denmark is primarily influenced by the latest glacial advances through the weichselian where the main advance of glacial ice sheets reached midway through jutland forming the north south trending main stationary line this line separates the peninsula into two by the jutland ridge houmark nielsen and kjaer 2003 kj√¶r et al 2003 in western jutland the shallow geology is dominated by glacial outwash sediments and hills with relics from older glaciation events to the east eastern jutland the moraine deposits clayey till dominate the surface geology these types of clayey tills are also dominating the shallow geology on funen zealand and the southern islands in the topographical low areas of denmark post glacial deposits younger than 13 000 years are often seen in the form of freshwater sand clays and organic rich peat and gyttja or shallow marine deposits now elevated above sea level today these post glacial deposits are overlain surface waters like rivers lakes or fjords and act as groundwater discharge zones in high areas and often within a few tens of kilometres from the coastal zone aeolian sands have formed and migrated over the surface in post glacial time the general thickness of the quaternary layers across the danish area is most often between 0 and 100 m and includes important aquifers for groundwater abstraction a few of these glacial aquifers are of regional extent but most are sub regional an important part of the quaternary aquifers is the buried valleys that cut through the glacial deposits but in some areas also the pre quaternary stratigraphy the deeper up to 250 m bsl and pre quaternary geology fig 1c is dominated by large sedimentary basins where the youngest sediments are located to the southwest and the oldest sediments are found in the north and east as a result of fault movements danish pre quaternary aquifers consist of carbonate rocks of late cretaceous age skrivekridt m√∏ns klint fm paleocene chalk from danien bryozoan chalk stevns klint fm and copenhagen chalk fm and selandien chalk deposits of lellinge green sand fm and kerteminde marl the carbonate aquifers are the most important deep freshwater aquifers on zealand the north eastern part of jutland and locally at funen at the central and south western part of the jutlandian peninsula sand deposits of especially miocene age constitute the deeper freshwater aquifers in denmark the drinking water reserve is entirely groundwater dependent with 1 3 abstracted from carbonate chalk and limestone aquifers and 2 3 from quaternary and miocene aquifers 3 methods 3 1 the national water resources model this study is based on the national water resources model for denmark also referred to as the dk model the background and setup of the model will only be reported in a condensed form as the development of the national model has already been reported previously in the literature henriksen et al 2003 h√∏jberg et al 2013 the national model was originally setup in 2003 henriksen and sonnenborg 2003 and has since undergone several updates h√∏jberg et al 2015 h√∏jberg et al 2010 refsgaard et al 2011 the model covers the entire denmark and is subdivided into seven subdomain models three subdomains cover the jutland peninsula dk4 6 one covers the island or funen dk3 one covers zealand and one covers the southern islands the last subdomain is the small baltic sea island of bornholm dk7 not shown and not included in this analysis through the years extensive work has been done to create harmonized and national covering dataset for the main variables used in groundwater modelling a list of the dataset used in the national model can be seen in s table 1 the dk model is generated in the framework of the fully integrated physically based distributed mike she hydrological model the mike she code was originally designed by abbott et al 1986 and continuously updated by the danish hydrological institute dhi graham and butts 2005 fig 2 is modular and includes several numerical engines of various complexity for the different flow components in this case the water cycle is described by an evapotranspiration component a linear reservoir drain formulation 2d overland flow component and a 2 layer unsaturated zone formulation kristensen and jensen 1975 the river flow is defined by routing in mike hydro and the saturated zone is described by a 3d finite difference solution based on darcy s law dhi 2019 the update of the national model in 2019 included an update of observational data and several improvements in the setup and calibration stisen et al 2019 for the model setup three main changes were made first a larger mapping of the hydrogeology of jutland led by the environmental agency of denmark mst made it possible to improve and update the hydrogeological model for jutland mst 2021 secondly to ensure consistency between subdomain models several near surface parameters were regionalized e g root depths drain depth and time constant and leakage coefficients the location of the drainage system in denmark is largely unknown and therefore drainage is incorporated in the entire area representing both artificial drains and natural drains not represented due to scale in the new dk model the drainage parameterization time constant and depth furthermore differentiates between land use topography and soil type drains are however only active when groundwater levels are above drain level thirdly the previous version of the dk model relied on an older river formulation engine mike11 this was changed to the new mike hydro dhi 2021 and additional river branches were added in the calibration scheme three steps were revised first a new calibration procedure was implemented using simultaneous calibration of all subdomain models dk1 dk6 based on one joint parametrisation secondly the total amount of irrigation applied was included as a calibration target thirdly an outlier identification scheme for hydraulic head observations was added the calibration of the model is performed using the calibration tool pest doherty 2002 more than 300 discharge stations and 25 000 groundwater intakes are included during the calibration equal weight was sought between groundwater level observations and river flow measurements groundwater levels were evaluated by rmse root mean square error while river flow was evaluated using the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 and both total and summer water balance error and irrigation amounts were evaluated by mean error me a kling gupta efficiency value of 1 indicates a perfect match of observations while any values above 0 41 are better than the mean flow knoben et al 2019 the calibration was done on the period of 2000 2010 and validated on the period 1995 1999 see stisen et al 2019 for more information on the national model as the model is used for climate change impact assessment the model is applied for conditions on which it is not calibrated causing deteriorating performance and introducing uncertainty pasten zapata et al 2022 under review refsgaard et al 2014 seibert 2003 to assess the robustness of the model on periods with substantially different climatic conditions than during calibration hydrological models are tested on periods with a similar footprint as the future climate that they are used to assess this is referred to as a differential split sample test kleme≈° 1986 however often observational data with such a climatic signature are unavailable therefore models are routinely tested on the most pronounced wet dry years in the observational dataset refsgaard et al 2014 in this case the three driest years 1996 1997 and 2003 are compared with the performance of the three wettest years 1994 1998 1999 for both groundwater and stream performance 3 2 climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios used in this study are generated by pasten zapata et al 2019 and the global and regional circulation gcm rcm models originate from the euro cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 and the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012a a total of 21 climate change cc model scenarios are applied 16 of the cc models are run with the rcp8 5 concentration scenario and 5 with the rcp4 5 concentration scenario three of the models are the same combination of gcm and rcm but run with different initial conditions an overview of the models can be seen in s table 1 all cc models are generally reported as one ensemble of possible futures covering both concentration scenarios however split ensemble values are when appropriate given in the text and or available in the supplementary material pasten zapata et al 2019 bias corrected the gcm rcm climate model data to denmark by means of a distribution based scaling dbs approach piani et al 2010 for precipitation and temperature precipitation and temperature distributions in the reference period 1991 2010 for observational data and climate model data were fitted by a double gamma distribution the upper tail was set to 90th percentile and a normal distribution respectively the bias correction is then done by removing the bias between the gcm rcm data distribution and the observational data distribution assuming a constant bias in time chen et al 2015 the same bias correction is then perturbed onto the future data the distribution fitting and bias correction are done on each climate grid for denmark 10 km and 20 km grid for precipitation and temperature respectively and each climate model potential evapotranspiration is also needed for the hydrological modelling but is not a direct output from the climate models potential evapotranspiration can be estimated using temperature dependent approaches such as oudin oudin et al 2005 hamon hamon 1963 or thornwaite thornthwaite 1948 as recommended by e g jayathilake and smith 2020 kodja et al 2020 and oudin et al 2005 it can also be estimated using additional gcm rcm data e g radiation as inputs to potential evapotranspiration equations like penman monteith monteith 1965 penman 1948 priestley taylor priestley and taylor 1972 or makkink makkink 1957 as demonstrated by e g seaby et al 2013 however the quality and subsequent bias correction of these inputs additional gcm rcm data can be problematic in this study the calculation of potential evapotranspiration was based on the temperature dependent oudin formula oudin et al 2005 to increase reliability the resulting potential evapotranspiration was bias corrected using estimated potential evapotranspiration calculated by the makkink formula for observed climate variables scharling 2001 again the bias correction is done on each climate grid for denmark 20 km grid and each climate model 3 3 study terminologies to aid the reader a few terms and definitions are given in this section the following terminology is used when referring to time periods for climate model and observation data 1 historical refers to data from observations during 1991 2010 2 present covers the period 1980 2010 and refers to data from cc models 3 future covers the period 2071 2100 and refers to data from cc models the historical period and the present period are different due to missing observational datasets from before 1991 the historical period is therefore shorter than the climate model periods changes in the climate signal are illustrated in the paper as either change in absolute values future present relative change future present present in or change factor future present furthermore the following approaches are used when assessing the climate change response in the hydrological model the q5 and q95 describe the upper and lower quantile of the data extremes in this study the q5 is the wet extreme and q95 is the dry extreme significance in changes in mean refers to a statistically significant two sample t test while a statistically significant variance is assessed with the barlett variance test both with an alpha 0 05 4 results 4 1 calibration results calibration of the danish national groundwater model has already been described elsewhere however a short overview of the performance is given here the distribution of mean errors for all groundwater intakes in denmark is shown in fig 3a for the calibration and validation period generally the performance on the groundwater levels is good the curves are centred around zero error for 50 of the boreholes meaning that errors are equally distributed and no systematic biases exist out of the 25 929 groundwater wells in the calibration period the majority 77 of stations have absolute mean errors below 5 m a few observations outer tails show large mean errors probably related to non representative measurements or local settings not included or represented at the model scale 500 500 m performance in the validation period is still acceptable but decreasing compared to the calibration period the distribution of the kling gupta kge performance of the discharge stations is seen in fig 3c for both calibration and validation periods 306 stations are used for calibration of the model during the calibration period the median kge is 0 69 during the validation period this value is 0 72 which corresponds to 75 of the stations having performance better than 0 54 and 0 58 respectively generally the performance of the model is best on the larger discharge stations and deteriorates for smaller catchments the median water balance error is 12 for both calibration and validation the distribution curves for the water balance results for the entire year and the summer period can be seen in s fig 1 the result of the differential split sample test dsst can be seen for the groundwater heads on fig 3b and for the kge in fig 3d for the groundwater levels the model performs just as good on the dry and wet years as on the entire calibration and validation period both have 76 of stations with absolute mean errors below 5 m for the stream flow performance the kge and water balance for the wet year is the same as for the calibration median of 0 69 for kge and 12 for water balance the performance deteriorates somewhat for the dry year with a kge median of 0 56 75 of the stations having performance better than 0 41 and a water balance median of 16 the groundwater modelling thus shows a solid performance during the dsst that corresponds to the performance reached during validitaion and calibration similarly for the kge and water balance during the wet years while the dry year shows an acceptable but poorer performance thus there is an increasing uncertainty on stream discharge projections during dry situations 4 2 projected climate model changes and spatial patterns the focus in this study is the climate change effect on hydrology and in this case study the changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are the cc model inputs that mainly control the hydrological model response furthermore as mentioned in section 3 2 the potential evapotranspiration is calculated from the temperature and the distribution of these two variables are therefore similar the focus is therefore on the projected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and detailed information on temperature projections is therefore not reported here generally the temperature projection for denmark is a 4 degrees increase for the rcp8 5 and 2 1 degrees for the rcp4 5 with standard deviations of 0 8 and 0 5 respectively pasten zaquypata et al 2019 the change in precipitation as simulated by the climate models from the present to the future is shown in fig 4 the change in absolute value is shown as mm per year and the figure also includes mean changes absolute mean changes standard deviation across the 21 maps as well as the annual mean of the historical observational data set the annual precipitation in the historical period is 874 mm y and the ensemble mean change from present to future is 139 mm y 17 from the figure there is a clear overweight of cc models that project increasing precipitation where only one model projects a decrease in annual precipitation hence causing the mean change and mean absolute change to be very similar and the standard deviation is relatively low the size of the change is however different for the cc models ranging from 241 mm y for the wettest model to 11 mm y for the driest spatially the distribution of the change does not follow any pre defined pattern across the climate models there is no indication that the areas with historically high precipitation western jutland receive more precipitation than areas with historically low precipitation zealand and funen this is also evident from the change factors s fig 2 where the high precipitation area of southwest jutland has a low change factor compared to the rest of the country when looking at ensemble mean change of precipitation for the six areas s table 2 it is clear that even though future precipitation in jutland generally is higher especially west and north the change factor from present to future is not higher than the other areas when looking at the change in s table 2 the increase in jutland is in fact a little lower than observed on the islands the standard deviation does however show a larger spread in the projected precipitation changes for the areas in jutland the standard deviation from the spatial maps also shows that the climate model uncertainties are higher in some places e g north west jutland compared to others e g falster lolland figs 5 and 6 show the absolute change in precipitation mm per month for winter december february january and summer june july august respectively change factor maps are supplied in s fig 3 and s fig 4 the historical precipitation during the winter season is 89 mm month and the ensemble change is 23 mm month 31 as seen from the annual change maps the change in winter precipitation shows a clear overweight of increasing precipitation projections there is thus limited difference between model projections this is also seen in the relatively small standard deviation again as for the annual precipitation change there is no clear evidence of similar spatial structures in the change between ensemble members the historical summer precipitation is 70 mm month with an ensemble mean change of 4 mm month 6 from fig 6 there are now large differences between the models on a national scale 13 models project increasing summer precipitation while 8 projects a decrease in precipitation this gives rise to a relatively large standard deviation on the change again there is no apparent spatial structure for the change across the models from the change factors s fig 2 s fig 3 and s fig 4 it can be seen that the standard deviation normalized by the change factor increases when looking at the seasonal changes compared to the entire year the level of agreement between the models is thus higher on annual basis and is lower for the winter and even more so for the summer period the change in potential evapotranspiration as simulated by the climate models from the present to the future is shown in fig 7 the annual historical potential evapotranspiration is 565 mm y and the ensemble mean change is 121 mm y all climate models project increasing potential evapotranspiration ranging from 57 mm y to 189 mm y with a low standard deviation between models in contrast to the precipitation the spatial distribution across denmark is very uniform within each of the climate models the projected changes for summer and winter can be seen in s fig 5 and s fig 6 the summer and winter historical potential evapotranspiration are 1079 and 92 mm month respectively and thus large seasonal differences are already present this difference is naturally correlated to the high temperatures during summer compared to winter as for the annual values all cc models show an increase in potential evapotranspiration during summer and winter however the changes in the summer are very high 230 mm y compared to winter 33 mm y again the spatial distribution across denmark is fairly uniform within each cc model s fig 5 and s fig 6 4 3 projected water balance the changes in climate across denmark have large effects on the water balance in the different geographical regions this impact is assessed by running the national groundwater resources model forced with each of the 21 climate datasets of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration for both the present and future time slices the simulated changes in water balance components for the six geo regions of denmark are shown in fig 8 in s table 2 the ensemble mean of the change for each emission scenario is shown for the data set in fig 8 together with the standard deviation future absolute values of the water balance components can be seen in s fig 7 the actual evapotranspiration shows a future ensemble mean of 652 mm y corresponding to an increase of 16 from present conditions the projected changes are twice as high for rcp8 5 18 compared to the rcp4 5 scenarios 8 s table 2 the actual evapotranspiration is not only governed by the available water from precipitation but also predominantly potential evapotranspiration calculated from temperature from the climate models the increases mainly occur during summer fig 8 where temperatures are highest following the tendencies seen for potential evapotranspiration fig 7 s fig 5 and s fig 6 the changes are more or less similar across the six regions but slightly higher for funen and the south islands the projected future groundwater recharge is estimated to an average of 366 mm y corresponding to an increase of 18 again rcp8 5 has the highest projected change 21 compared to rcp4 5 8 the future recharge estimates resemble the precipitation input where north and west jutland have the highest ensemble recharge values 430 mm y and 530 mm y respectively followed by east jutland 360 mm y and the islands are lower 270 320 mm y winter recharge is clearly the governing factor as summer recharge values are very low s fig 7 fig 8 due to the high evapotranspiration during summer the relative changes in the recharge component are higher for the islands than for jutland the future ensemble drainflow is projected to 148 mm y s table 6 corresponding to an increase of 22 from the present day conditions the largest amount of drainflow is present in western jutland 244 mm y while the other areas are substantially lower 115 158 mm y the largest relative increase in drainflow occurs for the southern islands and zealand seasonally the drainflow component is predominantly occurring during winter and it is also during this season that a large increase in drainage is found average future baseflow groundwater discharge to rivers increases to 90 mm y 7 increase again the rcp8 5 has the highest changes 5 15 while rcp4 5 simulations are substantially lower 0 5 however large differences between the regions are observed for jutland the future baseflow component s fig 7 is in the range of 95 220 mm y while the islands have much lower amounts 7 43 mm y the future change fig 8 is highest for western jutland 10 mm y followed by eastern and northern jutland 7 8 mm y while the changes are very low for the other areas 0 5 2 mm y due to the slower response of the groundwater seasonal differences are less pronounced and the baseflow component and the baseflow changes are present in both summer and winter for overland flow the future ensemble mean increases 49 to 26 mm y with values between 18 and 35 mm y for the regions where the highest values are found for the southern islands and eastern jutland the largest changes in overland flow relatively occur on zealand rcp8 5 89 rcp4 5 37 and funen rcp8 5 62 rcp4 5 24 and smallest in western jutland rcp8 5 37 rcp4 5 13 the absolute volumes are however small and small changes are therefore exaggerated when looking at relative increases seasonally overland flow is more pronounced during winter and it is also during winter that the largest change occurs the stream discharge is the combined fluxes of drain flow baseflow and overland flow during winter drainflow is the dominant process while during summer baseflow has the largest influence the overland flow component of the stream discharge is very small the future projected discharge is estimated to be 265 mm y corresponding to an increase of 21 rcp8 5 25 rcp4 5 9 however large variations between regions are found ensemble drain flow of western jutland is very high 483 mm y followed by eastern and northern jutland 277 334 mm y where the islands show relatively small values 151 179 mm y however zealand and the southern islands show the largest relative change 30 33 while the others are somewhat lower 11 19 irrigation is only present in jutland and is only a small part of the overall water balance 1 5 the future amount of irrigation is projected to be 7 mm y corresponding to an increase of 41 rcp8 5 40 53 rcp4 5 22 34 this average however covers the fact that western jutland has a much higher ensemble irrigation amount 16 mm y than the other two jutland areas 1 9 2 4 mm y the irrigation increases substantially especially for east jutland but also for the other areas seasonally irrigation is only active during summer irrigation increases despite higher precipitation due to the dependency on increasing temperature and potential evapotranspiration during summer reflected by the high summer actual evapotranspiration as seen in fig 8c 4 3 1 uncertainty changes and propagation the uncertainty of the projected changes in the water balance components can also be evaluated based on the standard deviation of the 21 cc model results fig 8 for actual evapotranspiration the spread of the model projections is fairly constant same standard deviation across the six areas in general the standard deviation of the water balance components precipitation recharge drainflow discharge baseflow fall into two groups the islands funen zealand and the southern islands and the three regions in jutland the standard deviation of the islands is lower than those estimated for the regions in jutland in all cases except for precipitation western jutland has the highest standard deviation of all regions comparison of the standard deviation across regions with different means is however awkward therefore the coefficient of variation is calculated for all six regions fig 9 the coefficient of variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean and is therefore also sometimes referred to as the relative standard deviation fig 9 shows the coefficient of variation for the six areas for the changes in the variable from present to future the figure highlights that there is an enhanced uncertainty on the change in the variables in jutland compared to the other areas as seen in fig 8 the uncertainties are also slightly elevated on funen compared to the two other islands the figure also shows how the uncertainty grows through the progradation in the hydrological model for all areas in denmark the coefficient of variation for the change is larger on the output of the model recharge discharge drains baseflow and overland flow than on the precipitation input the only exception is the actual evapotranspiration where there is a higher level of agreement between the models smaller uncertainty the temperature variation between the models are generally small meaning the temperature projection uncertainty is low pasten zapata et al 2019 the same was seen for the potential evapotranspiration fig 7 the act evapotranspiration is to a large degree driven by temperature pot evapotranspiration and therefore show relatively low coefficients 4 3 2 climate sensitivity the climate sensitivity is here defined as the response in the water balance component due to changes in precipitation and is evaluated for the different areas of denmark the climate sensitivity is calculated as the mm change pr mm change in precipitation from present to future for all climate models within each component and region instead of a regional mean a median ensemble sensitivity is then calculated due to outliers sensitivity values of 0 7 e g for evapotranspiration on the south islands means that for a 1 mm y change in precipitation the evapotranspiration increases by 0 7 mm y the climate sensitivity of the water balance components can be seen in table 1a it should be noted that a high sensitivity implies that the absolute change in the component is large it is therefore to be expected that climate sensitivity is less for second order processes components that are dependent on previous processes in the water cycle or mainly dependent on other climate variables such as temperature and pet compared to first order processes components that are directly affected by precipitation thus small flow components may have very large relative change but their overall sensitivity compared to the entire system is low however differences between the regions can still be assessed because some of the components are subcomponents of each other the summed sensitivity values in the row sum does not equal 1 therefore to compare differences in sensitivities across regions the percentage values of the climate sensitivity to the summed sensitivity are given in parentheses showing the contribution of that component to the summed sensitivity the high climate sensitivity in west jutland compared to the other regions table 2 originates from a large sensitivity in drainflow and baseflow while the sensitivity in evapotranspiration is low the high sensitivity in east jutland is also due to high discharge sensitivity drainflow and baseflow but evaporation sensitivity is higher while recharge is lower on funen a large part of the climate sensitivity is due to the highest climate sensitivity for evapotranspiration of the regions and while recharge sensitivity is still high most of the subsequent flow components have low sensitivity compared to the other regions for the south islands the evapotranspiration sensitivity is also elevated while discharge and drainflow play a large part of the sensitivity here the overland and baseflow response is close to non existent while evapotranspiration sensitivity is still high on zealand recharge sensitivity decreases here while a higher baseflow and overland flow contribution is seen the response in north jutland sensitivities is very similar to zealand with a little higher recharge and baseflow sensitivity generally for these flow components sum the most climate sensitive area is west jutland followed by east jutland for the south islands the overall sensitivity is substantially lowered compared to the other regions the islands generally have higher evapotranspiration climate sensitivity while the mainland has large baseflow sensitivity 4 4 projected groundwater levels the changes in precipitation and overall water balance as a result of climate change may also migrate through the groundwater system spatial differences in the responses are a combination of hydrogeology and climate changes over the areas the response in groundwater level from the 21 climate models is here investigated for both the phreatic groundwater table fig 10 and the main deeper groundwater aquifer in the region s fig 8 positive changes indicate wetter conditions meaning a groundwater table closer to the surface seasonal maps are not created here as the groundwater system may be delayed in response to the climatic inputs from the surface and winter summer plots are thus not logical instead the upper and lower percentile q95 and q5 of the groundwater level is analysed these low high groundwater levels are representative of situations typically occurring in summer winter the phreatic groundwater level in the historical period is on average 2 4 m below ground surface and from present to future a change in ensemble mean of 12 cm is estimated fig 10 this means that the phreatic groundwater table will be closer to the surface in the future the size of the change differs substantially between the climate models from 17 cm to 44 cm the spatial diversity for mean phreatic groundwater level change is relatively large reflected in a standard deviation of 16 cm across the country while the majority of models predict higher groundwater levels some also predict a reduction even for the wettest models top row in fig 10 there are areas where groundwater levels decrease in the future and the location of these areas are not always consistent across models e g cc model 12 and cc model 09 predict lower groundwater level in west and east jutland respectively it is however also evident from the mean change mean absolute change and standard deviation that there are certain areas in denmark that experience larger change and where uncertainties are higher than others e g in central jutland and northern zealand looking at the mean ensemble changes in the phreatic water level for the 21 models for the different areas in denmark fig 11 some general signals can be recognized for the phreatic water level the signal across the three variables mean q95 and q5 is diverse only for the south islands the changes in ensemble mean 3 5 cm are low across all three variables northern jutland has the largest change in mean 18 cm followed by east and west jutland 12 16 cm and zealand 9 cm mean funen has an ensemble mean change of zero indicating that while some climate models project increase for this area a comparable number of models project decreases q5 means are comparable across all the islands 5 7 cm and similarly across jutland where values are substantially higher 15 19 cm for q95 high values are found for north and east jutland and zealand 14 20 cm smaller mean values for west jutland 6 cm the ensemble q95 change phreatic for funen is the only one being negative for the deeper aquifers s fig 8 the historical hydraulic head is 17 m above sea level and the mean change to the future is 14 cm higher groundwater level again the different projections are diverse ranging from 12 cm to 56 cm overall the signal for the deep groundwater level changes across the regions can be seen in s fig 8 are somewhat similar to the response of the shallow aquifers fig 11 with similar high changes and low changes regions but with especially elevated values for zealand for all variables mean q95 and q5 high means 19 27 cm are found for zealand and north jutland east and west jutland have changes 9 15 cm except for q5 in west jutland which is quite low 4 cm while the remaining areas all have similar mean change 2 7 cm 4 4 1 uncertainties in the phreatic water level the standard deviation for the three variables is different for all areas except for the south islands that are low across all three variables for the means standard deviations are highest in jutland and zealand q95 standard deviations are distributed similarly to the means across the regions except for the q95 of funen and east jutland which is elevated compared to the mean in comparison standard deviation decreases for q5 for all regions relatively the highest values are still found for jutland in the deep aquifer the highest standard deviations are generally found for zealand and jutland while funen shows smaller standard deviations and the southern islands experience the smallest standard deviation as for the changes for the deep groundwater level standard deviations are similar for all variables mean q95 and q5 within each region s table 3 uncertainties expressed through ensemble variability are thus comparable across both mean and extreme situations q5 and q95 within the region 4 4 2 climate sensitivity the climate sensitivity of the phreatic and deep groundwater levels can also be calculated when comparing the diversity in projected spatial changes with the projected changes in precipitation it is clear that while precipitation plays an important role the geology and hydrology of the settings are sometimes crucial for the impact response e g the projected precipitation change for the southern islands was found to be the largest of all the regions both in absolute and relative change s table 2 but the groundwater response is small similar precipitation changes were registered on zealand but here the groundwater impact is a lot higher the climate sensitivity is thus again different for different areas of denmark the distribution of the sensitivity can here be examined by climate sensitivity maps these maps can be made for all climate models as shown in s fig 7 and s fig 10 the ensemble mean for all of these sensitivity maps is shown in fig 12 just like for the water balance components the climate sensitivity is calculated as the change in component this time in cm change in precipitation mm y e g the mean response in the phreatic of 0 13 which means that when future precipitation increases with 1 mm y the median change in the groundwater level as a response is 0 13 cm the map is an illustration of the response of the hydrological model to a change and there is no distinction between e g a wet or dry climate model the means for the regions can be seen in table 1b from the phreatic surface fig 12a it is clear that there are areas in denmark where the climate sensitivity is very high including central and eastern jutland northern jutland and some areas on zealand less sensitive areas are western and south jutland funen and the southern islands generally several features are recognisable on all sensitivity maps no matter of climate model s fig 7 indicating that the sensitivity is also governed by the hydrological model hydrogeological setting a very similar pattern is seen in the deeper aquifer fig 12b however here also areas in funen west south islands and south eastern jutland have higher climate sensitivity on average the climate sensitivity is a little higher for the deeper aquifers than for the phreatic mainly due to a large increase in sensitivity on zealand table 1 thus the deep aquifer response is larger than the surface near hydraulic head response in this region 4 5 statistical significance of future projections to investigate the significance of the climate change impact for all 21 cc models the 30 year mean for the present is compared to the 30 year mean for the future the results from the climate models are tested for significance for both changes in mean and changes in variance significant changes in mean indicate that there is a general shift in climate from present to future while a significant change in variance indicates an increase in climate model uncertainty i e the spread among the projections the changes in variance will be affected by the bias correction as cc model inputs are forced to be similar to observations during the present period but may still diverge during the future the results of this analysis are given for each region in s table 4 for all six regions significant changes in mean and variance are registered in both precipitation evapotranspiration drain flow discharge irrigation when applicable and recharge this means that for all these variables the change is significant despite climate model uncertainties increasing from present to future for the baseflow component all regions have significant changes in the mean while zealand as the only one does not have a significant change in the variance as well for the mean phreatic and deep groundwater level both zealand south islands west and north jutland have significant changes in both mean and variance however for funen the ensemble changes in mean are not significant for either the shallow and deep groundwater and also not significant for the deeper groundwater in west jutland thus in these two cases a substantial increase in precipitation 125 131 mm y cannot be predicted to a significant increase in groundwater level for both west and east jutland phreatic q95 and deep q5 also does not significantly change 4 6 governing hydrogeological conditions the reasons for the above mentioned differences in water balance climate sensitivities and groundwater change response are either due to differences in the input precipitation evapotranspiration temperature in the future projections or due to the hydrogeological settings of the areas several hydrogeological factors may will influence the propagation of this climatic signal and cause cc impact to differ between regions including land use soil type depth of the phreatic surface drainage system and geology the mean characteristics of the six regions are summed in table 2 looking at the differences in climate input fig 8 there are generally four groups 1 the south islands with largest precipitation change 140 mm y and relatively small uncertainty 3 north jutland with a large precipitation change 140 mm y and uncertainty 3 funen and zealand with a medium precipitation change 130 mm y 4 west and east jutland with a lower precipitation change 120 mm y 4 6 1 the upper subsurface for the upper subsurface the surface near features and processes are governing the climate change response an important factor that controls the water flow near the surface is the drainage system as mentioned drains are present in the model across the entire region except for surface water bodies but they are only active when groundwater levels exceed drain level in that case the water draining from the area is determined by a drainage time constant the depth to the phreatic surface in the reference period the proximity to drain level and the time constant for the models are shown in fig 13 and means for the regions are found in table 2 when comparing the climate insensitive areas of the phreatic groundwater level fig 12 with the proximity to drain level there is a clear reverse correlation between the two table 2 this means that the climate change impact of a change in precipitation is damped because of the draining of the saturated zone thus as the phreatic groundwater level is already close to or above drain level in the reference period an increase in precipitation will result in groundwater being removed by drainage resulting in less rise in groundwater levels than otherwise expected corresponding to less sensitivity to climate change for groundwater levels in contrast for the phreatic surface the most climate sensitive areas are found where the near surface groundwater level is deeper like in central mid east and northern jutland and northern zealand no clear correlation to the distribution of the drain time constant or the climate sensitive insensitive areas are immediately apparent indicating that the drain time constant may not be a main limiting factor the south islands has the lowest phreatic climate sensitivity of the regions table 2 thus the large precipitation change 144 mm y fig 8 does not result in large phreatic groundwater level increases s table 3 as the majority of groundwater table in this area is already close to drain levels 85 of the area table 2 the large change in climate input is routed through the drainage system and logically a very large increase in drainage was also registered in the water balance change for this area s table 2 and the climate sensitivity of drainflow discharge was found to be high compared to a neglectable sensitivity for overland baseflow table 1 this also leads to the lower climate impact uncertainty fig 9 for this area because the response in the hydrological model for this area will be similar across most climate models as the majority of climate models predict increases in water quantities thus more drain flow will always be generated at the expense of other climate change impacts due to the proximity to the drain level this causes the standard deviation across climate models to be smaller compared to the mean smaller coefficient of variation the closeness of the phreatic groundwater table to the surface also has another important impact namely the availability of water for evapotranspiration a shallower groundwater table means a potential for more evapotranspiration and thus less infiltrating water and therefore climate sensitivity and change in evapotranspiration fig 8 and table 1 was also high the high precipitation changes combined with the relatively small change in the system most water goes through few water balance compartments thus lead to a generally low climate sensitivity for the region table 1 funen and zealand are very similar in climatic input but differ in phreatic climate sensitivity and groundwater level response where funen has close to no change in groundwater level zealand projects an ensemble mean of 10 cm and twice as high climate sensitivity as in the case with the south island funen has an overall shallower phreatic surface and 7 more of the area are close to the drain than zealand but a higher increase or sensitivity in drain flow is not found on funen compared to zealand however funen has a large evapotranspiration change and the highest climate sensitivity of evapotranspiration of the regions strong response to precipitation changes funen already has larger evapotranspiration than zealand in the present and the difference between the two areas are increased in the future s table 2 this is due to the specific combination of a shallow groundwater table below drain level but very close to the root zone table 2 on funen compared to zealand which means the root zone water uptake due to higher future potential evapotranspiration in some areas and cc scenarios can increase to the point where mean groundwater level changes decrease or are dampened thus creating small positive and negative changes close to zero in mean phreatic groundwater levels s table 3 fig 11 leading to a small groundwater climate change signal and climate sensitivity for funen compared to zealand west and east jutland both experience similar precipitation changes but again the climate sensitivity and groundwater level response is not the same east jutland has a much higher groundwater climate sensitivity than west table 2 and a somewhat higher groundwater level change s table 3 fig 11 these two areas are quite similar both in drain depth and of area close to drain the depth to groundwater table is however 50 cm lower in the east than in the west as seen from the high standard deviation for the groundwater table of east jutland the depth to the phreatic surface is very deep for some areas east and shallow for others south leaving more room from groundwater level increases before drainage is activated thus resulting in a higher groundwater climate sensitivity for west jutland the most sensitive areas are close to the ridge at the mid jutland high fig 12 and on the glaciofluvial sand and gravel deposits fig 1 where groundwater tables are deeper fig 13 furthermore due to the soils and geology the areas are very different the sandy soil and subsurface of west jutland mean that the root zone is generally shallower than the phreatic surface causing the climate sensitivity of act evapotranspiration to be the lowest of the regions table 1 but also the irrigation in the future to rise s table 2 the connection between the subsurface and the surface water is strong leading to the highest general water balance climate sensitivity and highest for baseflow drains and discharge of the regions the connectivity may potentially also be the cause of effective routing of groundwater increases to the surface water as indicated by the high baseflow in the area s fig 7 north jutland has the second largest precipitation increase the phreatic groundwater level is the deepest of the regions and the region also experiences the largest increase in phreatic groundwater level and high climate sensitivity as for east jutland the groundwater level is very shallow in some places and quite deep in others leading to low climate sensitivity around the fjords and higher in the highland where groundwater tables are much deeper than drain level the proximity of the phreatic groundwater level to the drain level also explains the projected change in q5 fig 11 for the q5 wet extreme the groundwater level rises closer to or above drain level and thus the response is again limited by drainage thus causing a lower standard deviation s table 3 fig 11 for this variable for the areas where the q5 are above drain level zealand funen south islands table 2 in contrast the q95 dry extreme represents the lower position of the groundwater table which may be located below the drain level for several of the region s uncertainty increases in for this variable especially for funen east and north jutland s table 3 and fig 11 this may be related to larger summer precipitation uncertainties fig 6 as the q95 mainly occurs during dry periods of summertime 4 6 2 the deep subsurface sensitivity to change in climate for the deeper groundwater will be controlled both by input recharge and the large scale groundwater flow system geology thus for the deeper aquifer there are not the same limiting factors like drainage and evapotranspiration as seen for the phreatic surface larger climate change sensitivity for the deeper system was also observed than for the near surface system table 1 and all variables mean q5 and q95 were found to show the same type of response however as for the phreatic surface many areas are still sensitive insensitive to climate change this is a result of the linkage between the upper groundwater systems and lower aquifer recharge if additional drainage flow evapotranspiration is created in the near surface environment less recharge to the deeper groundwater system is generated causing a damped climate change impact signal to propagate through the system however as seen from table 1 the most sensitive regions are now both zealand followed by east and north jutland thus the sensitivity is shifted in the deep aquifer compared to the phreatic and for zealand the sensitivity increases it is also evident from fig 12 that there are areas in the regions where the climate sensitivity is now more widespread e g the eastern part of the south islands and east jutland and the northern part of zealand and north jutland the reason for this may be related to the aquifer type as all these areas have larger chalk aquifers from danien and the upper cretaceous fig 1c and these large chalk aquifers are especially widespread on zealand this may be an indication that these chalk aquifers may be more susceptible to climate change impacts 5 discussion 5 1 projected future climate model changes future temperatures across europe are projected to increase most pronounced in the mediterranean summer and the northeast winter kjellstr√∂m et al 2018 with low inter model spread matte et al 2019 for the potential evapotranspiration and indirectly temperature in this study a high agreement was also found between models the potential evapotranspiration was projected to increase for all models with an ensemble change of 121 mm y corresponding to 21 by 2100 ranging from 10 33 the spatial distribution of the change and uncertainty across denmark was found to be fairly uniform for the potential evapotranspiration these changes in potential evapotranspiration are similar to values reported by seaby et al 2013 van roosmalen et al 2007 for smaller catchment studies in denmark using older generations of climate models and scenarios sres ipcc 2000 projected precipitation by the climate models is generally reported by the ipcc ipcc 2013 to be more varying within regions and seasons than temperature christensen et al 2019 but a higher agreement between projected precipitation for the different ensemble models is found in south and north europe where the precipitation signal is decreasing and increasing respectively matte et al 2019 for central europe the signal is not as clear denmark is located at the dividing line between north and central and is therefore potentially prone to diverging climate model signals and thus higher uncertainty in climate impact projections generally the future projected precipitation changes over denmark annually and during winter shows wetter conditions only one model have decreasing annual precipitation values the ensemble annual mean change is projected to be 139 mm y corresponding to 17 by the end of the century this precipitation change is larger than the projected change over denmark for previous climate models and emissions scenarios sres ipcc 2000 seaby et al 2013 found changes of 6 19 in annual increase precipitation for 9 climate models 2 of decreasing trends 11 to 16 and one with a non changing trend for denmark while van roosmalen et al 2007 found changes of 9 16 for two larger danish catchments in jutland and zealand even though the cc models in this study are fairly in agreement concerning the direction for annual and winter precipitation changes large disagreements are encountered for the summer months where some cc models project increasing precipitation amounts and some decreasing leading to large uncertainties of the dry season estimates this is clearly illustrated by the coefficient of variation that increases by 41 46 for winter and annual precipitations whereas for the mean summer precipitation changes of up to 200 are found figs 5 and 6 this seasonal effect was also seen in a study by matte et al 2019 where climate model robustness from the eurocordex database jacob et al 2014 was evaluated across europe using a range of noise metrics and thresholds they found that the trustworthiness of the climate model precipitation signal was high over denmark during winter but decreased during summer to a level indicating that the change signal may be untrustworthy for this season due to inter member noise the trustworthiness of future winter precipitation between cc models is important for groundwater recharge as this is the season where the groundwater recharge primarily occurs even though the signal of mean precipitation changes for denmark is in good agreement across the models there are large differences in the spatial distribution of the changes and none of them seems to follow the historical tendencies for wet areas to become increasingly wetter compared to dry areas as seen in historical datasets karlsson et al 2014 piniewski et al 2017 investigated climate change signals across two large basins in poland for a range of eurocordex climate models they similarly found that the spatial variation of the precipitation change is large and that it varies substantially between the climate models this causes a significant reduction in robustness assessed by a robustness score for future precipitation projections in large parts of the catchments even in areas with the large ensemble mean changes in denmark the spatial uncertainty of the precipitation change is generally higher in jutland than in the other areas of denmark and the reasons for this difference is currently unknown differences in spatial climate change projections can be a consequence of multiple issues knutti and sedl√°ƒçek 2013 vidale et al 2003 among these different representations of physical processes limitations of cc models to describe local rainfall events e g cloud bursts and coarse resolution e g the inability of the rcm inputs to capture smaller scale variations for denmark the large uncertainty in jutland could be related to the fact that the climatology of the areas towards the west is predominantly governed by the larger westerly wind systems from the north sea and the atlantic ocean which may be simulated differently by the cc models it is however clear that more focus on the spatial issues is required in the future to secure robust climate change projections as input to impact assessments and to avoid constraining future water resources management and adaptation kundzewicz and stakhiv 2010 5 2 projected future hydrology and groundwater changes the climate change impact on the hydrological system in denmark showed an ensemble mean change towards wetter conditions with actual evapotranspiration increasing between 14 and 17 recharge increasing between 13 and 27 and discharge increasing between 11 and 33 from the present to the future across the regions thus large spatial differences in the water balance change were observed illustrating that the diverse flow systems of the six regions responded differently to climate change this illustrates that transferring or inferring climate change impacts from one region to another is very problematic the temporal seasonally difference in the climate change impact showed that largest change in the water balance components occurred during the winter season except for evapotranspiration which was dominating during summer causing little recharge to occur thus the climate impact on the winter is the dominant source of groundwater recharge and the groundwater system the migration of the climate change in the hydrological impact models showed that except the baseflow component most hydrological water balance components increase in relative size more than the precipitation for all water balance components except actual evapotranspiration all showed increasing uncertainty compared to the rainfall input in many cases the relative uncertainty coefficient of variation increased by more than 50 as the hydrological model uncertainty is added to the climate forcing uncertainty refsgaard et al 2013 refsgaard et al 2016 but still even when taking climate model uncertainty into account all water balance components were found to increase significantly from present to future conditions for all six danish regions climatic changes are thus present and significant for the hydrological cycle for all parts of denmark the changes in the groundwater system were even more diverse across the regions than the water balance components the ensemble mean phreatic groundwater levels were found to increase between 0 and 18 cm while deeper groundwater levels increased by 2 24 cm the groundwater response was significant in all regions except for funen and the deeper groundwater in east jutland 5 3 hydrogeology and climate change sensitivity the investigation of the climate change sensitivity showed that the impact of climatic change on both groundwater levels and water balance components is larger in some regions than in others fig 12 it is e g surprising that large precipitation increases do not lead to higher groundwater levels in all regions e g the largest precipitation changes did not lead to large groundwater level changes south islands this underpins the necessity to propagate climatic data through an appropriate impact model as the resulting response in groundwater to precipitation changes are not straightforward and depend on multiple hydrogeological factors the sensitivity and the coupling to the hydrology geomorphologies and geology of the different regions in denmark showed that among the hydrogeological factors the most decisive for the upper subsurface were two overall factors 1 phreatic surface elevation relative to the drainage system level and 2 phreatic surface elevation relative to root depth the first factor was shown to substantially dampen the phreatic groundwater level response e g any groundwater level rise is removed by the drainage system if groundwater levels are already very close to drain level thus generating a large drainflow water balance component potentially dampening the climate response on sub drain components of the water balance south islands or groundwater level changes are restricted if groundwater levels are within a certain distance from the drain level west jutland the second factor was shown to play an important role in cases where the phreatic surface was close to root depth but still not very close to drain level in this case the water available for evapotranspiration by the vegetation increased and damped the climate change response through the entire groundwater and water balance system funen thus the climate sensitivity was highest in locations with deep phreatic surfaces the connection between the location of the phreatic surface and land surface elevation and the climate response corresponds with findings from other studies dams et al 2012 applied a wetspa modflow model forced with 28 climate models for a lowland belgian catchment they found that the largest projected groundwater level changes were located between streams and in upstream areas where the depth to the groundwater table are deeper and closely connected to land elevation similarly erler et al 2019 simulated future groundwater level changes in ontario canada using the integrated hydrogeosphere model finding that locations with groundwater tables deeper than 2 m experienced the largest climate change response they also found very little or no change in groundwater levels close to terrain or surface water bodies the latter was also registered by mustafa et al 2019 in a case study in bangladesh the response in the deeper subsurface was found to be very similar to the responses found for the phreatic surface likely due to the strong connection between upper aquifer changes and lower aquifer recharge under climate forcing indications were also found that the chalk aquifers on zealand north and east jutland have a higher climate change response than the other aquifer types in denmark these upper cretaceous and danien chalk layers are characterised by high hydraulic conductivity and highly pumped aquifers these chalk types are not present elsewhere in denmark 5 4 consequences of hydrological model setup the location of the current phreatic surface is co dependent on soil type drainage shallow geology underlying geology transmissivity and topography especially the connection to topography is evident from the maps figs 1a and 13a while the depth of the root zone is dependent on soil type and vegetation this of course means that all these co dependencies are part of determining the current conditions and thus indirectly represented by the root depth and phreatic level the potential climate change response this also means that the way the hydrological model is set up e g root zone and vegetation will have a potentially larger impact than expected on the climate change projection produced by the model the deeper subsurface response mimicked the phreatic surface responses thus correct simulations of present day phreatic conditions are important as the location of the phreatic surface can play a large role in determining the climate response of the entire system similarly the way the drainage system is implemented in the model also have a large effect in this case drainage is implemented across the entire areas both compensating for natural small streams and branches not accounted for due to resolution and representing the tile drainage system in the agricultural areas differentiated by adjusting drain depth and constant however the true location of these draining features is unknown and thus in reality even more heterogeneity in the upper subsurface is likely present than captured here in this study future land use changes and other anthropogenic changes e g farm management have not been considered however changing land use and root zone dynamics may have a potential effect on the climate sensitivity of groundwater levels in certain areas of the country the effects of land use changes must be superimposed on the climatic signal in the literature the influence of land use changes to projected water balance and groundwater levels are diverse likely depending on governing local hydrological processes and type of land use conversion e g the difference in crops or new leave out areas several studies have shown that the impact of land use changes on water balance terms and groundwater response is relatively small compared to the impact of climate changes e g bisselink et al 2018 labrousse et al 2020 neupane and kumar 2015 torabi haghighi et al 2020 zipper et al 2018 with larger influence for extreme events karlsson et al 2016 other studies report more substantial land use change responses e g ahiablame et al 2017 tong et al 2012 karlsson et al 2016 investigated the influence on groundwater level and stream discharge using four climate models and four future land use scenarios for a danish catchment on funen at the end of the century the study found that land use had negligible influence on mean groundwater level and stream discharge but would influence the high shallow groundwater level extremes and stream discharge high flows to a larger degree thus wet extreme projections shown in the present study may to some degree be mitigated by future unknown land use adaptation measures the present study only investigated the impacts and responses of water quantity while water quality issues have been omitted quality issues have been shown to be more affected by land use changes olesen et al 2019 seidenfaden et al 2022 in review trang et al 2017 in this model setup a 2 layer solution for the unsaturated zone is used and this means that the capillary fringe in the unsaturated zone is not represented as it e g would be if using a full richards equation for unsaturated zone flow for a national model it is still unrealistic to run the entire modelling area with a richards equation due to the high computational burden using a full richards equation would potentially increase the effect of soil type as capillary forces in sand versus clay would be differentiated potentially leading to more less drainflow creation in areas of sandy or clayey soils thus the impact of shallow geology may be underestimated in this study 5 5 limitations and uncertainties in this study only climate model uncertainty 21 climate models is considered when investigating the climate sensitive areas and the propagation of uncertainty through the hydrological model the additional uncertainty arising from downscaling bias correction e g teutschbein and seibert 2013 and natural variability is thus not accounted for neither is the emission scenario uncertainty e g fischer et al 2014 covered as only 2 emission scenarios are represented both these factors may introduce additional uncertainty in the projections used when forcing the hydrological model still several studies have shown that the climate model uncertainty dominates over the other uncertainty sources in impact assessments of most variables e g hawkins and sutton 2011 joseph et al 2018 refsgaard et al 2016 seaby et al 2013 in this study the climate change scenarios are defined based on projected time frames representing a diversity of different global change levels however it is also possible to investigate specific warming scenarios king and harrington 2018 as demonstrated by e g collados lara et al 2020 the potential evapotranspiration approach used may also influence the hydrological impact modelling result to what degree results are affected by the choice of calculation method are divergent in literature some studies find large differences in potential evapotranspiration estimation using different calculation methods prudhomme and williamson 2013 seiller and anctil 2016 williamson et al 2016 especially during dry seasons dallaire et al 2021 however lemaitre basset et al 2021 found that the uncertainty from the potential evapotranspiration calculation method was minor when compared to the uncertainty originating from rcp gcm and rcm lemaitre basset et al 2021 forcing data uncertainty are however unlikely to affect the climate sensitive areas as these were shown to be mainly controlled by the hydrological model the climate sensitivity is here calculated using the change in the variable normalized by the change in precipitation this is of course a simplification as the response in the hydrological variables are also dependent on other factors like evapotranspiration and temporal distribution of the precipitation change this simplification will sometimes cause outliers e g where a small annual precipitation change is associated with a large change in groundwater level s fig 7 cc model 16 similarly the climate sensitivity of actual evapotranspiration is also controlled to a large extent by other factors potential evapotranspiration than precipitation another approach is to use the changes in precipitation subtracted by potential evapotranspiration however this may introduce an underestimation of the net precipitation as potential evapotranspiration is not always reached on an annual basis it should be noted that a high climate sensitivity in this study is the degree of response to changing climatic conditions and not a measure of vulnerability areas with low climate sensitivity may still be vulnerable to climate change due to other issues not covered in this study e g increased abstraction demands or saltwater intrusion along the coastline baena ruiz et al 2018 pulido velazquez et al 2018 other known uncertainties in the hydrological impact modelling like geological model e g sonnenborg et al 2015 hydrological model structure e g karlsson et al 2016 moeck et al 2016 calibration e g dams et al 2015 and parameter uncertainty e g brigode et al 2013 poulin et al 2011 are unfortunately beyond the scope of this study goderniaux et al 2015 reported the highest uncertainty for the groundwater levels originating from the calibration of the hydrological model compared to the climate model and natural variability uncertainties while her et al 2019 found that the uncertainty from the parameterization of the hydrological model may be dominant for slow flow components a thorough investigation of these uncertainty sources would be a very relevant next step especially erroneous representation of geology and the unsaturated zone dynamics could be expected to be important sources of uncertainty for the climate sensitivity of groundwater levels 5 6 implication for water managers and groundwater professionals when water managers and consultants are performing local climate impact assessments a handful of climate models are often only chosen for analysis due to limitations in time and cost models are routinely being chosen to represent the best spread in climate model uncertainty end members based on annual precipitation and temperature projection results from this study however shows that while annual precipitation values may be similar between two or more cc models seasonal projected changes may not likewise similar annual precipitation changes do not result in the same spatial pattern of the change thus the cc model s chosen for a specific area may be of huge importance to the climate change assessment results when investigating the resulting groundwater level projections it was also clear that the distribution of the change across denmark was not the same for the climate models even for models with similar annual precipitation projections this shows that choosing a subset of climate change models based on annual and or national estimated value may lead to erroneous estimations of local climate change impact assessments 6 conclusions this study investigates the climate sensitivity of the hydrological cycle through the water balance components and groundwater levels in the phreatic and deep aquifers of denmark using 21 climate change models the study area covers multiple aquifers in six regions across denmark with diverse geologies and hydrogeological characteristics and does thus give a unique possibility for comparing climate change responses for multiple different settings the main important conclusions were large regional differences in climate change forcing non consistent spatial distribution of change and impacts diverging responses in the hydrological system were observed large increases in precipitation and recharge does not necessarily lead to large increases in groundwater levels for denmark the region with the highest increase in future precipitation and recharge gave one of the smallest changes in both the shallow and deep aquifer spatial climate change sensitivity is therefore extremely important when evaluating climate impact on the hydrological cycle large differences in seasonal precipitation projections were found in cc models with similar annual changes the seasonal response of the water balance components to climate change was different in denmark the largest climate impact was occurring during winter for all flow components and recharge while the largest change was registered in summer for actual evapotranspiration and irrigation during summer evapotranspiration is high and infiltration low oppositely for winter winter is therefore the most important time for groundwater recharge and the groundwater system temporal differences in the climate response are thus extremely important the main contributors to the diverging response to climate forcing across the regions of multiple aquifers as stated above were found to be climate sensitivities are low when the cc response in the hydrological model is restricted by drains or dampened by increasing actual evapotranspiration climate sensitivities are high in areas where the phreatic zone is deep and possibly at locations of high conductive deep chalk aquifers credit authorship contribution statement seidenfaden i k conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft writing

7987,region ventura river watershed california usa focus after wildfire small mountainous watersheds can produce dramatic increases in fluvial sediment transport but these changes are often evaluated under the assumption of stationary pre fire sediment dynamics the objectives of this study were to investigate temporal dependence in the fine silt and clay suspended sediment dynamics of the ventura river before and after 48 5 of the 194 km2 undammed portion of the watershed burned in the 2017 thomas fire new hydrological insights fine sediment concentrations in the ventura river decreased between 1971 and 2008 in 2018 and 2019 fine suspended sediment concentrations were 14 2 and 5 1 times higher than predicted based on the entire monitoring record but 32 4 and 9 5 times higher than the most recent period of persistently low concentrations the thomas fire resulted in a 200x increase in fine sediment flux in 2018 relative to pre fire conditions however fine suspended sediment flux during both post fire years 2018 0 073 0 050 0 105 mt and 2019 0 393 0 284 0 447 mt was comparable to the long term average 0 177 0 140 0 230 mt because of relatively little post fire precipitation these findings highlight the importance of considering preexisting time dependent behavior when characterizing the fire impacts on suspended sediment dynamics and the critical role that storm event magnitudes play in determining the sediment yield of small mountainous watersheds after wildfire keywords wildfire fire suspended sediment dynamics time dependence small mountainous rivers 1 introduction suspended sediment transport from small mountainous rivers to the ocean is one of the dominant geomorphic mechanisms driving the evolution of terrestrial channel networks and coastal habitats milliman and syvitski 1992 beaches floodplains and low lying coastal zones such as salt marshes and estuaries are maintained by inputs of fluvial suspended sediment brownlie and taylor 1981 sediments replenish nutrients and organic compounds for terrestrial and aquatic life hunsinger et al 2008 but the overabundance of suspended sediment can also lead to the impairment of freshwater ecosystems usepa 2020 understanding the processes that control the rate of suspended sediment transport requires an understanding of interaction between external e g climate and internal e g watershed characteristics drivers of sediment and water supply to and through the channelized system the rate of watershed sediment transport is dependent on atmospheric constraints such as rainfall duration

burbank 2004 the importance of the interplay between fire disturbance characteristics and the timing and magnitude of subsequent precipitation events have been increasingly recognized as driving the

dry post fire water years may produce only small increases in watershed suspended sediment flux despite high proportional burn areas and dramatic increases in the dynamical relationship between suspended sediment concentration c ss and water discharge q warrick et al 2012 greenbaum et al 2021 although wildfire and subsequent storms are often characterized as impacting a static pre fire

can dramatically increase sediment transfer rates in the first months to years after fire reneau et al 2007 warrick and rubin 2007 aguilera and melack 2018 increases in the supply of runoff and sediment to stream channels after wildfire will result in changes to both water and sediment discharge q and q ss as well as the rating relationship between c ss and q at the watershed outlet if changes in supply and or routing of sediment and water are not identical asselman 2000 syvitski et al 2000 warrick 2014 after fire small mountainous watersheds typically experience much larger increases in sediment relative to water supply e g warrick and rubin 2007 warrick et al 2012 the resultant increase in c ss is often recognized by a post fire increase in the rating coefficient a and

that wildfire influence on c ss q rating curves is most recognizable during the first few years following a burn when c ss is expected to be highest despite increases in q this interannual period of disturbance produces the greatest increases in q ss when burned watersheds experience above average rainfall warrick et al 2012 aguilera and melack 2018 beyond the changes wrought by wildfire fluvial suspended sediment dynamics often display a range of time dependent sediment behaviors including persistent cycles of high and low periods of sediment loading at interannual to interdecadal scales e g hestir et al 2013 gray et al 2014 ahn and steinschneider 2018 fisher et al 2021 these patterns can also be affected by other large scale punctuated disturbances such as floods or exceptionally wet

including a broader analysis of time dependent suspended sediment dynamics which can place wildfire impacts in the context of previous and ongoing suspended sediment behavior change in a watershed the main objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of interdecadal temporal dependence and the 2017 thomas fire on the suspended sediment discharge relationship of the lower ventura river ca usa in order to refine suspended sediment flux estimations our research plan was to characterize persistent patterns of fine suspended sediment dynamics both before and after the thomas fire and investigate their impacts on watershed suspended sediment flux 2 study region the ventura river drains 587 km2 of the eastern end of the santa ynez mountains in the transverse ranges to the southern california coast usa fig 1 table 1 the watershed geology is mostly cretaceous and tertiary coarse and fine siliciclastic sedimentary rock with quaternary landslide units in the uplands and quaternary alluvial deposits primarily in the lowlands putnam 1942 kellogg et al 2008 gutierrez et al 2008 this study focuses on 486 km2 of the ventura river watershed that flows from the headwaters in the santa ynez mountains with a maximum elevation of 1833 m to usgs gaging station 11118500 the ventura river watershed receives an annual average of 709 mm of precipitation with 2 year 5 year and 10 year return intervals of 600 mm 1000 mm and 1400 mm respectively prism 2019 much of this rainfall occurs during the cool wet season october april typical of the mediterranean climate of southern california with the majority falling in the headwaters rantz 1969 cooke and reeves 1976 the ventura river average annual discharge q mean is 1 77 m3 s 1 and peak discharge q peak for 2 year 5 year and 10 year

reduction of dam height due to safety concerns resulted in the reduction of matilija reservoir capacity to 6 105 m3 by 2014 aecom and stillwater sciences 2016 and 1 85 105 m3 by 2020 ventura county 2020 matilija reservoir s trapping efficiency for total sediment bedload to fine suspended load was estimated at 45 in 2005 usbr 2006 and was far less efficient after the thomas fire particularly for fine suspended sediment the focus of this study lake casitas also receives its water from the robles diversion dam est 1959 contributing area 192 0 km2 including that of matilija reservoir and north fork matilija creek which diverts up to 14 2 m3 s 1 of upper ventura river streamflow to lake casitas during the wet season water diversions continued after the thomas fire but were curtailed at times due excavation required to remove rapidly aggraded sediments carlson 2019 lake casitas effectively traps all sediment that it receives from its direct drainage area and the robles diversion of the upper ventura river because it only discharges back to the ventura river during rare extremely wet periods usbr 2006 the combined effect of these impoundment structures during the ucr monitoring periods was the capture of all of the fine sediment supplied from the coyote creek watershed and most of the water and fine sediments supplied from the drainage area of the robles diversion dam when the supply of water from matilija reservoir and the north fork matilija creek was 14 2 m3 s 1 the undammed portion of the ventura river watershed is predominantly vegetated by mixed chaparral

concentrations and flux was organized around the development of fine suspended sediment concentration discharge relationships precipitation discharge relationships were also developed at an annual level of aggregation to investigate changes in water supply to the channelized system fine suspended sediment loads were estimated for the ventura river gage 11118500 through each of the following approaches i a single rating curve based on the entire c ss q monitoring record ii individual rating curves for periods of persistent fine suspended sediment dynamics and iii rating curves for each of the first two post wildfire years following the december 2017 thomas fire the flux estimates were then compared to assess the impact of wildfire on fine sediment dynamics and flux 3 1 precipitation data retrieval spatiotemporally distributed precipitation p data for the study region was downloaded from prism 2019 as monthly 4 km rasters clipped to the ventura river watershed above the foster park gaging station with arcgis pro v 2 4 2 esri 2020 and used to calculate annual p mm in the ventura river watershed for water years wy 1930 2019 fig 2 a water year is defined as the period between october 1st of the previous year and september 30th of the water year 3 2 usgs discharge and suspended sediment data hydrological measurements from the ventura river at the usgs gaging station 11118500 were obtained from the usgs nwis 2019 we used usgs suspended sediment monitoring data to characterize pre fire fine suspended sediment dynamics the usgs collected n 100 flow integrated depth and width integrated suspended sediment samples from stormflows between wy 1971 and 2008 with attendant particle size distribution data fig 3 the usgs sampling program involves lowering and retrieving cable deployed isokinetic samplers through the depth of flow at multiple points across the channel at a station edwards and glysson 1999 for this study we used c ss samples if they had all of the following data c ss usgs code 80154 particle size distribution usgs codes 70311 70346 and instantaneous discharge q i 15 min time interval usgs code 00061 fig 3 table 2 mean daily discharge q d usgs code 00060 and peak discharge q peak was also retrieved from the usgs for wy 1930 2019 for calculating sediment fluxes and evaluating the lower ventura river s flood regime 3 3 ucr suspended sediment sampling the usgs suspended sediment monitoring program on the ventura river ended in 2015 to characterize post fire fine suspended sediment dynamics the authors collected n 71 suspended sediment samples herein referred to as ucr samples during stormflow conditions in wy 2018 and 2019 at the casitas vista road bridge coincident with usgs gaging station 11118500 fig 3 due to effort limitations and safety considerations suspended sediment samples were collected using the non isokinetic surface dip method edwards and glysson 1999 the dip method utilized by ucr collects samples at the surface of flow and thus can only be expected to faithfully sample finer suspended particles transported as washload the usgs flow integrated method can faithfully sample coarser suspended particles with depth dependent concentration gradients edwards and glysson 1999 however the flow integrated method involves the operation of a crane to deploy the heavy isokinetic samplers which requires more personnel than the surface dip method and entails a higher risk of interaction with stormflow debris briefly the surface dip sampling method used by ucr involves sampling the water surface with a hand line suspended bucket and quantitatively transferring the sampled water to prepared sample bottles discrete equal volume samples were captured using a sampler bucket on the surface of the river at the center of the highest stream surface velocity samples were collected at 1 hour intervals where equal volume samples were collected in pairs a single 1 l bottle for particle size analysis and a single 1 l bottle for c ss peak flow samples were collected in volumes greater than 120 l 3 4 ucr suspended sediment sample analysis suspended sediment samples collected by ucr for particle size distribution analysis were characterized on a beckman coulter ls 13 320 laser diffraction particle size analyzer using polarized intensity diffraction capabilities with 117 size bins from 0 034 to 2000 ¬µm following sample preparation as per gray et al 2010 using 100 ml of heated hydrogen peroxide for organic digestion and deflocculation with sodium metaphosphate particle size distributions were then transformed to usgs suspended sediment particle size bins 10 size bins from 2 to 2000 ¬µm grab samples collected for c ss were processed and calculated as per gray et al 2014 all samples were measured volumetrically and then filtered through pre weighed combusted whatman gf a 0 7 ¬µm glass fiber filters filters were dried at 60 c for 24 h cooled to room temperature under vacuum in a desiccator and then weighted to 0 00001 g peak flow samples were measured volumetrically and sediment was separated from water through large volume centrifugation as per hatten et al 2012 differing only in the use of a thermo scientific sorvall lynx 6000 for a minimum of 15 minutes at 2500 times gravity with repeat filling of 1 l centrifuge bottles the retained sediment pellet was dried and weighed in the same manner as the filter samples the supernatant was subsampled after every centrifuge run processed for sediment as per the filter approach above and the c ss of peak flow samples was calculated as the dry mass of supernatant and pellet sediment divided by the sampled water volume 3 5 restriction of inquiry to fine suspended sediment because suspended sediment samples were collected by the authors from the surface of the river rather than through flow integrated methods used by the usgs coarse suspended sediment particles were potentially under represented to address this issue we conservatively limited our study to the fraction of suspended sediment that we could confidently ascribe as washload i e transported in a fully mixed state across the flow field and thus without concentration dependency on location within the flow field we defined this subset of total suspended load as particles with d 62 5 ¬µm i e fines fractional concentration defined as c ss fines on the basis of the particle size threshold between washload and depth stratified suspended load calculated for each usgs and ucr observation using manning s equation stokes law and the rouse number rouse 1937 for further details see si including table s2 the minimum calculated washload threshold found for the sampled flows was d 136 7 ¬µm so we are confident that fine suspended sediment was faithfully sampled by both the flow integrated methods used by the usgs and surface sampling methods used by ucr 3 6 precipitation drainage relationship the relationship between annual p and drainage was investigated over the period of usgs discharge monitoring with a focus on changes after the 2017 thomas fire annual discharge m3 was calculated from usgs q d data gage 11118500 for each wy from 1930 to 2019 and then transformed to depth of annual drainage by dividing discharge by watershed area dependence of annual drainage on annual p was empirically modeled as a power law relationship for the complete pre fire monitoring period 1930 2017 and the pre 1930 1959 and post dam 1960 2017 periods to confirm which would be the appropriate base period for comparison to the post fire period analysis of covariance ancova was used to test for differences between the drainage p models for both dam periods using r studio r development core team 2021 post wildfire annual drainage values were then compared to the drainage predictions from the selected model 3 7 fine suspended sediment rating curves css qi dynamics and time dependence concentration discharge rating curves were used to investigate changes in the relationship between c ss fines and q over time to enable statistical comparisons of c ss fines q i relationships between periods with ancova power law c ss fines q i rating curves in the form of 1 c ss fines a q i b with regression parameters a and b as the intercept and slope respectively were fitted to the usgs historical dataset and ucr post fire monitoring in wys 2018 and 2019 to avoid potential bias from the systematically poor fit of power law curves e g farnsworth and warrick 2007 gray 2018 loess rating curves were fitted with a smoothing factor …ë of 0 5 and used as the basis of rating curve residual calculations for investigations of temporal dependence throughout usgs q i c ss fines monitoring to assess patterns of temporal dependence in fine suspended sediment dynamics over annual to interdecadal time scales we calculated the residuals between c ss fines observations and the predicted concentrations c ss fines a ÀÜ from the loess rating curve fitted to the entire log transformed usgs historical q i c ss fines dataset as per gray et al 2014 loess residuals were plotted against time and mann kendall analysis was used to identify trends in the c ss fines q i relationship over the entire usgs base period of record a cumulative loess residual curve over the usgs sampling period was also developed to identify persistent periods on the basis of local slope such that periods of persistence are identified by distinct positive and negative slopes gray 2015a gray 2018 periods of persistent positive subscript p and negative subscript n c ss fines q i behavior were determined following gray 2018 on the basis of the local slope of the cumulative residual curve maintained over a range of cumulative residual values 5x the residual mean squared error rmse of the c ss q rating curve the usgs historical q i c ss fines dataset was then separated into persistent periods by date and new loess and power law rating curves eq 1 were developed for each period differences between c ss fines q i relationships during the entire period of usgs historical data the persistent positive period and the persistent negative period and post fire years were assessed using ancova techniques applied to the power law rating curves see supplemental information and gray 2018 for further details 3 8 fine suspended sediment flux estimation estimation of q ss fines ÀÜ for the range of periods and assumptions investigated in this study was performed by predicting daily c ss fines ÀÜ with usgs q d records and loess rating curves daily c ss fines ÀÜ was produced by applying the usgs q d record at gage 11118500 to rating curves developed from each suspended sediment monitoring dataset with c ss fines a ÀÜ c ss fines p ÀÜ c ss fines n ÀÜ c ss fines 2018 ÀÜ and c ss fines 2019 ÀÜ corresponding to the datasets usgs all total usgs record usgs persistent positive period usgs persistent negative period post fire 2018 and post fire 2019 respectively daily c ss fines ÀÜ values were predicted from loess models c ss fines q i for all q d values for the ventura river over the base period of the rating curve monitoring dataset values of c ss fines ÀÜ that were within the q i c ss monitored discharge domain for each period were predicted using loess curves fitted to that period s c ss fines q i dataset for q d values outside of the monitored q i domain thus outside of the domain of loess rating curve predictions extrapolation required additional steps estimation of c ss fines ÀÜ for q d below the monitored q i domain was calculated as the average of the ten lowest observed c ss values gray 2018 estimation of c ss fines ÀÜ for q d values greater than the monitored q i discharge domain was calculated from a power law curve fitted to the q i c ss fines dataset subset by the five highest q i values daily q ss fines ÀÜ was calculated for each period as a product of q d and bias corrected c ss fines ÀÜ c ss corrected ÀÜ 2 q ss fines ÀÜ q d c ss corrected ÀÜ two bias correction factors were used to calculate c ss corrected ÀÜ the daily bias correction factor bcf d that adjusts for the use of q d rather than q i warrick and mertes 2009 and a log bias correction factor bcf l that corrects for systematic bias imparted by calculating regression parameters using log transformed data ferguson 1986 3 c ss corrected ÀÜ bcf d bcf l c ss fines ÀÜ the value of bcf d was calculated by comparing fine sediment loads estimated from q d values and those from q i values by taking the average of the ratio of q i and q d over the usgs and ucr suspended sediment monitoring period which was determined to be 1 02 the log bias correction factor bcf l was calculated as 4 bcf l 10 s 2 2 where s is the mean squared error of the residuals this bcf l was used to correct for log transformation bias and although it is fit to a non normally distributed rating curve it is used as a conservative estimate for q ss fines annual values of q ss fines ÀÜ were calculated for each period by multiplying daily c ss fines ÀÜ c ss fines a ÀÜ c ss fines p ÀÜ c ss fines n ÀÜ by q d and time and then summing over each wy helsel and hirsch 2002 an additional optimal c ss fines o ÀÜ was also determined by using separate rating curves for persistent positive and negative periods over the entire usgs suspended sediment monitoring period when q d fell within a positive or negative temporal zone values of c ss fines o ÀÜ were determined by the respective rating curve and then multiplied by q d and time to calculate daily q ss fines o ÀÜ before summing by wy uncertainty was estimated at a 95 level as per farnsworth and warrick 2007 and gray et al 2015b by propagating an assumed 10 total error in observed q i and c ss fines values along with localized c ss fines q i rating curve standard error using the mean confidence interval approach helsel and hirsch 2002 for daily c ss fines ÀÜ values that required extrapolation outside of the sampling q i domain an additional 10 error was applied as per farnsworth and warrick 2007 annual q ss f ines ÀÜ were then averaged for each period differences in suspended sediment discharge estimations were evaluated by examining the ratios as per gray 2018 of q ss fines p ÀÜ to q ss fines a ÀÜ p a q ss fines p ÀÜ to q ss fines n n a and q ss fines ÀÜ to q ss fines n ÀÜ o a to assess the impact of persistence behavior on q ss fines ÀÜ and compare them to post wildfire wys 2018 and 2019 q ss fines ÀÜ 4 results 4 1 hydrologic response during the two post wildfire years 2018

2017 drainage p relationship 6 7 and 1 7 times higher respectively although the difference was outside of the 95 confidence interval for individual predictions the larger increase in drainage response for wy 2018 than wy 2019 are likely attributed to watershed rebound in terms of vegetation regrowth increasing surface roughness and increasing soil sorptivity hydraulic conductivity with increased time after the burn romero et al 2018 similarly peak discharge values for water years 2018 170 8 m3 s 1 2 year return interval and 2019 453 1 m3 s 1 5 year return interval were respectively below and

thomas fire wy 2018 were visually dark brown and smelled heavily of burned material and appeared to contain high amounts of floating wood debris and charcoal samples collected during wy 2018 and 2019

significantly different but intercepts differed significantly table 4 years 2018 and 2019 are parallel to each other and the curve fit to the entire usgs record but differ in intercepts offset and are 13 2 times higher and 4 6 times higher respectively than the rating curve fit to the entire usgs record loess rating curves bore the characteristic s shaped curvature commonly found in small mountainous rivers on the us pacific coast farnsworth and warrick 2007 with lower local slopes at the low and high ends of the discharge domain fig 5b the loess curve for the post wildfire year 2018 also displayed a dip in the middle discharge range due to the high leverage of the small number of samples collected in this discharge range 4 3 persistent pre fire suspended sediment behavior persistent periods of high or low c ss fines were identified by examining c ss fines q i loess residuals over the usgs monitoring period the mann kendall analysis showed a significant negative temporal trend tau 0 47 p 0 0001 and a fitted negative linear temporal trend was also significant fig 6a further analysis into the temporal pattern of residuals identified persistent positive p 1971

stationary record fig 7a table 3 ancova results table 4 show that both persistent rating curves are parallel to that of the complete usgs record but differ in offset by 2 3 times higher and 2 2 times lower respectively table 4 years 2018 and 2019 were both strongly offset from the n curve 30 9 times and 8 9 times respectively and the 2018 curve had a lower slope than that of the n period driven by

ÀÜ for wy 2018 and wy 2019 were 14 2 and 5 1 times pww2018 a and pw2019 a higher than would be predicted by a single rating curve fit to the entire usgs record by taking the most recent period of persistent negative c ss q behavior as the baseline for post fire comparison we found that q ss fines ÀÜ was elevated 32 4 times baseline in 2018 pw2018 n and 9 5 times baseline in 2019 pw2019 n respectively 5 discussion between 1971 and 2008 the average annual fine sediment flux in the ventura river at usgs gage 11118500 was 0 177 0 140 0 230 mt 1 œÉ as estimated by taking into account persistent periods of fine suspended sediment behavior our findings are lower than previous investigations of fine suspended sediment flux at the same location using usgs suspended sediment monitoring data and rating curves farnsworth and warrick 2007 found an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 197 mt using a single loess rating curve based on the entire historical suspended sediment monitoring record through 2006 n 490 and estimating the fine sediment fraction model based on discharge hill and mcconaughy 1988 estimated an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 58 mt from 1969 to 1980 and brownlie and taylor 1981 found an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 76 mt over a base period of 1967 1975 these findings of higher sediment fluxes in the ventura river reflect the fact that these studies fall within the persistent period of elevated suspended sediment concentrations 1971 1982 that we identified and the shorter base period over which their estimate is averaged which also include one or both years of exceptional flooding 1969 and 1978 these two years accounted for more than 75 of the fine sediment flux from 1969 to 1980 using our approach or that of hill and mcconaughy 1988 this highlights the risk of using short base periods to estimate mean sediment fluxes particularly from small mountainous rivers whose long term sediment yield is dominated by highly episodic precipitation and disturbance events the time dependent fined sediment behavior that we found in the ventura river from 1971 to 2008 can be described as a single cycle of elevated persistent suspended sediment concentrations then persistently low concentrations this was followed by a short term increase in sediment and water supply after the 2017 thomas fire the single cycle of persistent positive to negative fine suspended sediment behavior in the lower ventura river between 1971 and 2008 is indicative of a decreasing trend in c ss fines over this period time dependent fine suspended sediment behavior appears to play a significant role in over or under prediction of suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes in many small mountainous rivers gray 2018 including the ventura river we used the same usgs data set gage 11118500 and sampling period as gray 2018 albeit truncated by availability of particle size distribution data while focusing only on fine suspended sediments for this study our results show a similar pattern of persistent suspended sediment behavior indicative of a decreasing trend in c ss and c ss fines over the common period of record the latter part of the total suspended sediment monitoring period after the cessation of suspended sediment particle size analysis by the usfs in 2008 reported by gray 2018 featured the resumption of persistent positive behavior and a return to elevated c ss the differences between the rating relationships found for the persistent positive and negative periods found for c ss q and c ss fines q relationships were also similar p n of 1 9 and 2 7 respectively this contrasts with previous findings on the temporal dependence of particle size specific suspended sediment dynamics on the salinas river where the timing and frequency of persistent periods of elevated depressed suspended mud concentrations differed greatly from those of sand gray et al 2015a thus the supply of both fines and sand to the lower ventura river appear to have declined relative to the supply of water over the 1971 2008 period potentially through the reduction of common sources or drivers it should be noted that the persistent negative period of fine suspended sediment behavior in the ventura river included a plateau of relatively stable suspended sediment concentrations composed of a few samples collected from low flow conditions in the mid 1980s to early 1990s this period also happens to coincide with the 1985 wheeler fire which was the largest wildfire in the history of the ventura river watershed prior to the thomas fire the resultant interannual pause in declining fine sediment concentrations in the usgs record may be associated with this burn and indeed we expect that large increases in the suspended sediment c ss fines q occurred after this large fire unfortunately suspended sediment sampling was not focused on storm events during this period on the ventura river and the few samples on record were collected primarily during baseflow conditions years after the fire if the long term decline of fine sediment concentrations in lower ventura river persisted through the decade after the end of the usgs monitoring period 2008 the increased fine sediment flux engendered by the thomas fire was more than twice what would be estimated under an assumption of time independence in this context the impact of the thomas fire on the c ss fines q relationship would be a 30x increase in fine sediment concentration in the lower ventura river during the first year after fire and more than a 32x increase in flux due to increases in sediment supply alone it should be noted that the annual runoff production in 2018 was 6 7 times higher than predicted by the historical p q relationship this increase in runoff production likely resulted from dramatic reductions in evapotranspiration and infiltration rates and increases in lateral hydrologic connectivity resulting from the combustion of vegetation and soil organic matter usfs 2018 thus even with the conservative assumption of uniformed increases in discharge production across the precipitation domain the impact of the thomas fire on fine sediment flux in 2018 was perhaps a 200x increase when increases in runoff baseflow and fine sediment supply are jointly considered however the ventura river s fine sediment flux in 2018 of 0 073 0 05 0 11 mt remained well below the long term annual average of 0 177 0 140 0 230 mt despite dramatic increases in water and sediment supply because 2018 was a relatively dry year less than half of the average annual precipitation our finding of suspended sediment flux increases after wildfire are consistent with previous studies that found orders of magnitude increases in sediment transfer after wildfires in small mountainous catchments with a high proportion of recent burn area warrick and rubin 2007 coombs and melack 2012 warrick et al 2012 and strong dependence of suspended sediment flux on the occurrence of significant precipitation events during the period of disturbance particularly the first year after fire warrick et al 2012 wester et al 2014 aguilera and melack 2018 greenbaum et al 2021 by 2019 the impact of the thomas fire on c ss fines was only 10x that of the pre fire period of persistently low c ss fines and annual runoff was 2x greater than the long term p q relationship although 2019 was wetter than both 2018 and the average the resultant fine sediment flux in 2019 of 0 393 0 284 0 427 mt was only about double that of the long term annual mean fine sediment flux vegetation and soil hydraulic property rebound and sediment supply stabilization likely contributed to a rapid relaxation toward pre fire hydro sedimentological behavior of the undammed portion of the ventura river watershed monitored in this study the multi year response in erosion runoff and discharge of suspended sediment is known to decay with time warrick and rubin 2007 explored this idea by applying an exponential decay model to evaluate the effects of wildfire on c ss and their exponential decay back to baseline concentrations fitting such a model to c ss fines q offset values and proportional value above the annual p q rating curve for 2018 2019 yields a post fire recovery half life of 0 85 years in terms suspended sediment dynamics and 0 93 years in terms of runoff production both runoff and sediment delivery mechanisms appear to recover over similar time scales in the undammed portion of the ventura river watershed as found in similar post fire settings e g warrick et al 2012 greenbaum et al 2021 the modest fine sediment fluxes observed in the lower ventura river during the first two years after the thomas fire were of a similar magnitude or less than the fine sediment impounded by the matilija robles and casitas dams during this period the impounded watersheds of the coyote matilija and north fork matilija creeks contain the steepest headwaters in the ventura river watershed and were also burned to a greater extent and at greater severity than the undammed portion of the watershed that contributed most of the water and sediment observed in the lower ventura river the matilija reservoir had already filled with approximately 6 0 106 m3 with 6 105 m3 of remaining capacity by 2014 aecom and stillwater sciences 2016 which was further reduced to 1 8 105 m3 by 2020 ventura county 2020 on the order of 0 9 105 m3 of sediment was also deposited in the robles diversion facility and removed during wy 2019 carlson 2019 rincon consultants 2019 and lake casitas likely experienced even greater sedimentation from coyote creek as well as ventura river diversion waters together these impoundments likely captured 1 2 mt of total sediment during 2018 and 2019 an undetermined proportion of which were fines in comparison to 0 5 mt of fine sediment discharged by the undammed watershed during this period while lake casitas will remain an effective trap for sediment for decades to come plans for the removal of matilija dam are underway which will eventually result in the release of over 10 mt of impounded sediment to the ventura river and its adjacent coastal marine habitats ventura county 2020 although the magnitude and character of the short term impacts of the thomas fire on water and sediment fluxes in the lower ventura river are clear the causes of long term time depended suspended sediment behavior prior to the fire are not the single sequence of persistent positive and negative fine suspended sediment and corresponding negative secular trend in rating curve residuals over the period of usgs record show that concentration discharge relationships have been decreasing throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the ventura watershed this is likely caused by either decreasing watershed fine sediment supply and or increasing water supply driving a dilution effect since our results suggest no secular trend in precipitation partitioning to runoff at least at annual aggregation fine sediment supply has likely decreased throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the ventura watershed what may have caused this interdecadal decrease in fine sediment supply to the lower ventura river common culprits include the spatiotemporal distribution of disturbances such as wildfire landuse and hydrologic modification as well as hydro meteorological activity in the case of the ventura river wildfire extent in the watershed has not decrease over the period of suspended sediment record calfire 2021 land use such as urban development wolman and schick 1967 2007 and changes in agricultural irrigation gray et al 2016 have been shown to alter the suspended sediment response in watersheds by changing water and sediment supply to the channelized system agricultural operations in the ventura river watershed may be of lesser importance since they comprise less than 4 of the land use in the undammed basin while urban and industrial development account for only 16 9 and are focused in lower sloped regions that are not likely the dominant sources of sediment the timing of the transition around 1980 to the period of persistently low c ss fines may be related to land use changes or changing land use operations such as forestry management practices as have been found elsewhere e g fisher et al 2021 but could also be an artifact of our analysis imposed on a long term interdecadal trend in decreasing concentrations impoundment of major tributaries to the ventura river have certainly decreased the delivery of fine sediment usbr 2006 however all major dams were emplaced more than a decade before the onset of fine suspended sediment monitoring and rapid sedimentation of the matilija reservoir resulted in dramatic reduction of its sediment trapping efficiency during the historical monitoring period finally persistent patterns of hydro meteorological activity may have also played a role and indeed high magnitude floods e g floods 1000 m3 s 1 return interval 10 years occurred more frequently in the latter decades of the c ss fines monitoring record 1 event from 1971 to 1990 vs 4 events from 1990 to 2008 hestir et al 2013 found a step wise decrease in the sacramento river suspended sediment regime from transport to supply regulation and attributed it to supply exhaustion from a large magnitude flood flushing event and gray et al 2015a found patterns of similar flushing behavior in the salinas river corresponding to smaller more frequent flows further investigation of the ventura river watershed s land use and hydro meteorological regime may provide fruitful insights into the reason for its interdecadal patterns of fine suspended sediment behavior 6 conclusion the main goals of this study were to investigate interdecadal temporal dependence in the fine silt and clay suspended sediment dynamics of the ventura river over its historical monitoring period 1971 2008 and evaluate changes to these dynamics after the 2017 thomas fire a period of elevated fine sediment concentration early in the historical monitoring record 1971 1981 was followed by a period of persistently low concentrations 1981 2008 relative to the ensemble concentration discharge relationship for the entire historical monitoring period this pattern is consistent with a monotonic decrease in normalized fine sediment concentrations in the ventura river over the 1971 2008 period of historical monitoring conducted by the us geological survey refined estimations of fine suspended sediment flux for the post dam period of hydrologic monitoring 1960 2019 incorporating these temporal patterns resulted in a small 10 increase in estimated fine sediment flux over the historical period 0 0160 vs 0 177 mt however fine sediment fluxes estimated on the basis of c ss fines q i relationships characterized during positive elevated concentrations or negative depressed concentrations periods of persistent fine sediment behavior differed by a factor of 2 7 0 286 vs 0 106 mt after the 2017 thomas fire fine suspended sediment concentrations monitored during stormflow in 2018 and 2019 were 14 2 and 5 1 times higher than predicted based on the entire historical monitoring record but 32 4 and 9 5 times higher than the most recent period of persistently low suspended sediment concentrations respectively the impact of the thomas fire on sediment and water supply to the channel increased fine sediment flux in 2018 by a factor of 200 relative to pre fire conditions however the fine suspended sediment flux during 2018 of 0 073 0 050 0 105 mt and 2019 of 0 393 0 284 0 437 mt were lower than and comparable respectively to the long term average of 0 177 0 14 0 23 mt because of relatively low precipitation magnitudes during the post fire period these findings highlight the importance of considering time dependent behavior when estimating fluvial sediment fluxes and characterizing the impacts of fire on suspended sediment dynamics as well as the critical role that storm event magnitudes play in determining the sediment yield of small mountainous watersheds after wildfire developing c ss q rating relationships over even multiple decades can result in dramatic over or under prediction of sediment fluxes when applied beyond the period of record by extension ignoring temporally dependent c ss q relationships can potentially mask or over under accentuate the impact of disturbance events on suspended sediment dynamics by not considering disturbance dynamics in the context of the most recent system state finally post fire rainfall magnitudes during the first few years after fire is a dominant control on suspended sediment transfer from small 102 103 km2 mountainous watersheds with rapid post fire recovery characteristics such as the steep shrublands that dominate the ventura river watershed when such watersheds do not receive rare high magnitude rainfall events during the first few years after fire suspended sediment fluxes may remain modest despite order of magnitude increases in sediment and water supply to the channel the limitations of this study in terms of monitoring frequency and approach illustrate potential future directions for better characterizing and understanding fine sediment dynamics in small mountainous watersheds this study was based on a relatively small amount n 100 of historical data collected over multiple decades and an intensive post fire monitoring regime n 71 conducted over 2 years at one river station the historical record suffers from the fact that it ended 10 years before the onset of post fire monitoring because of reductions in usgs suspended sediment monitoring efforts which have been noted across the us over recent decades e g warrick and milliman 2018 our monitoring efforts after the thomas fire suffered from effort and safety constraints that limited the amount of sampling conducted and restricted the study to fine sediment increased monitoring efforts and expanded use of proxy measurements that support higher frequency and longer duration monitoring would increase the power of investigations into changes in suspended sediment dynamics over decades and after punctuated disturbances future efforts that employ distributed monitoring of the watershed sediment transport and storage continuum using direct e g hydrologic topographic bathymetric and stratigraphic monitoring and indirect approaches e g sediment tracers will also be critical for spanning the gap in process

that wildfire influence on c ss q rating curves is most recognizable during the first few years following a burn when c ss is expected to be highest despite increases in q this interannual period of disturbance produces the greatest increases in q ss when burned watersheds experience above average rainfall warrick et al 2012 aguilera and melack 2018 beyond the changes wrought by wildfire fluvial

upper ventura river because it only discharges back to the ventura river during rare extremely wet periods usbr 2006 the combined effect of these impoundment structures during the ucr monitoring

cable deployed isokinetic samplers through the depth of flow at multiple points across the channel at a station edwards and glysson 1999 for this study we used c ss samples if they had all of the following data c ss usgs code 80154 particle size distribution usgs codes 70311 70346 and instantaneous discharge q i 15 min time interval usgs code 00061 fig 3 table 2 mean daily discharge q d usgs code 00060 and peak discharge q peak was also retrieved from the usgs for wy 1930 2019 for calculating sediment fluxes and evaluating the lower ventura river s flood regime 3 3 ucr suspended sediment sampling the usgs suspended sediment monitoring program on the ventura river ended in 2015 to characterize post fire fine suspended sediment dynamics the authors collected n 71 suspended sediment samples herein referred to as ucr samples during stormflow conditions in wy 2018 and 2019 at the casitas vista road bridge coincident with usgs gaging station 11118500 fig 3 due to effort limitations and safety considerations suspended sediment samples were collected using the non isokinetic surface dip method edwards and glysson 1999 the dip method utilized by ucr collects samples at the surface of flow and thus can only be expected to faithfully sample finer suspended particles transported as washload the usgs flow integrated method can faithfully sample coarser suspended particles with depth dependent concentration gradients edwards and glysson 1999 however the flow integrated method involves the operation of a crane to deploy the heavy isokinetic samplers which requires more personnel than the surface dip method and entails a higher risk of interaction with stormflow debris briefly the surface dip sampling method used by ucr involves sampling the water surface with a hand line suspended bucket and quantitatively transferring the sampled water to prepared sample bottles discrete equal volume samples were captured using a sampler bucket on the surface of the river at the center of the highest stream surface velocity samples were collected at 1 hour intervals where equal volume samples were collected in pairs a single 1 l bottle for particle size analysis and a single 1 l bottle for c ss peak flow samples were collected in volumes greater than 120 l 3 4 ucr suspended sediment sample analysis suspended sediment samples collected by ucr for particle size distribution analysis were characterized on a beckman coulter ls 13 320 laser diffraction particle size analyzer using polarized intensity diffraction capabilities with 117 size bins from 0 034 to 2000 ¬µm following sample preparation as per gray et al 2010 using 100 ml of heated hydrogen peroxide for organic digestion and deflocculation with sodium metaphosphate particle size distributions were then transformed to usgs suspended sediment particle size bins 10 size bins from 2 to 2000 ¬µm grab samples collected for c ss were processed and calculated as per gray et al 2014 all samples were measured volumetrically and then filtered through pre weighed combusted whatman gf a 0 7 ¬µm glass fiber filters filters were dried at 60 c for 24 h cooled to room temperature under vacuum in a desiccator and then weighted to 0 00001 g peak flow samples were measured volumetrically and sediment was separated from water through large volume centrifugation as per hatten et al 2012 differing only in the use of a thermo scientific sorvall lynx 6000 for a minimum of 15 minutes at 2500 times gravity with repeat filling of 1 l centrifuge bottles the retained sediment pellet was dried and weighed in the same manner as the filter samples the supernatant was subsampled after every centrifuge run processed for sediment as per the filter approach above and the c ss of peak flow samples was calculated as the dry mass of supernatant and pellet sediment divided by the sampled water volume 3 5 restriction of inquiry to fine suspended sediment because suspended sediment samples were collected by the authors from the surface of the river rather than through flow integrated methods used by the usgs coarse suspended sediment particles were potentially under represented to address this issue we conservatively limited our study to the fraction of suspended sediment that we could confidently ascribe as washload i e transported in a fully mixed state across the flow field and thus without concentration dependency on location within the flow field we defined this subset of total suspended load as particles with d 62 5 ¬µm i e fines fractional concentration defined as c ss fines on the basis of the particle size threshold between washload and depth stratified suspended load calculated for each usgs and ucr observation using manning s equation stokes law and the rouse number rouse 1937 for further details see si including table s2 the minimum calculated washload threshold found for the sampled flows was d 136 7 ¬µm so we are confident that fine suspended sediment was faithfully sampled by both the flow integrated methods used by the usgs and surface sampling methods used by ucr 3 6 precipitation drainage relationship the relationship between annual p and drainage was investigated over the period of usgs discharge monitoring with a focus on changes after the 2017 thomas fire annual discharge m3 was calculated from usgs q d data gage 11118500 for each wy from 1930 to 2019 and then transformed to depth of annual drainage by dividing discharge by watershed area dependence of annual drainage on annual p was empirically modeled as a power law relationship for the complete pre fire monitoring period 1930 2017 and the pre 1930 1959 and post dam 1960 2017 periods to confirm which would be the appropriate base period for comparison to the post fire period analysis of covariance ancova was used to test for differences between the drainage p models for both dam periods using r studio r development core team 2021 post wildfire annual drainage values were then compared to the drainage predictions from the selected model 3 7 fine suspended sediment rating curves css qi dynamics and time dependence concentration discharge rating curves were used to investigate changes in the relationship between c ss fines and q over time to enable statistical comparisons of c ss fines q i relationships between periods with ancova power law c ss fines q i rating curves in the form of 1 c ss fines a q i b with regression parameters a and b as the intercept and slope respectively were fitted to the usgs historical dataset and ucr post fire monitoring in wys 2018 and 2019 to avoid potential bias from the systematically poor fit of power law curves e g farnsworth and warrick 2007 gray 2018 loess rating curves were fitted with a smoothing factor …ë of 0 5 and used as the basis of rating curve residual calculations for investigations of temporal dependence throughout usgs q i c ss fines monitoring to assess patterns of temporal dependence in fine suspended sediment dynamics over annual to interdecadal time scales we calculated the residuals between c ss fines observations and the predicted concentrations c ss fines a ÀÜ from the loess rating curve fitted to the entire log transformed usgs historical q i c ss fines dataset as per gray et al 2014 loess residuals were plotted against time and mann kendall analysis was used to identify trends in the c ss fines q i relationship over the entire usgs base period of record a cumulative loess residual curve over the usgs sampling period was also developed to identify persistent periods on the basis of local slope such that periods of persistence are identified by distinct positive and negative slopes gray 2015a gray 2018 periods of persistent positive subscript p and negative subscript n c ss fines q i behavior were determined following gray 2018 on the basis of the local slope of the cumulative residual curve maintained over a range of cumulative residual values 5x the residual mean squared error rmse of the c ss q rating curve the usgs historical q i c ss fines dataset was then separated into persistent periods by date and new loess and power law rating curves eq 1 were developed for each period differences between c ss fines q i relationships during the entire period of usgs historical data the persistent positive period and the persistent negative period and post fire years were assessed using ancova techniques applied to the power law rating curves see supplemental information and gray 2018 for further details 3 8 fine suspended sediment flux estimation estimation of q ss fines ÀÜ for the range of periods and assumptions investigated in this study was performed by predicting daily c ss fines ÀÜ with usgs q d records and loess rating curves daily c ss fines ÀÜ was produced by applying the usgs q d record at gage 11118500 to rating curves developed from each suspended sediment monitoring dataset with c ss fines a ÀÜ c ss fines p ÀÜ c ss fines n ÀÜ c ss fines 2018 ÀÜ and c ss fines 2019 ÀÜ corresponding to the datasets usgs all total usgs record usgs persistent positive period usgs persistent negative period post fire 2018 and post fire 2019 respectively daily c ss fines ÀÜ values were predicted from loess models c ss fines q i for all q d values for the ventura river over the base period of the rating curve monitoring dataset values of c ss fines ÀÜ that were within the q i c ss monitored discharge domain for each period were predicted using loess curves fitted to that period s c ss fines q i dataset for q d values outside of the monitored q i domain thus outside of the domain of loess rating curve predictions extrapolation required additional steps estimation of c ss fines ÀÜ for q d below the monitored q i domain was calculated as the average of the ten lowest observed c ss values gray 2018 estimation of c ss fines ÀÜ for q d values greater than the monitored q i discharge domain was calculated from a power law curve fitted to the q i c ss fines dataset subset by the five highest q i values daily q ss fines ÀÜ was calculated for each period as a product of q d and bias corrected c ss fines ÀÜ c ss corrected ÀÜ 2 q ss fines ÀÜ q d c ss corrected ÀÜ two bias correction factors were used to calculate c ss corrected ÀÜ the daily bias correction factor bcf d that adjusts for the use of q d rather than q i warrick and mertes 2009 and a log bias correction factor bcf l that corrects for systematic bias imparted by calculating regression parameters using log transformed data ferguson 1986 3 c ss corrected ÀÜ bcf d bcf l c ss fines ÀÜ the value of bcf d was calculated by comparing fine sediment loads estimated from q d values and those from q i values by taking the average of the ratio of q i and q d over the usgs and ucr suspended sediment monitoring period which was determined to be 1 02 the log bias correction factor bcf l was calculated as 4 bcf l 10 s 2 2 where s is the mean squared error of the residuals this bcf l was used to correct for log transformation bias and although it is fit to a non normally distributed rating curve it is used as a conservative estimate for q ss fines annual values of q ss fines ÀÜ were calculated for each period by multiplying daily c ss fines ÀÜ c ss fines a ÀÜ c ss fines p ÀÜ c ss fines n ÀÜ by q d and time and then summing over each wy helsel and hirsch 2002 an additional optimal c ss fines o ÀÜ was also determined by using separate rating curves for persistent positive and negative periods over the entire usgs suspended sediment monitoring period when q d fell within a positive or negative temporal zone values of c ss fines o ÀÜ were determined by the respective rating curve and then multiplied by q d and time to calculate daily q ss fines o ÀÜ before summing by wy uncertainty was estimated at a 95 level as per farnsworth and warrick 2007 and gray et al 2015b by propagating an assumed 10 total error in observed q i and c ss fines values along with localized c ss fines q i rating curve standard error using the mean confidence interval approach helsel and hirsch 2002 for daily c ss fines ÀÜ values that required extrapolation outside of the sampling q i domain an additional 10 error was applied as per farnsworth and warrick 2007 annual q ss f ines ÀÜ were then averaged for each period differences in suspended sediment discharge estimations were evaluated by examining the ratios as per gray 2018 of q ss fines p ÀÜ to q ss fines a ÀÜ p a q ss fines p ÀÜ to q ss fines n n a and q ss fines ÀÜ to q ss fines n ÀÜ o a to assess the impact of persistence behavior on q ss fines ÀÜ and compare them to post wildfire wys 2018 and 2019 q ss fines ÀÜ 4 results 4 1 hydrologic response during the two post wildfire years 2018

model for comparison to post wildfire drainage response fig 4a we found that post wildfire years 2018 and 2019 both have a higher drainage 21 6 mm and 154 2 mm respectively than predicted by the 1930 2017 drainage p relationship 6 7 and 1 7 times higher respectively although the difference was outside of the 95 confidence interval for individual predictions the larger increase in drainage response for wy 2018 than wy 2019 are likely attributed to watershed rebound in terms of vegetation regrowth increasing surface roughness and increasing soil sorptivity hydraulic conductivity with increased time after the burn romero et al 2018 similarly peak discharge values for water years 2018 170 8 m3 s 1 2 year return interval and 2019 453 1 m3 s 1 5 year return interval were respectively below and

thomas fire wy 2018 were visually dark brown and smelled heavily of burned material and appeared to contain high amounts of floating wood debris and charcoal samples collected during wy 2018 and 2019

during the 2nd post fire wet season wy 2019 c ss fines values remained elevated relative to historical observations but appeared to be decreasing over time as further illustrated in the next section the power relationship between usgs c ss fines and q i are weakly positive r2 0 33 fig 5a table 3 for post wildfire years 2018 a weak positive power relationship was also observed r2 0 24 fig 5a as was a relatively strong positive relationship for 2019 r2 0 93 the slopes of the power relationships for pre wildfire usgs b 0 74 and post wildfire years 2018 b 0 49 and 2019 b 0 86 were not significantly different but intercepts differed significantly table 4 years 2018 and 2019 are parallel to each other and the curve fit to the entire usgs record but differ in intercepts offset and are 13 2 times higher and 4 6 times higher respectively than the rating curve fit to the entire usgs record loess rating curves bore the characteristic s shaped curvature commonly found in small mountainous rivers on the us pacific coast farnsworth and warrick 2007 with lower local slopes at the low and high ends of the discharge domain fig 5b the loess curve for the post wildfire year 2018 also displayed a dip in the middle discharge range due to the high leverage of the small number of samples collected in this discharge range 4 3 persistent pre fire suspended sediment behavior persistent periods of high or low c ss fines were identified by examining c ss fines q i loess residuals over the usgs monitoring period the mann kendall analysis showed a significant negative temporal trend tau 0 47 p 0 0001 and a fitted negative linear temporal trend was also significant fig 6a further analysis into the temporal pattern of residuals identified persistent positive p 1971 1982 and negative n 1983 2009 periods of fine suspended sediment behavior fig 6b note that the persistent negative period includes a plateau of relatively stable suspended sediment concentrations composed of a few samples collected from low flows in the mid 1980 s to early 1990 s 4 4 comparison of pre fire and post fire periods power law c ss fines q i rating curves fit to c ss q i data subset by p persistent periods of positive i e elevated c ss fines and n persistent periods of negative i e depressed c ss fines improved in correlation relative to the rating curve fitted to the entire usgs stationary record fig 7a table 3 ancova results table 4 show that both persistent rating curves are parallel to that of the complete usgs record but differ in offset by 2 3 times higher and 2 2 times lower respectively table 4 years 2018 and 2019 were both strongly offset from the n curve 30 9 times and 8 9 times respectively and the 2018 curve had a lower slope than that of the n period driven by very high c ss in the low discharge 10 m3 s 1 domain 4 5 css fines qi loess rating curves loess rating curves were developed for each post fire year 2018 and 2019 the positive 1971 1982 and negative 1983 2009 periods and the entire usgs suspended sediment discharge dataset 1971 2009 fig 7b to estimate annual suspended sediment flux average annual fine suspended sediment flux was calculated over the base periods for each of the loess rating curves derived from the usgs data set q ss fines a ÀÜ q ss fines p ÀÜ and q ss fines n ÀÜ additional optimal flux q ss fines o ÀÜ developed by applying q d records to pp an pn curves when within their respective periods and each of the post fire years 2018 and 2019 table 5 the q ss fines ÀÜ ratio o a 1 10 showed that suspended sediment flux estimates that account for persistent sediment behavior were only 10 higher than those obtained under the assumption of stationary c ss fines q relationships over the period of record post wildfire q ss fines ÀÜ for wy 2018 and wy 2019 were 14 2 and 5 1 times pww2018 a and pw2019 a higher than would be predicted by a single rating curve fit to the entire usgs record by taking the most recent period of persistent negative c ss q behavior as the baseline for post fire comparison we found that q ss fines ÀÜ was elevated 32 4 times baseline in 2018 pw2018 n and 9 5 times baseline in 2019 pw2019 n respectively 5 discussion between 1971 and 2008 the average annual fine sediment flux in the ventura river at usgs gage 11118500 was 0 177 0 140 0 230 mt 1 œÉ as estimated by taking into account persistent periods of fine suspended sediment behavior our findings are lower than previous investigations of fine suspended sediment flux at the same location using usgs suspended sediment monitoring data and rating curves farnsworth and warrick 2007 found an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 197 mt using a single loess rating curve based on the entire historical suspended sediment monitoring record through 2006 n 490 and estimating the fine sediment fraction model based on discharge hill and mcconaughy 1988 estimated an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 58 mt from 1969 to 1980 and brownlie and taylor 1981 found an average annual fine sediment flux of 0 76 mt over a base period of 1967 1975 these findings of higher sediment fluxes in the ventura river reflect the fact that these studies fall within the persistent period of elevated suspended sediment concentrations 1971 1982 that we identified and the shorter base period over which their estimate is averaged which also include one or both years of exceptional flooding 1969 and 1978 these two years accounted for more than 75 of the fine sediment flux from 1969 to 1980 using our approach or that of hill and mcconaughy 1988 this highlights the risk of using short base periods to estimate mean sediment fluxes particularly from small mountainous rivers whose long term sediment yield is dominated by highly episodic precipitation and disturbance events the time dependent fined sediment behavior that we found in the ventura river from 1971 to 2008 can be described as a single cycle of elevated persistent suspended sediment concentrations then persistently low concentrations this was followed by a short term increase in sediment and water supply after the 2017 thomas fire the single cycle of persistent positive to negative fine suspended sediment behavior in the lower ventura river between 1971 and 2008 is indicative of a decreasing trend in c ss fines over this period time dependent fine suspended sediment behavior appears to play a significant role in over or under prediction of suspended sediment concentrations and fluxes in many small mountainous rivers gray 2018 including the ventura river we used the same usgs data set gage 11118500 and sampling period as gray 2018 albeit truncated by availability of particle size distribution data while focusing only on fine suspended sediments for this study our results show a similar pattern of persistent suspended sediment behavior indicative of a decreasing trend in c ss and c ss fines over the common period of record the latter part of the total suspended sediment monitoring period after the cessation of suspended sediment particle size analysis by the usfs in 2008 reported by gray 2018 featured the resumption of persistent positive behavior and a return to elevated c ss the differences between the rating relationships found for the persistent positive and negative periods found for c ss q and c ss fines q relationships were also similar p n of 1 9 and 2 7 respectively this contrasts with previous findings on the temporal dependence of particle size specific suspended sediment dynamics on the salinas river where the timing and frequency of persistent periods of elevated depressed suspended mud concentrations differed greatly from those of sand gray et al 2015a thus the supply of both fines and sand to the lower ventura river appear to have declined relative to the supply of water over the 1971 2008 period potentially through the reduction of common sources or drivers it should be noted that the persistent negative period of fine suspended sediment behavior in the ventura river included a plateau of relatively stable suspended sediment concentrations composed of a few samples collected from low flow conditions in the mid 1980s to early 1990s this period also happens to coincide with the 1985 wheeler fire which was the largest wildfire in the history of the ventura river watershed prior to the thomas fire the resultant interannual pause in declining fine sediment concentrations in the usgs record may be associated with this burn and indeed we expect that large increases in the suspended sediment c ss fines q occurred after this large fire unfortunately suspended sediment sampling was not focused on storm events during this period on the ventura river and the few samples on record were collected primarily during baseflow conditions years after the fire if the long term decline of fine sediment concentrations in lower ventura river persisted through the decade after the end of the usgs monitoring period 2008 the increased fine sediment flux engendered by the thomas fire was more than twice what would be estimated under an assumption of time independence in this context the impact of the thomas fire on the c ss fines q relationship would be a 30x increase in fine sediment concentration in the lower ventura river during the first year after fire and more than a 32x increase in flux due to increases in sediment supply alone it should be noted that the annual runoff production in 2018 was 6 7 times higher than predicted by the historical p q relationship this increase in runoff production likely resulted from dramatic reductions in evapotranspiration and infiltration rates and increases in lateral hydrologic connectivity resulting from the combustion of vegetation and soil organic matter usfs 2018 thus even with the conservative assumption of uniformed increases in discharge production across the precipitation domain the impact of the thomas fire on fine sediment flux in 2018 was perhaps a 200x increase when increases in runoff baseflow and fine sediment supply are jointly considered however the ventura river s fine sediment flux in 2018 of 0 073 0 05 0 11 mt remained well below the long term annual average of 0 177 0 140 0 230 mt despite dramatic increases in water and sediment supply because 2018 was a relatively dry year less than half of the average annual precipitation our finding of suspended sediment flux increases after wildfire are consistent with previous studies that found orders of magnitude increases in sediment transfer after wildfires in small mountainous catchments with a high proportion of recent burn area warrick and rubin 2007 coombs and melack 2012 warrick et al 2012 and strong dependence of suspended sediment flux on the occurrence of significant precipitation events during the period of disturbance particularly the first year after fire warrick et al 2012 wester et al 2014 aguilera and melack 2018 greenbaum et al 2021 by 2019 the impact of the thomas fire on c ss fines was only 10x that of the pre fire period of persistently low c ss fines and annual runoff was 2x greater than the long term p q relationship although 2019 was wetter than both 2018 and the average the resultant fine sediment flux in 2019 of 0 393 0 284 0 427 mt was only about double that of the long term annual mean fine sediment flux vegetation and soil hydraulic property rebound and sediment supply stabilization likely contributed to a rapid relaxation toward pre fire hydro sedimentological behavior of the undammed portion of the ventura river watershed monitored in this study the multi year response in erosion runoff and discharge of suspended sediment is known to decay with time warrick and rubin 2007 explored this idea by applying an exponential decay model to evaluate the effects of wildfire on c ss and their exponential decay back to baseline concentrations fitting such a model to c ss fines q offset values and proportional value above the annual p q rating curve for 2018 2019 yields a post fire recovery half life of 0 85 years in terms suspended sediment dynamics and 0 93 years in terms of runoff production both runoff and sediment delivery mechanisms appear to recover over similar time scales in the undammed portion of the ventura river watershed as found in similar post fire settings e g warrick et al 2012 greenbaum et al 2021 the modest fine sediment fluxes observed in the lower ventura river during the first two years after the thomas fire were of a similar magnitude or less than the fine sediment impounded by the matilija robles and casitas dams during this period the impounded watersheds of the coyote matilija and north fork matilija creeks contain the steepest headwaters in the ventura river watershed and were also burned to a greater extent and at greater severity than the undammed portion of the watershed that contributed most of the water and sediment observed in the lower ventura river the matilija reservoir had already filled with approximately 6 0 106 m3 with 6 105 m3 of remaining capacity by 2014 aecom and stillwater sciences 2016 which was further reduced to 1 8 105 m3 by 2020 ventura county 2020 on the order of 0 9 105 m3 of sediment was also deposited in the robles diversion facility and removed during wy 2019 carlson 2019 rincon consultants 2019 and lake casitas likely experienced even greater sedimentation from coyote creek as well as ventura river diversion waters together these impoundments likely captured 1 2 mt of total sediment during 2018 and 2019 an undetermined proportion of which were fines in comparison to 0 5 mt of fine sediment discharged by the undammed watershed during this period while lake casitas will remain an effective trap for sediment for decades to come plans for the removal of matilija dam are underway which will eventually result in the release of over 10 mt of impounded sediment to the ventura river and its adjacent coastal marine habitats ventura county 2020 although the magnitude and character of the short term impacts of the thomas fire on water and sediment fluxes in the lower ventura river are clear the causes of long term time depended suspended sediment behavior prior to the fire are not the single sequence of persistent positive and negative fine suspended sediment and corresponding negative secular trend in rating curve residuals over the period of usgs record show that concentration discharge relationships have been decreasing throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the ventura watershed this is likely caused by either decreasing watershed fine sediment supply and or increasing water supply driving a dilution effect since our results suggest no secular trend in precipitation partitioning to runoff at least at annual aggregation fine sediment supply has likely decreased throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the ventura watershed what may have caused this interdecadal decrease in fine sediment supply to the lower ventura river common culprits include the spatiotemporal distribution of disturbances such as wildfire landuse and hydrologic modification as well as hydro meteorological activity in the case of the ventura river wildfire extent in the watershed has not decrease over the period of suspended sediment record calfire 2021 land use such as urban development wolman and schick 1967 2007 and changes in agricultural irrigation gray et al 2016 have been shown to alter the suspended sediment response in watersheds by changing water and sediment supply to the channelized system agricultural operations in the ventura river watershed may be of lesser importance since they comprise less than 4 of the land use in the undammed basin while urban and industrial development account for only 16 9 and are focused in lower sloped regions that are not likely the dominant sources of sediment the timing of the transition around 1980 to the period of persistently low c ss fines may be related to land use changes or changing land use operations such as forestry management practices as have been found elsewhere e g fisher et al 2021 but could also be an artifact of our analysis imposed on a long term interdecadal trend in decreasing concentrations impoundment of major tributaries to the ventura river have certainly decreased the delivery of fine sediment usbr 2006 however all major dams were emplaced more than a decade before the onset of fine suspended sediment monitoring and rapid sedimentation of the matilija reservoir resulted in dramatic reduction of its sediment trapping efficiency during the historical monitoring period finally persistent patterns of hydro meteorological activity may have also played a role and indeed high magnitude floods e g floods 1000 m3 s 1 return interval 10 years occurred more frequently in the latter decades of the c ss fines monitoring record 1 event from 1971 to 1990 vs 4 events from 1990 to 2008 hestir et al 2013 found a step wise decrease in the sacramento river suspended sediment regime from transport to supply regulation and attributed it to supply exhaustion from a large magnitude flood flushing event and gray et al 2015a found patterns of similar flushing behavior in the salinas river corresponding to smaller more frequent flows further investigation of the ventura river watershed s land use and hydro meteorological regime may provide fruitful insights into the reason for its interdecadal patterns of fine suspended sediment behavior 6 conclusion the main goals of this study were to investigate interdecadal temporal dependence in the fine silt and clay suspended sediment dynamics of the ventura river over its historical monitoring period 1971 2008 and evaluate changes to these dynamics after the 2017 thomas fire a period of elevated fine sediment concentration early in the historical monitoring record 1971 1981 was followed by a period of persistently low concentrations 1981 2008 relative to the ensemble concentration discharge relationship for the entire historical monitoring period this pattern is consistent with a monotonic decrease in normalized fine sediment concentrations in the ventura river over the 1971 2008 period of historical monitoring conducted by the us geological survey refined estimations of fine suspended sediment flux for the post dam period of hydrologic monitoring 1960 2019 incorporating these temporal patterns resulted in a small 10 increase in estimated fine sediment flux over the historical period 0 0160 vs 0 177 mt however fine sediment fluxes estimated on the basis of c ss fines q i relationships characterized during positive elevated concentrations or negative depressed concentrations periods of persistent fine sediment behavior differed by a factor of 2 7 0 286 vs 0 106 mt after the 2017 thomas fire fine suspended sediment concentrations monitored during stormflow in 2018 and 2019 were 14 2 and 5 1 times higher than predicted based on the entire historical monitoring record but 32 4 and 9 5 times higher than the most recent period of persistently low suspended sediment concentrations respectively the impact of the thomas fire on sediment and water supply to the channel increased fine sediment flux in 2018 by a factor of 200 relative to pre fire conditions however the fine suspended sediment flux during 2018 of 0 073 0 050 0 105 mt and 2019 of 0 393 0 284 0 437 mt were lower than and comparable respectively to the long term average of 0 177 0 14 0 23 mt because of relatively low precipitation magnitudes during the post fire period these findings highlight the importance of considering time dependent behavior when estimating fluvial sediment fluxes and characterizing the impacts of fire on suspended sediment dynamics as well as the critical role that storm event magnitudes play in determining the sediment yield of small mountainous watersheds after wildfire developing c ss q rating relationships over even multiple decades can result in dramatic over or under prediction of sediment fluxes when applied beyond the period of record by extension ignoring temporally dependent c ss q relationships can potentially mask or over under accentuate the impact of disturbance events on suspended sediment dynamics by not considering disturbance dynamics in the context of the most recent system state finally post fire rainfall magnitudes during the first few years after fire is a dominant control on suspended sediment transfer from small 102 103 km2 mountainous watersheds with rapid post fire recovery characteristics such as the steep shrublands that dominate the ventura river watershed when such watersheds do not receive rare high magnitude rainfall events during the first few years after fire suspended sediment fluxes may remain modest despite order of magnitude increases in sediment and water supply to the channel the limitations of this study in terms of monitoring frequency and approach illustrate potential future directions for better characterizing and understanding fine sediment dynamics in small mountainous watersheds this study was based on a relatively small amount n 100 of historical data collected over multiple decades and an intensive post fire monitoring regime n 71 conducted over 2 years at one river station the historical record suffers from the fact that it ended 10 years before the onset of post fire monitoring because of reductions in usgs suspended sediment monitoring efforts which have been noted across the us over recent decades e g warrick and milliman 2018 our monitoring efforts after the thomas fire suffered from effort and safety constraints that limited the amount of sampling conducted and restricted the study to fine sediment increased monitoring efforts and expanded use of proxy measurements that support higher frequency and longer duration monitoring would increase the power of investigations into changes in suspended sediment dynamics over decades and after punctuated disturbances future efforts that employ distributed monitoring of the watershed sediment transport and storage continuum using direct e g hydrologic topographic bathymetric and stratigraphic monitoring and indirect approaches e g sediment tracers will also be critical for spanning the gap in process

m in most areas this area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 22 3 c the mean annual precipitation is 1678 0 mm of which nearly 80 falls in the wet season from april to september and 20 in the dry season from october to march zhou et al 2011 the bedrock is sandstone and shale the soil ph is 4 4 9 and rich in litter in the surface layer according to the united states department of agriculture usda soils are divided into the ultisol group and the udult subgroup buol et al 2011 there are three successional forests in this nature reserve table 1 namely a pinus massoniana coniferous section pf about 70 years old a mixed conifer broadleaf forest cbf about 100 years old and an old growth monsoon evergreen broadleaved section mbf about 400 years old which have been the subject of long term successional studies huang et al 2011 they are located at an elevation of between 150 and 300 m above sea level zhou et al 2006 pf was planted in 1954 and has not been disturbed by humans ever since the area of pf is about 22 ha cbf was shaped by the succession of the p massoniana plantation as a result of the invasion by broad leaved tree species the sampling plots were located in the buffer zone of a reserve that has a total area of about 557 ha mbf has been well protected for more than 400 years and is mainly established in the central area of the reserve its area is about 218 ha one permanent sample plot of 100 000 m2 was established in each forest type pf 23 09 59 n 112 33 21 e cbf 23 10 25 n 112 32 54 e and mbf 23 10 08 n 112 32 22 e the distance between them was close 1 7 km fig 1 and they had similar soil parent material light temperature and precipitation conditions liu et al 2021 2 2 methods 2 2 1 environmental factors the environmental factors in this study included air temperature t precipitation pre relative humidity rh evaporation e and vapor pressure deficit vpd the data on air temperature precipitation relative humidity and evaporation were all from dinghushan forest ecosystem research station recorded from 2012 to 2018 the t and rh were recorded by a temperature sensor hmp45d vaisala company finland and a humidity sensor hmp45d vaisala company finland respectively the pre was manually observed by a rain gauge sm1 1 shanghai meteorological instrument factory co ltd china a small evaporation pan adm7 zhonghuan tianyi tianjin meteorological instrument co ltd tianjin china was used for artificial observation of the evaporation the calculation formula of vpd is 1 vpd 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 rh t represents air temperature and rh is air relative humidity 2 2 2 soil water content during the observation period the topsoil moistures 0 30 cm were measured using both neutron probe cnc503b beijing chaoneng technology co ltd china and gravimetric sampling in the three permanent forest plots nine neutron probes were installed in each plot and were used to take three to six measurements usually every 5 days at a monthly frequency in close proximity and similar layers soil samples were collected monthly with a 30 mm diameter auger to determine the gravimetric soil moisture contents the gravimetric soil moisture contents were also used to calibrate the neutron probe the calculation formula of soil volumetric water content vwc and soil water content swc mm in each soil layer of the observation profile is as follows 2 vwc m r r w c 3 swc vwc h 10 r is the neutron counting rate in the soil rw is the neutron count rate in water m and c are constants and their values are 12 272 and 1 2683 respectively h represents the thickness of the soil layer 2 2 3 standing mass and moisture of litter layer fifteen litterfall traps of 1 m2 were placed randomly in the permanent plot of each forest during the study period huang et al 2011 adjacent to these three 1 m2 areas were marked to monitor the temporal dynamics of the standing litter pool standing litter was collected monthly in each forest the dead branches and leaves in the 1 m2 plot were also collected during sampling and any mixed in soil was removed thus all of the material that remained was regarded as litter and wrapped in a transparent and airtight sealed plastic bag the fresh mass of all litter types was weighed in situ and oven dried at 80 c until a constant mass to determine their water content according to the values obtained of the fresh mass m a g and dry mass m b g of the aforementioned samples the calculation formula for the litter moisture content w l was 4 w l m a m b 100 m b 2 3 statistical analysis we calculated the descriptive statistical parameters of the data we collected including the mean the standard error and the coefficient of variation cv this procedure was carried out using excel 2016 and spss 24 0 one way analysis of variation anova was applied to compare the differences in the standing mass of the litter layer and the litter moisture content of the three forests pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between the litter moisture content in the three forests and environmental factors in order to solve the collinearity between the environmental factors we used hierarchical partitioning analyses to compare the relative contribution of different environmental variables to the variation of litter moisture content partitioning analyses were conducted with the r statistical package using the hier part package nally and walsh 2004 as long as the number of tested factors does not exceed nine hierarchical partitioning provides reliable results olea et al 2010 we used origin 2019 software to draw figures 3 results 3 1 dynamics of environmental conditions in fig 2 from 2012 to 2018 the mean annual precipitation in the study site was 2166 5 331 8 mm and ranged from 1860 8 mm to 2869 2 mm total precipitation from april to september accounted for 71 3 of the annual average with a value of 1546 7 mm resulting in the distinctive wet april to september and dry october to march seasons the annual mean t was 22 3 0 2 c the year 2015 was the hottest year with an average t of 22 6 c and the average t of 2012 was the lowest with a value of 21 9 c the average annual rh varied from 76 1 to 83 7 with a mean annual value of 79 9 2 4 the average annual e was 1065 7 55 8 mm the maximum was 1156 8 mm 2012 and the minimum was 992 8 mm 2016 total evaporation in the wet season 643 5 63 9 mm was a lot higher than that in the dry season 422 2 34 5 mm the monthly mean vpd varied between 0 34 kpa in march and 0 90 kpa in october with a mean of 0 55 0 17 kpa the minimum mean annual vpd was in 2016 with a value of 0 43 kpa and the maximum was in 2013 with a value of 0 64 kpa on the whole the precipitation was abundant and the heat input was stable within a year in this region 3 2 dynamics of standing mass of litter layer as shown in fig 3 the mean annual fresh mass was 558 2 99 1 g m 2 248 7 29 6 g m 2 and 190 9 31 3 g m 2 for pf cbf and mbf respectively and the dry mass was 324 8 59 5 g m 2 134 5 16 4 g m 2 and 97 9 19 0 g m 2 for pf cbf and mbf respectively the annual average of both the fresh mass and the dry mass of pf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of cbf and mbf the standing mass of the litter layer decreased gradually with the vegetation restoration on the monthly scale the cv was 20 6 6 5 and 4 8 for pf cbf and mbf above fresh mass respectively and was 10 6 8 4 and 5 4 for pf cbf and mbf above dry mass respectively this suggested that the variation of the standing mass of the litter layer was more stable in the later successional forest than in the earlier one on the seasonal scale the average standing mass of the litter layer in pf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in cbf and mbf in both the fresh mass and the dry mass measurements regardless of whether the measurement was of the dry season or the wet season in the dry season the cv was 43 7 36 4 and 41 9 for pf cbf and mbf above fresh mass and was 30 7 30 2 and 31 4 for pf cbf and mbf above dry mass respectively in the wet season the cv was 30 9 28 9 and 30 0 for pf cbf and mbf above the fresh mass and was 28 1 22 9 and 30 9 for pf cbf and mbf above the dry mass respectively the cv of the standing mass of the litter in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season suggesting that the variation of the standing mass of the litter layer in the wet season was more stable than that in the dry season 3 3 dynamics of the litter moisture content on the annual scale the mean litter moisture content was 100 5 15 7 87 9 11 3 and 72 0 7 3 for mbf cbf and pf respectively the variation of mbf was from 85 2 to 131 7 cbf s was from 74 7 to 105 2 and pf s was from 62 8 to 82 1 the mean annual litter moisture content of mbf was distinctively higher p 0 001 than that of cbf and pf the litter moisture content increased gradually alongside the vegetation restoration the cv of annual litter moisture content was 15 6 12 8 and 10 1 for mbf cbf and pf respectively fig 4 on the inner annual scale the mean monthly litter moisture content of mbf varied from 53 4 to 141 1 the minimum was recorded in february the mean monthly litter moisture content of cbf varied from 42 0 february to 120 4 august while that of the pf varied from 38 8 october to 99 8 june the mean monthly litter moisture content of mbf was significantly higher than that of pf p 0 05 and slightly higher than that of cbf fig 5 on the seasonal scale as shown in fig 6 a it was as expected that the precipitation in the wet season was significantly higher than in the dry season fig 6 b showed that the progression of topsoil 0 30 cm water content in the three forests was mbf cbf pf both in the wet season and in the dry season and its value in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season p 0 01 the cv was 4 9 11 2 and 11 7 for mbf cbf and pf respectively in the wet season and was 10 0 16 4 and 21 2 for mbf cbf and pf respectively in the dry season in addition the progression of the standing mass of the litter layer was pf cbf mbf during both the wet and dry seasons fig 6c fig 6 d showed that the average litter moisture content in mbf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in pf during both the dry seasons and the wet seasons the cv of the litter moisture content in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season for all the three forests indicating that the variation of the forest litter moisture content was more stable in the latter than in the former moreover compared to the soil water content of the same period the cv of the litter moisture content during the dry and wet seasons was significantly higher than the topsoil water content this showed that the litter layer was more sensitive than the topsoil layer to changes in external environmental factors 3 4 the effects of environmental variables on the litter moisture content in the dry season both rh and swc had a substantial positive effect on the litter moisture content in the three forests p 0 01 while e had a significant negative effect as well as the vpd p 0 05 a positive effect was observed between pre and the litter water content in the three forests during dry seasons however t had no significant effect on the three forests p 0 05 fig 7 in the wet season the litter moisture content in the three forests was positively influenced by rh and swc also had a significant positive effect vpd had a significant negative effect on pf cbf and mbf respectively however both t and pre had no significant effect on the three forests p 0 05 this indicated that the litter moisture content of the three forest types was not sensitive to t and pre in the wet season fig 8 the results of the hierarchical partitioning analyses between environmental factors and the litter moisture content were shown in fig 9 swc contributed the most to the variation of litter moisture content in the dry season swc could explain 56 0 65 8 and 64 6 of the variation for pf cbf and mbf respectively in the wet season swc could explain 40 4 57 4 and 30 0 of the variation for pf cbf and mbf respectively 4 discussion 4 1 changes in standing mass of the litter layer during vegetation restoration the standing mass of the litter layer mainly depends on the litter production decomposition rate and accumulation over time jonathan et al 2016 it is also affected by climate with temperature and humidity playing the most prominent role wen and he 2016 some studies have shown that the standing mass of the litter layer would increase with the occurrence of succession liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 while other studies showed that the standing mass of the litter layer would decrease with the occurrence of succession ma et al 2014 liu et al 2013 the results of this study showed that the standing mass amount of the litter layer gradually decreased with the occurrence of succession in the three forests this is consistent with the results of huang et al 2013 thus leading us to conclude that the effect of succession on the standing mass of the litter layer is strongly related to the climatic and soil conditions of the forest in question as the progression of vegetation restoration continues the plant species become more and more abundant and the structure of the canopy becomes more and more complex the ability to inhibit water evaporation is also gradually enhanced the soil water in mbf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in cbf and pf liu et al 2021 this might be conducive to the formation of a humid and warm environment suitable for the survival of soil microorganisms as well as improving their activity and leading to a higher rate of litter layer decomposition wang et al 2018 compared to the pf in the early succession the decomposition rate of mbf in the late succession period was faster and the litter layer accumulation was less which resulted in a decreasing trend of the standing mass of the litter layer with succession 4 2 changes in the litter moisture content during vegetation restoration litter moisture content is one of the environmental characteristics of forests which is restricted by climatic conditions viney 1991 the higher the litter moisture content is the better the hydrothermal conditions are in an area yan et al 2001 pointed out that the litter moisture content in mbf was the highest among the three forests as was shown in this study the litter moisture content increased gradually with succession this agrees with the conclusion by yan et al 2001 generally it is believed that the shape of the needle was round and slender larger than the leaf area so that it has a strong water holding capacity liu et al 2013 pointed that the pf had a high water holding capacity compared with cbf and mbf however because of the plant species richness complex canopy structure and the large leaf area of mbf the air relative humidity and soil water content in the forest were kept at a high level which better inhibited water evaporation therefore the litter moisture content in mbf was the highest among the three forests on the seasonal scale the variation pattern of the litter moisture content was the same as the topsoil water both of them were higher in the wet season than in the dry season and the progression was mbf cbf pf both in the dry season and in the wet season the cv of the litter moisture content of the three studied forests in the dry season was higher than in the wet season indicating that the change of the litter moisture content was more stable in the wet season than in the dry season this might be due to the more stable environment in the wet season because of the complex climate of the study region li et al 2021 in addition further analysis showed that the cv of the litter moisture content was significantly higher than the cv of the soil water on the monthly seasonal and annually scales which indicated that the litter layer was more sensitive to the change in external environmental factors than the soil layer under the condition of large fluctuation of precipitation 4 3 relationship between environmental factors and litter moisture content the litter moisture content was strongly affected by environmental factors generally research has found that precipitation increases litter moisture content walsh and voigt 1977 however the relationship between pre and the litter layer in pf during the dry season was not significant this might be because the pf litter layer contained a high lipid amount wei et al 2012 which is unfavorable for the holding of water in the dry season the insignificant relationship between pre and the litter layer in the three forests in the wet season was likely because the litter layer was in a relatively saturated state in this season in humid subtropical china t and rh were important factors affecting the litter moisture content and have been found to affect each other as well jim√©nez pinilla et al 2016 nyman et al 2015 an increase in rh has been recorded to inhibit the evaporation of water in the litter layer thus the litter moisture content would increase with an increase in rh zhao et al 2021 this was consistent with the results of our study the results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between vpd and the litter moisture content in the three forest types both in the dry season and in the wet season the vpd mainly affects the litter moisture content by affecting rh williams et al 2015 e caused water to escape from the plant stems and leaves thus the litter moisture content decreased with an increase in evaporation similar to the findings of other researchers zhang et al 2011 soil moisture can play a replenishment role in the litter moisture content as the litter moisture was more sensitive to the change in the external environment agreeing with other pieces of research in the field chuvieco et al 2004 schaap and bouten 1997 zhao et al 2021 the results showed that swc had a substantial positive impact on the litter moisture content both in the dry and wet seasons the result of hierarchical partitioning analyses showed that swc was the main driver of the litter moisture content and similar results have been reported in previous studies zhao et al 2021 5 conclusion on the whole through long term observations of the litter moisture content and external environmental factors it was found that in the dinghushan area which has a wet and warm climate as vegetation restoration progresses the standing mass of the litter layer in the three forests showed a trend of decrease and the litter moisture content in the three forests showed an increasing trend the litter moisture content in mbf was significantly higher than that in cbf and pf compared to the soil layer the litter layer was more easily affected by external environmental factors further analysis showed that soil water content was the most significant factor affecting the litter moisture content both in the dry season and the wet season the results of the present study indicated that the water retention capacity of the forest had improved dramatically as vegetation restoration progressed in humid subtropical china credit authorship contribution statement xiaodong

m in most areas this area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 22 3 c the mean annual precipitation is 1678 0 mm of which nearly 80 falls in the wet season from april to september and 20 in the dry season from october to march zhou et al 2011 the bedrock is sandstone and shale the soil ph is 4 4 9 and rich in litter in the surface layer according to the united states department of agriculture usda soils are divided into the ultisol group and the udult subgroup buol et al 2011 there are three successional forests in this nature reserve table 1 namely a pinus massoniana coniferous section pf about 70 years old a mixed conifer broadleaf forest cbf about 100 years old and an old growth monsoon evergreen broadleaved section mbf about 400 years old which have been the subject of long term successional studies huang et al 2011 they are located at an elevation of between 150 and 300 m above sea level zhou et al 2006 pf was planted in 1954 and has not been disturbed by humans ever since the area of pf is about 22 ha cbf was shaped by the succession of the p massoniana plantation as a result of the invasion by broad leaved tree species the sampling plots were located in the buffer zone of a reserve that has a total area of about 557 ha mbf has been well protected for more than 400 years and is mainly established in the central area of the reserve its area is about 218 ha one permanent sample plot of 100 000 m2 was established in each forest type pf 23 09 59 n 112 33 21 e cbf 23 10 25 n 112 32 54 e and mbf 23 10 08 n 112 32 22 e the distance between them was close 1 7 km fig 1 and they had similar soil parent material light temperature and precipitation conditions liu et al 2021 2 2 methods 2 2 1 environmental factors the environmental factors in this study included air temperature t precipitation pre relative humidity rh evaporation e and vapor pressure deficit vpd the data on air temperature precipitation relative humidity and evaporation were all from dinghushan forest ecosystem research station recorded from 2012 to 2018 the t and rh were recorded by a temperature sensor hmp45d vaisala company finland and a humidity sensor hmp45d vaisala company finland respectively the pre was manually observed by a rain gauge sm1 1 shanghai meteorological instrument factory co ltd china a small evaporation pan adm7 zhonghuan tianyi tianjin meteorological instrument co ltd tianjin china was used for artificial observation of the evaporation the calculation formula of vpd is 1 vpd 0 611 e 17 502 t t 240 97 1 rh t represents air temperature and rh is air relative humidity 2 2 2 soil water content during the observation period the topsoil moistures 0 30 cm were measured using both neutron probe cnc503b beijing chaoneng technology co ltd china and gravimetric sampling in the three permanent forest plots nine neutron probes were installed in each plot and were used to take three to six measurements usually every 5 days at a monthly frequency in close proximity and similar layers soil samples were collected monthly with a 30 mm diameter auger to determine the gravimetric soil moisture contents the gravimetric soil moisture contents were also used to calibrate the neutron probe the calculation formula of soil volumetric water content vwc and soil water content swc mm in each soil layer of the observation profile is as follows 2 vwc m r r w c 3 swc vwc h 10 r is the neutron counting rate in the soil rw is the neutron count rate in water m and c are constants and their values are 12 272 and 1 2683 respectively h represents the thickness of the soil layer 2 2 3 standing mass and moisture of litter layer fifteen litterfall traps of 1 m2 were placed randomly in the permanent plot of each forest during the study period huang et al 2011 adjacent to these three 1 m2 areas were marked to monitor the temporal dynamics of the standing litter pool standing litter was collected monthly in each forest the dead branches and leaves in the 1 m2 plot were also collected during sampling and any mixed in soil was removed thus all of the material that remained was regarded as litter and wrapped in a transparent and airtight sealed plastic bag the fresh mass of all litter types was weighed in situ and oven dried at 80 c until a constant mass to determine their water content according to the values obtained of the fresh mass m a g and dry mass m b g of the aforementioned samples the calculation formula for the litter moisture content w l was 4 w l m a m b 100 m b 2 3 statistical analysis we calculated the descriptive statistical parameters of the data we collected including the mean the standard error and the coefficient of variation cv this procedure was carried out using excel 2016 and spss 24 0 one way analysis of variation anova was applied to compare the differences in the standing mass of the litter layer and the litter moisture content of the three forests pearson s correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships between the litter moisture content in the three forests and environmental factors in order to solve the collinearity between the environmental factors we used hierarchical partitioning analyses to compare the relative contribution of different environmental variables to the variation of litter moisture content partitioning analyses were conducted with the r statistical package using the hier part package nally and walsh 2004 as long as the number of tested factors does not exceed nine hierarchical partitioning provides reliable results olea et al 2010 we used origin 2019 software to draw figures 3 results 3 1 dynamics of environmental conditions in fig 2 from 2012 to 2018 the mean annual precipitation in the study site was 2166 5 331 8 mm and ranged from 1860 8 mm to 2869 2 mm total precipitation from april to september accounted for 71 3 of the annual average with a value of 1546 7 mm resulting in the distinctive wet april to september and dry october to march seasons the annual mean t was 22 3 0 2 c the year 2015 was the hottest year with an average t of 22 6 c and the average t of 2012 was the lowest with a value of 21 9 c the average annual rh varied from 76 1 to 83 7 with a mean annual value of 79 9 2 4 the average annual e was 1065 7 55 8 mm the maximum was 1156 8 mm 2012 and the minimum was 992 8 mm 2016 total evaporation in the wet season 643 5 63 9 mm was a lot higher than that in the dry season 422 2 34 5 mm the monthly mean vpd varied between 0 34 kpa in march and 0 90 kpa in october with a mean of 0 55 0 17 kpa the minimum mean annual vpd was in 2016 with a value of 0 43 kpa and the maximum was in 2013 with a value of 0 64 kpa on the whole the precipitation was abundant and the heat input was stable within a year in this region 3 2 dynamics of standing mass of litter layer as shown in fig 3 the mean annual fresh mass was 558 2 99 1 g m 2 248 7 29 6 g m 2 and 190 9 31 3 g m 2 for pf cbf and mbf respectively and the dry mass was 324 8 59 5 g m 2 134 5 16 4 g m 2 and 97 9 19 0 g m 2 for pf cbf and mbf respectively the annual average of both the fresh mass and the dry mass of pf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of cbf and mbf the standing mass of the litter layer decreased gradually with the vegetation restoration on the monthly scale the cv was 20 6 6 5 and 4 8 for pf cbf and mbf above fresh mass respectively and was 10 6 8 4 and 5 4 for pf cbf and mbf above dry mass respectively this suggested that the variation of the standing mass of the litter layer was more stable in the later successional forest than in the earlier one on the seasonal scale the average standing mass of the litter layer in pf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in cbf and mbf in both the fresh mass and the dry mass measurements regardless of whether the measurement was of the dry season or the wet season in the dry season the cv was 43 7 36 4 and 41 9 for pf cbf and mbf above fresh mass and was 30 7 30 2 and 31 4 for pf cbf and mbf above dry mass respectively in the wet season the cv was 30 9 28 9 and 30 0 for pf cbf and mbf above the fresh mass and was 28 1 22 9 and 30 9 for pf cbf and mbf above the dry mass respectively the cv of the standing mass of the litter in the dry season was lower than that in the wet season suggesting that the variation of the standing mass of the litter layer in the wet season was more stable than that in the dry season 3 3 dynamics of the litter moisture content on the annual scale the mean litter moisture content was 100 5 15 7 87 9 11 3 and 72 0 7 3 for mbf cbf and pf respectively the variation of mbf was from 85 2 to 131 7 cbf s was from 74 7 to 105 2 and pf s was from 62 8 to 82 1 the mean annual litter moisture content of mbf was distinctively higher p 0 001 than that of cbf and pf the litter moisture content increased gradually alongside the vegetation restoration the cv of annual litter moisture content was 15 6 12 8 and 10 1 for mbf cbf and pf respectively fig 4 on the inner annual scale the mean monthly litter moisture content of mbf varied from 53 4 to 141 1 the minimum was recorded in february the mean monthly litter moisture content of cbf varied from 42 0 february to 120 4 august while that of the pf varied from 38 8 october to 99 8 june the mean monthly litter moisture content of mbf was significantly higher than that of pf p 0 05 and slightly higher than that of cbf fig 5 on the seasonal scale as shown in fig 6 a it was as expected that the precipitation in the wet season was significantly higher than in the dry season fig 6 b showed that the progression of topsoil 0 30 cm water content in the three forests was mbf cbf pf both in the wet season and in the dry season and its value in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season p 0 01 the cv was 4 9 11 2 and 11 7 for mbf cbf and pf respectively in the wet season and was 10 0 16 4 and 21 2 for mbf cbf and pf respectively in the dry season in addition the progression of the standing mass of the litter layer was pf cbf mbf during both the wet and dry seasons fig 6c fig 6 d showed that the average litter moisture content in mbf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in pf during both the dry seasons and the wet seasons the cv of the litter moisture content in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season for all the three forests indicating that the variation of the forest litter moisture content was more stable in the latter than in the former moreover compared to the soil water content of the same period the cv of the litter moisture content during the dry and wet seasons was significantly higher than the topsoil water content this showed that the litter layer was more sensitive than the topsoil layer to changes in external environmental factors 3 4 the effects of environmental variables on the litter moisture content in the dry season both rh and swc had a substantial positive effect on the litter moisture content in the three forests p 0 01 while e had a significant negative effect as well as the vpd p 0 05 a positive effect was observed between pre and the litter water content in the three forests during dry seasons however t had no significant effect on the three forests p 0 05 fig 7 in the wet season the litter moisture content in the three forests was positively influenced by rh and swc also had a significant positive effect vpd had a significant negative effect on pf cbf and mbf respectively however both t and pre had no significant effect on the three forests p 0 05 this indicated that the litter moisture content of the three forest types was not sensitive to t and pre in the wet season fig 8 the results of the hierarchical partitioning analyses between environmental factors and the litter moisture content were shown in fig 9 swc contributed the most to the variation of litter moisture content in the dry season swc could explain 56 0 65 8 and 64 6 of the variation for pf cbf and mbf respectively in the wet season swc could explain 40 4 57 4 and 30 0 of the variation for pf cbf and mbf respectively 4 discussion 4 1 changes in standing mass of the litter layer during vegetation restoration the standing mass of the litter layer mainly depends on the litter production decomposition rate and accumulation over time jonathan et al 2016 it is also affected by climate with temperature and humidity playing the most prominent role wen and he 2016 some studies have shown that the standing mass of the litter layer would increase with the occurrence of succession liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 while other studies showed that the standing mass of the litter layer would decrease with the occurrence of succession ma et al 2014 liu et al 2013 the results of this study showed that the standing mass amount of the litter layer gradually decreased with the occurrence of succession in the three forests this is consistent with the results of huang et al 2013 thus leading us to conclude that the effect of succession on the standing mass of the litter layer is strongly related to the climatic and soil conditions of the forest in question as the progression of vegetation restoration continues the plant species become more and more abundant and the structure of the canopy becomes more and more complex the ability to inhibit water evaporation is also gradually enhanced the soil water in mbf was significantly higher p 0 001 than that in cbf and pf liu et al 2021 this might be conducive to the formation of a humid and warm environment suitable for the survival of soil microorganisms as well as improving their activity and leading to a higher rate of litter layer decomposition wang et al 2018 compared to the pf in the early succession the decomposition rate of mbf in the late succession period was faster and the litter layer accumulation was less which resulted in a decreasing trend of the standing mass of the litter layer with succession 4 2 changes in the litter moisture content during vegetation restoration litter moisture content is one of the environmental characteristics of forests which is restricted by climatic conditions viney 1991 the higher the litter moisture content is the better the hydrothermal conditions are in an area yan et al 2001 pointed out that the litter moisture content in mbf was the highest among the three forests as was shown in this study the litter moisture content increased gradually with succession this agrees with the conclusion by yan et al 2001 generally it is believed that the shape of the needle was round and slender larger than the leaf area so that it has a strong water holding capacity liu et al 2013 pointed that the pf had a high water holding capacity compared with cbf and mbf however because of the plant species richness complex canopy structure and the large leaf area of mbf the air relative humidity and soil water content in the forest were kept at a high level which better inhibited water evaporation therefore the litter moisture content in mbf was the highest among the three forests on the seasonal scale the variation pattern of the litter moisture content was the same as the topsoil water both of them were higher in the wet season than in the dry season and the progression was mbf cbf pf both in the dry season and in the wet season the cv of the litter moisture content of the three studied forests in the dry season was higher than in the wet season indicating that the change of the litter moisture content was more stable in the wet season than in the dry season this might be due to the more stable environment in the wet season because of the complex climate of the study region li et al 2021 in addition further analysis showed that the cv of the litter moisture content was significantly higher than the cv of the soil water on the monthly seasonal and annually scales which indicated that the litter layer was more sensitive to the change in external environmental factors than the soil layer under the condition of large fluctuation of precipitation 4 3 relationship between environmental factors and litter moisture content the litter moisture content was strongly affected by environmental factors generally research has found that precipitation increases litter moisture content walsh and voigt 1977 however the relationship between pre and the litter layer in pf during the dry season was not significant this might be because the pf litter layer contained a high lipid amount wei et al 2012 which is unfavorable for the holding of water in the dry season the insignificant relationship between pre and the litter layer in the three forests in the wet season was likely because the litter layer was in a relatively saturated state in this season in humid subtropical china t and rh were important factors affecting the litter moisture content and have been found to affect each other as well jim√©nez pinilla et al 2016 nyman et al 2015 an increase in rh has been recorded to inhibit the evaporation of water in the litter layer thus the litter moisture content would increase with an increase in rh zhao et al 2021 this was consistent with the results of our study the results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between vpd and the litter moisture content in the three forest types both in the dry season and in the wet season the vpd mainly affects the litter moisture content by affecting rh williams et al 2015 e caused water to escape from the plant stems and leaves thus the litter moisture content decreased with an increase in evaporation similar to the findings of other researchers zhang et al 2011 soil moisture can play a replenishment role in the litter moisture content as the litter moisture was more sensitive to the change in the external environment agreeing with other pieces of research in the field chuvieco et al 2004 schaap and bouten 1997 zhao et al 2021 the results showed that swc had a substantial positive impact on the litter moisture content both in the dry and wet seasons the result of hierarchical partitioning analyses showed that swc was the main driver of the litter moisture content and similar results have been reported in previous studies zhao et al 2021 5 conclusion on the whole through long term observations of the litter moisture content and external environmental factors it was found that in the dinghushan area which has a wet and warm climate as vegetation restoration progresses the standing mass of the litter layer in the three forests showed a trend of decrease and the litter moisture content in the three forests showed an increasing trend the litter moisture content in mbf was significantly higher than that in cbf and pf compared to the soil layer the litter layer was more easily affected by external environmental factors further analysis showed that soil water content was the most significant factor affecting the litter moisture content both in the dry season and the wet season the results of the present study indicated that the water retention capacity of the forest had improved dramatically as vegetation restoration progressed in humid subtropical china credit authorship contribution statement xiaodong

7989,study region the huaihe river basin is located in china s north south climate transition belt where massive droughts occurred in history study focus to comprehensively capture how climate extremes have behaved in the past this paper analyzed the trend change point and periodicity of drought at multiple spatial temporal scales based on the standardized precipitation indexes spi and the historical simulation experiments of 9 cmip6 models were evaluated against observations for further exploring the behavior of climate extremes in future periods new hydrological insights for the region the period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years while the period of spi 3 is at the time scale of 1 3 years indicating potential teleconnections with large scale climate events moreover miroc6 and cesm2 models exhibited better performance in simulating precipitation than individual models and multi model ensemble mean the uncertainties of the model ensemble mean of 3 selected models in depicting droughts have a good consistency with the observations the projection experiments of cmip6 derived from the selected historical simulation models can be used to predict drought in the near future and the far future under different scenarios over the huaihe river basin keywords spi mann kendall test continuous wavelet transform meteorological drought cmip6 the huaihe river basin 1 introduction china located at the intersection of many kinds of monsoons kripalani et al 2007 wang et al 2021a 2022 is one of the countries that suffered from the frequent occurrence of droughts in the world chen et al 2019 han et al 2021 li et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the complex terrain conditions within the vast territory and the randomness of the interannual monsoons promoted the uneven distribution of water and heat besides both permanent arid climate areas such as areas in northwest china and seasonal drought areas are presented in china studies have exhibited that the summer monsoon rainfall indicates a declining trend over north china 105 e 125 e 35 n 45 n whereas in south china over the yangtze river valley 105 e 125 e 25 n 35 n the monsoon rainfall has shown an increasing trend during recent decades gong and ho 2002 preethi et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b the huaihe river is located in the north south climate transition belt in china lu and zhu wang et al 2021a whose basin borders the yangtze river in the south and the yellow river in the north the local climate is influenced by warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate in the north and subtropical semi humid monsoon climate in the south the special geographical and climate conditions topographic heterogeneity the intricate river system and the influence of human activities have caused frequent droughts in the basin threatening the lives and property of the people as well as the socio economic development in the region cheng et al 2021 wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 xie 2013 zhang et al 2015 in history there have been massive drought events since the beginning of the 19th century including extreme droughts that occurred in 1924 and 1942 wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 in the worst case about three million people died because of drought related issues there were 16 significant meteorological drought years in the huaihe river basin over the last six decades i e 1961 1962

extreme drought have been noted based on records the recently released international panel on climate change s sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 ipcc 2021 pointed out that global climate change may further aggravate natural disasters in the next decades such as droughts and floods and will cause an ever expanding impact on socio economic development and ecosystem sustainability all over the world as one of the major commodity grain bases in china the huaihe river basin accounts for one sixth of the total production with about 11 cropland over china besides about 13 6 of the country s population lives in the huaihe river basin with less than 3 of the country s total water resources dong et al 2021 it is of great importance to comprehensively capture the characteristics of meteorological drought evolution and assess the performance of the general circulation model gcms in simulating precipitation and other concerning variables which might be valuable to project the extreme events in the huaihe river basin this is what was done in this study exploring the evolution of drought in the past is the precondition to figure out its relationship with climate change and what might happen in the future in recent years considerable studies have been conducted on the topics of the drought evolution in the huaihe river basin the existing studies primarily focus on three aspects i e the adaptability of different drought indicators cai 2013 xie 2013 yuan 2004 drought centers and drought trend in the basin huang 2014 xie 2013 and the drought forecast with reanalysis or gcm products ji et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2020 wang w et al evaluated the revised palmer drought severity index pdsi in the huaihe river basin and verified its application in drought monitoring and early warning systems wang 2012 xie w s analyzed the adaptability of composite index ci in the huaihe river basin which took standardized precipitation index spi and relative humidity into account the study also revealed that the annual total drought days were distributed along the latitude direction indicating that the north part of the basin suffered more drought days than the south part xie 2013 adopting spi as the drought indicator yao r et al extracted the shift trajectory of the drought center in the huaihe river basin for the period 1962 2016 and found that the drought center mainly diffused from the center of the river basin to the surrounding areas yao 2021 wen z et al took spi and standardized streamflow index ssi as drought indicator and adopted the mann kendall test to explore the temporal variation characteristics of regional meteorological and hydrological drought it was found that droughts in autumn and winter were more frequent than in summer wen 2021 over the huaihe river basin although much progress has been made in understanding the characteristics of drought variation in the huaihe river basin there are still some limitations previous studies usually analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of drought by selecting typical sites and focusing on one feature or adopting the regional averaged variables calculated by thiessen polygon or arithmetic the evolution of drought over the entire basin based on more than one feature is rarely studied there is a need to explore the spatiotemporal variation of the drought by analyzing every site in the huaihe river basin through multiple aspects of features this will help us to have a more comprehensive and specific understanding of the drought situation in this basin which is one of the most important tasks to understand the past extreme climate performance on the other hand gcms have been widely used to simulate future climate conditions under different scenarios almazroui et al 2021a kripalani et al 2006 preethi et al 2017 the coupled model intercomparison project cmip organized under the auspices of the world climate research programme s wcrp working group on coupled modelling wgcm started 20 years before as a comparison of a handful of early global coupled climate models which has evolved over five phases into a major international multi model research activity eyring et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 much work has been done to assess the future climate change based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and cmip6 almazroui et al 2021a almazroui and krakauer 2020 dosio et al 2021 nashwan and shahid 2022 song et al 2021 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhu et al 2021 focusing on different aspects of climate variability it has been proved that the simulation of average climate states is improved in cmip6 climate models compared to cmip5 dosio et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 zhang j y et al evaluated the performance of cmip6 multi model on the tibetan plateau and explored the spatiotemporal evolution of precipitation average temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the near future and the far future under shared socioeconomic pathways ssp1 2 6 low concentration scenario ssp2 4 5 medium concentration scenario ssp3 7 0 medium to high concentration scenario and ssp5 8 5 high concentration scenario it was found that the precipitation tends to increase and the temperature exhibits a rising trend in the future zhang 2011 jiang t et al analyzed the evolution of annual temperature and precipitation for the period 2021 2100 in the huaihe river basin based on five models of cmip6 the results showed that the increasing precipitation mainly covered the middle part of the basin and the temperature would rise faster and the precipitation would increase more in the future compared with cmip5 simulation results jiang et al 2020 nashwan et al evaluated the performance of 29 cmip6 models over egypt in simulating precipitation and found that there would be an intensification in hydrological hazard under ssp1 1 9 and ssp1 2 6 scenarios which represent 1 5 and 2 0 c warming at the end of the present century respectively nashwan and shahid 2022 except for the projected change in different meteorological factors over different regions the performance of cmip6 models in simulating historical conditions and how to get the most out of the cmip6 model outputs also need attention almazroui et al assessed the performance of a large ensemble of cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and temperature over south america and concluded that the cmip6 models successfully captured the main climate characteristics across south america however increasingly heavy tailed precipitation distribution and a rightward shifted temperature distribution were also noted almazroui et al 2021a and similar research has also been conducted in africa and special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex regions almazroui et al 2021b 2020 yue y l et al studied the projected changes in precipitation and temperature over the yangtze river basin based on 23 cmip6 models and found that the biases in cmip6 models could be effectively corrected by empirical quantile mapping eqm and the multi model ensemble mme performed better than individual models for each climatic variable yue et al 2021 above all the realistic representation of the complex climate characteristics of a specific region remains a challenge consequently regional gcm evaluation is needed to fully understand the potential bias of cmip6 simulations in a specific region further to select better performance models to improve the accuracy of projected changes and it is another important task before we explore the behavior of climate extremes in the future periods therefore the main objectives of this paper are a to evaluate the application of spi in the huaihe river basin based on multi scale spi b to extract the statistical characteristics of trend change point and periodicity of meteorological drought at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin during 1956 2020 c to explore the relationship between drought indicators and other meteorological variables over the basin d to assess the performance of several cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and drought in the huaihe river basin and discuss the application of cmip6 for future projections 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin hrb a natural dividing line between north and south china is located between the yangtze river and the yellow river and stretches from 111 55 e 121 20 e and 30 55 n 36 20 n covering 270 000 km2 fig 1 the west southwest and northeast of the huaihe river basin are mountainous and hilly areas while the rest are vast plains with an elevation ranging from 2 to 2200 m the south of the huaihe river basin lies in the north subtropical zone with an annual average temperature of 11 16 whereas the north of the basin is usually affected by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate the basin is characterized by hot and rainy summer and cold and dry winter in general the temperature increases from north to south and from coast to inland while the annual precipitation varies from south to north and from mountainous to plain which are greatly affected by the topographic heterogeneity the mainstream of huaihe flows through henan province anhui province shandong province and jiangsu province finally into the yangtze river and the yellow sea considering its impact on the regional climate natural resources and socio economy this paper took the four provinces as the study region based on the administrative division dong et al 2021 2 2 data the monthly observed precipitation was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma gov cn to calculate the standardized precipitation index section 3 1 and further applied to analyze the drought evolution characteristics in the huaihe river basin besides monthly maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration records are also available from the website which was used to discuss their relationship with drought as described in the user s guide all the available data on the website have been ensured with high quality control after extreme value check and homogeneity test along with manual spot check in this paper the 209 meteorological observation stations are spread over and near the huaihe river basin as shown in fig 2 of which 73 stations are in the river basin some stations with missing values from january 1956 to december 2020 are presented in table 1 the missing values of sanmenxia and chaohu stations were supplemented by the multi year average value of the corresponding month to get a full sequence from 1956 to 2020 of which the missing part is less than one year and the observation data of the other stations were analyzed at their own record time span to ensure the consistency of the data and the reliability of analysis ben gal 2005 padulano and giuseppe 2020 besides all the data used in this study were tested for the autocorrelation coefficient using the two tailed test it was found that significant serial correlations were present in the time series data 1956 2020 of each station and the pre whitening approach bronaugh and werner 2013 yue et al 2002 was adopted to remove serial correlation to prepare stationary data for drought index calculation and characteristics analysis in this study 5 cmip6 endorsed mips from all the 21 mips were selected all of which have got lots of attention and are closely associated with the drought evolution in the huaihe river basin they are coupled climate carbon cycle model intercomparison project c4mip jones et al 2016 cloud feedback model intercomparison project cfmip webb et al 2017 global monsoons model intercomparison

with deck to be independent of the forcing the cmip6 historical simulations serve as an important benchmark for assessing model performance through evaluation against observations the historical simulations are forced by time dependent observations eyring et al 2016 here the cmip6 historical simulation experiments from 9 models offered by 5 research communities were assessed for their performance in simulating precipitation and drought over the huaihe river basin for the period 1956 2020 the outputs from cmip6 historical simulations experiment historical are available through https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the brief information of each model was listed in table 2 the precipitation of all the models was remapped to the observation stations by using bilinear interpolation to reserve the realistic characteristics of observation as much as possible the seasonal mean of spring summer autumn and winter was defined as the average of march april may june july august september october november and december january february respectively 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi is a commonly used drought indicator that represents the precipitation in a certain region within a given period using probability guttman nathaniel 1999 ma 2012 which was constructed by mckee et al when analyzing the drought degree of colorado mckee 1993 it has been proved that it is more reliable to calculate spi based on the precipitation data of continuous 30 years or more bordi et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2013 wu et al 2005 positive and negative spi values indicate wet and dry conditions separately whose severity varies with its magnitudes it can be used to evaluate regional drought conditions above the monthly scale also it is a standardized index that makes comparisons possible and reliable between different regions and various periods spi is an effective indicator to assess the meteorological drought conditions in the huaihe river basin cai 2013 mao 2012 yan 2009 in this study spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 were calculated for a 65 year span 1956 2020 at 209 meteorological observation stations across the huaihe river basin fig 2 spi 1 and spi 12 were selected to assess the short term and long term water resources shortage conditions whereas spi 3 was used to represent the seasonal drought for agriculture and spi 3 value of february was used for evaluating winter drought may for spring august for summer and november for autumn more details about the theory and calculation equations of spi are available in appendix a 1 here this paper used the spi generator offered by national drought mitigation center ndmc to calculate the spi value https drought unl edu monitoring spi spiprogram aspx the severity of floods and droughts classified based on spi was shown in table 3 guttman nathaniel 1998 1999 mao 2012 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test m k test for short is a nonparametric statistical test method initially proposed by mann and kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 quite a lot of studies aimed at testing the significance of hydrometeorological element trend have been conducted using the m k test almazroui and krakauer 2020 byakatonda et al 2018 cook et al 2004 gocic and trajkovic 2014 wang et al 2020 sequential mann kendall smk test can be used to detect the change point and estimate when a trend starts in a sequence cheng et al 2016 modarres and sarhadi 2009 rahman et al 2016 satishkumar and rathnam 2020 xiong and guo 2011 here the m k test and sen s slope estimator test were adopted to analyze the trend of the spi sequences the regional kendall test was used to test regional trends based on the spi sequences of the 73 observation stations over the huaihe river basin helsel et al 2020 moreover change points in the trend for the period 1956 2020 were detected by using the smk test when the m k test is used for trend analysis the null hypothesis h0 is that the time sequence values x 1 x 2 x n are n independent random samples with identical distribution the alternative hypothesis h1 is a two tailed test indicating that for all k j n k j the distributions of x i and x j are not the same in the two tailed test if z z 1 Œ± 2 the hypothesis h0 is not acceptable indicating that the time sequence value has a significant upward or downward trend at the confidence level Œ± positive and negative values of z indicate upward and downward trends separately see appendix a 2 for the equations for the m k test and sen s slope estimator when the smk test is applied for detecting change points two statistics sequence curves ufk and ubk and two critical value lines uŒ± and uŒ± are drawn on the same graph when ufk and ubk exceed the critical line it indicates a significant upward or downward trend and the range beyond the critical line is defined as the time span of the change if there is an intersection point with the ufk and ubk curves along with the point is between the two critical lines the time corresponding to the intersection point is the beginning time of the change i e change point see appendix a 3 for the equations of the smk test 3 3 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa is a useful approach to accomplish time frequency multi resolution analysis √∂zger et al 2020 webb et al 2017 it can identify both the time characteristics from multi frequency and the frequency characteristics from multi temporal scales the basics of wa are to approach a signal or a function with a cluster of wavelet functions which can be obtained by the stretching and shifting of a fundamental wavelet function on the time axis the continuous wavelet transformation cwt is widely used in geographic physical studies as a time series intermittent wave feature extraction tool khan et al 2021 liu 2018 and the morlet wavelet exhibits good performance in balancing the time and frequency here cwt and morlet wavelet were used to detect the periodicity of drought in the huaihe river basin for the period 1956 2020 see equations in appendix a 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of historical drought events based on the monthly precipitation of the 73 meteorological observation stations in the huaihe river basin and the 136 meteorological stations surrounding the huaihe river basin 209 meteorological stations in all spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 during 1956 2020 were calculated to analyze the characteristics of drought at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin when analyzing the characteristics at spatial scale the spis of the 209 meteorological stations were interpolated to the basin according to the kriging interpolation method to depict the realistic distribution of characteristics as much as possible and the spis of the 73 meteorological stations were adopted when the statistical analysis is conducted firstly according to the severity classification of spi in table 3 the annual drought index spi 12 of the 79 meteorological stations for the period 1956 2020 was statistically analyzed the percentage frequency of different grades of spi classification for each year over the huaihe river basin was presented in fig 3 it is obvious that drought covers 20 35 of the meteorological stations over the basin in most years while flood covers 20 40 in general the percentage frequency of different grades of spi classification in the basin from 1956 2020 is relatively stable the percentage frequency fluctuates only in specific years e g 1964 1966 1986 1988 1999 2013 and 2019 all of which are consistent with the historical records of typical drought years then two typical drought events in the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1978 were selected to further assess the application of spi as a drought indicator in the huaihe river basin the spatial distributions of spi 3 of february 1998 and may 1978 were drawn in fig 4 a and fig 4 b separately according to the records wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 from september 1998 to the first ten days of march 1999 the precipitation in the whole shandong province was only one fourth of that in the same period of previous years there was a long term drought from january 1999 to february 1999 in anhui province while severe drought occurred in most of henan province from september 1998 to march 1999 in short the lack of rainfall in most regions lasted for a long time during 1998 1999 causing continuous drought in autumn and winter of 1998 over the huaihe river basin as shown in fig 4 a the spatial distribution of spi 3 is in good agreement with the recorded data revealing that the west part of henan province and the east part of shandong province suffered severe drought in the winter of 1998 as for 1978 there was rare rainfall from march to june in shandong province with no rainfall for 80 consecutive days causing drought almost all over the province in jiangsu province the drought occurred in spring and lasted till the end of june 1979 which was an extremely severe drought year in history and there was a continuous drought in spring summer and winter in the north of anhui province which proved to be the most severe drought in nearly 200 years from the winter of 1977 to the spring of 1978 the precipitation in henan province was less than usual among which only one fifth of normal rainfall was in the north of zhumadian as shown in fig 4 b drought occurred in the entire huaihe river basin in the spring of 1978 and the spatial distribution of drought is consistent with the records in conclusion spi can capture the drought condition over the huaihe river basin precisely and reliably 4 2 spatial patterns of trends in spi for the period 1956 2020 the statistics of trends based on multi scale drought indices using mann kendall test sen s slope estimator and regional kendall test for the period 1956 2020 in the huaihe river basin were presented in table 4 as shown in fig 5 the spatial distributions of trends in spi 1 spi 12 spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn and spi 3 winter are similar roughly distributing along the latitude direction which illustrates that the drying trend is more significant in the north part of the basin than in the south part of the basin on the contrary the trend of spi 3 spring is longitudinally distributed in fig 5 c it is noticeable that shandong province and the east part of henan province are the high value areas of the drying trend in fig 5 a and fig 5 b and a wetting trend exists in the southern part of jiangsu province and the southern part of anhui province indicating that the regional drought is relieving to some extent according to spi 3 spring there is a drying trend in the east part of henan province meaning that the spring drought in the upper reaches of the basin is aggravating in the recent 65 years besides the spi 3 summer trend varies gradually from south to north exhibiting a wetting trend in the south while drying in the north spi 3 autumn shows a drying trend in most areas of the huaihe river basin and the drying trend is most significant in the northeastern part of shandong province with the maximum value of 0 057 10a spi 3 winter represents a wetting trend in the north part of jiangsu province indicating that the winter drought in this region will possibly be relieved if following this trend generally the drying trend in the north part of the huaihe river basin is more significant than that in the southern part during summer and winter while the drying trend in the eastern part is more significant than that in the western part of the basin during spring it was illustrated that each season s drought in the east part of the basin shows an aggravating trend but relieves in the southeast station statistics of trends based on spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 were presented in fig 6 it can be concluded that all the 73 meteorological stations in the basin show either a wetting trend or a drying trend at each scale of spi while only a few sitesexhibit a significant trend spi 1 and spi 12 shared the same frequency of wetting trend and drying trend over the huaihe river basin while there are more sites with significant drying trends according to spi 12 overall as shown in table 4 regional drying trend was observed according to spi 3 in spring and spi 3 in autumn while spi 3 in winter indicated more sites with a wetting trend which could enrich the analysis of spatial characteristics 4 3 change point detection during 1956 2020 sequential mann kendall smk test was applied for detecting the change point in the sequence of spi 12 from 1956 to 2020 at the 73 meteorological stations over the basin the frequency of stations with change points in the basin was shown in fig 7 it is widely known that meteorological drought and other hydrological processes are always under the influence of climate phenomena and human activity cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2021b it can be observed that the change points 1963 1964 1970 1974 2002 2005 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 account for the relatively high frequency which were typical el ni√±o or la ni√±o years in history lenssen et al 2020 zong et al 2010 historically the dramatic increase of change point stations from 1970 to 1974 may be explained by the fact that there were many severe drought years in the 1960 s no drought events occurred in the early 1970 s while the typical severe drought occurred again in the late 1970 s and there were el ni√±o and la ni√±o events before and after the early 1970 s respectively which may explain the occurrence of the change point during 1970 1974 additionally there was a severe drought in 2001 and the drought relieved in the basin from 2002 to 2007 during which typical el ni√±o events occurred then extensive drought occurred at the end of the flood season in 2008 lasting to may 2009 the total rainfall for the period october 2008 to may 2009 only accounted for 30 of the multi year average precipitation for the same period in late january 2011 most areas of the basin suffered from meteorological drought up to the standard of extreme drought later drought occurred in the summer of 2013 as well as severe droughts in shandong province in 2015 that is to say the arising of the change point is roughly consistent with whether or not the drought transition occurred furthermore the change points are associated with large scale climate phenomena like el ni√±o the change point usually occurs around a typical el ni√±o or la ni√±o year the time interval of change points is usually about 1 2 years and it has been found that there were in phase relations between ni√±o3 and droughts over the huaihe river basin of which the climate indices ni√±o3 lead spring drought by 1 5 2 years fang et al 2021 it is worth studying in the future whether the occurrence of change points has linkages with climate indices and what it is schepen et al 2012 according to the historical records of typical drought years in the huaihe river basin bengbu station 58221 in anhui province xinyang station 57297 in henan province yantai station 54765 in shandong province and xuzhou station 58027 in jiangsu province were selected as representative stations to draw the smk test curves ufk ubk uŒ± and uŒ± as shown in fig 8 the ufk and ubk curves of each station basically follow the same pattern in short the drying or wetting trend is insignificant in the selected stations while their change points are concentrated on the timeline indicating that the drought evolution in these regions exhibits a good synchronization there are change points such as 1962 1974 1975 1996 2006 2007 and 2013 for the period 1956 2020 in the huaihe river basin the ufk curve of bengbu station fig 8 a showed a steady rise without possible abrupt change there is an insignificant drying trend before 2007 but an insignificant wetting trend after 2007 the long term insignificant drying trend may explain the severe droughts that occurred in 2001 and from 2008 to 2011 the situation of xinyang station fig 8 b is highly similar to that of bengbu station the ufk curve of yantai station fig 8 c fluctuates significantly and there are change points in 1963 1975 and 2014 for the period 1987 2012 uf 0 and it has passed the significance test showing that there is a significant drying trend after the 1980 s it can confirm the actual situation that the huaihe river basin suffered from a long term drought from 1991 to 1998 and yantai was hit by a historical rare drought in 2015 that is to say 2014 is a change point in yantai station during 1956 2020 which might be associated with the reform of the rural land system in 2014 in china as one of the most important agricultural production bases the land use change of shandong province keeps pace with the government policy besides the ufk curve of xuzhou station fig 8 d fluctuates around the zero scale line and the majority of them are less than zero the drying trend is not significant and there is a change point in 1972 there is an insignificant wetting trend from 1972 to 1976 and an insignificant drying trend after 1977 the long term insignificant trend may explain the severe shortage of water caused by the drought in 1978 in general all the stations showed that the significant drying trend shifts to insignificant near 1960 which might be explained by the fact that there was much government policy implementation on the development and usage of agricultural land and urban land near 1960 it has been illustrated that both the trend and the abrupt change in the meteorological series are very closely intertwined and it is very hard to distinguish between them xiong and guo 2011 how to detect the change point more accurately and effectively is a task to be considered 4 4 periodicity the cwt analysis was conducted on five basin averaged time series i e spi 3 spring spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn spi 3 winter and spi 12 to identify the periodicity of multi scale spis in the huaihe river basin during 1956 2020 the analysis results of the annual drought index spi 12 in the huaihe river basin were illustrated in fig 9 the continuous wavelet power spectrum for the time series of spi 12 revealed that the sectors with significant 0 05 confidence level are consistently distributed in the 2 12 years bands during 1956 1980 the 3 7 years bands in the period of 1976 2002 and the 1 4 years bands in the period of 1984 2005 fig 9 also illustrated the corresponding global wavelet spectrum when the wavelet spectrum is beyond the red dashed line it indicates that the corresponding period is at the 0 05 confidence level test the figure exhibited that spi 12 has significant period at the time scale of 2 7 years in other words the variation of the spi 12 in the whole 65 years is mainly dominated by the period of 2 7 years the cwt results of the seasonal drought index spi 3 in the huaihe river basin were shown in fig 10 the spring spi 3 fig 10 a showed significant wavelet power in the 0 5 2 years bands during 1962 1990 and for the period of 1996 2006 and the 4 7 years bands for the period 1997 2004 and the global wavelet spectrum revealed the significant period at the time scale of 1 2 5 years fig 10 b showed significant wavelet power peaks in the 1 3 years bands during 1986 2004 and the 0 5 3 years band in the period of 2008 2016 it is obvious that the summer spi 3 time series has significant period at the time scale of 1 3 years the autumn spi 3 exhibited 0 5 3 years bands during 1983 1990 and 0 5 4 years bands for the period 1998 2010 fig 10 c revealed the significant period of 1 3 years during 1956 2020 fig 10 d showed significant wavelet power in the 2 4 years bands during 1992 2002 1 3 years bands for the period 2008 2018 and the 1 2 years bands can be extracted nearly over the entire time domain and the period at the time scale of 1 3 5 years can be observed in the global wavelet spectrum among all the seasons the period of winter drought index is more stable during the entire time domain then the oscillation frequency tends to be higher than other seasons in the time domain which is mutually verified with the conclusion in section 4 1 that the drying trend in winter is more significant in the basin the period oscillations of summer spi 3 shared the same pattern as autumn spi 3 especially after the 1980 s that is to say continuous droughts in summer and autumn are more common in the basin with a 1 3 years period the results are consistent with the historical records above all the significant period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years which is related to large scale climate events e g enso nao and soi as has been studied before fang et al 2021 wang et al 2016 the seasonal drought tends to follow the period at the time scale of 1 3 years which is influenced by different enso events cp or ep li et al 2018 and various phases of enso positive or negative li et al 2011 nalley et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 it is noted that the significant period of spi 12 has become shorter since the 1980 s along with the same period oscillation pattern of summer spi 3 and autumn spi 3 it is worth considering whether the phenomenon is associated with the global climate shift in the late 1980 s reid et al 2016 however the above conclusions might change with time as the analyzed span is limited plenty of research still needs to be conducted to explore the potential relations between drought and climate changes in the huaihe river basin 4 5 relationship between drought characteristics and other meteorological variables run theory wu et al 2019 yevjevich 1967 was adopted to identify the starting time of drought events the corresponding drought duration d and the drought severity s here a drought event was defined as the spi 1 value lower than 0 5 including one month drought events and the two drought events were integrated into one when the time interval between them is less than 2 months in this part weifang station 54843 in shandong province was taken as an example the statistical results were shown in fig 11 for the past 65 years 53 drought events lasting more than one month occurred in weifang station among which the longest drought event is 16 months started in november 2005 followed by a 10 month drought event that started in december 1976 this analysis exhibited that drought duration and drought severity exert a mutual effect with a correlation coefficient of 0 8719 at the 0 01 significance level test despite that the exact causes for drought development are still not fully understood so far and will be further explored in detail detecting the quantitative relations between different drought characteristics may offer references for drought prediction and emergency management the spearman correlation coefficient was also used to identify the relationships between drought duration drought intensity and other meteorological factors based on the spi 1 sequence at monthly scale for the period 1956 2020 the correlation between spi 1 and monthly average air temperature average maximum air temperature relative humidity monthly sunshine percentage and sunshine duration were demonstrated in table 5 the drought duration evaluated by spi 1 in the huaihe river basin represented a significant negative correlation with the drought peak intensity meaning that the longer the drought duration is the lower the drought peak intensity is it is also noticeable that spi 1 exhibited a negative correlation with average air temperature average maximum temperature sunshine duration and sunshine percentage whereas the correlation with air temperature is weaker than that with sunshine class variables besides spi 1 is positively correlated with relative humidity and the spearman correlation coefficient is up to 0 6472 in the basin it is worthy of consideration to take relative humidity as one of the drought related factors to modify the drought indicators 4 6 the cmip6 model performance on precipitation and drought the performance of cmip6 models in simulating precipitation in the huaihe river basin was assessed by comparing the multi year average monthly precipitation of observation and simulated results for the period 1956 2020 fig 12 besides we used the taylor diagram to assess the performance of cmip6 models in reproducing the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in the huaihe river basin fig 13 numerous studies have adopted the two methods to evaluate the climate model performance ayugi et al 2021 cao et al 2021 dosio et al 2021 li et al 2021 liao et al 2021 taylor 2001 zhu et al 2021 as shown in fig 12 the precipitation was underestimated in flood season according to most models while it was overestimated in the dry season among all the models miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip showed consistent patterns with the observed data conversely the cesm2 of c4mip and cesm2 of lumip performed relatively poorly with either overestimating a lot or underestimating a lot the variation of precipitation in one year was captured by most models consequently miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip were selected as good performance models which were also evaluated according to the arithmetic mean of models along with the results of the ensemble mean of the 9 models as shown in fig 13 the taylor diagram was presented to evaluate the performance of cmip6 models in reproducing the spatial pattern of the annual precipitation the performance of individual models showed great differences in fig 13 miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip also exhibited the highest spatial correlation coefficients from 0 91 to 0 93 meanwhile the normalized standard deviation of the three models is around 0 8 and the normalized centered root mean square error is 0 6 approximately that means the three models can reasonably simulate the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in the huaihe river basin in comparison the results for the multi model mean are similar to the three models this indicated that the arithmetic mean of the 3 models outperforms most individual models as well as the arithmetic mean of the 9 models it is common knowledge that the simulation performance of climate models are affected by several sources of disturbances except for the uncertainty of climate models or physical processes to be over simplified many other causes can influence the performance assessment it should be noticed that there might be biases caused by comparing the grid scale variable of climate models to the point scale of observation station data when interpolating the cmip6 data to observation stations i e down scaling related issues degaetano and castellano 2017 padulano et al 2019 how to eliminate the scale effect and do a less uncertainty quantitative evaluation will be noteworthy research for the historical simulation results and future projections according to the evaluation results miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip exhibited good performance in depicting the annual circle of precipitation as well as the spatial pattern of annual precipitation thus the 3 models performance in simulating drought conditions in the huaihe river basin was assessed the monthly precipitation of the ensemble mean of 3 models was used to calculate spi 1 and spi 12 sequences the box and whisker plots were applied to illustrate the range of spi values over the 73 stations in the basin based on observation and simulation results fig 14 indicated that the uncertainty ranges of the ensemble mean of 3 models for spi have a good consistency with observation results however it should be noted that biases still exist in the simulation results in fig 14 b the outliers of mme more focus on the positive values which express more wet conditions it might be explained by the general overestimation of precipitation in cmip6 models li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a efforts still need to be made to further reduce the bias of simulation results besides the projection experiments of cmip6 derived from the selected historical simulation models can be used to predict drought in the near future and the far future under different scenarios and further offer references to the management of water resources in this study region except for precipitation and temperature radiation and other meteorological factors are also associated with drought closely the performance assessment of cmip models in simulating other variables can also be conducted in future studies 5 conclusions this study explored the drought characteristics at multiple spatial temporal scales and assessed the performance of cmip6 models in simulating the precipitation and drought over the huaihe river basin firstly the drought condition and major historical drought events in the huaihe river basin were investigated and the application of spi was evaluated then the statistical characteristics of drought i e trend change point and periodicity were detected finally the performance of 9 cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and drought was evaluated against observations the primary conclusions are as follows a the spatial distribution of trends in spi 1 spi 12 spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn spi 3 winter roughly distribute along the latitude direction indicating that the drying trend is more significant in the north part of the basin than in the south and the trends in spi 3 spring is longitudinally distributed with a significant drying trend in the east b the significant drying trend converted to insignificant near 1960 which was in pace with the implementation of government policies on the development and usage of agricultural land and urban land near 1960 and the drought of the entire basin has good synchronization sharing identical change points in different sites c the significant period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years indicating potential teleconnections with large scale climate events e g enso nao and soi the seasonal drought has a significant period at the time scale of 1 3 years under the influence of different enso events cp or ep and various phases of enso positive or negative d it has been revealed that the drought lasts longer and the drought severity is greater with a correlation coefficient of 0 8719 whereas there is a significant negative correlation between drought duration and drought peak intensity and it is worthy of consideration to take relative humidity as one of the drought related factors to modify drought indicators e the 9 cmip6 models showed great discrepancies in simulating precipitation among them miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip were selected as good performance models in the huaihe river basin the ensemble mean of 3 selected models exhibited better performance in simulating precipitation than individual models and the ensemble mean of 9 models besides the spi calculated by the ensemble mean of 3 models also has a good consistency with observations overall this paper systematically exhibited the characteristics of drought evolution at multi spatial temporal scale in the huaihe river basin based on spi the results presented could contribute a lot to further exploring the precipitation and drought conditions in the near and the far future over the huaihe river basin based on the projection experiments derived from the selected cmip6 models besides change points were associated with abrupt land use change and periodicity presented a relationship with large scale climate phenomena these discoveries do add value to the drought research over the huaihe river basin and similar areas however the above conclusions might change with time as the analyzed span is limited plenty of research still needs to be conducted to explore the potential relations between drought and climate changes in the huaihe river basin funding this

extremes have behaved in the past this paper analyzed the trend change point and periodicity of drought at multiple spatial temporal scales based on the standardized precipitation indexes spi and the historical simulation experiments of 9 cmip6 models were evaluated against observations for further exploring the behavior of climate extremes in future periods new hydrological insights for the region the period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years while the period of spi 3 is at the time scale of 1 3 years indicating potential teleconnections with large scale climate events moreover miroc6 and cesm2 models exhibited better performance in simulating precipitation than individual models and multi model ensemble mean the uncertainties of the model ensemble mean of 3 selected models in depicting droughts have a good consistency with the observations the projection experiments of cmip6 derived from the selected historical simulation models can be used to predict drought in the near future and the far future under different scenarios over the huaihe river basin keywords spi mann kendall test continuous wavelet transform meteorological drought cmip6 the huaihe river basin 1 introduction china located at the intersection of many kinds of monsoons kripalani et al 2007 wang et al 2021a 2022 is one of the countries that suffered from the frequent occurrence of droughts in the world chen et al 2019 han et al 2021 li et al 2020 yan et al 2021 the complex terrain conditions within the vast territory and the randomness of the interannual monsoons promoted the uneven distribution of water and heat besides both permanent arid climate areas such as areas in northwest china and seasonal drought areas are presented in china studies have exhibited that the summer monsoon rainfall indicates a declining trend over north china 105 e 125 e 35 n 45 n whereas in south china over the yangtze river valley 105 e 125 e 25 n 35 n the monsoon rainfall has shown an increasing trend during recent decades gong and ho 2002 preethi et al 2017 zhang et al 2021b the huaihe river is located in the north south climate transition belt in china lu and zhu wang et al 2021a whose basin borders the yangtze river in the south and the yellow river in the north the local climate is influenced by warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate in the north and subtropical semi humid monsoon climate in the south the special geographical and climate conditions topographic heterogeneity the intricate river system and the influence of human activities have caused frequent droughts in the basin threatening the lives and property of the people as well as the socio economic development in the region cheng et al 2021 wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 xie 2013 zhang et al 2015 in history there have been massive drought events since the beginning of the 19th century including extreme droughts that occurred in 1924 and 1942 wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 in the worst case about three million people died because of drought related issues there were 16 significant meteorological drought years in the huaihe river basin over the last six decades i e 1961 1962 1966 1976 1978 1986 1988 1991 1992 1994 1997 1999 2001 2008 2015 and 2019 frequent occurrence and intensification of droughts along with an increase in the percentage of areas under moderate and extreme drought have been noted based on records the recently released international panel on climate change s sixth assessment report ipcc ar6 ipcc 2021 pointed out that global climate change may further aggravate natural disasters in the next decades such as droughts and floods and will cause an ever expanding impact on socio economic development and ecosystem sustainability all over the world as one of the major commodity grain bases in china the huaihe river basin accounts for one sixth of the total production with about 11 cropland over china besides about 13 6 of the country s population lives in the huaihe river basin with less than 3 of the country s total water resources dong et al 2021 it is of great importance to comprehensively capture the characteristics of meteorological drought evolution and assess the performance of the general circulation model gcms in simulating precipitation and other concerning variables which might be valuable to project the extreme events in the huaihe river basin this is what was done in this study exploring the evolution of drought in the past is the precondition to figure out its relationship with climate change and what might happen in the future in recent years considerable studies have been conducted on the topics of the drought evolution in the huaihe river basin the existing studies primarily focus on three aspects i e the adaptability of different drought indicators cai 2013 xie 2013 yuan 2004 drought centers and drought trend in the basin huang 2014 xie 2013 and the drought forecast with reanalysis or gcm products ji et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2020 wang w et al evaluated the revised palmer drought severity index pdsi in the huaihe river basin and verified its application in drought monitoring and early warning systems wang 2012 xie w s analyzed the adaptability of composite index ci in the huaihe river basin which took standardized precipitation index spi and relative humidity into account the study also revealed that the annual total drought days were distributed along the latitude direction indicating that the north part of the basin suffered more drought days than the south part xie 2013 adopting spi as the drought indicator yao r et al extracted the shift trajectory of the drought center in the huaihe river basin for the period 1962 2016 and found that the drought center mainly diffused from the center of the river basin to the surrounding areas yao 2021 wen z et al took spi and standardized streamflow index ssi as drought indicator and adopted the mann kendall test to explore the temporal variation characteristics of regional meteorological and hydrological drought it was found that droughts in autumn and winter were more frequent than in summer wen 2021 over the huaihe river basin although much progress has been made in understanding the characteristics of drought variation in the huaihe river basin there are still some limitations previous studies usually analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of drought by selecting typical sites and focusing on one feature or adopting the regional averaged variables calculated by thiessen polygon or arithmetic the evolution of drought over the entire basin based on more than one feature is rarely studied there is a need to explore the spatiotemporal variation of the drought by analyzing every site in the huaihe river basin through multiple aspects of features this will help us to have a more comprehensive and specific understanding of the drought situation in this basin which is one of the most important tasks to understand the past extreme climate performance on the other hand gcms have been widely used to simulate future climate conditions under different scenarios almazroui et al 2021a kripalani et al 2006 preethi et al 2017 the coupled model intercomparison project cmip organized under the auspices of the world climate research programme s wcrp working group on coupled modelling wgcm started 20 years before as a comparison of a handful of early global coupled climate models which has evolved over five phases into a major international multi model research activity eyring et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 much work has been done to assess the future climate change based on coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and cmip6 almazroui et al 2021a almazroui and krakauer 2020 dosio et al 2021 nashwan and shahid 2022 song et al 2021 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhu et al 2021 focusing on different aspects of climate variability it has been proved that the simulation of average climate states is improved in cmip6 climate models compared to cmip5 dosio et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 zhang j y et al evaluated the performance of cmip6 multi model on the tibetan plateau and explored the spatiotemporal evolution of precipitation average temperature maximum temperature and minimum temperature in the near future and the far future under shared socioeconomic pathways ssp1 2 6 low concentration scenario ssp2 4 5 medium concentration scenario ssp3 7 0 medium to high concentration scenario and ssp5 8 5 high concentration scenario it was found that the precipitation tends to increase and the temperature exhibits a rising trend in the future zhang 2011 jiang t et al analyzed the evolution of annual temperature and precipitation for the period 2021 2100 in the huaihe river basin based on five models of cmip6 the results showed that the increasing precipitation mainly covered the middle part of the basin and the temperature would rise faster and the precipitation would increase more in the future compared with cmip5 simulation results jiang et al 2020 nashwan et al evaluated the performance of 29 cmip6 models over egypt in simulating precipitation and found that there would be an intensification in hydrological hazard under ssp1 1 9 and ssp1 2 6 scenarios which represent 1 5 and 2 0 c warming at the end of the present century respectively nashwan and shahid 2022 except for the projected change in different meteorological factors over different regions the performance of cmip6 models in simulating historical conditions and how to get the most out of the cmip6 model outputs also need attention almazroui et al assessed the performance of a large ensemble of cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and temperature over south america and concluded that the cmip6 models successfully captured the main climate characteristics across south america however increasingly heavy tailed precipitation distribution and a rightward shifted temperature distribution were also noted almazroui et al 2021a and similar research has also been conducted in africa and special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex regions almazroui et al 2021b 2020 yue y l et al studied the projected changes in precipitation and temperature over the yangtze river basin based on 23 cmip6 models and found that the biases in cmip6 models could be effectively corrected by empirical quantile mapping eqm and the multi model ensemble mme performed better than individual models for each climatic variable yue et al 2021 above all the realistic representation of the complex climate characteristics of a specific region remains a challenge consequently regional gcm evaluation is needed to fully understand the potential bias of cmip6 simulations in a specific region further to select better performance models to improve the accuracy of projected changes and it is another important task before we explore the behavior of climate extremes in the future periods therefore the main objectives of this paper are a to evaluate the application of spi in the huaihe river basin based on multi scale spi b to extract the statistical characteristics of trend change point and periodicity of meteorological drought at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin during 1956 2020 c to explore the relationship between drought indicators and other meteorological variables over the basin d to assess the performance of several cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and drought in the huaihe river basin and discuss the application of cmip6 for future projections 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin hrb a natural dividing line between north and south china is located between the yangtze river and the yellow river and stretches from 111 55 e 121 20 e and 30 55 n 36 20 n covering 270 000 km2 fig 1 the west southwest and northeast of the huaihe river basin are mountainous and hilly areas while the rest are vast plains with an elevation ranging from 2 to 2200 m the south of the huaihe river basin lies in the north subtropical zone with an annual average temperature of 11 16 whereas the north of the basin is usually affected by a warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate the basin is characterized by hot and rainy summer and cold and dry winter in general the temperature increases from north to south and from coast to inland while the annual precipitation varies from south to north and from mountainous to plain which are greatly affected by the topographic heterogeneity the mainstream of huaihe flows through henan province anhui province shandong province and jiangsu province finally into the yangtze river and the yellow sea considering its impact on the regional climate natural resources and socio economy this paper took the four provinces as the study region based on the administrative division dong et al 2021 2 2 data the monthly observed precipitation was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma gov cn to calculate the standardized precipitation index section 3 1 and further applied to analyze the drought evolution characteristics in the huaihe river basin besides monthly maximum air temperature minimum air temperature relative humidity and sunshine duration records are also available from the website which was used to discuss their relationship with drought as described in the user s guide all the available data on the website have been ensured with high quality control after extreme value check and homogeneity test along with manual spot check in this paper the 209 meteorological observation stations are spread over and near the huaihe river basin as shown in fig 2 of which 73 stations are in the river basin some stations with missing values from january 1956 to december 2020 are presented in table 1 the missing values of sanmenxia and chaohu stations were supplemented by the multi year average value of the corresponding month to get a full sequence from 1956 to 2020 of which the missing part is less than one year and the observation data of the other stations were analyzed at their own record time span to ensure the consistency of the data and the reliability of analysis ben gal 2005 padulano and giuseppe 2020 besides all the data used in this study were tested for the autocorrelation coefficient using the two tailed test it was found that significant serial correlations were present in the time series data 1956 2020 of each station and the pre whitening approach bronaugh and werner 2013 yue et al 2002 was adopted to remove serial correlation to prepare stationary data for drought index calculation and characteristics analysis in this study 5 cmip6 endorsed mips from all the 21 mips were selected all of which have got lots of attention and are closely associated with the drought evolution in the huaihe river basin

with deck to be independent of the forcing the cmip6 historical simulations serve as an important benchmark for assessing model performance through evaluation against observations the historical simulations are forced by time dependent observations eyring et al 2016 here the cmip6 historical simulation experiments from 9 models offered by 5 research communities were assessed for their performance in simulating precipitation and drought over the huaihe river basin for the period 1956 2020 the outputs from cmip6 historical simulations experiment historical are available through https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 the brief information of each model was listed in table 2 the precipitation of all the models was remapped to the observation stations by using bilinear interpolation to reserve the realistic characteristics of observation as much as possible the seasonal mean of spring summer autumn and winter was defined as the average of march april may june july august september october november and december january february respectively 3 methodology 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi the standardized precipitation index spi is a commonly used drought indicator that represents the precipitation in a certain region within a given period using probability guttman nathaniel 1999 ma 2012 which was constructed by mckee et al when analyzing the drought degree of colorado mckee 1993 it has been proved that it is more reliable to calculate spi based on the precipitation data of continuous 30 years or more bordi et al 2009 vicente serrano et al 2013 wu et al 2005 positive and negative spi values indicate wet and dry conditions separately whose severity varies with its magnitudes it can be used to evaluate regional drought conditions above the monthly scale also it is a standardized index that makes comparisons possible and reliable between different regions and various periods spi is an effective indicator to assess the meteorological drought conditions in the huaihe river basin cai 2013 mao 2012 yan 2009 in this study spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 were calculated for a 65 year span 1956 2020 at 209 meteorological observation stations across the huaihe river basin fig 2 spi 1 and spi 12 were selected to assess the short term and long term water resources shortage conditions whereas spi 3 was used to represent the seasonal drought for agriculture and spi 3 value of february was used for evaluating winter drought may for spring august for summer and november for autumn more details about the theory and calculation equations of spi are available in appendix a 1 here this paper used the spi generator offered by national drought mitigation center ndmc to calculate the spi value https drought unl edu monitoring spi spiprogram aspx the severity of floods and droughts classified based on spi was shown in table 3 guttman nathaniel 1998 1999 mao 2012 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test m k test for short is a nonparametric statistical test method initially proposed by mann and kendall kendall 1975 mann 1945 quite a lot of studies aimed at testing the significance of hydrometeorological element trend have been conducted using the m k test almazroui and krakauer 2020 byakatonda et al 2018 cook et al 2004 gocic and trajkovic 2014 wang et al 2020 sequential mann kendall smk test can be used to detect the change point and estimate when a trend starts in a sequence cheng et al 2016 modarres and sarhadi 2009 rahman et al 2016 satishkumar and rathnam 2020 xiong and guo 2011 here the m k test and sen s slope estimator test were adopted to analyze the trend of the spi sequences the regional kendall test was used to test regional trends based on the spi sequences of the 73 observation stations over the huaihe river basin helsel et al 2020 moreover change points in the trend for the period 1956 2020 were detected by using the smk test when the m k test is used for trend analysis the null hypothesis h0 is that the time sequence values x 1 x 2 x n are n independent random samples with identical distribution the alternative hypothesis h1 is a two tailed test indicating that for all k j n k j the distributions of x i and x j are not the same in the two tailed test if z z 1 Œ± 2 the hypothesis h0 is not acceptable indicating that the time sequence value has a significant upward or downward trend at the confidence level Œ± positive and negative values of z indicate upward and downward trends separately see appendix a 2 for the equations for the m k test and sen s slope estimator when the smk test is applied for detecting change points two statistics sequence curves ufk and ubk and two critical value lines uŒ± and uŒ± are drawn on the same graph when ufk and ubk exceed the critical line it indicates a significant upward or downward trend and the range beyond the critical line is defined as the time span of the change if there is an intersection point with the ufk and ubk curves along with the point is between the two critical lines the time corresponding to the intersection point is the beginning time of the change i e change point see appendix a 3 for the equations of the smk test 3 3 wavelet analysis wavelet analysis wa is a useful approach to accomplish time frequency multi resolution analysis √∂zger et al 2020 webb et al 2017 it can identify both the time characteristics from multi frequency and the frequency characteristics from multi temporal scales the basics of wa are to approach a signal or a function with a cluster of wavelet functions which can be obtained by the stretching and shifting of a fundamental wavelet function on the time axis the continuous wavelet transformation cwt is widely used in geographic physical studies as a time series intermittent wave feature extraction tool khan et al 2021 liu 2018 and the morlet wavelet exhibits good performance in balancing the time and frequency here cwt and morlet wavelet were used to detect the periodicity of drought in the huaihe river basin for the period 1956 2020 see equations in appendix a 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of historical drought events based on the monthly precipitation of the 73 meteorological observation stations in the huaihe river basin and the 136 meteorological stations surrounding the huaihe river basin 209 meteorological stations in all spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 during 1956 2020 were calculated to analyze the characteristics of drought at multiple spatial and temporal scales in the basin when analyzing the characteristics at spatial scale the spis of the 209 meteorological stations were interpolated to the basin according to the kriging interpolation method to depict the realistic distribution of characteristics as much as possible and the spis of the 73 meteorological stations were adopted when the statistical analysis is conducted firstly according to the severity classification of spi in table 3 the annual drought index spi 12 of the 79 meteorological stations for the period 1956 2020 was statistically analyzed the percentage frequency of different grades of spi classification for each year over the huaihe river basin was presented in fig 3 it is obvious that drought covers 20 35 of the meteorological stations over the basin in most years while flood covers 20 40 in general the percentage frequency of different grades of spi classification in the basin from 1956 2020 is relatively stable the percentage frequency fluctuates only in specific years e g 1964 1966 1986 1988 1999 2013 and 2019 all of which are consistent with the historical records of typical drought years then two typical drought events in the winter of 1998 and the spring of 1978 were selected to further assess the application of spi as a drought indicator in the huaihe river basin the spatial distributions of spi 3 of february 1998 and may 1978 were drawn in fig 4 a and fig 4 b separately according to the records wang 2006 wen 2008 wen 2005 wen 2007 from september 1998 to the first ten days of march 1999 the precipitation in the whole shandong province was only one fourth of that in the same period of previous years there was a long term drought from january 1999 to february 1999 in anhui province while severe drought occurred in most of henan province from september 1998 to march 1999 in short the lack of rainfall in most regions lasted for a long time during 1998 1999 causing continuous drought in autumn and winter of 1998 over the huaihe river basin as shown in fig 4 a the spatial distribution of spi 3 is in good agreement with the recorded data revealing that the west part of henan province and the east part of shandong province suffered severe drought in the winter of 1998 as for 1978 there was rare rainfall from march to june in shandong province with no rainfall for 80 consecutive days causing drought almost all over the province in jiangsu province the drought occurred in spring and lasted till the end of june 1979 which was an extremely severe drought year in history and there was a continuous drought in spring summer and winter in the north of anhui province which proved to be the most severe drought in nearly 200 years from the winter of 1977 to the spring of 1978 the precipitation in henan province was less than usual among which only one fifth of normal rainfall was in the north of zhumadian as shown in fig 4 b drought occurred in the entire huaihe river basin in the spring of 1978 and the spatial distribution of drought is consistent with the records in conclusion spi can capture the drought condition over the huaihe river basin precisely and reliably 4 2 spatial patterns of trends in spi for the period 1956 2020 the statistics of trends based on multi scale drought indices using mann kendall test sen s slope estimator and regional kendall test for the period 1956 2020 in the huaihe river basin were presented in table 4 as shown in fig 5 the spatial distributions of trends in spi 1 spi 12 spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn and spi 3 winter are similar roughly distributing along the latitude direction which illustrates that the drying trend is more significant in the north part of the basin than in the south part of the basin on the contrary the trend of spi 3 spring is longitudinally distributed in fig 5 c it is noticeable that shandong province and the east part of henan province are the high value areas of the drying trend in fig 5 a and fig 5 b and a wetting trend exists in the southern part of jiangsu province and the southern part of anhui province indicating that the regional drought is relieving to some extent according to spi 3 spring there is a drying trend in the east part of henan province meaning that the spring drought in the upper reaches of the basin is aggravating in the recent 65 years besides the spi 3 summer trend varies gradually from south to north exhibiting a wetting trend in the south while drying in the north spi 3 autumn shows a drying trend in most areas of the huaihe river basin and the drying trend is most significant in the northeastern part of shandong province with the maximum value of 0 057 10a spi 3 winter represents a wetting trend in the north part of jiangsu province indicating that the winter drought in this region will possibly be relieved if following this trend generally the drying trend in the north part of the huaihe river basin is more significant than that in the southern part during summer and winter while the drying trend in the eastern part is more significant than that in the western part of the basin during spring it was illustrated that each season s drought in the east part of the basin shows an aggravating trend but relieves in the southeast station statistics of trends based on spi 1 spi 3 and spi 12 were presented in fig 6 it can be concluded that all the 73 meteorological stations in the basin show either a wetting trend or a drying trend at each scale of spi while only a few sitesexhibit a significant trend spi 1 and spi 12 shared the same frequency of wetting trend and drying trend over the huaihe river basin while there are more sites with significant drying trends according to spi 12 overall as shown in table 4 regional drying trend was observed according to spi 3 in spring and spi 3 in autumn while spi 3 in winter indicated more sites with a wetting trend which could enrich the analysis of spatial characteristics 4 3 change point detection during 1956 2020 sequential mann kendall smk test was applied for detecting the change point in the sequence of spi 12 from 1956 to 2020 at the 73 meteorological stations over the basin the frequency of stations with change points in the basin was shown in fig 7 it is widely known that meteorological drought and other hydrological processes are always under the influence of climate phenomena and human activity cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2021b it can be observed that the change points 1963 1964 1970 1974 2002 2005 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 account for the relatively high frequency which were typical el ni√±o or la ni√±o years in history lenssen et al 2020 zong et al 2010 historically the dramatic increase of change point stations from 1970 to 1974 may be explained by the fact that there were many severe drought years in the 1960 s no drought events occurred in the early 1970 s while the typical severe drought occurred again in the late 1970 s and there were el ni√±o and la ni√±o events before and after the early 1970 s respectively which may explain the occurrence of the change point during 1970 1974 additionally there was a severe drought in 2001 and the drought relieved in the basin from 2002 to 2007 during which typical el ni√±o events occurred then extensive drought occurred at the end of the flood season in 2008 lasting to may 2009 the total rainfall for the period october 2008 to may 2009 only accounted for 30 of the multi year average precipitation for the same period in late january 2011 most areas of the basin suffered from meteorological drought up to the standard of extreme drought later drought occurred in the summer of 2013 as well as severe droughts in shandong province in 2015 that is to say the arising of the change point is roughly consistent with whether or not the drought transition occurred furthermore the change points are associated with large scale climate phenomena like el ni√±o the change point usually occurs around a typical el ni√±o or la ni√±o year the time interval of change points is usually about 1 2 years and it has been found that there were in phase relations between ni√±o3 and droughts over the huaihe river basin of which the climate indices ni√±o3 lead spring drought by 1 5 2 years fang et al 2021 it is worth studying in the future whether the occurrence of change points has linkages with climate indices and what it is schepen et al 2012 according to the historical records of typical drought years in the huaihe river basin bengbu station 58221 in anhui province xinyang station 57297 in henan province yantai station 54765 in shandong province and xuzhou station 58027 in jiangsu province were selected as representative stations to draw the smk test curves ufk ubk uŒ± and uŒ± as shown in fig 8 the ufk and ubk curves of each station basically follow the same pattern in short the drying or wetting trend is insignificant in the selected stations while their change points are concentrated on the timeline indicating that the drought evolution in these regions exhibits a good synchronization there are change points such as 1962 1974 1975 1996 2006 2007 and 2013 for the period 1956 2020 in the huaihe river basin the ufk curve of bengbu station fig 8 a showed a steady rise without possible abrupt change there is an insignificant drying trend before 2007 but an insignificant wetting trend after 2007 the long term insignificant drying trend may explain the severe droughts that occurred in 2001 and from 2008 to 2011 the situation of xinyang station fig 8 b is highly similar to that of bengbu station the ufk curve of yantai station fig 8 c fluctuates significantly and there are change points in 1963 1975 and 2014 for the period 1987 2012 uf 0 and it has passed the significance test showing that there is a significant drying trend after the 1980 s it can confirm the actual situation that the huaihe river basin suffered from a long term drought from 1991 to 1998 and yantai was hit by a historical rare drought in 2015 that is to say 2014 is a change point in yantai station during 1956 2020 which might be associated with the reform of the rural land system in 2014 in china as one of the most important agricultural production bases the land use change of shandong province keeps pace with the government policy besides the ufk curve of xuzhou station fig 8 d fluctuates around the zero scale line and the majority of them are less than zero the drying trend is not significant and there is a change point in 1972 there is an insignificant wetting trend from 1972 to 1976 and an insignificant drying trend after 1977 the long term insignificant trend may explain the severe shortage of water caused by the drought in 1978 in general all the stations showed that the significant drying trend shifts to insignificant near 1960 which might be explained by the fact that there was much government policy implementation on the development and usage of agricultural land and urban land near 1960 it has been illustrated that both the trend and the abrupt change in the meteorological series are very closely intertwined and it is very hard to distinguish between them xiong and guo 2011 how to detect the change point more accurately and effectively is a task to be considered 4 4 periodicity the cwt analysis was conducted on five basin averaged time series i e spi 3 spring spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn spi 3 winter and spi 12 to identify the periodicity of multi scale spis in the huaihe river basin during 1956 2020 the analysis results of the annual drought index spi 12 in the huaihe river basin were illustrated in fig 9 the continuous wavelet power spectrum for the time series of spi 12 revealed that the sectors with significant 0 05 confidence level are consistently distributed in the 2 12 years bands during 1956 1980 the 3 7 years bands in the period of 1976 2002 and the 1 4 years bands in the period of 1984 2005 fig 9 also illustrated the corresponding global wavelet spectrum when the wavelet spectrum is beyond the red dashed line it indicates that the corresponding period is at the 0 05 confidence level test the figure exhibited that spi 12 has significant period at the time scale of 2 7 years in other words the variation of the spi 12 in the whole 65 years is mainly dominated by the period of 2 7 years the cwt results of the seasonal drought index spi 3 in the huaihe river basin were shown in fig 10 the spring spi 3 fig 10 a showed significant wavelet power in the 0 5 2 years bands during 1962 1990 and for the period of 1996 2006 and the 4 7 years bands for the period 1997 2004 and the global wavelet spectrum revealed the significant period at the time scale of 1 2 5 years fig 10 b showed significant wavelet power peaks in the 1 3 years bands during 1986 2004 and the 0 5 3 years band in the period of 2008 2016 it is obvious that the summer spi 3 time series has significant period at the time scale of 1 3 years the autumn spi 3 exhibited 0 5 3 years bands during 1983 1990 and 0 5 4 years bands for the period 1998 2010 fig 10 c revealed the significant period of 1 3 years during 1956 2020 fig 10 d showed significant wavelet power in the 2 4 years bands during 1992 2002 1 3 years bands for the period 2008 2018 and the 1 2 years bands can be extracted nearly over the entire time domain and the period at the time scale of 1 3 5 years can be observed in the global wavelet spectrum among all the seasons the period of winter drought index is more stable during the entire time domain then the oscillation frequency tends to be higher than other seasons in the time domain which is mutually verified with the conclusion in section 4 1 that the drying trend in winter is more significant in the basin the period oscillations of summer spi 3 shared the same pattern as autumn spi 3 especially after the 1980 s that is to say continuous droughts in summer and autumn are more common in the basin with a 1 3 years period the results are consistent with the historical records above all the significant period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years which is related to large scale climate events e g enso nao and soi as has been studied before fang et al 2021 wang et al 2016 the seasonal drought tends to follow the period at the time scale of 1 3 years which is influenced by different enso events cp or ep li et al 2018 and various phases of enso positive or negative li et al 2011 nalley et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 it is noted that the significant period of spi 12 has become shorter since the 1980 s along with the same period oscillation pattern of summer spi 3 and autumn spi 3 it is worth considering whether the phenomenon is associated with the global climate shift in the late 1980 s reid et al 2016 however the above conclusions might change with time as the analyzed span is limited plenty of research still needs to be conducted to explore the potential relations between drought and climate changes in the huaihe river basin 4 5 relationship between drought characteristics and other meteorological variables run theory wu et al 2019 yevjevich 1967 was adopted to identify the starting time of drought events the corresponding drought duration d and the drought severity s here a drought event was defined as the spi 1 value lower than 0 5 including one month drought events and the two drought events were integrated into one when the time interval between them is less than 2 months in this part weifang station 54843 in shandong province was taken as an example the statistical results were shown in fig 11 for the past 65 years 53 drought events lasting more than one month occurred in weifang station among which the longest drought event is 16 months started in november 2005 followed by a 10 month drought event that started in december 1976 this analysis exhibited that drought duration and drought severity exert a mutual effect with a correlation coefficient of 0 8719 at the 0 01 significance level test despite that the exact causes for drought development are still not fully understood so far and will be further explored in detail detecting the quantitative relations between different drought characteristics may offer references for drought prediction and emergency management the spearman correlation coefficient was also used to identify the relationships between drought duration drought intensity and other meteorological factors based on the spi 1 sequence at monthly scale for the period 1956 2020 the correlation between spi 1 and monthly average air temperature average maximum air temperature relative humidity monthly sunshine percentage and sunshine duration were demonstrated in table 5 the drought duration evaluated by spi 1 in the huaihe river basin represented a significant negative correlation with the drought peak intensity meaning that the longer the drought duration is the lower the drought peak intensity is it is also noticeable that spi 1 exhibited a negative correlation with average air temperature average maximum temperature sunshine duration and sunshine percentage whereas the correlation with air temperature is weaker than that with sunshine class variables besides spi 1 is positively correlated with relative humidity and the spearman correlation coefficient is up to 0 6472 in the basin it is worthy of consideration to take relative humidity as one of the drought related factors to modify the drought indicators 4 6 the cmip6 model performance on precipitation and drought the performance of cmip6 models in simulating precipitation in the huaihe river basin was assessed by comparing the multi year average monthly precipitation of observation and simulated results for the period 1956 2020 fig 12 besides we used the taylor diagram to assess the performance of cmip6 models in reproducing the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in the huaihe river basin fig 13 numerous studies have adopted the two methods to evaluate the climate model performance ayugi et al 2021 cao et al 2021 dosio et al 2021 li et al 2021 liao et al 2021 taylor 2001 zhu et al 2021 as shown in fig 12 the precipitation was underestimated in flood season according to most models while it was overestimated in the dry season among all the models miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip showed consistent patterns with the observed data conversely the cesm2 of c4mip and cesm2 of lumip performed relatively poorly with either overestimating a lot or underestimating a lot the variation of precipitation in one year was captured by most models consequently miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip were selected as good performance models which were also evaluated according to the arithmetic mean of models along with the results of the ensemble mean of the 9 models as shown in fig 13 the taylor diagram was presented to evaluate the performance of cmip6 models in reproducing the spatial pattern of the annual precipitation the performance of individual models showed great differences in fig 13 miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip also exhibited the highest spatial correlation coefficients from 0 91 to 0 93 meanwhile the normalized standard deviation of the three models is around 0 8 and the normalized centered root mean square error is 0 6 approximately that means the three models can reasonably simulate the spatial pattern of annual precipitation in the huaihe river basin in comparison the results for the multi model mean are similar to the three models this indicated that the arithmetic mean of the 3 models outperforms most individual models as well as the arithmetic mean of the 9 models it is common knowledge that the simulation performance of climate models are affected by several sources of disturbances except for the uncertainty of climate models or physical processes to be over simplified many other causes can influence the performance assessment it should be noticed that there might be biases caused by comparing the grid scale variable of climate models to the point scale of observation station data when interpolating the cmip6 data to observation stations i e down scaling related issues degaetano and castellano 2017 padulano et al 2019 how to eliminate the scale effect and do a less uncertainty quantitative evaluation will be noteworthy research for the historical simulation results and future projections according to the evaluation results miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip exhibited good performance in depicting the annual circle of precipitation as well as the spatial pattern of annual precipitation thus the 3 models performance in simulating drought conditions in the huaihe river basin was assessed the monthly precipitation of the ensemble mean of 3 models was used to calculate spi 1 and spi 12 sequences the box and whisker plots were applied to illustrate the range of spi values over the 73 stations in the basin based on observation and simulation results fig 14 indicated that the uncertainty ranges of the ensemble mean of 3 models for spi have a good consistency with observation results however it should be noted that biases still exist in the simulation results in fig 14 b the outliers of mme more focus on the positive values which express more wet conditions it might be explained by the general overestimation of precipitation in cmip6 models li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a efforts still need to be made to further reduce the bias of simulation results besides the projection experiments of cmip6 derived from the selected historical simulation models can be used to predict drought in the near future and the far future under different scenarios and further offer references to the management of water resources in this study region except for precipitation and temperature radiation and other meteorological factors are also associated with drought closely the performance assessment of cmip models in simulating other variables can also be conducted in future studies 5 conclusions this study explored the drought characteristics at multiple spatial temporal scales and assessed the performance of cmip6 models in simulating the precipitation and drought over the huaihe river basin firstly the drought condition and major historical drought events in the huaihe river basin were investigated and the application of spi was evaluated then the statistical characteristics of drought i e trend change point and periodicity were detected finally the performance of 9 cmip6 models in simulating precipitation and drought was evaluated against observations the primary conclusions are as follows a the spatial distribution of trends in spi 1 spi 12 spi 3 summer spi 3 autumn spi 3 winter roughly distribute along the latitude direction indicating that the drying trend is more significant in the north part of the basin than in the south and the trends in spi 3 spring is longitudinally distributed with a significant drying trend in the east b the significant drying trend converted to insignificant near 1960 which was in pace with the implementation of government policies on the development and usage of agricultural land and urban land near 1960 and the drought of the entire basin has good synchronization sharing identical change points in different sites c the significant period of spi 12 lies around 2 7 years indicating potential teleconnections with large scale climate events e g enso nao and soi the seasonal drought has a significant period at the time scale of 1 3 years under the influence of different enso events cp or ep and various phases of enso positive or negative d it has been revealed that the drought lasts longer and the drought severity is greater with a correlation coefficient of 0 8719 whereas there is a significant negative correlation between drought duration and drought peak intensity and it is worthy of consideration to take relative humidity as one of the drought related factors to modify drought indicators e the 9 cmip6 models showed great discrepancies in simulating precipitation among them miroc6 of lumip cesm2 of ls3mip and miroc6 of ls3mip were selected as good performance models in the huaihe river basin the ensemble mean of 3 selected models exhibited better performance in simulating precipitation than individual models and the ensemble mean of 9 models besides the spi calculated by the ensemble mean of 3 models also has a good consistency with observations overall this paper systematically exhibited the characteristics of drought evolution at multi spatial temporal scale in the huaihe river basin based on spi the results presented could contribute a lot to further exploring the precipitation and drought conditions in the near and the far future over the huaihe river basin based on the projection experiments derived from the selected cmip6 models besides change points were associated with abrupt land use change and periodicity presented a relationship with large scale climate phenomena these discoveries do add value to the drought research over the huaihe river basin and similar areas however the above conclusions might change with time as the analyzed span is limited plenty of research still needs to be conducted to explore the potential relations between drought and climate changes in the huaihe river basin funding this
