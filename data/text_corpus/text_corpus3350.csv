16750,among various aqua remediation technologies separation aims at cleaning pollutants by isolating them despite their destruction solutes can also be recovered after the process adsorptive micellar flocculation amf has been known as an important surfactant based technique to separate poorly water soluble hazardous pollutants from aqua media as an efficient and energy intensive replacement for other surfactant based techniques as such amf should be known amf is based on the partitioning of solutes gradient from bulk solution into the nanosized smart anionic surfactant micelle followed by flocculation however unlike coagulation flocculation or adsorption amf is not viable for the production of drinking water in water utilities due to the loss of surfactant monomers unfortunately it can be used as a reservoir or for the recycling recovery of organic pollutants intermediates ions organics bioactive dyes etc even at high concentrations the performance of amf depends on various parameters and this review briefly summarizes the existing researches on different pollutants removal by amf and material recovery recycling this includes operating condition factors surfactants flocculants surfactant flocculant or surfactant pollutant concentration ratio and water conditions chemistry because varieties of micro interfacial phenomena other than physical interactions occur in a versatile micellar environment in the amf process emphases are given to adsorptive oxidation micellar catalysis selectivity furthermore for the first time this review gives an overview of understanding the state of the art multifunctional nano amphiphile based amf that behaves mimetic to aquatic organisms in the process of pollutant removal the efficiency of amf including recycling concentrated solution without noticeable deterioration as an auxiliary resource income for the next cycle signifies economic viability versatility and manifold applications in aqua remediation significance ways to achieve enhanced process efficiency as well as challenges and future opportunities in wastewater treatment are also highlighted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorptive micellar flocculation amf anionic surfactants micellar catalysis selectivity recycling 1 introduction methods for purification of steadily increasing organic pollutants from water are categorized as approaches that isolate the organic solutes and those that destroy them despite its advantage the destruction process costly in some cases does not allow the recovery of auxiliary products and is limited to the formation of secondary pollutants generation of toxic secondary products whereas physicochemical separation methods are accompanied by mere transfer of the pollutants from the bulk to another media rather than pollutant destruction thus solutes recycling and recovery at the end of the process could be possible there is thus a mounting need for a technological solution innovative and efficient against the challenges of the efficient removal and recycling problem of aqua soluble pollutants cecon et al 2021 pakdel et al 2021 in recent years a considerable amount of investigations have been conducted in searching for a surfactant based non classical separation technology of target solutes from water at a reasonable cost and with a tolerable impact on the environment peredo mancilla and dominguez 2016 saveyn et al 2008 shen et al 2015 talens alesson et al 2010 the ability of surfactants in materials surface modification liu et al 2020 ma et al 2021 xi et al 2005 xiao et al 2020 ion floatation hoseinian et al 2018 peng et al 2019 polat and erdogan 2007 reyes et al 2009 assisting with drug delivery bowker and stahl 2008 kaur et al 2016 mathias et al 1996 assisting with catalysis sorella et al 2015 zhan et al 2017 dispersion and emulsification bao et al 2019 lin et al 2007 vaisman et al 2006 made them significant entities for environmental application among surfactant based applications a separation process via surfactant micelle enhanced flocculation namely adsorptive micellar flocculation amf has been investigated for wastewater cleaning for over 20 years ever since the 1998s when talens et al 1998 proposed micellar flocculation some years after somasundara first introduced alcl3 precipitation redissolution behavior in anionic surfactant solution somasundaran et al 1988 since then the removal of poorly water soluble organics and metal ions by flocculation of micelles has been widely investigated demissie et al 2021b saitoh et al 2014c talens alesson et al 2004 wang et al 2019 a micellar artifact composed of liquid crystal and random fragments of the crystal is easily flocculable and filterable during its formation it can entrap organic pollutants present in water by selection of an appropriate surfactant micelle for cationic pollutants adsorption on its surface pereira et al 2014 r f p 2011 2010 or solubilization of hazardous organic bioactive solutes amf can be applied for the removal of both inorganic cations and organic compounds shen et al 2016 the main advantages of amf are micellar flocculate with the random fragments of liquid crystal gives a versatile and powerful ground for binding varieties of solutes anthony and talens alesson 2007a enables very rapid removal saitoh et al 2017 2014c 2011 and provides a capacity to remove high pollutant concentration talens alesson et al 2006 ease of operation and low energy demand compared with other surfactant assisted methods also grasp considerable attention the efficiency of amf is not based on simple relations rather it depends on a variety of parameters for example co solutes operating conditions surfactant type and solution chemistry many investigations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of amf and how those parameters influence its efficiency shen et al 2016 however amf fails to achieve the principle to use one chemical to consume completely a target chemical that is hazardous toxic or valuable because the process releases into the supernatant a non flocculated surfactant on the order of magnitude of the critical micelle concentration cmc of the amphiphile used talens alesson et al 2006 besides if different pollutants are present together amf suffers from selective removal of target solutes to this end amf is preferred to treat concentrated pollutants than a dilute stream as amf shows great technological promise due to the fact that it has good potential to recycle and recover the flocculant surfactants and the targeted pollutant anthony and talens alesson 2007b there is a serious attempt in scaling up from bench scale to a continuously operated unit piolet scale at a commercial scale nevertheless amf has not been commercialized yet which might be due to the scarcity of enough evidence on its process optimization as experimental parameters for individual systems are to be selected on the basis of existing conditions there are no universal experimental conditions that can be cascaded and best fit the amf process in different wastewater conditions substantial understanding of those extensively studied methods has paramount importance in this regard however of particular concern are 1 recycling and recovery of auxiliary components as it may ultimately be related with the economic viability and environmental risk of the process 2 a means of using a prominently lower concentration of surfactant since monomers at the concentration equal to the surfactant cmc are often present in supernatant and 3 selective removal of precious solute in the presence of other similar species such a compiled article in the amf process is scarce in the literature hence this review first provides an overview of basic amf principles after introduced surfactants micelles and micelle assisted separations to that end the literature results on solute removal efficiency and operating conditions specifically by amf process are summarized including selective removal of target solute micelle assisted catalysis and recovery recycling of solutes flocculants and surfactants secondly the review highlights the state of the art application of multifunctional nano amphiphile based amf for single step removal of a spectrum of pollutants behaving mimetic to small aquatic animals so far no comprehensive review of it has been reported in the literature 2 surfactants and micelle surfactants have special amphiphilic properties because they possess a lipophobic head and a lipophilic chain tail group with a robust affinity for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds solvents the lipophilic nonpolar tail group typically consists of a long alkyl or alkyl aryl chain with 10 to 20 carbon atoms chen et al 2020 the head group either consists of a charged moiety or a nonionic moiety based on the constituent molecule the surfactants head moiety bears different charges accordingly there are cationic anionic and nonionic classes of surfactants chat et al 2019 there is another class called zwitterionic surfactant if the head group holds both anionic and cationic centers amphoteric behavior at different ph besides surfactants may have more than one head moiety and may include more than one hydrocarbon chain tail group fig 1 if two hydrophilic parts of surfactant are connected by spacer near the head group it is thought of twine gemini surfactant and bola surfactants or bolaforms in case the two head group of similar or different charges are connected by hydrophobic chain s due to polar apolar dual nature surfactants adsorb diffuse between water air or water oil interface at their low concentration level the interfacial diffusion of surfactants intermediary increases the interfacial area by dropping the surface tension of water air of the phase boundary and water oil interfacial tension demissie and duraisamy 2016 liu et al 2021 as a result surfactants can be used as dispersants detergents wetting foaming agents and emulsifiers in several applications when surfactants are saturated at the interface they self assemble aggregate into a thermodynamically smart structure due to the interactions with the solvent surfactants assemble in bulk to micelle above a certain concentration called cmc which can be identified by a significant attenuation of conductivity surface tension st or osmotic pressure measurement because all of them continue to change before the vicinity of the cmc point is reached as shown in fig 2 the solution conductivity increase and water surface tension decrease by increasing the concentration of both cetylpyridinium chloride cpc and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab aggregation of surfactants is favored by the tendency of their tails to minimize the free energy of interaction with the polar phase such that their hydrophobic moieties are being expelled from the polar solvent pan et al 2016 spiering et al 2021 consequently hydrophilic head groups are in contact with the surrounding aqueous phase at the outer surface or interface and the long chain tail part forms a micellar core having hydrophobic nature the reverse phenomenon occurs in non polar solvents besides solvent polarity other factors like temperature ionic strength and pressure alter the micellar aqueous phase for example chen et al 2020 reported a u shaped plot of mc with increasing temperature in this respect while the generated micelle aggregate has higher order lower entropy than the monomers the micellar surroundings generally present a more disordered configuration higher entropy this change due competition of interfacial energy suggests that cmc fig 2 can be used to get evidence on the thermodynamic parameters of the micellization the standard gibbs free energy of micellization δ g m i c 0 can be described as δ g m i c 0 rt in x c m c where r is a gas constant x c m c implies mole fraction of cmc and t is absolute temperature the slop of pre micelle plot fig 2 can also be used instead of x c m c to determine the free enegry as well as surfcae excess concentration demissie and duraisamy 2016 2 1 structure of micelle the concurrent spontaneous assembly of amphiphiles either involves geometric packing micelle or phase separation through competitive interactions the extent of micellization and interfacial adsorption of surfactants with respect to microenvironmental or structural factors can be conveniently determined by the ratio of cmc c20 its increase inhibits micellization table 1 where c20 is the surfactant concentration that corresponds to 20 dyn cm reduction of the solvent surface tension rosen and kunjappu 2012 a geometric assembly by multiple amphiphiles generates a diversity of complex nano architectures aggregation number nagg and size of micelles liu et al 2015 lombardo et al 2015 depending on the hydrated head moiety cross sectional area counterions the tail group diameter the flow conditions as well as the number of head and tail group ghosh et al 2020 the packing parameter cpp eq 1 can be used to predict the morphology of the resulting microstructure 1 c pp v l a 0 where a0 represents the effective cross sectional area of the head group v and l stand for the incompressible monomer hydrophobic segment volume and its length respectively engberts and hoekstra 1995 a summary of the amphiphile aggregate architecture predicted from the cpp is presented in fig 3 2 2 surfactant mediated separation process such surfactant various types aggregates enable encapsulation and solubilize lipophilic and bioactive molecules into the hydrophobic site dar and chat 2015 this spontaneous dissolution of molecules micellar solubilization is governed by reversible interactions between solubilizate and amphiphilic aggregates to form a thermodynamically stable isotropic solution therefore it is pertinent to mention that depending on the polarity degree of hydration and micro viscosity of different surfactants microstructure sites and the nature of solutes maswal and dar 2014 solubilizate can be retained at distinct microenvironments in the aggregate fig 4 a at the core corona and the interface between core and corona chat et al 2011 dar and chat 2015 besides co solubilization between solutes could enhance their micellar solubilization accordingly dar and chat 2015 reported enhanced solubilization of warfarin wf and coumarin30 c30 solute mixture in three different surfactant micelle than their single solute solubilization fig 4a owing to the solutes co solubilization therefore the solubilization efficiency in micelle depends upon those aforementioned factors affecting the aggregation structures of surfactants and the structure of solubilizate different types of interaction involve during solubilization depending on the nature of the solute and the aggregate site fig 4b various surfactant aggregate based separation technologies for aqua remediation have been investigated for several years three of which have fascinated a great deal of research attention fig 5 a c amf admicellar chromatography also called surfactant mediated admicelle sma and micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf since introduced by dunn et al 1985 meuf technology has been used and demonstrated strong potential in removing various pollutants from wastewater acero et al 2017 ahmad et al 2006 anis et al 2020 chowdhury et al 2019 dharupaneedi et al 2019 parakala et al 2019 verma and sarkar 2020 the main principle is effective size enlargement of contaminants due to solubilization or bound onto micelles fig 5b they can then be retained by ultrafiltration uf membrane de and mondal 2012 schwarze 2017 the main advantages of meuf compared to conventional uf are simultaneous removal of inorganic ions and organic solutes too small to be rejected by uf membrane via ionic or hydrophobic interactions with a micelle even at lower concentrations recovery of surfactants with a low cmc rather meuf is not a very simple process as its performance is susceptible to a variety of parameters and it has some limitations such as back contamination by amphiphile monomers low tolerance to ionic strength fluctuation a low selectivity pressure derived process and membrane fouling schwarze 2017 sma an immobilized surfactant layer based non membrane driven approach developed by allowing surfactants to aggregate on heterogeneous and porous materials in which the surfactant immobilized hydrophobic layer admicelle hemimicelle on the solid surface fig 5a can be used as two dimensional solvents sorbent for robust adsolubilization of organic pollutants within an admicelle of a solid liquid interface as an alternative of activated carbons acs adak et al 2006 bayram et al 2020 hailu et al 2017 ma et al 2021 pal and pal 2017 paria and khilar 2004a peredo mancilla and dominguez 2016 although sma has the advantage of surfactant recycling and the organics concentration in the admicelle phase viz ph management there exist considerable drawbacks such as the need for a continual feeding of surfactant surfactant back contamination sensitivity to ph and salinity and need for extended agitation in addition it has a relatively low adsorption kinetics processing capacity 3 adsorptive micellar flocculation amf amf is a two step filterable surfactant based separation process by which polyvalent cations with a high tendency al3 ba2 fe3 ca2 or la3 adsorb on the micellar surface of some suitable anionic surfactants followed by flocculation in this process the phenomena of micellization before flocculation play a significant role it is obvious that flocculation is a non equilibrium phenomenon and is basically limited by the rate of collisions like precipitation reaction micellization occurs when the aqueous phase concentration reaches a specific value chen et al 2020 however micellization could be interpreted from the thermodynamic equilibrium standpoint that the competition between the solvent water with micellar core interfacial energy and conformational disruption energy of soluble chain hydrophilic of surfactants stemming from the micellar center drive the self assembly and micellization lombardo et al 2015 as described in section 2 the energy change δ g m i c 0 when one mole of surfactant transferred from solution to its aggregate phase can be described as a function of mole fraction of cmc x c m c owing to the hydrophobic effect of the non polar moiety of surfactants the change in entropy of micellization which can be drived from van t hoff equation is generally positive and it is this which makes the spontaneity of the micellization process negative δ g m i c 0 however the spontaneity could still be attenuated by other parameters mentioned above as a result the optimization of factors affecting the micellization process should be taken into consideration while considering amf for optimal removal of solute from water in the amf process anionic solutes bind or complex with the bound cation s and molecular solutes can solubilize in versatile micellar pseudo phase talens et al 1998 as the cations neutralize or reduce the micellar effective surface charge the soluble solutes pollutants containing micelle are quickly flocculate together as amorphous floc fig 5c then the resulting flocs tend to precipitate and separate by gravity settling or a coarse filter thus providing an interesting simple alternative separation technique to both high agitation energy demanding sma based film polymerization and high pressure driven meuf methods pato morales and talens alesson 2000 in addition it has been studied that the removal efficiency of amf per unit mass of the amphiphiles is fifty times that of sma porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 and has fast kinetics saitoh et al 2017 2014c 2011 unlike meuf the process undertaken is pretty easy and requires less dosage of amphiphiles than meuf wang et al 2019 the basic principles of amf solute solubilization by micelle and the subsequent flocculation in amf is not a single process besides the aggregation of micelles differs from micellar enlargement as known to take place generally in the transition from micellar solutions to the liquid crystal the governing principles in the mechanism of insolubilization of surfactants aggregates in the presence of cations the precipitation of the monomers and other phenomena are as follows i micelles contain charged regions called diffused and stream inner layers fig 5d among them the stream layer paton morales and talens alesson 2002 in which the majority of flocculant ions are tightly bound is very important to explain amf when the micelle stern and diffuse layer surface binds with cation al3 or fe3 high cation concentration across the layer leads to suppressing the intermicellar repulsions or reducing the micellar zeta potential to a value of zero and rapidly flocculate the micelles as disordered aggregate by shielding the surface charge in other word an intuitive description of amf follows grosberg et al 2002 model i e the phenomena can be explained by the interplay between repulsion and attraction of flocculant ions and cells micelles in addition to the pollutant chemical gradient from the bulk solutions the final aggregate with fragments of liquid crystal inlaid contains an amorphous structure spongy and sometimes buoyant porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 in some cases amf may be perceived as a mere flocculation coagulation process ii the high cation concentration enables organic target compounds to associate as a complex of non polar nature and or an ion pair across the stern diffuse layer thus favors binding of them into a micellar interior and on a spot of amorphous positive surface charges on the flocculates respectively talens alesson et al 2004 such a complexation can be a reason for significant flocculation of organic anions like phenolate benzoate dissociated 2 4 d dichlorophenoxy acetic acid at their lower concentration talens alesson et al 2006 iii it may be accompanied by an extension of a rheologically bound to the micelle region from the stern diffuse layer to portions of the diffuse layer this phenomenon may lead to having apparent excesses of positive charge by turn either bind upon itself target solutes and or behaves as adsorption substrate for organics talens alesson 2003 the process may be well described by guoy chapman stern isotherms talens alesson et al 2002 iv the synergistic effect of flocculation and interestingly redox reaction oxidation may occur simultaneously when cationic flocculant like fe3 with redox properties are used in this case the concentration of anionic pollutants on the micelle could therefore cause the partial or total oxidation of them talens alesson 2003 3 1 amphiphiles and metal cations for amf a glance at history anionic surfactants particularly sodium alkyl benzene sulfonates table 2 have been extensively used in the amf process among many available surfactants may be because of the following reasons i they have already been used and their efficiency has been proven in other surfactant mediated processes which also helps to compare their performance with the available literature results schwarze 2017 ii most are readily biodegradable bautista toledo et al 2014 beltra et al 2000 bondi et al 2015 sa and me 2012 or commercially available in high quality iii they have high aggregation number coll 1970 paria and khilar 2004b ease of their flocculation reversal hernáinz and calero 2001 or applicability for closed loop process reusability of their residual amount for mineral collection talens alesson et al 2010 and high equilibrium interaction constant with solutes adak et al 2005 gokturk and tuncay 2003 among various metal salt ions trivalent al3 and fe3 m are found to enhance micellar flocculation to a high extent and generate amorphous floc with variable stoichiometry m 1 x na3x ds 3 n porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 talens et al 1998 their flocculation or micellar charge neutralization capacity is usually determined by ζ potential measurement as a consequence of the change in the micellar surface charge by adsorbed cations sedimentation of charged micellar colloidal particles as a result these flocculants have been used to treat contaminated water and for the removal of concentrated surfactant from seawater by means of the amf approach sˇvab et al 2008 3 2 factors affecting the performance of amf this section outlines the materials used experimental conditions and their influence on the performance of amf including parameters affecting the surfactant aggregation and structure 3 2 1 surfactants and flocculants for the efficiency of the amf process the dream surfactant for the process should have the following properties stable large micelles with low cmc high aggregation number high solubilization capacity for the solute and biodegradable unfortunately finding a surfactant in line with these requirements at the same time could be difficult however the requirement can be compensated by finding conditions for a good surfactant solute interaction besides the concentration of surfactants and flocculants has been known to affect the zero point of micellar region zeta potential and the corresponding removal of solutes during micelle flocculation cavalcante et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 evaluated the removal of phenol and benzene derivatives respectively by increasing the concentration of surfactants the results show that the removal was increased up to a certain surfactant concentration might be the cmc region under insufficient micellar flocculation a high concentration of surfactants remains in bulk with a shallow binding potential for solutes for instance pato morales and talens alesson 2000 pioneered that flocculation would not occur at sufficiently high sds concentration in agreement with the stellner scamehorn model apart from the micellar structural change with an excess surfactant displacement of the solubilized solute by surfactant monomers restabilization would occur and ultimately impair the organic solute removal efficiency cavalcante et al 2018 saitoh et al 2014c yang et al 2016 the nature of surfactants and flocculants also affects the performance of amf according to talens et al 1998 it is remarkable that while sdbs efficiently precipitates at high al3 concentration only about 10 of sds barely underwent flocculation under the same high flocculant concentration besides the value of fe3 required to reach the full flocculation region of sds micelle has been known to be twice that of al3 talens alesson et al 2002 beyond the optimum surfactant flocculate ratio of the flocculation region there exists less flocculation of surfactants but does not cause an additional noticeable effect at higher co solute concentration due to micellar swelling pato morales and talens alesson 2000 it is detailed in section 3 3 1 owing to the micellar surface competition of solutes with flocculant cations the presence of an excess target solute in the media humpers the performance of amf cavalcante et al 2018 therefore finding appropriate surfactant and flocculant type and an optimum concentration for the full flocculation region is vital in the application of amf 3 2 2 temperature it is obvious that conditions responsible for cmc decrease are important to increase solute solubilization and reduce back contamination of effluent by surfactant monomers such conditions can be attained by a moderate increase of temperature as it affects the free energy of micellization pereira et al 2009 which then would improve the balance between solute solubilization and surfactant monomer concentration in the effluent however at a very high temperature the cmc increases and negates the solute incorporation into the micelle pereira et al 2010 valente et al 2006 accordingly cavalcante et al 2018 reported maximum removal of phenol between 35 and 40 c at constant surfactant concentration with minimum removal at 50 c however the effect of temperature in amf performance is governed by the hydrophilicity of counterions and the concentration of electrolytes in the media manet et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 the effect of temperature on the pollutant sorption capacity of the micelle can also be extended to the phase transition phenomenon of the surfactant as shown in fig 6 a surfactants dissolved in water generally present a kraft temperature tk or a cloud point the thermal point below which surfactants are insoluble and amphiphile aggregates are in the state of restricted motion however by raising the temperature beyond tk the micellar and lamellar phases transfer to a more flexible form known as a thermotropic liquid crystalline phase lombardo et al 2015 which influences the solute sorption capacity of amf micelle before flocculation van der meeren et al 2015 examined relative 70 improvement of phenol sorption by dioctadecyl dimethylammonium chloride dodac upon increasing the temperature from 20 c to 40 c with a slight decline above the surfactant tk 37 5 c it might be due to dodac aggregate transition from gel to liquid crystalline state when the phase transition temperature tm is approached the solute molecule sorption sites in the micelle become more easily reachable and permeable because of more disordering of the surfactant hydrophobic chains as the thermal region reaches the vicinity of the tm point similarly saveyn et al 2008 showed increased sorption of methyl benzyl alcohol by increasing the temperature of dodac media it is not surprising that in the presence of electrolytes tm is not constant because ionic strength and temperature have antagonistic contributions to the cmc pereira et al 2009 as a result it is worth mentioning that maintaining their balance will lead to efficient micellization and subsequently bring high solute sorption efficiency micelle size can also be influenced by temperature as this schwarze 2017 evaluated the effect of increasing temperature on a micellar size decrease 3 2 3 ph the effect of ph ph adjustment on the uptake of solutes due to the interaction between ionizable organic pollutants and mesoporous ionic liquid crystalline media like micelle is an important research topic sabatino et al 2012 it is mainly because a ph affects the dissociation of basic and acidic solutes b affects the surface charge of the micelle as well as electrostatic interaction between solute and the micelle c the growing body of evidence on the insufficiency of only octanol water partition coefficient log ko w to predict the interaction of target solutes with the amphiphile aggregates lukacova et al 2006 and d ph adjustment could be taken as cost effective alternative technique compared to the process cost associated with solute sorption enhancement by temperature and solute surfactant concentration optimization however the stability of surfactants is sensitive to ph change as they are synthesized by saponification of fatty acid at pka 9 it indicates the necessity of ph optimization to the value lower than surfactant dissociation ph as such increasing removal of phenol direct yellow 27 dye and reactive blue 14 dye by increasing the ph unto below the dissociation ph of surfactant was reported cavalcante et al 2018 melo et al 2015 2018 in addition ph affects the hydrolysis of metal salt cations and their interaction with the micellar surface and ionizable solutes accordingly almeida and talens alesson 2006 observed re solubilization of phenol at high ph as a result of inefficient micellar flocculation associated with al salt hydrolysis to amorphous floc in general for ionizable solutes removal by al3 salts as a flocculant the range between low acid and weak basic ph has been reported to be a more convenient condition saitoh et al 2014b 2014c talens alesson et al 2002 moreover such a ph effect on re solubilization and flocculation in the amf process can be employed for the recycling of the chemicals as shall be discussed in the later sections 3 2 4 electrolytes generally most industries laden electrolytes to their effluent water in non trivial concentrations allègre et al 2006 as electrolytes affect the tk morphology structure of surfactant micelle δ g m i c 0 manet et al 2013 pereira et al 2010 2009 it is crucial to investigate the effect of electrolytes on the performance of amf the removal of various target solutes by a new type of base soap bs surfactant and ca2 based amf upon increasing the concentration of electrolytes has been investigated cavalcante et al 2018 melo et al 2015 2018 the authors found that the removal efficiency of the solutes decreased drastically with the increase in the solute concentration as per noïk et al 1987 and stellner and scamehorn 1989 investigation this phenomenon should be due to the tolerance of surfactant to precipitate by ca2 in the presence of increasing electrolytes concentration nacl such an increase in na negates the ionization extent of bs na rcoo making the micellization and consequently hinder the interaction of ca2 with the surfactant and narrowing of the full flocculation region of the micelle the same phenomenon of decreased micellar flocculation was reported by using al3 flocculant paton morales and talens alesson 2001 besides the exceeded increase in electrolyte concentration enables the surfactant precipitation however such precipitate has a low sorbing potential for pollutants compared to the amorphous micellar flocs melo et al 2015 in addition several key factors such as the contact time floc settling time stirring speed and optimum air flow rate have also been known to affect the removal efficiency of solutes by amf sun et al 2008 compared to conventional coagulation flocculation amf does not demand rapid and prolonged stirring as these humpers the diffusion of target solutes from the bulk to micellar sites and by turn impair their removal cavalcante et al 2018 porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 porras and talens 1999 regarding contact time a very prolonged time has been known to have a determinantal effect particularly in removing target solutes with a high aqua affinity melo et al 2015 2017 generally the above large number of researches and investigations is an indication of interest in amf amf as a promising method has not only the advantage of avoiding the use of membranes and overpressure compared to meuf but also rejected fraction has a much lower content in water flocculate weight of 50 and 5 of effluent volume than membrane based surfactant enhanced filtration talens alesson et al 2006 ease of operation high efficiency rapidity of the process the possibility of operation at room temperature the use of easily available chemicals and biodegradability of the residual surfactants like sds by riverine microbes are the other advantages melo et al 2018 saitoh et al 2014b 2011 talens alesson et al 2010 2002 nevertheless despite coagulation flocculation amf is not liable for the production of drinking water in water utilities however it can be used as a reservoir or for the recycling and recovery of scarcely water soluble organic pollutants and their intermediates in the chemical process industries at high concentrations thousands of ppm if applied for water with diluted pollutants the surfactant leakage in the effluent may lead to high pollution instead of the target solute removal low removal selectivity and poor biodegradability of some surfactants are the other drawbacks shen et al 2016 3 3 approaches toward amf performance improvement as a result of the aforementioned drawbacks including the so called monomers back contamination many investigations have been conducted to overcome the main bottlenecks for the highest possible and cost effective removal of organic pollutants 3 3 1 surfactant selection the use of surfactants containing olefine hydrophobic chain with the ability to delocalize the π electrons through the neighboring olefine chain has been proved to cross link the micellar monomer chains viz slight irradiation fig 6b the cross linking generates the new stable nano sized aggregate and minimizes the surfactant monomer concentration in the solution chen et al 2017 because the free monomers prefer to join the stable aggregate phase then the subsequent flocculation of the crosslinked micelles stably enables the partition of pollutant solutes from the effluent water in contrast to classical surfactants the use of anionic surfactants obtained by the saponification of natural products like animal fat and vegetable oil have got prominence as alternative surfactants due to the environmental compatibility of the deflocculated surfactant monomers in a recent study cavalcante et al 2018 employed bs synthesized from natural sources and naoh accordingly 60 phenol removal was achieved by using ca2 salt as a flocculant in another study melo et al 2018 used bs of various chain lengths to extract reactive blue 14 dye and reported 86 removal at optimum conditions the same conclusion was drawn by using bs and ca2 salt as a flocculant to separate direct yellow 27dye melo et al 2017 2015 the concentration of surfactant used in these studies was relatively higher than the synthetic surfactants might be either due to the nature of the new surfactants or the flocculant used precipitation of micelle using ca2 has been studied however micelles according to somasundaran et al 1988 have some ability to prevent precipitation the model developed by stellner and scamehorn 1989 predicted that precipitation occurs only in the presence of further excess calcium ions after the micelle is saturated with ca2 that is a different scenario than fe3 and al3 in another study talens alesson 1999 compared micellar flocculation with ca and al ions in this case concomitant with the schulze hardy rule estimation the ca 2 one order of magnitude greater than al 3 concentration was required to reach zero zeta potential from the conventional perspective of soap precipitation in the presence of hardness causing ions the demand for high ca2 concentration than al3 to precipitate surfactant is unexpected it is quite obvious that al 3 salts are far more aqua soluble than ca 2 salts from this point of view it could be hypothesized that lower ca2 concentrations would precipitate calcium surfactants soaps however ca2 induces micellar flocculation than monomer precipitation at the surfactant concentration higher than its cmc baviere et al 1983 peacock and matijević 1980 the above reported demand for high bs surfactant concentration with ca2 flocculant could be associated with this phenomenon and it would cause monomer equals to its cmc to be released into the effluent 3 3 2 use of bio flocculants the complexation of al ion with surfactant pollutants notably increases the aluminum concentration remained in the outlet water hereby considerable evidence exists that al is a potent neurotoxicant and its overexposure exert alzheimer s disease in humans which worsens human beings and other animals health flaten 2001 lei et al 2021 as such ferric salts could be used as an alternative flocculant in addition to calcium ion with the advantages of being eco friendly high security non toxicity operational simplicity innocuity high efficiency and biodegradability over traditional flocculants microbial bio flocculants mbfs with the ability to flocculate cells suspensions and colloids have progressively fascinated wide consideration recently zhang et al 2010 specifically microbial flocculant ga1 mbfga1 is a kind of microorganism paenibacillus polymyxa ga1 harvested from secondary metabolites of fermentation liquid huang et al 2019 2012 as per yang et al 2016 and huang et al 2019 mbfga1 has a linear long chain molecular structure possessing homogenous abundant functional groups with the weight of 1 18 106d apart from cells suspended and colloidal particle flocculation mbfga1 has been used in the amf process yang et al 2016 accordingly efficient removal of organic pollutants with minimum residual surfactant was achieved owing to a complex well stretched macromolecular polyelectrolytic polar matrix in ga1 fig 7 a c which is mimetic to extracellular polymeric substances eps mbfs are endowed with complex binding biosorption or bridging of organic and metal cations apart from the micellar flocculation capacity huang et al 2019 2012 however a nontrivial concentration of eps is remained in the effluent although mbfga1 has resulted in an environmentally tolerable concentration of cationic pollutants and residual surfactants in the effluent in addition natural flocculant coagulants such as starch tannins mucilages or several vegetable extracts have been proposed as efficient and eco friendly alternative products for the amf process research for more efficient natural flocculant has been continued to satisfy the environmental subjects and sustainability goal moringa oleifera seed extract has been found to be very interesting in flocculating sdbs micelle up to 80 although it presents a limit on its residual surfactant at a concentration in ppm beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 besides undesirable characteristics of organic byproducts buildup during moringa oleifera based treatment necessitates more investigation of other likely natural flocculants ndabigengesere and subba narasiah 1998 in accord beltrán heredia et al 2009 applied natural tannin based extract tanfloc from acacia and revealed effective flocculation on micelle of an sdbs sodium lauryl sulfoacetate slsa sodium dodecyl diphenyl ether disulfonate sdded sodium nonylphenol sulfate sns sles sodium triethanolamine lauryl sulfate tea ls and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate sdss 3 3 3 application of additives and biodegradation as discussed in the previous section by increasing surfactant concentration beyond cmc the effluent quality decline and back contamination continue to increase for instance talens alesson et al 2006 used mining waste marble dust as an auxiliary resource after the amf process to improve amf performance the result of their study demonstrated high refinement of the separation process by significantly reducing the flocculant loss and moderately reduce surfactant linkage in another approach saitoh et al 2007 introduced magnesium ii chloride into the aqueous mixture of sds and aluminum iii chloride in order to generate layered hydroxide structure by their ions hydrolysis and inside the layer containing the sds aggregate the result of their investigation shows that the region inside the impregnated hydroxide could stably retain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and minimize surfactant monomers in the effluent water although the efficiency depends on the cation sds ratio saitoh et al 2011 vasilescu et al 2004 besides the biodegradation process of residual pollutants as well as surfactants being applied increasingly bautista toledo et al 2014 bondi et al 2015 sa and me 2012 talens alesson et al 2006 since surfactants are proved to enhance bacterial activities and bioavailability of organic solutes zeng et al 2018 moreover saitoh et al 2014c conducted a laboratory scale experiment on co precipitation of sds with aluminum iii chloride by typically reducing their concentration to 80 ppm and 5 ppm respectively the study demonstrated nearly complete tetracycline removal viz the sorption of aluminum chelates ion pairs with ds sds ion on hydrophobic sds impregnated precipitate in the ph region nearly from 5 to 8 5 the result also confirmed rapid degradation of tetracycline collected to the precipitate using ultra violet light in a similar experiment of using sds dosage much below its cmc saitoh et al 2014b high efficiency of rapid cationic dyes removal was reported 3 3 4 polymer surfactant complexation and flocculation this method is based on the flocculation of surfactant polyelectrolyte complexes in which polymers and oppositely charged surfactants electrostatically interact with each other and can form nanosized assemblies or films of polymer surfactant aggregates psas as a floc shen et al 2016 the charged surfactant monomers in orders of magnitude lower than the cmc attach to the polyelectrolyte polymer chain in the form of mini hemi micelles then self flocculation of psas with bind pollutants that are large enough under an optimum condition can be separated by gravity settling or a coarse filter fig 7d for example shen et al 2015 employed poly ethylenimine pei and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac with sds to evaluate the removal of cd ii cr iii and zn ii priority metal pollutants from dilute solution for the first time according to the findings when 0 5 mm sds below its cmc was used injection of 40 ppm pei resulted in 99 removal of cd ii with the residual level as low as 10 ppb in another investigation saitoh et al 2014a applied 20 ppm of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and an electrically equivalent amount of sds 62 ppm for the horseradish peroxidase hrp enhanced rapid removal of estrogens and phenolic compounds from water accordingly phenolic and less polar estrogen compounds were nearly completely incorporated into the hydrophobic regions formed by an aggregate of pah sds complexes and readily separated later saitoh et al 2017 designed an air bubbles based coagulation flotation system for rapid removal of tetracycline from water by using much less amount of sds and aluminum iii chloride in the presence of an electrically equivalent amount of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah polyelectrolyte the result shows that under the optimum conditions and with a typical concentration of 20 ppm sds 1 ppm al iii and 6 5 mg pah nearly complete removal of acidic and basic pharmaceuticals fluoroquinolone and tetracycline from aqua media was achieved within 5 min about 0 12 ppm of residual sds was achieved which is much lower compared to 0 2 ppm of total tolerable anionic surfactant concentration of japan s water regulation study area 3 3 5 improving selective removal the recovery of precious metals like gold from a mixture of waste constituting materials or other sources is recently a tool of vital importance in the context of metal entrapping amf provides a metal ion an oppositely charged micelle to bind on the surface and the resulting matrix is removed from the aqueous phase by a coarse filter or gravity settling however the approach needs modification to impart selectivity among verities of cations in the solution this approach can also be cascaded in the selective removal of small cationic organic species the introduction of a suitably complexing agent with cations like protonated pyridine 2 azo p dimethylaniline pada has been applied as an excellent entrapper of particular metal ions to micellar phases from their aqua mixture as well as for their recovery aydinoglu et al 2016 2014 ghezzi et al 2008 in this case the deprotonated form of pada replaces the negative ions from the metal salt and forming chelates with a positive charge it will then be electrostatically bound on a variety of negatively charged micelle surfaces and through hydrophobic interaction with interior micellar regions subsequently the metal ions could be efficiently collected out via a stripping reaction undertaken by using weakly acidic solutions of nacl under mild conditions ghezzi et al 2008 besides although polyvalent ions al3 are more amenable to bind on micelle than monovalent ions na the latter can rather change the hydrophobicity of micellar flocculate ghezzi et al 2008 and affects the extent of complexes formation upon it fig 8 a thus it improves the selective removal of organic pollutants from the mixture of different organic compounds with a different propensity for the micellar floc in accord anthony and talens alesson 2007b proposed halide salt of monovalent ions in the narrow flocculant concentration range for selective removal of two groups of organic compounds which rely primarily on hydrophobic interaction and or complex formation the result showed that adequate monovalent salt improved the hydrophobicity and enabled selective removal of organics with a high propensity for hydrophobicity from the mixture by limiting the removal efficiency of those relying on complex formation 3 4 recovery and recycling the predictability of the multi step separation of surfactant mediated process in removing attention grabbing solutes by amf has also been verified for example the result of predictability investigation on multi stage phenol removal by amf shows that the removal by amf requires a lower expenditure of sds than meuf techniques talens alesson et al 2006 the same trend of lower expenditure was favorably verified by comparing meuf and amf using surfactants with lower cmc values in addition talens alesson et al 2010 examined the effect of seven step amf process operating and mixing condition in the removal of phenol accordingly appropriate mixing condition of experimental artifacts of amf reduced the phenol concentration with an efficiency of 98 which is the highest and ever reported by surfactant mediated separation processes similarly sun et al 2008 conducted several amf experimental tests on a pilot plant scale study the results show that the removal efficiency of pollutants increased from 69 with the single operation to 78 by the second operation in amf and any other methods finding an appropriate application is similarly important as the modification strategy there has been an attempt for the treatment of soil extracts sˇvab et al 2008 and hospital wastewater anthony and talens alesson 2007b saitoh et al 2014c by amf moreover recycling the resource may signify the importance of this process according to the investigation of anthony and talens alesson 2007b the following sequential procedures would help for material recycling and recovery steps to be applied in the recycling of conventional amf a floc re dissolution in hot concentrated nacl solution or water at high concentration b dilution of concentrate obtained from step a in cold brine for amphiphile and cation re flocculation which help to the selective re incorporation of one of the pollutants from the concentrate c filtration of b to separate the floc from the supernatant d separation of the of pollutants in the filtrate for example by using hollow fiber extraction e repeating a for re dissolution of floc obtained after c f repeating c to separate selectively adsorbed solutes from flocculants g re flocculation of the concentrate amphiphile cation by dilution into the untreated effluent the change in the krafft point using ion exchange is the other strategy used for surfactant recovery in the amf process for example as an anionic surfactant the krafft point of sds is nearly 13 c but it could be increased to about 35 c after potassium salt injection in sds solution due to ion exchange with potassium reflecting the krafft point of the resulting kds pair as a result kds will precipitate at lower temperatures than sds schwarze 2017 as described in section 3 2 3 ph governs the solute incorporation into surfactant aggregates because it affects both solute dissociation and the micelle s surface charge thereby enhancing electrostatic interaction between them or leaching out the bound solutes into bulk besides section 3 3 4 describes the pollutants electrostatic interaction with psas as an essential tool in their removal as a further result ph adjustment by making use of the same excess of hydroxide or hydrogen ions is used to leach out the bound pollutants into the concentrated solution because they have been known to compete with and displace those bound ions after the recovery of organic ions or inorganic metal cations from the psas flocs the ph can be adjusted near the neutral condition to recycle polymers and surfactants because their charge is proton dependent fig 8b besides the cost efficiency of amf was evaluated by predictability investigation of a multi stage process and such recycling without noticeable deterioration of polyelectrolytes for the next cycle signifies economic viability and the sustainability of the process it is because pollutant containing concentrated solution can be taken as an income stream or an auxiliary resource apart from obtaining treated water although this technology appeared to have potential applications it is not applied yet for the removal and recovery of target solutes particularly in the large process 3 5 modification of amf and micro interfacial phenomena 3 5 1 co adsorption with oxidation it has been examined that the redox properties oxidative of iron can bring the synergistic effect of flocculation and destruction of pollutants during amf this happens if oxidant flocculants with opposite micellar polarity are used the micelle could increase the collision probability of the micelle bound pollutant with a cationic flocculant oxidant helping the electron relay from the oxidant into the pollutant bounded to the micelle kundu et al 2002 das et al 2001 investigated comparative studies to examine oxidation of ethanol and propan 1 ol using cr vi instead of al3 flocculant for cpc and sds micelle the result shows that partitioning of the alkanols to the micelle of sds was followed by enhanced oxidation by cr vi but cationic cpc inhibited their oxidation consistently the redox reaction involving a phenazinium dye ps evident that the bound sds micelle favored the location of the dye close to the micellar head groups thereby the reactivity of pulse radiolytically generated reducing radicals get increased gawandi et al 2002 it has also been evidenced that undesired photo chemical partial oxidization reactions involved at micellar bound organic ions aniline during the fe3 based amf process talens alesson 2003 in another effort similar oxidation phenomena without flocculation using hdtmab micelle in the presence of suspended tio2 for degradation of phenol 2 4 5 trichlorophenol and 2 5 dichlorophenol was carried out fabbri et al 2006 to this end the phenolics adsorption onto hdtmab modified tio2 enhanced their rapid decomposition under a mercury lamp photoreactor however the technique needs careful optimization of surfactant concentration due to competition of micelle and solute bound aggregate for substrate partitioning 3 5 2 micellar catalysis apart from solute solubilization partition the micelle of amf can be used as preferential partitioning media of the target solute catalysts and oxidants between the aqueous and micellar phases for example aqueous micellar media of cps and sds were used to evaluate the kinetics of d glucose oxidation by cr vi in the presence and absence of 2 2 bipyridine bayen et al 2005 while cpc had inhibited both the 2 20 bipyridine catalyzed and uncatalyzed redox reaction sds catalyzed the oxidation through both paths in similar research islam et al 2005 studied the oxidation of d fructose by cr vi using 2 2 bipyridyl bipy and 1 10 phenanthroline as a catalyst in sds and cpc micelle solution according to their findings using the same catalyst promoted 1 10 phenanthroline ethanol oxidation by hexavalent chromium had resulted in an accelerated generation of acetaldehyde in anionic surfactant sds media but cationic surfactant cpc media did not exhibit enhanced aldehyde generation saha et al 2011 in this pathway the complex of 1 10 phenanthroline cr vi in sds media oxidizes ethanol and turns to cr iii which can be recycled as described in section 3 5 a similar conclusion was drawn for catalyzed nucleophilic attack based oxidation of ethane 1 2 diol and propan 2 ol in sds micellar media ghosh et al 2012 ghosh et al 2012 in another study ru iii and cr vi were used to oxidize octanal and 2 propanol in acidic media of sds cpc and tx 100 chowdhury et al 2020 2019 the results show that sds paired with oxidative cations had the best catalytic activities furthermore an experiment on micelle catalyzed reduction of methylene blue was conducted talens alesson 2003 however there still remains a need to mitigate the drawbacks such as a need for an influent pretreatment step for suspension removal and minimize the amount of flocculant organic complex contents 3 5 3 polycationic nanocluster based amf besides soluble cation organic complex generation talens alesson et al 2004 the cations al3 fe3 in situ hydrolyze to a myriad aquaoxyhydroxo species non flocculate in contrast recently we have designed a method based on a pre hydrolyzed polycationic aluminum nanocluster al30 as a flocculant in sds media below its cmc to remove various phenolic compounds from water demissie et al 2021a the nanocluster was chosen primely for the following reasons i to minimize control the in situ hydrolyzed species ii to reduce the content of soluble cation organic complex remediate back contamination because the al30 organic complex is insoluble at an appropriate ph condition liu et al 2021 iii for effective flocculation of surfactant micelle by making use of a high positive charge on the material and iv for simultaneous removal of suspended particles present in the effluent the method reflected two different phenomena depending on the sds concentration i in situ accommodation of sds on al30 aggregate was examined at sds concentration much below its cmc as time goes on continuous adsorption of sds without configuration change with the final dense sds aggregate was examined in this case fig 9 a ii when sds above its cmc was used the flocculation of pollutant bound micellar aggregate was examined it was followed by an interesting new feature of configuration eversion as the reaction time increase such that the micellar core exposed out and the surrounding adsorbed flocculant became a core as evidenced by tem elemental mapping and line scanning fig 9b thereby the resulting material had efficiently removed suspensions and partitioned phenolics depending on their log ko w simultaneously this study can be taken as a new venue for further study in the micro interfacial phenomena of amf furthermore the residual sds in the supernatant was found to enhance the biodegradation of the unbind pollutants in the treatment process by bacillus subtilis bacterium thus the use of residual monomer sds in the effluent as such auxiliary material to enhance mineralization of the remaining pollutants by bacterial action single step treatment less footprint and the simplicity of the operation will make this application cost effective eco compatible and more widespread the same method was applied to remove various dyes from textile mimetic wastewater demissie et al 2021b consistent with the above report simultaneous removal of dissolved dyes and suspensions was reported 3 6 multifunctional nano amphiphile as amf the above sections discuss the aggregation of surfactants and subsequent flocculation by flocculant injection in contrast this section introduces state of the art new amphiphilic nanocoagulant with a metal conjugate head component on long chain hydrocarbon fig 9c as an amf material liu et al 2019 synthesized a biomimetic new amphiphilic nanocoagulant a hydrocarbon with pre bound si al complexed head for single step removal of spectrum wastewater components there is a growing body of evidence that precipitation of multifunctional products during synthesis induced by the new functional groups negates the storage and dispersion ability wang et al 2016 zeng and park 2009 unfortunately the new amphiphilic nanocoagulant had shown stability for one year of storage at ph 4 0 and aluminum total alt 1 0 m however it had reflected decreased stability at high ph and increasing al concentration owing to the si and al components gelatinization under these conditions therefore by an acid base self assembly method and controlling the al concentration the conjugate of quaternary ammonium si al amphiphile can undergo self aggregation and results in a cationic si al complexed micellar surface shell and an eversible hydrophobic micellar core besides the hydrocarbon with ammonium si al complexes head shell mimics some small aqua animals structural eversion behavior during food preying and resting actinia is a spherical cylindrical shaped aquatic organism with tentacles that take back and extends its tentacle while resting and food preying respectively fig 9d moreover as the aqua behavior of this multifunctional nanocoagulant micelle aggregate resembles that of actinia it was named as spherical actinia like micellar coagulant amc according to liu et al al 2019 amc had demonstrated aggregation flocculation and configuration eversion behavior after attaining appropriate aqua conditions as a response to change in the water environment like actinia the aggregate micellar shell of such interesting material could hydrolyze into flocs destabilize and enmeshes aqua particulate matter and colloidal suspended particles whereas its core composed of the long chain with quaternary ammonium expose out and entraps small dissolved contaminants like tentacle outward extension by actinia fig 9d the authors evaluated the pollutant removal performance of amc using municipal secondary wastewater effluent compared to al2 so4 3 and fecl3 performance liu et al 2019 the result of this study shows that the synergistic effort of the amc shell and its core structure had demonstrated efficient performance over other inorganic coagulants and polymeric polyelectrolyte polydadmac i e removal of turbidity 90 significant removal improvement 90 of dissolved organic carbon doc and no3 as well as total phosphorus tp all 90 fig 10 a however conventional coagulants were underperformed with the removal rate of tp 8 68 doc 30 54 turbidity 87 98 and negligible no3 removal consistent with other studies gao et al 2021 haberkamp et al 2007 lacasa et al 2011 ritigala et al 2021 besides irrespective of hydrophobicity and other diverse properties of pollutants amc achieved over 90 removal of all tested emerging pharmaceutical and micropollutant contaminants contrary to the removal by conventional coagulants fig 10b cho chon chos and chons species were the predominant constituent of such organic micropollutants in the raw water as detailed in fig 10c based on their heteroatoms o n and s number furthermore the authors suggested that adjusting amc dosage allows meeting water quality standards thus amc could be expanded as a powerful purification technology advances in aqua treatment 4 significance challenges and future opportunities of amf as shown in previous sections of this review amf is a promising versatile strategy used to rapidly remove various organic pollutants of human hazard efficiently from water even at a high concentration as reported in several studies it is an energy intensive process than other surfactant mediated water treatment processes however the state of the art amf working process has often been investigated in bench scale operations and has not been espoused as a standard technique in industrial and domestic wastewaters treatment despite there are some attempts at cascading amf for organic contaminants and selective cations removal from real wastewater with analogous removal efficiency with commercialized model systems but as of yet the approach has no longer been adopted in large scale water treatment plants except the attempt on the continuous pilot scale operation by sun et al 2008 as the amf process shows great technological promise in order to further develop the industrial application it is an essential step in establishing the feasibility of pilot scale scale up to a full scale commercial process however some of the aforementioned drawbacks have to be addressed and properly overcome in a way described in the previous sections see sections 3 3 1 to 3 3 5 before industrial scalability might be possible although biosurfactants with giant micelles low cmc and bio flocculants with very good binding properties are needed there are still a limited number of such investigations and the available bioproducts are limited it is apparent that the reuse recycling of both flocculant and surfactant for a full scale process is worthy both in terms of sustainability and economic viability nevertheless the required processes for the recycling of surfactants that have been reported by different studies are still complicated there remained a growing trend of efficiently recycling auxiliary noble organics surfactants or ingredients of biomass besides micellar catalysis adsorption oxidation selective removal of valuable solutes by using ligands and residual contaminant biodegradation have been reported to improve the efficiency unfortunately these studies were carried out batchwise but the scaling up of amf allows for the development of a continuously operatable unit process in which the oxidant catalyst or polyelectrolytes used are recycled with the flocculates however efficient recycling of surfactants catalysis flocculants and oxidant as well as the recovery of solutes particularly for the large scale application have not received a great deal of attention thus further progress should be made to optimizing testing and validating the feasibility and economic viability of material recovery recycling for pilot scale or industrial recyclability attention should also be paid to promoting the application of bio flocculant and large micellar biosurfactants furthermore extensive studies should be conducted on a large scale application and recycling of novel multi functional amphiphilic noncoagulant described in section 3 6 including toxicological studies because such a product is very new 5 conclusion as discussed by the multiple examples of surfactants and their applications in this review flocculation of surfactant micelles which allows either removal of pollutant solutes from aqueous solutions or their recovery with the process known as adsorptive micellar flocculation amf have been studied extensively in the field of environmental remediation when ionic surfactants are saturated at the water air interface a thermodynamically smart nanosized aggregate structure micelle containing surfactant monomers will form in aqueous media such a smart nanosized anionic surfactant micelle with a versatile environment allows efficient partitioning of hazardous solute gradient from bulk solution and can be separated together by assisting with flocculants the selection of appropriate process conditions salinity ph temperature surfactant properties nagg chain length cmc biodegradability flocculant type simplex metal ion polycation bio based and flocculation capacity is crucial to a successful application of amf the method has been applied to remove a variety of solutes ions organics dyes etc in which the desired interaction between solute and the anionic surfactant established and could result in enrichment factors 98 such high efficiency is not only limited to single solutes but can be extended to mixtures of pollutants in aqueous solutions ionized nonionized organics dyes multiple ions due to diverse micro interfacial phenomena and interaction between solute micelle and flocculant in the process of amf other associated phenomena such as micellar catalysis and adsorptive oxidation can be considered to supplement the removal efficiency as non flocculated surfactants lose during the amf process ways of reducing the lost monomers or alternative surfactants have been highlighted including the use of surfactant possessing unsaturated chain biosurfactants polymer surfactant complexation biodegradation coprecipitation and additives marble dust magnesium chloride with the advantages of being eco friendly high security non toxicity operational simple innocuity high efficiency and biodegradability over flocculant traditional flocculants microbial seed or leaf extracts and polymeric nanocluster flocculants have been summarized it was expected over the next few decades that the mentioned approaches particularly the novel metal conjugate multifunctional amphiphiles will be adapted in large scale treatment

16750,among various aqua remediation technologies separation aims at cleaning pollutants by isolating them despite their destruction solutes can also be recovered after the process adsorptive micellar flocculation amf has been known as an important surfactant based technique to separate poorly water soluble hazardous pollutants from aqua media as an efficient and energy intensive replacement for other surfactant based techniques as such amf should be known amf is based on the partitioning of solutes gradient from bulk solution into the nanosized smart anionic surfactant micelle followed by flocculation however unlike coagulation flocculation or adsorption amf is not viable for the production of drinking water in water utilities due to the loss of surfactant monomers unfortunately it can be used as a reservoir or for the recycling recovery of organic pollutants intermediates ions organics bioactive dyes etc even at high concentrations the performance of amf depends on various parameters and this review briefly summarizes the existing researches on different pollutants removal by amf and material recovery recycling this includes operating condition factors surfactants flocculants surfactant flocculant or surfactant pollutant concentration ratio and water conditions chemistry because varieties of micro interfacial phenomena other than physical interactions occur in a versatile micellar environment in the amf process emphases are given to adsorptive oxidation micellar catalysis selectivity furthermore for the first time this review gives an overview of understanding the state of the art multifunctional nano amphiphile based amf that behaves mimetic to aquatic organisms in the process of pollutant removal the efficiency of amf including recycling concentrated solution without noticeable deterioration as an auxiliary resource income for the next cycle signifies economic viability versatility and manifold applications in aqua remediation significance ways to achieve enhanced process efficiency as well as challenges and future opportunities in wastewater treatment are also highlighted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorptive micellar flocculation amf anionic surfactants micellar catalysis selectivity recycling 1 introduction methods for purification of steadily increasing organic pollutants from water are categorized as approaches that isolate the organic solutes and those that destroy them despite its advantage the destruction process costly in some cases does not allow the recovery of auxiliary products and is limited to the formation of secondary pollutants generation of toxic secondary products whereas physicochemical separation methods are accompanied by mere transfer of the pollutants from the bulk to another media rather than pollutant destruction thus solutes recycling and recovery at the end of the process could be possible there is thus a mounting need for a technological solution innovative and efficient against the challenges of the efficient removal and recycling problem of aqua soluble pollutants cecon et al 2021 pakdel et al 2021 in recent years a considerable amount of investigations have been conducted in searching for a surfactant based non classical separation technology of target solutes from water at a reasonable cost and with a tolerable impact on the environment peredo mancilla and dominguez 2016 saveyn et al 2008 shen et al 2015 talens alesson et al 2010 the ability of surfactants in materials surface modification liu et al 2020 ma et al 2021 xi et al 2005 xiao et al 2020 ion floatation hoseinian et al 2018 peng et al 2019 polat and erdogan 2007 reyes et al 2009 assisting with drug delivery bowker and stahl 2008 kaur et al 2016 mathias et al 1996 assisting with catalysis sorella et al 2015 zhan et al 2017 dispersion and emulsification bao et al 2019 lin et al 2007 vaisman et al 2006 made them significant entities for environmental application among surfactant based applications a separation process via surfactant micelle enhanced flocculation namely adsorptive micellar flocculation amf has been investigated for wastewater cleaning for over 20 years ever since the 1998s when talens et al 1998 proposed micellar flocculation some years after somasundara first introduced alcl3 precipitation redissolution behavior in anionic surfactant solution somasundaran et al 1988 since then the removal of poorly water soluble organics and metal ions by flocculation of micelles has been widely investigated demissie et al 2021b saitoh et al 2014c talens alesson et al 2004 wang et al 2019 a micellar artifact composed of liquid crystal and random fragments of the crystal is easily flocculable and filterable during its formation it can entrap organic pollutants present in water by selection of an appropriate surfactant micelle for cationic pollutants adsorption on its surface pereira et al 2014 r f p 2011 2010 or solubilization of hazardous organic bioactive solutes amf can be applied for the removal of both inorganic cations and organic compounds shen et al 2016 the main advantages of amf are micellar flocculate with the random fragments of liquid crystal gives a versatile and powerful ground for binding varieties of solutes anthony and talens alesson 2007a enables very rapid removal saitoh et al 2017 2014c 2011 and provides a capacity to remove high pollutant concentration talens alesson et al 2006 ease of operation and low energy demand compared with other surfactant assisted methods also grasp considerable attention the efficiency of amf is not based on simple relations rather it depends on a variety of parameters for example co solutes operating conditions surfactant type and solution chemistry many investigations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of amf and how those parameters influence its efficiency shen et al 2016 however amf fails to achieve the principle to use one chemical to consume completely a target chemical that is hazardous toxic or valuable because the process releases into the supernatant a non flocculated surfactant on the order of magnitude of the critical micelle concentration cmc of the amphiphile used talens alesson et al 2006 besides if different pollutants are present together amf suffers from selective removal of target solutes to this end amf is preferred to treat concentrated pollutants than a dilute stream as amf shows great technological promise due to the fact that it has good potential to recycle and recover the flocculant surfactants and the targeted pollutant anthony and talens alesson 2007b there is a serious attempt in scaling up from bench scale to a continuously operated unit piolet scale at a commercial scale nevertheless amf has not been commercialized yet which might be due to the scarcity of enough evidence on its process optimization as experimental parameters for individual systems are to be selected on the basis of existing conditions there are no universal experimental conditions that can be cascaded and best fit the amf process in different wastewater conditions substantial understanding of those extensively studied methods has paramount importance in this regard however of particular concern are 1 recycling and recovery of auxiliary components as it may ultimately be related with the economic viability and environmental risk of the process 2 a means of using a prominently lower concentration of surfactant since monomers at the concentration equal to the surfactant cmc are often present in supernatant and 3 selective removal of precious solute in the presence of other similar species such a compiled article in the amf process is scarce in the literature hence this review first provides an overview of basic amf principles after introduced surfactants micelles and micelle assisted separations to that end the literature results on solute removal efficiency and operating conditions specifically by amf process are summarized including selective removal of target solute micelle assisted catalysis and recovery recycling of solutes flocculants and surfactants secondly the review highlights the state of the art application of multifunctional nano amphiphile based amf for single step removal of a spectrum of pollutants behaving mimetic to small aquatic animals so far no comprehensive review of it has been reported in the literature 2 surfactants and micelle surfactants have special amphiphilic properties because they possess a lipophobic head and a lipophilic chain tail group with a robust affinity for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds solvents the lipophilic nonpolar tail group typically consists of a long alkyl or alkyl aryl chain with 10 to 20 carbon atoms chen et al 2020 the head group either consists of a charged moiety or a nonionic moiety based on the constituent molecule the surfactants head moiety bears different charges accordingly there are cationic anionic and nonionic classes of surfactants chat et al 2019 there is another class called zwitterionic surfactant if the head group holds both anionic and cationic centers amphoteric behavior at different ph besides surfactants may have more than one head moiety and may include more than one hydrocarbon chain tail group fig 1 if two hydrophilic parts of surfactant are connected by spacer near the head group it is thought of twine gemini surfactant and bola surfactants or bolaforms in case the two head group of similar or different charges are connected by hydrophobic chain s due to polar apolar dual nature surfactants adsorb diffuse between water air or water oil interface at their low concentration level the interfacial diffusion of surfactants intermediary increases the interfacial area by dropping the surface tension of water air of the phase boundary and water oil interfacial tension demissie and duraisamy 2016 liu et al 2021 as a result surfactants can be used as dispersants detergents wetting foaming agents and emulsifiers in several applications when surfactants are saturated at the interface they self assemble aggregate into a thermodynamically smart structure due to the interactions with the solvent surfactants assemble in bulk to micelle above a certain concentration called cmc which can be identified by a significant attenuation of conductivity surface tension st or osmotic pressure measurement because all of them continue to change before the vicinity of the cmc point is reached as shown in fig 2 the solution conductivity increase and water surface tension decrease by increasing the concentration of both cetylpyridinium chloride cpc and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab aggregation of surfactants is favored by the tendency of their tails to minimize the free energy of interaction with the polar phase such that their hydrophobic moieties are being expelled from the polar solvent pan et al 2016 spiering et al 2021 consequently hydrophilic head groups are in contact with the surrounding aqueous phase at the outer surface or interface and the long chain tail part forms a micellar core having hydrophobic nature the reverse phenomenon occurs in non polar solvents besides solvent polarity other factors like temperature ionic strength and pressure alter the micellar aqueous phase for example chen et al 2020 reported a u shaped plot of mc with increasing temperature in this respect while the generated micelle aggregate has higher order lower entropy than the monomers the micellar surroundings generally present a more disordered configuration higher entropy this change due competition of interfacial energy suggests that cmc fig 2 can be used to get evidence on the thermodynamic parameters of the micellization the standard gibbs free energy of micellization δ g m i c 0 can be described as δ g m i c 0 rt in x c m c where r is a gas constant x c m c implies mole fraction of cmc and t is absolute temperature the slop of pre micelle plot fig 2 can also be used instead of x c m c to determine the free enegry as well as surfcae excess concentration demissie and duraisamy 2016 2 1 structure of micelle the concurrent spontaneous assembly of amphiphiles either involves geometric packing micelle or phase separation through competitive interactions the extent of micellization and interfacial adsorption of surfactants with respect to microenvironmental or structural factors can be conveniently determined by the ratio of cmc c20 its increase inhibits micellization table 1 where c20 is the surfactant concentration that corresponds to 20 dyn cm reduction of the solvent surface tension rosen and kunjappu 2012 a geometric assembly by multiple amphiphiles generates a diversity of complex nano architectures aggregation number nagg and size of micelles liu et al 2015 lombardo et al 2015 depending on the hydrated head moiety cross sectional area counterions the tail group diameter the flow conditions as well as the number of head and tail group ghosh et al 2020 the packing parameter cpp eq 1 can be used to predict the morphology of the resulting microstructure 1 c pp v l a 0 where a0 represents the effective cross sectional area of the head group v and l stand for the incompressible monomer hydrophobic segment volume and its length respectively engberts and hoekstra 1995 a summary of the amphiphile aggregate architecture predicted from the cpp is presented in fig 3 2 2 surfactant mediated separation process such surfactant various types aggregates enable encapsulation and solubilize lipophilic and bioactive molecules into the hydrophobic site dar and chat 2015 this spontaneous dissolution of molecules micellar solubilization is governed by reversible interactions between solubilizate and amphiphilic aggregates to form a thermodynamically stable isotropic solution therefore it is pertinent to mention that depending on the polarity degree of hydration and micro viscosity of different surfactants microstructure sites and the nature of solutes maswal and dar 2014 solubilizate can be retained at distinct microenvironments in the aggregate fig 4 a at the core corona and the interface between core and corona chat et al 2011 dar and chat 2015 besides co solubilization between solutes could enhance their micellar solubilization accordingly dar and chat 2015 reported enhanced solubilization of warfarin wf and coumarin30 c30 solute mixture in three different surfactant micelle than their single solute solubilization fig 4a owing to the solutes co solubilization therefore the solubilization efficiency in micelle depends upon those aforementioned factors affecting the aggregation structures of surfactants and the structure of solubilizate different types of interaction involve during solubilization depending on the nature of the solute and the aggregate site fig 4b various surfactant aggregate based separation technologies for aqua remediation have been investigated for several years three of which have fascinated a great deal of research attention fig 5 a c amf admicellar chromatography also called surfactant mediated admicelle sma and micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf since introduced by dunn et al 1985 meuf technology has been used and demonstrated strong potential in removing various pollutants from wastewater acero et al 2017 ahmad et al 2006 anis et al 2020 chowdhury et al 2019 dharupaneedi et al 2019 parakala et al 2019 verma and sarkar 2020 the main principle is effective size enlargement of contaminants due to solubilization or bound onto micelles fig 5b they can then be retained by ultrafiltration uf membrane de and mondal 2012 schwarze 2017 the main advantages of meuf compared to conventional uf are simultaneous removal of inorganic ions and organic solutes too small to be rejected by uf membrane via ionic or hydrophobic interactions with a micelle even at lower concentrations recovery of surfactants with a low cmc rather meuf is not a very simple process as its performance is susceptible to a variety of parameters and it has some limitations such as back contamination by amphiphile monomers low tolerance to ionic strength fluctuation a low selectivity pressure derived process and membrane fouling schwarze 2017 sma an immobilized surfactant layer based non membrane driven approach developed by allowing surfactants to aggregate on heterogeneous and porous materials in which the surfactant immobilized hydrophobic layer admicelle hemimicelle on the solid surface fig 5a can be used as two dimensional solvents sorbent for robust adsolubilization of organic pollutants within an admicelle of a solid liquid interface as an alternative of activated carbons acs adak et al 2006 bayram et al 2020 hailu et al 2017 ma et al 2021 pal and pal 2017 paria and khilar 2004a peredo mancilla and dominguez 2016 although sma has the advantage of surfactant recycling and the organics concentration in the admicelle phase viz ph management there exist considerable drawbacks such as the need for a continual feeding of surfactant surfactant back contamination sensitivity to ph and salinity and need for extended agitation in addition it has a relatively low adsorption kinetics processing capacity 3 adsorptive micellar flocculation amf amf is a two step filterable surfactant based separation process by which polyvalent cations with a high tendency al3 ba2 fe3 ca2 or la3 adsorb on the micellar surface of some suitable anionic surfactants followed by flocculation in this process the phenomena of micellization before flocculation play a significant role it is obvious that flocculation is a non equilibrium phenomenon and is basically limited by the rate of collisions like precipitation reaction micellization occurs when the aqueous phase concentration reaches a specific value chen et al 2020 however micellization could be interpreted from the thermodynamic equilibrium standpoint that the competition between the solvent water with micellar core interfacial energy and conformational disruption energy of soluble chain hydrophilic of surfactants stemming from the micellar center drive the self assembly and micellization lombardo et al 2015 as described in section 2 the energy change δ g m i c 0 when one mole of surfactant transferred from solution to its aggregate phase can be described as a function of mole fraction of cmc x c m c owing to the hydrophobic effect of the non polar moiety of surfactants the change in entropy of micellization which can be drived from van t hoff equation is generally positive and it is this which makes the spontaneity of the micellization process negative δ g m i c 0 however the spontaneity could still be attenuated by other parameters mentioned above as a result the optimization of factors affecting the micellization process should be taken into consideration while considering amf for optimal removal of solute from water in the amf process anionic solutes bind or complex with the bound cation s and molecular solutes can solubilize in versatile micellar pseudo phase talens et al 1998 as the cations neutralize or reduce the micellar effective surface charge the soluble solutes pollutants containing micelle are quickly flocculate together as amorphous floc fig 5c then the resulting flocs tend to precipitate and separate by gravity settling or a coarse filter thus providing an interesting simple alternative separation technique to both high agitation energy demanding sma based film polymerization and high pressure driven meuf methods pato morales and talens alesson 2000 in addition it has been studied that the removal efficiency of amf per unit mass of the amphiphiles is fifty times that of sma porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 and has fast kinetics saitoh et al 2017 2014c 2011 unlike meuf the process undertaken is pretty easy and requires less dosage of amphiphiles than meuf wang et al 2019 the basic principles of amf solute solubilization by micelle and the subsequent flocculation in amf is not a single process besides the aggregation of micelles differs from micellar enlargement as known to take place generally in the transition from micellar solutions to the liquid crystal the governing principles in the mechanism of insolubilization of surfactants aggregates in the presence of cations the precipitation of the monomers and other phenomena are as follows i micelles contain charged regions called diffused and stream inner layers fig 5d among them the stream layer paton morales and talens alesson 2002 in which the majority of flocculant ions are tightly bound is very important to explain amf when the micelle stern and diffuse layer surface binds with cation al3 or fe3 high cation concentration across the layer leads to suppressing the intermicellar repulsions or reducing the micellar zeta potential to a value of zero and rapidly flocculate the micelles as disordered aggregate by shielding the surface charge in other word an intuitive description of amf follows grosberg et al 2002 model i e the phenomena can be explained by the interplay between repulsion and attraction of flocculant ions and cells micelles in addition to the pollutant chemical gradient from the bulk solutions the final aggregate with fragments of liquid crystal inlaid contains an amorphous structure spongy and sometimes buoyant porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 in some cases amf may be perceived as a mere flocculation coagulation process ii the high cation concentration enables organic target compounds to associate as a complex of non polar nature and or an ion pair across the stern diffuse layer thus favors binding of them into a micellar interior and on a spot of amorphous positive surface charges on the flocculates respectively talens alesson et al 2004 such a complexation can be a reason for significant flocculation of organic anions like phenolate benzoate dissociated 2 4 d dichlorophenoxy acetic acid at their lower concentration talens alesson et al 2006 iii it may be accompanied by an extension of a rheologically bound to the micelle region from the stern diffuse layer to portions of the diffuse layer this phenomenon may lead to having apparent excesses of positive charge by turn either bind upon itself target solutes and or behaves as adsorption substrate for organics talens alesson 2003 the process may be well described by guoy chapman stern isotherms talens alesson et al 2002 iv the synergistic effect of flocculation and interestingly redox reaction oxidation may occur simultaneously when cationic flocculant like fe3 with redox properties are used in this case the concentration of anionic pollutants on the micelle could therefore cause the partial or total oxidation of them talens alesson 2003 3 1 amphiphiles and metal cations for amf a glance at history anionic surfactants particularly sodium alkyl benzene sulfonates table 2 have been extensively used in the amf process among many available surfactants may be because of the following reasons i they have already been used and their efficiency has been proven in other surfactant mediated processes which also helps to compare their performance with the available literature results schwarze 2017 ii most are readily biodegradable bautista toledo et al 2014 beltra et al 2000 bondi et al 2015 sa and me 2012 or commercially available in high quality iii they have high aggregation number coll 1970 paria and khilar 2004b ease of their flocculation reversal hernáinz and calero 2001 or applicability for closed loop process reusability of their residual amount for mineral collection talens alesson et al 2010 and high equilibrium interaction constant with solutes adak et al 2005 gokturk and tuncay 2003 among various metal salt ions trivalent al3 and fe3 m are found to enhance micellar flocculation to a high extent and generate amorphous floc with variable stoichiometry m 1 x na3x ds 3 n porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 talens et al 1998 their flocculation or micellar charge neutralization capacity is usually determined by ζ potential measurement as a consequence of the change in the micellar surface charge by adsorbed cations sedimentation of charged micellar colloidal particles as a result these flocculants have been used to treat contaminated water and for the removal of concentrated surfactant from seawater by means of the amf approach sˇvab et al 2008 3 2 factors affecting the performance of amf this section outlines the materials used experimental conditions and their influence on the performance of amf including parameters affecting the surfactant aggregation and structure 3 2 1 surfactants and flocculants for the efficiency of the amf process the dream surfactant for the process should have the following properties stable large micelles with low cmc high aggregation number high solubilization capacity for the solute and biodegradable unfortunately finding a surfactant in line with these requirements at the same time could be difficult however the requirement can be compensated by finding conditions for a good surfactant solute interaction besides the concentration of surfactants and flocculants has been known to affect the zero point of micellar region zeta potential and the corresponding removal of solutes during micelle flocculation cavalcante et al 2018 and wang et al 2019 evaluated the removal of phenol and benzene derivatives respectively by increasing the concentration of surfactants the results show that the removal was increased up to a certain surfactant concentration might be the cmc region under insufficient micellar flocculation a high concentration of surfactants remains in bulk with a shallow binding potential for solutes for instance pato morales and talens alesson 2000 pioneered that flocculation would not occur at sufficiently high sds concentration in agreement with the stellner scamehorn model apart from the micellar structural change with an excess surfactant displacement of the solubilized solute by surfactant monomers restabilization would occur and ultimately impair the organic solute removal efficiency cavalcante et al 2018 saitoh et al 2014c yang et al 2016 the nature of surfactants and flocculants also affects the performance of amf according to talens et al 1998 it is remarkable that while sdbs efficiently precipitates at high al3 concentration only about 10 of sds barely underwent flocculation under the same high flocculant concentration besides the value of fe3 required to reach the full flocculation region of sds micelle has been known to be twice that of al3 talens alesson et al 2002 beyond the optimum surfactant flocculate ratio of the flocculation region there exists less flocculation of surfactants but does not cause an additional noticeable effect at higher co solute concentration due to micellar swelling pato morales and talens alesson 2000 it is detailed in section 3 3 1 owing to the micellar surface competition of solutes with flocculant cations the presence of an excess target solute in the media humpers the performance of amf cavalcante et al 2018 therefore finding appropriate surfactant and flocculant type and an optimum concentration for the full flocculation region is vital in the application of amf 3 2 2 temperature it is obvious that conditions responsible for cmc decrease are important to increase solute solubilization and reduce back contamination of effluent by surfactant monomers such conditions can be attained by a moderate increase of temperature as it affects the free energy of micellization pereira et al 2009 which then would improve the balance between solute solubilization and surfactant monomer concentration in the effluent however at a very high temperature the cmc increases and negates the solute incorporation into the micelle pereira et al 2010 valente et al 2006 accordingly cavalcante et al 2018 reported maximum removal of phenol between 35 and 40 c at constant surfactant concentration with minimum removal at 50 c however the effect of temperature in amf performance is governed by the hydrophilicity of counterions and the concentration of electrolytes in the media manet et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 the effect of temperature on the pollutant sorption capacity of the micelle can also be extended to the phase transition phenomenon of the surfactant as shown in fig 6 a surfactants dissolved in water generally present a kraft temperature tk or a cloud point the thermal point below which surfactants are insoluble and amphiphile aggregates are in the state of restricted motion however by raising the temperature beyond tk the micellar and lamellar phases transfer to a more flexible form known as a thermotropic liquid crystalline phase lombardo et al 2015 which influences the solute sorption capacity of amf micelle before flocculation van der meeren et al 2015 examined relative 70 improvement of phenol sorption by dioctadecyl dimethylammonium chloride dodac upon increasing the temperature from 20 c to 40 c with a slight decline above the surfactant tk 37 5 c it might be due to dodac aggregate transition from gel to liquid crystalline state when the phase transition temperature tm is approached the solute molecule sorption sites in the micelle become more easily reachable and permeable because of more disordering of the surfactant hydrophobic chains as the thermal region reaches the vicinity of the tm point similarly saveyn et al 2008 showed increased sorption of methyl benzyl alcohol by increasing the temperature of dodac media it is not surprising that in the presence of electrolytes tm is not constant because ionic strength and temperature have antagonistic contributions to the cmc pereira et al 2009 as a result it is worth mentioning that maintaining their balance will lead to efficient micellization and subsequently bring high solute sorption efficiency micelle size can also be influenced by temperature as this schwarze 2017 evaluated the effect of increasing temperature on a micellar size decrease 3 2 3 ph the effect of ph ph adjustment on the uptake of solutes due to the interaction between ionizable organic pollutants and mesoporous ionic liquid crystalline media like micelle is an important research topic sabatino et al 2012 it is mainly because a ph affects the dissociation of basic and acidic solutes b affects the surface charge of the micelle as well as electrostatic interaction between solute and the micelle c the growing body of evidence on the insufficiency of only octanol water partition coefficient log ko w to predict the interaction of target solutes with the amphiphile aggregates lukacova et al 2006 and d ph adjustment could be taken as cost effective alternative technique compared to the process cost associated with solute sorption enhancement by temperature and solute surfactant concentration optimization however the stability of surfactants is sensitive to ph change as they are synthesized by saponification of fatty acid at pka 9 it indicates the necessity of ph optimization to the value lower than surfactant dissociation ph as such increasing removal of phenol direct yellow 27 dye and reactive blue 14 dye by increasing the ph unto below the dissociation ph of surfactant was reported cavalcante et al 2018 melo et al 2015 2018 in addition ph affects the hydrolysis of metal salt cations and their interaction with the micellar surface and ionizable solutes accordingly almeida and talens alesson 2006 observed re solubilization of phenol at high ph as a result of inefficient micellar flocculation associated with al salt hydrolysis to amorphous floc in general for ionizable solutes removal by al3 salts as a flocculant the range between low acid and weak basic ph has been reported to be a more convenient condition saitoh et al 2014b 2014c talens alesson et al 2002 moreover such a ph effect on re solubilization and flocculation in the amf process can be employed for the recycling of the chemicals as shall be discussed in the later sections 3 2 4 electrolytes generally most industries laden electrolytes to their effluent water in non trivial concentrations allègre et al 2006 as electrolytes affect the tk morphology structure of surfactant micelle δ g m i c 0 manet et al 2013 pereira et al 2010 2009 it is crucial to investigate the effect of electrolytes on the performance of amf the removal of various target solutes by a new type of base soap bs surfactant and ca2 based amf upon increasing the concentration of electrolytes has been investigated cavalcante et al 2018 melo et al 2015 2018 the authors found that the removal efficiency of the solutes decreased drastically with the increase in the solute concentration as per noïk et al 1987 and stellner and scamehorn 1989 investigation this phenomenon should be due to the tolerance of surfactant to precipitate by ca2 in the presence of increasing electrolytes concentration nacl such an increase in na negates the ionization extent of bs na rcoo making the micellization and consequently hinder the interaction of ca2 with the surfactant and narrowing of the full flocculation region of the micelle the same phenomenon of decreased micellar flocculation was reported by using al3 flocculant paton morales and talens alesson 2001 besides the exceeded increase in electrolyte concentration enables the surfactant precipitation however such precipitate has a low sorbing potential for pollutants compared to the amorphous micellar flocs melo et al 2015 in addition several key factors such as the contact time floc settling time stirring speed and optimum air flow rate have also been known to affect the removal efficiency of solutes by amf sun et al 2008 compared to conventional coagulation flocculation amf does not demand rapid and prolonged stirring as these humpers the diffusion of target solutes from the bulk to micellar sites and by turn impair their removal cavalcante et al 2018 porras rodrigu and talense alesson 1999 porras and talens 1999 regarding contact time a very prolonged time has been known to have a determinantal effect particularly in removing target solutes with a high aqua affinity melo et al 2015 2017 generally the above large number of researches and investigations is an indication of interest in amf amf as a promising method has not only the advantage of avoiding the use of membranes and overpressure compared to meuf but also rejected fraction has a much lower content in water flocculate weight of 50 and 5 of effluent volume than membrane based surfactant enhanced filtration talens alesson et al 2006 ease of operation high efficiency rapidity of the process the possibility of operation at room temperature the use of easily available chemicals and biodegradability of the residual surfactants like sds by riverine microbes are the other advantages melo et al 2018 saitoh et al 2014b 2011 talens alesson et al 2010 2002 nevertheless despite coagulation flocculation amf is not liable for the production of drinking water in water utilities however it can be used as a reservoir or for the recycling and recovery of scarcely water soluble organic pollutants and their intermediates in the chemical process industries at high concentrations thousands of ppm if applied for water with diluted pollutants the surfactant leakage in the effluent may lead to high pollution instead of the target solute removal low removal selectivity and poor biodegradability of some surfactants are the other drawbacks shen et al 2016 3 3 approaches toward amf performance improvement as a result of the aforementioned drawbacks including the so called monomers back contamination many investigations have been conducted to overcome the main bottlenecks for the highest possible and cost effective removal of organic pollutants 3 3 1 surfactant selection the use of surfactants containing olefine hydrophobic chain with the ability to delocalize the π electrons through the neighboring olefine chain has been proved to cross link the micellar monomer chains viz slight irradiation fig 6b the cross linking generates the new stable nano sized aggregate and minimizes the surfactant monomer concentration in the solution chen et al 2017 because the free monomers prefer to join the stable aggregate phase then the subsequent flocculation of the crosslinked micelles stably enables the partition of pollutant solutes from the effluent water in contrast to classical surfactants the use of anionic surfactants obtained by the saponification of natural products like animal fat and vegetable oil have got prominence as alternative surfactants due to the environmental compatibility of the deflocculated surfactant monomers in a recent study cavalcante et al 2018 employed bs synthesized from natural sources and naoh accordingly 60 phenol removal was achieved by using ca2 salt as a flocculant in another study melo et al 2018 used bs of various chain lengths to extract reactive blue 14 dye and reported 86 removal at optimum conditions the same conclusion was drawn by using bs and ca2 salt as a flocculant to separate direct yellow 27dye melo et al 2017 2015 the concentration of surfactant used in these studies was relatively higher than the synthetic surfactants might be either due to the nature of the new surfactants or the flocculant used precipitation of micelle using ca2 has been studied however micelles according to somasundaran et al 1988 have some ability to prevent precipitation the model developed by stellner and scamehorn 1989 predicted that precipitation occurs only in the presence of further excess calcium ions after the micelle is saturated with ca2 that is a different scenario than fe3 and al3 in another study talens alesson 1999 compared micellar flocculation with ca and al ions in this case concomitant with the schulze hardy rule estimation the ca 2 one order of magnitude greater than al 3 concentration was required to reach zero zeta potential from the conventional perspective of soap precipitation in the presence of hardness causing ions the demand for high ca2 concentration than al3 to precipitate surfactant is unexpected it is quite obvious that al 3 salts are far more aqua soluble than ca 2 salts from this point of view it could be hypothesized that lower ca2 concentrations would precipitate calcium surfactants soaps however ca2 induces micellar flocculation than monomer precipitation at the surfactant concentration higher than its cmc baviere et al 1983 peacock and matijević 1980 the above reported demand for high bs surfactant concentration with ca2 flocculant could be associated with this phenomenon and it would cause monomer equals to its cmc to be released into the effluent 3 3 2 use of bio flocculants the complexation of al ion with surfactant pollutants notably increases the aluminum concentration remained in the outlet water hereby considerable evidence exists that al is a potent neurotoxicant and its overexposure exert alzheimer s disease in humans which worsens human beings and other animals health flaten 2001 lei et al 2021 as such ferric salts could be used as an alternative flocculant in addition to calcium ion with the advantages of being eco friendly high security non toxicity operational simplicity innocuity high efficiency and biodegradability over traditional flocculants microbial bio flocculants mbfs with the ability to flocculate cells suspensions and colloids have progressively fascinated wide consideration recently zhang et al 2010 specifically microbial flocculant ga1 mbfga1 is a kind of microorganism paenibacillus polymyxa ga1 harvested from secondary metabolites of fermentation liquid huang et al 2019 2012 as per yang et al 2016 and huang et al 2019 mbfga1 has a linear long chain molecular structure possessing homogenous abundant functional groups with the weight of 1 18 106d apart from cells suspended and colloidal particle flocculation mbfga1 has been used in the amf process yang et al 2016 accordingly efficient removal of organic pollutants with minimum residual surfactant was achieved owing to a complex well stretched macromolecular polyelectrolytic polar matrix in ga1 fig 7 a c which is mimetic to extracellular polymeric substances eps mbfs are endowed with complex binding biosorption or bridging of organic and metal cations apart from the micellar flocculation capacity huang et al 2019 2012 however a nontrivial concentration of eps is remained in the effluent although mbfga1 has resulted in an environmentally tolerable concentration of cationic pollutants and residual surfactants in the effluent in addition natural flocculant coagulants such as starch tannins mucilages or several vegetable extracts have been proposed as efficient and eco friendly alternative products for the amf process research for more efficient natural flocculant has been continued to satisfy the environmental subjects and sustainability goal moringa oleifera seed extract has been found to be very interesting in flocculating sdbs micelle up to 80 although it presents a limit on its residual surfactant at a concentration in ppm beltrán heredia and sánchez martín 2009 besides undesirable characteristics of organic byproducts buildup during moringa oleifera based treatment necessitates more investigation of other likely natural flocculants ndabigengesere and subba narasiah 1998 in accord beltrán heredia et al 2009 applied natural tannin based extract tanfloc from acacia and revealed effective flocculation on micelle of an sdbs sodium lauryl sulfoacetate slsa sodium dodecyl diphenyl ether disulfonate sdded sodium nonylphenol sulfate sns sles sodium triethanolamine lauryl sulfate tea ls and sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate sdss 3 3 3 application of additives and biodegradation as discussed in the previous section by increasing surfactant concentration beyond cmc the effluent quality decline and back contamination continue to increase for instance talens alesson et al 2006 used mining waste marble dust as an auxiliary resource after the amf process to improve amf performance the result of their study demonstrated high refinement of the separation process by significantly reducing the flocculant loss and moderately reduce surfactant linkage in another approach saitoh et al 2007 introduced magnesium ii chloride into the aqueous mixture of sds and aluminum iii chloride in order to generate layered hydroxide structure by their ions hydrolysis and inside the layer containing the sds aggregate the result of their investigation shows that the region inside the impregnated hydroxide could stably retain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and minimize surfactant monomers in the effluent water although the efficiency depends on the cation sds ratio saitoh et al 2011 vasilescu et al 2004 besides the biodegradation process of residual pollutants as well as surfactants being applied increasingly bautista toledo et al 2014 bondi et al 2015 sa and me 2012 talens alesson et al 2006 since surfactants are proved to enhance bacterial activities and bioavailability of organic solutes zeng et al 2018 moreover saitoh et al 2014c conducted a laboratory scale experiment on co precipitation of sds with aluminum iii chloride by typically reducing their concentration to 80 ppm and 5 ppm respectively the study demonstrated nearly complete tetracycline removal viz the sorption of aluminum chelates ion pairs with ds sds ion on hydrophobic sds impregnated precipitate in the ph region nearly from 5 to 8 5 the result also confirmed rapid degradation of tetracycline collected to the precipitate using ultra violet light in a similar experiment of using sds dosage much below its cmc saitoh et al 2014b high efficiency of rapid cationic dyes removal was reported 3 3 4 polymer surfactant complexation and flocculation this method is based on the flocculation of surfactant polyelectrolyte complexes in which polymers and oppositely charged surfactants electrostatically interact with each other and can form nanosized assemblies or films of polymer surfactant aggregates psas as a floc shen et al 2016 the charged surfactant monomers in orders of magnitude lower than the cmc attach to the polyelectrolyte polymer chain in the form of mini hemi micelles then self flocculation of psas with bind pollutants that are large enough under an optimum condition can be separated by gravity settling or a coarse filter fig 7d for example shen et al 2015 employed poly ethylenimine pei and poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride polydadmac with sds to evaluate the removal of cd ii cr iii and zn ii priority metal pollutants from dilute solution for the first time according to the findings when 0 5 mm sds below its cmc was used injection of 40 ppm pei resulted in 99 removal of cd ii with the residual level as low as 10 ppb in another investigation saitoh et al 2014a applied 20 ppm of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah and an electrically equivalent amount of sds 62 ppm for the horseradish peroxidase hrp enhanced rapid removal of estrogens and phenolic compounds from water accordingly phenolic and less polar estrogen compounds were nearly completely incorporated into the hydrophobic regions formed by an aggregate of pah sds complexes and readily separated later saitoh et al 2017 designed an air bubbles based coagulation flotation system for rapid removal of tetracycline from water by using much less amount of sds and aluminum iii chloride in the presence of an electrically equivalent amount of poly allylamine hydrochloride pah polyelectrolyte the result shows that under the optimum conditions and with a typical concentration of 20 ppm sds 1 ppm al iii and 6 5 mg pah nearly complete removal of acidic and basic pharmaceuticals fluoroquinolone and tetracycline from aqua media was achieved within 5 min about 0 12 ppm of residual sds was achieved which is much lower compared to 0 2 ppm of total tolerable anionic surfactant concentration of japan s water regulation study area 3 3 5 improving selective removal the recovery of precious metals like gold from a mixture of waste constituting materials or other sources is recently a tool of vital importance in the context of metal entrapping amf provides a metal ion an oppositely charged micelle to bind on the surface and the resulting matrix is removed from the aqueous phase by a coarse filter or gravity settling however the approach needs modification to impart selectivity among verities of cations in the solution this approach can also be cascaded in the selective removal of small cationic organic species the introduction of a suitably complexing agent with cations like protonated pyridine 2 azo p dimethylaniline pada has been applied as an excellent entrapper of particular metal ions to micellar phases from their aqua mixture as well as for their recovery aydinoglu et al 2016 2014 ghezzi et al 2008 in this case the deprotonated form of pada replaces the negative ions from the metal salt and forming chelates with a positive charge it will then be electrostatically bound on a variety of negatively charged micelle surfaces and through hydrophobic interaction with interior micellar regions subsequently the metal ions could be efficiently collected out via a stripping reaction undertaken by using weakly acidic solutions of nacl under mild conditions ghezzi et al 2008 besides although polyvalent ions al3 are more amenable to bind on micelle than monovalent ions na the latter can rather change the hydrophobicity of micellar flocculate ghezzi et al 2008 and affects the extent of complexes formation upon it fig 8 a thus it improves the selective removal of organic pollutants from the mixture of different organic compounds with a different propensity for the micellar floc in accord anthony and talens alesson 2007b proposed halide salt of monovalent ions in the narrow flocculant concentration range for selective removal of two groups of organic compounds which rely primarily on hydrophobic interaction and or complex formation the result showed that adequate monovalent salt improved the hydrophobicity and enabled selective removal of organics with a high propensity for hydrophobicity from the mixture by limiting the removal efficiency of those relying on complex formation 3 4 recovery and recycling the predictability of the multi step separation of surfactant mediated process in removing attention grabbing solutes by amf has also been verified for example the result of predictability investigation on multi stage phenol removal by amf shows that the removal by amf requires a lower expenditure of sds than meuf techniques talens alesson et al 2006 the same trend of lower expenditure was favorably verified by comparing meuf and amf using surfactants with lower cmc values in addition talens alesson et al 2010 examined the effect of seven step amf process operating and mixing condition in the removal of phenol accordingly appropriate mixing condition of experimental artifacts of amf reduced the phenol concentration with an efficiency of 98 which is the highest and ever reported by surfactant mediated separation processes similarly sun et al 2008 conducted several amf experimental tests on a pilot plant scale study the results show that the removal efficiency of pollutants increased from 69 with the single operation to 78 by the second operation in amf and any other methods finding an appropriate application is similarly important as the modification strategy there has been an attempt for the treatment of soil extracts sˇvab et al 2008 and hospital wastewater anthony and talens alesson 2007b saitoh et al 2014c by amf moreover recycling the resource may signify the importance of this process according to the investigation of anthony and talens alesson 2007b the following sequential procedures would help for material recycling and recovery steps to be applied in the recycling of conventional amf a floc re dissolution in hot concentrated nacl solution or water at high concentration b dilution of concentrate obtained from step a in cold brine for amphiphile and cation re flocculation which help to the selective re incorporation of one of the pollutants from the concentrate c filtration of b to separate the floc from the supernatant d separation of the of pollutants in the filtrate for example by using hollow fiber extraction e repeating a for re dissolution of floc obtained after c f repeating c to separate selectively adsorbed solutes from flocculants g re flocculation of the concentrate amphiphile cation by dilution into the untreated effluent the change in the krafft point using ion exchange is the other strategy used for surfactant recovery in the amf process for example as an anionic surfactant the krafft point of sds is nearly 13 c but it could be increased to about 35 c after potassium salt injection in sds solution due to ion exchange with potassium reflecting the krafft point of the resulting kds pair as a result kds will precipitate at lower temperatures than sds schwarze 2017 as described in section 3 2 3 ph governs the solute incorporation into surfactant aggregates because it affects both solute dissociation and the micelle s surface charge thereby enhancing electrostatic interaction between them or leaching out the bound solutes into bulk besides section 3 3 4 describes the pollutants electrostatic interaction with psas as an essential tool in their removal as a further result ph adjustment by making use of the same excess of hydroxide or hydrogen ions is used to leach out the bound pollutants into the concentrated solution because they have been known to compete with and displace those bound ions after the recovery of organic ions or inorganic metal cations from the psas flocs the ph can be adjusted near the neutral condition to recycle polymers and surfactants because their charge is proton dependent fig 8b besides the cost efficiency of amf was evaluated by predictability investigation of a multi stage process and such recycling without noticeable deterioration of polyelectrolytes for the next cycle signifies economic viability and the sustainability of the process it is because pollutant containing concentrated solution can be taken as an income stream or an auxiliary resource apart from obtaining treated water although this technology appeared to have potential applications it is not applied yet for the removal and recovery of target solutes particularly in the large process 3 5 modification of amf and micro interfacial phenomena 3 5 1 co adsorption with oxidation it has been examined that the redox properties oxidative of iron can bring the synergistic effect of flocculation and destruction of pollutants during amf this happens if oxidant flocculants with opposite micellar polarity are used the micelle could increase the collision probability of the micelle bound pollutant with a cationic flocculant oxidant helping the electron relay from the oxidant into the pollutant bounded to the micelle kundu et al 2002 das et al 2001 investigated comparative studies to examine oxidation of ethanol and propan 1 ol using cr vi instead of al3 flocculant for cpc and sds micelle the result shows that partitioning of the alkanols to the micelle of sds was followed by enhanced oxidation by cr vi but cationic cpc inhibited their oxidation consistently the redox reaction involving a phenazinium dye ps evident that the bound sds micelle favored the location of the dye close to the micellar head groups thereby the reactivity of pulse radiolytically generated reducing radicals get increased gawandi et al 2002 it has also been evidenced that undesired photo chemical partial oxidization reactions involved at micellar bound organic ions aniline during the fe3 based amf process talens alesson 2003 in another effort similar oxidation phenomena without flocculation using hdtmab micelle in the presence of suspended tio2 for degradation of phenol 2 4 5 trichlorophenol and 2 5 dichlorophenol was carried out fabbri et al 2006 to this end the phenolics adsorption onto hdtmab modified tio2 enhanced their rapid decomposition under a mercury lamp photoreactor however the technique needs careful optimization of surfactant concentration due to competition of micelle and solute bound aggregate for substrate partitioning 3 5 2 micellar catalysis apart from solute solubilization partition the micelle of amf can be used as preferential partitioning media of the target solute catalysts and oxidants between the aqueous and micellar phases for example aqueous micellar media of cps and sds were used to evaluate the kinetics of d glucose oxidation by cr vi in the presence and absence of 2 2 bipyridine bayen et al 2005 while cpc had inhibited both the 2 20 bipyridine catalyzed and uncatalyzed redox reaction sds catalyzed the oxidation through both paths in similar research islam et al 2005 studied the oxidation of d fructose by cr vi using 2 2 bipyridyl bipy and 1 10 phenanthroline as a catalyst in sds and cpc micelle solution according to their findings using the same catalyst promoted 1 10 phenanthroline ethanol oxidation by hexavalent chromium had resulted in an accelerated generation of acetaldehyde in anionic surfactant sds media but cationic surfactant cpc media did not exhibit enhanced aldehyde generation saha et al 2011 in this pathway the complex of 1 10 phenanthroline cr vi in sds media oxidizes ethanol and turns to cr iii which can be recycled as described in section 3 5 a similar conclusion was drawn for catalyzed nucleophilic attack based oxidation of ethane 1 2 diol and propan 2 ol in sds micellar media ghosh et al 2012 ghosh et al 2012 in another study ru iii and cr vi were used to oxidize octanal and 2 propanol in acidic media of sds cpc and tx 100 chowdhury et al 2020 2019 the results show that sds paired with oxidative cations had the best catalytic activities furthermore an experiment on micelle catalyzed reduction of methylene blue was conducted talens alesson 2003 however there still remains a need to mitigate the drawbacks such as a need for an influent pretreatment step for suspension removal and minimize the amount of flocculant organic complex contents 3 5 3 polycationic nanocluster based amf besides soluble cation organic complex generation talens alesson et al 2004 the cations al3 fe3 in situ hydrolyze to a myriad aquaoxyhydroxo species non flocculate in contrast recently we have designed a method based on a pre hydrolyzed polycationic aluminum nanocluster al30 as a flocculant in sds media below its cmc to remove various phenolic compounds from water demissie et al 2021a the nanocluster was chosen primely for the following reasons i to minimize control the in situ hydrolyzed species ii to reduce the content of soluble cation organic complex remediate back contamination because the al30 organic complex is insoluble at an appropriate ph condition liu et al 2021 iii for effective flocculation of surfactant micelle by making use of a high positive charge on the material and iv for simultaneous removal of suspended particles present in the effluent the method reflected two different phenomena depending on the sds concentration i in situ accommodation of sds on al30 aggregate was examined at sds concentration much below its cmc as time goes on continuous adsorption of sds without configuration change with the final dense sds aggregate was examined in this case fig 9 a ii when sds above its cmc was used the flocculation of pollutant bound micellar aggregate was examined it was followed by an interesting new feature of configuration eversion as the reaction time increase such that the micellar core exposed out and the surrounding adsorbed flocculant became a core as evidenced by tem elemental mapping and line scanning fig 9b thereby the resulting material had efficiently removed suspensions and partitioned phenolics depending on their log ko w simultaneously this study can be taken as a new venue for further study in the micro interfacial phenomena of amf furthermore the residual sds in the supernatant was found to enhance the biodegradation of the unbind pollutants in the treatment process by bacillus subtilis bacterium thus the use of residual monomer sds in the effluent as such auxiliary material to enhance mineralization of the remaining pollutants by bacterial action single step treatment less footprint and the simplicity of the operation will make this application cost effective eco compatible and more widespread the same method was applied to remove various dyes from textile mimetic wastewater demissie et al 2021b consistent with the above report simultaneous removal of dissolved dyes and suspensions was reported 3 6 multifunctional nano amphiphile as amf the above sections discuss the aggregation of surfactants and subsequent flocculation by flocculant injection in contrast this section introduces state of the art new amphiphilic nanocoagulant with a metal conjugate head component on long chain hydrocarbon fig 9c as an amf material liu et al 2019 synthesized a biomimetic new amphiphilic nanocoagulant a hydrocarbon with pre bound si al complexed head for single step removal of spectrum wastewater components there is a growing body of evidence that precipitation of multifunctional products during synthesis induced by the new functional groups negates the storage and dispersion ability wang et al 2016 zeng and park 2009 unfortunately the new amphiphilic nanocoagulant had shown stability for one year of storage at ph 4 0 and aluminum total alt 1 0 m however it had reflected decreased stability at high ph and increasing al concentration owing to the si and al components gelatinization under these conditions therefore by an acid base self assembly method and controlling the al concentration the conjugate of quaternary ammonium si al amphiphile can undergo self aggregation and results in a cationic si al complexed micellar surface shell and an eversible hydrophobic micellar core besides the hydrocarbon with ammonium si al complexes head shell mimics some small aqua animals structural eversion behavior during food preying and resting actinia is a spherical cylindrical shaped aquatic organism with tentacles that take back and extends its tentacle while resting and food preying respectively fig 9d moreover as the aqua behavior of this multifunctional nanocoagulant micelle aggregate resembles that of actinia it was named as spherical actinia like micellar coagulant amc according to liu et al al 2019 amc had demonstrated aggregation flocculation and configuration eversion behavior after attaining appropriate aqua conditions as a response to change in the water environment like actinia the aggregate micellar shell of such interesting material could hydrolyze into flocs destabilize and enmeshes aqua particulate matter and colloidal suspended particles whereas its core composed of the long chain with quaternary ammonium expose out and entraps small dissolved contaminants like tentacle outward extension by actinia fig 9d the authors evaluated the pollutant removal performance of amc using municipal secondary wastewater effluent compared to al2 so4 3 and fecl3 performance liu et al 2019 the result of this study shows that the synergistic effort of the amc shell and its core structure had demonstrated efficient performance over other inorganic coagulants and polymeric polyelectrolyte polydadmac i e removal of turbidity 90 significant removal improvement 90 of dissolved organic carbon doc and no3 as well as total phosphorus tp all 90 fig 10 a however conventional coagulants were underperformed with the removal rate of tp 8 68 doc 30 54 turbidity 87 98 and negligible no3 removal consistent with other studies gao et al 2021 haberkamp et al 2007 lacasa et al 2011 ritigala et al 2021 besides irrespective of hydrophobicity and other diverse properties of pollutants amc achieved over 90 removal of all tested emerging pharmaceutical and micropollutant contaminants contrary to the removal by conventional coagulants fig 10b cho chon chos and chons species were the predominant constituent of such organic micropollutants in the raw water as detailed in fig 10c based on their heteroatoms o n and s number furthermore the authors suggested that adjusting amc dosage allows meeting water quality standards thus amc could be expanded as a powerful purification technology advances in aqua treatment 4 significance challenges and future opportunities of amf as shown in previous sections of this review amf is a promising versatile strategy used to rapidly remove various organic pollutants of human hazard efficiently from water even at a high concentration as reported in several studies it is an energy intensive process than other surfactant mediated water treatment processes however the state of the art amf working process has often been investigated in bench scale operations and has not been espoused as a standard technique in industrial and domestic wastewaters treatment despite there are some attempts at cascading amf for organic contaminants and selective cations removal from real wastewater with analogous removal efficiency with commercialized model systems but as of yet the approach has no longer been adopted in large scale water treatment plants except the attempt on the continuous pilot scale operation by sun et al 2008 as the amf process shows great technological promise in order to further develop the industrial application it is an essential step in establishing the feasibility of pilot scale scale up to a full scale commercial process however some of the aforementioned drawbacks have to be addressed and properly overcome in a way described in the previous sections see sections 3 3 1 to 3 3 5 before industrial scalability might be possible although biosurfactants with giant micelles low cmc and bio flocculants with very good binding properties are needed there are still a limited number of such investigations and the available bioproducts are limited it is apparent that the reuse recycling of both flocculant and surfactant for a full scale process is worthy both in terms of sustainability and economic viability nevertheless the required processes for the recycling of surfactants that have been reported by different studies are still complicated there remained a growing trend of efficiently recycling auxiliary noble organics surfactants or ingredients of biomass besides micellar catalysis adsorption oxidation selective removal of valuable solutes by using ligands and residual contaminant biodegradation have been reported to improve the efficiency unfortunately these studies were carried out batchwise but the scaling up of amf allows for the development of a continuously operatable unit process in which the oxidant catalyst or polyelectrolytes used are recycled with the flocculates however efficient recycling of surfactants catalysis flocculants and oxidant as well as the recovery of solutes particularly for the large scale application have not received a great deal of attention thus further progress should be made to optimizing testing and validating the feasibility and economic viability of material recovery recycling for pilot scale or industrial recyclability attention should also be paid to promoting the application of bio flocculant and large micellar biosurfactants furthermore extensive studies should be conducted on a large scale application and recycling of novel multi functional amphiphilic noncoagulant described in section 3 6 including toxicological studies because such a product is very new 5 conclusion as discussed by the multiple examples of surfactants and their applications in this review flocculation of surfactant micelles which allows either removal of pollutant solutes from aqueous solutions or their recovery with the process known as adsorptive micellar flocculation amf have been studied extensively in the field of environmental remediation when ionic surfactants are saturated at the water air interface a thermodynamically smart nanosized aggregate structure micelle containing surfactant monomers will form in aqueous media such a smart nanosized anionic surfactant micelle with a versatile environment allows efficient partitioning of hazardous solute gradient from bulk solution and can be separated together by assisting with flocculants the selection of appropriate process conditions salinity ph temperature surfactant properties nagg chain length cmc biodegradability flocculant type simplex metal ion polycation bio based and flocculation capacity is crucial to a successful application of amf the method has been applied to remove a variety of solutes ions organics dyes etc in which the desired interaction between solute and the anionic surfactant established and could result in enrichment factors 98 such high efficiency is not only limited to single solutes but can be extended to mixtures of pollutants in aqueous solutions ionized nonionized organics dyes multiple ions due to diverse micro interfacial phenomena and interaction between solute micelle and flocculant in the process of amf other associated phenomena such as micellar catalysis and adsorptive oxidation can be considered to supplement the removal efficiency as non flocculated surfactants lose during the amf process ways of reducing the lost monomers or alternative surfactants have been highlighted including the use of surfactant possessing unsaturated chain biosurfactants polymer surfactant complexation biodegradation coprecipitation and additives marble dust magnesium chloride with the advantages of being eco friendly high security non toxicity operational simple innocuity high efficiency and biodegradability over flocculant traditional flocculants microbial seed or leaf extracts and polymeric nanocluster flocculants have been summarized it was expected over the next few decades that the mentioned approaches particularly the novel metal conjugate multifunctional amphiphiles will be adapted in large scale treatment

16751,sulfonamides sas are among the most widely used antibiotics to treat bacterial infections for humans and animals they are also used in livestock agriculture to improve growth and feed efficiency in many countries recent years there is a growing concern about the environmental fate and treatment technologies of sas in order to eliminate their potential impact on the ecosystem and human health additionally sas are frequently used as model compounds to evaluate the performance of newly developed advanced water treatment processes hence understanding the chemical reaction features of sas can provide valuable information for further technological development in this review the reaction kinetics abiotic transformations and corresponding ecotoxicity changes of sas in natural environments and water treatment processes were comprehensively analyzed to draw critical suggestion and new insights the oh based aop is proposed as an effective method for the elimination of sas toxicity although it is susceptible to water constituent due to low selectivity the application of biochar or metal based oxidants in aops is becoming a future trend for sa treatment overall this review would provide useful information for the development of advanced water treatment technologies and the control of ecological risks related to sas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamides treatment technology abiotic transformation ecological toxicity kinetics 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used for decades to treat bacterial infections for humans and animals since the discovery of penicillin in 1929 burkholder 1959 williams 1985 they are also used extensively as growth promoters and or disease suppressors in livestock and aquaculture farms zhou et al 2013a the global consumption of antibiotics has increased by 65 from 2000 to 2015 bringing about environmental residues and antibiotic resistance that seriously threaten the global health klein et al 2018 sulfonamides sas and their derivatives have been used as synthetic antibiotics for the longest time and are still among the most widely used antibiotics in modern livestock industries mu et al 2015 the sales of sas for food producing animals during 2012 on average per european union member state and in the united states was 31 8 tons and 493 51 tons respectively economou and gousia 2015 the usage amount of sas in china during 2013 was estimated 7920 tons zhang et al 2015a sas consist of two aromatic moieties an aniline ring and a heterocyclic n containing ring r substituent which are joined through a sulfonamide linkage nh so2 feng et al 2019 they are amphoteric compounds that undergo two acid base equilibria with different dissociation constants the aniline amino nitrogen nh2 has a pka value at ph 2 3 while sulfanilamide nitrogen so2 nh has a pka value at ph 4 5 11 baran et al 2011 qiang and adams 2004 sas are commonly divided into five membered and six membered sas on the basis of the atomic number of r substituent which greatly influences their transformation mechanisms and reaction kinetics the structure and physicochemical parameters of common sas are listed in table 1 sas are incompletely metabolized in the body of humans and animals and are difficult to be removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes a large proportion of the consumed sas may enter the environment in their parent and moderately metabolized forms with the discharge of excretions or wastewater effluent ahmed et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a due to their high water solubility and weak adsorption sas and their metabolites are often mobile and can be easily spread in the environment kodesova et al 2016 leal et al 2013 as a result the aquatic environment is a main sink for sas and metabolites ng μg l 1 which are also frequently detected in agricultural soil or river sediments ng μg g 1 gros et al 2010 liu and wong 2013 sarmah et al 2006 zhang et al 2015a once sas enter the environment they may pose adverse effects to the ecosystem by changing the natural microbial communities or developing antibiotic resistant bacteria allen et al 2010 blaser 2016 grenni et al 2018 antibiotic resistance genes args which are widespread in the environment across the world have become one of the biggest threats to public health in the 21st century d costa et al 2011 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 as a consequence of extensive usage of sas over the years sulfonamide resistance genes have been detected in many soil and aquatic environments worldwide gao et al 2012b zhou et al 2017 posing a significant threat to the environment and human health moreover sas have become frequently used model compounds to test the performance of emerging treatment technologies in the environmental discipline bibliometric analysis was conducted by searching with the topic of ppcp and treatment for publications between 2001 and 2021 in the science citation index sci among the 1472 literatures on treatment technologies for pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps about 14 5 used sas as target compounds hence understanding the chemical reaction features of sas would provide valuable information for effective technological development in the future to date numerous treatment technologies including photolysis lian et al 2015 willach et al 2018 ozonization dodd et al 2006 gomez ramos mdel et al 2011 chlorination dong et al 2019 gao et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops acosta rangel et al 2018 yang et al 2017 have been developed for the removal of sas however the decomposition of parent sas may not necessarily lead to the elimination of their ecotoxicity which could be of greater environmental concerns noted that the ecotoxicity in this review includes antimicrobial ability acute toxicity chronic toxicity and genotoxicity for example the nitro derivative of sas generated by the attack of sulfate radical so4 or carbonate radical co3 has been demonstrated to be more toxic toward v fischeri than the parent form yang et al 2017 the elevated ecotoxicity of sas induced by the modification at the para amino group has also been confirmed by majewsky et al 2014 hence it is of vital importance to understand the ecotoxicity changes of sas as they undergo structural transformation in different processes this paper comprehensively reviews the reaction kinetics characteristic structural transformations and corresponding ecotoxicity changes of sas in various abiotic processes including environmental and engineering processes the aim was to provide critical information useful for the development of advanced water treatment technologies and the control of ecological risks related to sas 2 reaction rates of sas in various chemical processes 2 1 photolysis photodegradation has been considered as the major pathway for natural attenuation of sas li et al 2018a several studies boreen et al 2004 2005 ge et al 2019 reported the direct photolysis of sas under natural sunlight the rate constant of which range from 10 7 to 1 3 10 4 s 1 table 2 the half life t 1 2 of sas in winter 31 06 1925 41 h is approximately 1 2 order of magnitude higher than that in summer 3 0 44 78 h demonstrating the photolysis of sas is highly sensitive to seasonal variation ge et al 2019 this indicated the strong dependency of sas photolysis on sunlight condition as they have only spectra tail 290 325 nm overlapping with solar irradiation wei et al 2019 furthermore the triplet excited dissolved organic matter 3dom has been proved to be the most important reactive intermediate for the natural photolysis of sas with six membered r boreen et al 2005 wang et al 2018 ultraviolet uv irradiation has been increasingly used for disinfection of wastewater and drinking water sas are susceptible to photodegradation under uvc irradiation 245 nm the direct photolysis rate constants of which range from 10 5 to 10 3 s 1 under conventional irradiation conditions table 2 however the direct photodegradation of sas was more sensitive to the variation of uvb radiation since they have maximal absorption within the uvb region 290 320 nm moore and zhou 1994 it has also been reported that the photolysis of sas is favored at lower ph conditions where the maximal absorption shifts to lower wavelength wei et al 2019 the direct photolysis of sas varied greatly depending on irradiation source matrix and ph condition boreen et al 2004 challis et al 2013 for example the photolysis rate constants for sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfisoxazole siz greatly decreazed with increasing ph while sulfamethizole smiz sulfathiazole stz and sulfamethazine sm2 showed the opposite change table 2 the inconsistent trends may ascribe to the different photochemical behaviors of sas with different substituents boreen et al 2005 ge et al 2018 niu et al 2013 song et al 2017 generally the sas with five membered r exhibit a higher photolysis rate than those with six membered r due to their different electron densities cui et al 2016 lian et al 2015 tian et al 2020 according to the hückel law the o or s atom located in the five membered r can provide lone pair electrons to form a delocalized π bond leading to the higher electron density and stronger photon absorption ability lian et al 2015 furthermore the energies of the highest lowest occupied molecular orbital and the energy gap which are listed table 1 can indicate the compound reactivity and substituent effect intuitively yin et al 2020 in addition the photolysis rates of sa metabolites are greatly different with their parent compounds due to the effect of substituents on the aniline ring for example n4 acetyl smx no smx and no2 smx showed significantly lower photolysis rate than smx while smx glucuronide had the highest photolysis rate compared to parent smx and other metabolites table 2 specifically the photolysis rates of n4 acetyl sas with six membered r are generally higher than those of parent sas the opposite effects of n4 acetylated substituent suggested that the photolysis of sas with five membered and six membered r were dominated by different mechanisms as discussed in section 3 3 2 2 advanced oxidation processes the pseudo first order and second order rate constants of sas and metabolites with various oxidants or reactive species are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively so4 109 1011 m 1 s 1 and oh 109 1010 m 1 s 1 are the most effective reactive species for sas removal followed by cl 109 m 1 s 1 co3 108 109 m 1 s 1 and cl2 106 m 1 s 1 table 4 the rate constants of anionic sas by so4 were greatly higher than that of neutral sas while oh showed similar reactivity for distinct forms of sas yang et al 2017 in the high carbonate water matrix such as hydrolyzed urine co3 can be easily formed by reactive radicals such as oh or so4 and become the dominant reactive species for sas degradation sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b as the higher selectivity of co3 rendered it less susceptible to the scavenging effects of solution matrix yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b the rate constants of n4 acetylated sas were greatly lower than that of their parent forms in the reaction with so4 or co3 due to the difference in benzene substituents sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b by contrast such reactivity difference was not observed under the attack of oh zhang et al 2015b 2 3 non radical oxidation the singlet oxygen 1o2 and o3 are effective non radical oxidants for sas transformation with rate constant of 104 109 m 1 s 1 and 105 106 m 1 s 1 table 4 respectively both exhibited the higher reactivity for anionic sas than the neutral sas dantas et al 2008 dodd et al 2006 ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 specifically 1o2 oxidation was demonstrated to play a more important role than oh oxidation and direct photolysis in the natural attenuation of sas in sunlit water ge et al 2019 free available chlorine hocl ocl was the dominant oxidant for sas elimination in water disinfection processes dodd and huang 2004 and hocl 102 105 m 1 s 1 table 4 was greatly more reactive than ocl chamberlain and adams 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 yang et al 2019 clo2 103 104 m 1 s 1 table 4 was an effective oxidant for sas under acidic conditions ben et al 2017 ferrate vi fevi 10 104 m 1 s 1 was the most reactive metal oxidants for sas while mno4 0 45 m 1 s 1 and mno2 10 4 10 3 s 1 mno2 0 0 36 mm were less reactive tables 3 and 4 generally hfeo4 was more reactive than feo4 2 and the reaction rate greatly decreazed at higher ph table 4 the reactivity of mno2 depended on its redox potential which was mainly influenced by crystalline structure solution ph and concentration of mn2 li et al 2020 song et al 2019b wan et al 2015 in addition peroxymonosulfate pms 10 4 10 3 s 1 pms 0 1 mm and peroxydisulfate pds 10 4 10 3 s 1 pds 0 0 5 0 6 mm could also degrade sas by direct oxidation or non radical reaction table 3 3 characteristic structural transformation of sas 3 1 oxidation of the aniline moiety the frontier electron densities feds theory calculations confirmed that the aniline moiety in sas was the most susceptible site for the attack of electrophilic oxidants or radicals shad et al 2018 density functional theory dft calculations also suggested that the n4 c5 and c8 atoms fig 1 on the aniline ring of sas molecule had high potential to be oxidized yin et al 2018a zhang et al 2020b the transformations of aniline moiety in sas fig 2 by so4 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2015 yin et al 2018a zhou et al 2019 co3 wojnarovits et al 2020 zhang et al 2015b zhang et al 2016b cl liu et al 2020b 1o2 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2020 pms bao et al 2019 liu et al 2020a yin et al 2018b o3 dantas et al 2008 shad et al 2018 hocl dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 fevi feng et al 2019 sharma et al 2006 sun et al 2019 mno4 song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 or mno2 bialk et al 2005 gao et al 2012a li et al 2020 have been widely reported especially elimination of aromatic nh2 or substitution of nh2 by no2 has been uniquely observed by the attack of hno2 or no2 cheng et al 2020 sun et al 2017 previous research demonstrated the majority of oh attacked the benzene ring or reacted directly with nh2 group du et al 2017 solar et al 1986 yang et al 2017 indicating that the benzene ring is also a preferred site in sas for hydroxylation sagi et al 2015 similarly transformations of nh2 group in aniline to form aniline radical cation nitrosobenzene nitrobenzene and azobenzene have been reported in various aops systems chen et al 2018 duran et al 2019 the substitution of nh2 group by oh was also a dominant mechanism for aniline degradation while such reaction was scarcely reported for sas zhao et al 2013 due to the electron donating characteristic of nh2 and electron withdrawing characteristic of so2 nh the hydroxylation of sas tended to occurred at the ortho position c5 and c8 of the amino group ji et al 2015 zhuang et al 2019 in contrast the hydroxylation of the aniline more likely occurred at the para position of the amino group zhao et al 2013 both so4 and co3 are electrophilic radicals that can readily react with the electron rich nh2 group on aniline moiety of sas yang et al 2017 the amino n atom was initially attacked by so4 or co3 through one electron transfer mechanism leading to the formation of n centered radicals which may couple to form dimeric products or be further oxidized to hydroxylamine nitroso or nitro substituted sas ji et al 2017 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b such amino substitution was also observed by direct attack of pms through electrophilic reaction bao et al 2019 yin et al 2018b hydroxylation of benzene ring through h abstraction was another pathway for sas degradation in the so4 based processes mahdi ahmed et al 2012 yang et al 2018a differently co3 was more selective to attack nh2 group than oh and so4 leading to the formation of nitro substituted or dimeric sas instead of hydroxylated products yang et al 2017 ozonation is an effective method to eliminate sas through direct o3 attack or oh attack formed by o3 decomposition urbano et al 2017 the direct oxidation by o3 molecules showed a greater selectivity than oh oxidation and the amino n atom was the first site for o3 attack with the formation of nitrobenzene group followed by the cleavage of s n bond dantas et al 2008 shad et al 2018 the hydroxylation of the benzene ring c5 through electrophilic attack by o3 or oh also occurred during the ozonation of sas shad et al 2018 the amino n atom is also susceptible to the attack of hocl in chlorination processes mainly through nucleophilic substitution leading to the formation of organic chloramines i e n chlorinated and n n dichlorinated sa intermediates dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 n chlorinated sas could undergo a back reaction to generate the parent compounds or rearrange to the ortho chlorinated product dodd and huang 2004 the n n dichlorinated sas could proceed with a coupling reaction to form dimeric products or undergo n cl bond heterolysis to generate an arylnitrenium cation n chlorinated sa nitrenium species dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the latter is extremely susceptible to nucleophilic attack by h2o at the para position to the nh2 group fishbein and mcclelland 1987 and subsequently rearrange to p benzo quinoneimine structures mcclelland et al 1996 besides oxidation of the amino group hydroxylation on the benzene ring and so2 extrusion were also observed in the chlorination of sas gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the oxidation of sas by metal oxidants such as permanganate mno2 or fevi most likely occurs at the amino group rather than at the ortho position of the benzene ring gao et al 2012a sharma et al 2006 song et al 2019a both fevi and mno4 could selectively oxidize the amino group through a stepwise oxidation process with the formation of a hydroxylamine group which further generates a nitroso or nitro compound sharma et al 2006 song et al 2019a yu et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the dimeric products connecting through nh nh were also observed in permanganate based oxidation process song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 however the oxidation of the amino group depended on ph due to the speciation of oxidants it was the dominant pathway by fevi oxidation under neutral ph but more likely occurred at acidic conditions by permanganate acosta rangel et al 2020 zhuang et al 2019 apart from mno4 mno2 and mn iii were also confirmed to attack the amino n atom followed by one electron transfer mechanism that generated sas radicals gao et al 2012a zhuang et al 2019 the sa radicals could proceed with further transformations including self coupling or smiles type rearrangement like so2 extrusion gao et al 2012a li et al 2020 the self coupling reaction could be significantly accelerated in unsaturated soil systems due to the high concentration of sas li et al 2020 furthermore natural organic matters noms may also enhance such transformation through radical radical coupling with sas radicals bialk et al 2005 song et al 2019b overall so4 and co3 are effective oxidants which are more selective for the aniline moiety than oh and exhibit higher oxidative ability than other oxidants e g o3 hocl and high valent metal oxidants however the reaction of sas with so4 or co3 might be significantly inhibited by noms as the reactive radical intermediates that formed through one electron transfer mechanism were likely reduced by antioxidant moieties in dom back to the parent sas canonica and schonenberger 2019 by contrast the intermediates of sas formed in oh induced oxidation could not be regenerated to their parent forms by dom wenk et al 2011 suggesting oh induced transformation differs from so4 or co3 induced transformation o3 and free available chlorine hocl ocl are both strong oxidants under acidic conditions with the redox potentials of 2 076 v and 1 482 v jiang and lloyd 2002 respectively for metal oxidants their oxidative reactivity for sas was consistent with their redox potentials which were in order of fevi 2 20 v mno4 1 507 v mno2 1 23 v jiang and lloyd 2002 especially due to the weaker electron donation ability of acetylated substituent nhcoch3 than nh2 group chen et al 1975 the transformation rates of n4 acetylated sas by selective oxidants including so4 co3 and o3 were significantly lower than the parent sas table 4 3 2 smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion the smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion products have been reported during the transformation of sas by photodegradation boreen et al 2005 challis et al 2013 perisa et al 2013 xu et al 2014 mno2 gao et al 2012a mno4 yang et al 2018b fevi acosta rangel et al 2020 feng et al 2019 feng et al 2018 sun et al 2019 cl liu et al 2020b fenton or fenton like oxidation neafsey et al 2010 wang et al 2010 so4 based oxidation fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2018a yin et al 2020 ozonation krakstrom et al 2020 and chlorination fu et al 2018 the so2 extrusion was identified as the predominant mechanism for sas containing a six membered r in direct or indirect photolysis processes through 3dom boreen et al 2005 which was markedly different from the photodegradation mechanisms of sas with a five membered r boreen et al 2004 the photolysis of n4 acetylated sas with a six membered r under simulated solar irradiation can also induce so2 extrusion products similar to their parent compounds garcia galan et al 2012 perisa et al 2013 although sas with a five membered r can not undergo so2 extrusion during photolysis the so2 extrusion products were observed for the corresponding n4 acetylated sa and sa glucuronide metabolites bonvin et al 2013 evidently the so2 extrusion pathway is greatly influenced by both heterocyclic ring and substituent on aniline ring an intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution mechanism based on dft calculations has been proposed by tentscher et al 2013 to elaborate on the so2 extrusion process the initial step is the formation of an aniline radical cation via single electron oxidation followed by a smiles type radical rearrangement of transition states and final the extrusion of so2 the aniline radical is susceptible to the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of a r nitrogen heteroatom on the para position of the aniline ring due to the low barrier of such rearrangement as for the extrusion of so2 feng et al 2019 proposed a catalytic cycle initiated by fevi in which so2 extrusion is likely to restore the aromaticity of the aniline ring with the formation of an oxidative intermediate that will oxidize another sas to generate a radical cation fig 3 a differently other studies reported that the sulfone group in smiles radical could be further oxidized by an o atom originate from o2 mno2 or mno4 etc addition to the sulfur atom leading to a thermally labile intermediate and readily decomposing by so3 extrusion fig 3 b gao et al 2012a yang et al 2018b furthermore a ring closing reaction joining the nh group from the pyrimidine ring to the aniline ring was observed after so2 extrusion of sulfadimethoxine sdm during ozonation process krakstrom et al 2020 it should be noted that the smiles type rearrangement is unique to sas containing a six membered r in which the ortho nitrogen heteroatom to the amino nitrogen enables the formation of a five membered ring transition state feng et al 2019 in contrast the so2 extrusion of sas with a five membered r was unfavorable in geometry due to the higher energy barriers for rearrangement the nitrogen heteroatom in the five membered r is further away geometrically from the para position of the aniline ring with larger so2n c n anglehan that in a six membered r feng et al 2019 instead oxidation of the aniline moiety or destruction of the heterocyclic ring is more likely to occur for sas with a five membered r by either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack sharma et al 2006 yu et al 2017 this distinction might explain the faster degradation rate of five membered sas than that of six membered ones table 4 feng et al 2019 yin et al 2020 3 3 cleavage of sulfonamide group and adjacent sites c nh so2 c the results of dft calculations indicated that s2 atom was the most susceptible site in sas to be attacked by oxidative nucleophilic species while the c3 n1 and c11 atoms showed high vulnerability to attack by electrophilic species yin et al 2018a as these atoms are concentrated at the sulfonamide group and its adjacent sites the cleavages of sulfonamide bond s n c n bond and s c bond of sas molecule can easily occur to degrade sas fig 1 sulfonamide bond s n bond cleavage the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond δ cleavage of sas yielding sulfanilic acid and corresponding amino r substituent can easily occur by the attack of nucleophilic oxidants on the sulfonamide s atom fig 1 such reactions have been widely reported in multiple processes such as hydrolysis bialk bielinska et al 2012 photolysis boreen et al 2004 garcia galan et al 2012 ge et al 2018 niu et al 2013 trovo et al 2009b photocatalysis baran et al 2009 hu et al 2007 song et al 2017 fenton or fenton like oxidation barhoumi et al 2016 dirany et al 2012 zhou et al 2013b chlorination ben et al 2017 gao et al 2014 ozonation gomez ramos mdel et al 2011 guo et al 2015 urbano et al 2017 fevi oxidation acosta rangel et al 2020 kim et al 2015 mno4 or mno2 mediated oxidation li et al 2020 song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 direct oxidation of pms bao et al 2019 yin et al 2018b non radical pds cnt process guan et al 2019 and so4 based oxidation fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yin et al 2018a the sulfonamide bond cleavage is favorable under acidic conditions where the protonated amine group tends to become unreactive towards electrophilic oxidants such as fevi or o3 while the sulfonic group becomes the most reactive site kim et al 2015 hydrolysis of sas mainly through a sulphonyl group substitution mechanism upon h2o attacking was also facilitated in acidic conditions bialk bielinska et al 2012 the reasons are that the protonated substrate attracts the nucleophilic h2o molecule more easily and the neutral leaving group i e amino r substituent under acidic conditions is easier to be substituted than the negatively charged amino heterocycles moreover hydrolysis of sas with a six membered r through sulfonamide bond cleavage is easier than that of five membered sas as the products with an amine group bound to a six membered r should be better stabilized and thus become the better leaving groups in nucleophilic sulphonyl group substitution bialk bielinska et al 2012 however the hydrolysis alone did not show significant contribution to the natural attenuation of sas li et al 2018b the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond is a prevailing mechanism for the photolysis of sas with a five membered r which differs from the so2 extrusion pathway during the direct photolysis of six membered sas bonvin et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2018 willach et al 2018 it should be noted that the δ cleavage mechanisms of sas by direct and indirect photolysis were distinct the cleavage of the s n bond occurs through a one step manner during direct photolysis as the s n bond of five membered sas at the triplet states is significantly weaker than at singlet states ge et al 2018 the higher reactivity of sulfonamide moiety in the excited sas results in the direct decomposition of the s n bond which is much easier to occur than in indirect photolysis process by contrast the oh mediated indirect photolysis is a multi step process via two pathways including h abstraction and electrophilic c3 attack rather than a one step cleavage leading to the cleavage of either s n bond or s c bond fig 4 ge et al 2018 the multi step mechanism is also suitable for oh mediated indirect photolysis of six membered sas despite they undergo different direct photolysis pathways with five membered sas guerard et al 2009 besides the δ cleavage of sas induced by oh has been recognized as the dominant pathway in many aops despite the poor selectivity of such oxidants cheng et al 2019 guo et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2013b the δ cleavage was also confirmed as the dominant photolysis pathway for several sa metabolites including n4 acetylated sa and sa glucuronide bonvin et al 2013 by contrast another metabolite no sa favored the modifications of the substituents no2 nh2 or nhcoch3 instead of cleavage reactions bonvin et al 2013 s c bond cleavage the frontier electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital 2fed2 homo is an indicator for the reactivity of each atom under the attack of electrophilic agent fukui et al 1954 higher 2fed2 homo values of both c3 and n10 atoms indicate that not only s n bond but also s c bond may cleave upon the attack on the sulfur atom zhuang et al 2019 smaller wiberg bond orders of c3 s2 and s2 n10 which mean weaker bond strength also confirm the possibility of s c bond cleavage zhuang et al 2019 the cleavage of s c bond γ cleavage fig 1 of sas has been reported during hydrolysis bialk bielinska et al 2012 photolysis boreen et al 2004 guerard et al 2009 su et al 2016 zhou and moore 1994 mno4 oxidation zhuang et al 2019 chlorination ben et al 2017 and electro fenton or fenton like processes dirany et al 2012 wang et al 2010 as the aniline is the least suitable leaving group upon the analogous nucleophilic sulphonyl substitution the γ cleavage was more difficult than δ cleavage during hydrolysis processes bialk bielinska et al 2012 the elimination of aniline from sas may occur at high temperature under acidic solutions bialk bielinska et al 2012 c n bond cleavage the c n bond cleavage ε cleavage fig 1 has been confirmed as one of the main pathways of sas hydrolysis by bialk bielinska et al 2012 who proposed an aromatic nucleophilic substitution mechanism that takes place in the heterocyclic aromatic ring such reaction more easily occurs with six membered sas compared to five membered ones as the six membered heterocyclic rings have a stronger electron withdrawing ability that favors nucleophilic attack bialk bielinska et al 2012 the breaking of the c n bond was also observed during photodegradation of sas with the detection of sulfanilamide although to an appreciably lesser extent than dominant pathways boreen et al 2004 the ε cleavage of sas was also reported in mno4 or mno2 mediated oxidation li et al 2020 song et al 2019a and photo fenton process trovo et al 2009a by the attack of oxidants at the central n atom 3 4 transformation of the heterocyclic ring five or six membered r the five membered heterocyclic rings such as isoxazole or thiazole ring can serve as reactive moiety toward so4 attack forming heterocyclic ring hydroxylation or ring cleavage products through either c o bond or n o bond cleavage ghauch et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 feds calculations suggested that c12 of smx c11 of siz and c13 of stz were the preferential sites to be attacked by so4 fig 5 a zhou et al 2019 the reaction of so4 with oxazole or isoxazole ring is initiated by the electrophilic attack at olefinic double bond with formation of allylic radicals followed by the elimination of so4 2 through hydrolysis to form the hydroxylated is oxazole dogan et al 1990 the latter can rearrange to a carbonyl through a hemi ketal equilibrium step which resulted in cleavage of the heterocyclic ring at c o bond and formation of an oxime fig 5 b hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2019 the oxime can release hydroxylamine to form a second carbonyl by addition of h2o similar hydroxylation and cleavage of the isoxazole ring have also been reported during photolysis su et al 2016 willach et al 2018 fevi oxidation sharma et al 2006 yu et al 2017 tio2 photocatalysis hu et al 2007 non radical pds cnt process guan et al 2019 photo fenton or fenton like processes trovo et al 2009a yan et al 2018 it should be noted that the reaction rate of siz with so4 was much higher than that of smx table 3 indicating the methyl substituent could remarkably increaze the reactivity of isoxazole ring ji et al 2015 dogan et al 1990 have provided evidence with electron spin resonance and pulse radiolysis studies that methyl substituent on the isoxazole ring favored the attack of electrophilic so4 due to the increazed electron density by contrast smiz was less amenable to so4 reaction which may ascribe to the lack of olefinic structure in the thiadiazole ring and the addition of the negatively charge n atom zhou et al 2019 the six membered heterocyclic rings which generally consists of two n atoms are expected to be more difficult to mineralize due to the higher stability of the ring structure wang et al 2010 previous studies have revealed that the six membered heterocyclic rings of sas are resistant to so4 attack cui et al 2016 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 instead the breaking of such heterocyclic rings via n c bonds cleavage could occur during gamma irradiation induced degradation or fenton like processes of sulfadiazine sdz and sm2 barhoumi et al 2016 guo et al 2012 liu and wang 2013 wan and wang 2017 for example the pyrimidine ring can be attacked by oh leading to the breaking of n c bonds due to the stronger negative charge of the nitrogen atom liu and wang 2013 both five and six membered sas can undergo hydroxylation on the heterocyclic rings under the attack of oh acosta rangel et al 2018 dirany et al 2012 du et al 2017 trovo et al 2009a it has been previously observed that five membered r were more susceptible to oh attack than benzene ring batista and nogueira 2012 trovo et al 2009a which contradicted with the observation of six membered ones yang et al 2018a as the hydroxyl group can enhance the electron density of the heterocyclic ring the hydroxylated intermediate may easily undergo further radical or non radical attack to generate more stable dihydroxylated products gao et al 2014 guan et al 2019 hu et al 2007 especially isomerization of the isoxazole ring is one of the dominant photolysis pathways for smx poirier larabie et al 2016 trovo et al 2009b yang et al 2017 zhou and moore 1994 but has not been reported for other sas willach et al 2018 demonstrated that photoisomer was the dominant product for the neutral smx species while the s n bond cleavage and isoxazole ring opening occurred more preferably for the anionic smx species mohatt et al 2011 have proposed an isomerization mechanism initiated by the cleavage of the isoxazole n o bond followed by the recyclization to form an azirine intermediate which can quickly rearrange to an oxazole ring substituted isomer fig 6 such isomerization of smx has also been reported during catalytic photodegradation gong and chu 2016 mno4 oxidation gao et al 2014 and photo fenton process trovo et al 2009a it should be noted that the isomerization from isoxazole ring to oxazole ring could increaze the electron density of the olefinic double bond which is a preferred site for the electrophilic attack thus enhancing the reactivity toward electrophilic and selective oxidants yang et al 2017 on the other hand isomerization transformation during direct photolysis could be suppressed by reactive species such as so4 or co3 zhang et al 2016a 4 toxicity and environmental occurrence of transformation products of sas 4 1 toxicity of transformation products the substituent on aniline ring sas can inhibit bacterial growth by competitively binding to dihydropteroate synthase dhps and therefore inhibiting the synthesis of folate due to the similar structures of sas and para amino benzoic acid paba which is a natural ligand for dhps deng et al 2012 yun et al 2012 the aniline group of sas is essential for their antimicrobial effect prabhu et al 1997 richter et al 2013 nouws et al 1985 has reported that n4 acetyl sas was inactive toward e coli which was ascribed to the lack of free p aminophenyl group the oxidation or substituent of the aniline moiety would be expected to greatly influence the antimicrobial properties of sas the cross coupling products of sas with nom constituent or self coupling dimers formed via the amide nitrogen might eliminate ecotoxicity due to their lower mobility bialk et al 2005 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020b on the contrary other researchers demonstrated that sdm dimers connecting through nh nh were more harmful to common aquatic species i e fish daphnia and green algae yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the azo carcinogenicity has been previously demonstrated through bond cleavage or oxidation to highly reactive diazonium salts brown and de vito 1993 the nitroso nitro and 4 hydroxyl substituted sas have also been confirmed with more toxicity than the parent sas because these derivative substituents have stronger affinities to bind to dhps majewsky et al 2014 naisbitt et al 1999 shad et al 2018 yang et al 2017 as for hydroxylamine sas naisbitt et al 1999 reported their higher cytotoxicity compared to sas while majewsky et al 2014 found it was less toxic towards v fischeri than the parent form the hydroxyl addition product on the benzene ring was demonstrated not harmful for aquatic taxa shad et al 2018 the deamination of sas also led to the elimination of antibacterial activity toward e coli due to the destruction of paba like toxicophore cheng et al 2020 by contrast the disinfection products of sas during chlorination processes exhibited higher acute toxicity and genotoxic potentials than the precursor drug yang et al 2019 hence the environmental risks of the products generated from the transformation of the aniline moiety should be carefully considered so2 extrusion the acute and chronic toxicity of so2 extrusion products toward common aquatic organisms were far higher than their parent compound yang et al 2018b hence although some promising technologies such as the combination of naturally abundant mno2 and permanganate might be helpful for the elimination of sas containing a six membered r through smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion more attentions should be paid to perform further risk assessments the smiles types rearrangement and so2 extrusion of sas as well as further reactions during chlorination or photolysis processes also led to the evaluated acute toxicity towards v fischeri compared to the parent compound xu et al 2014 yin et al 2020 the ring closing product originating from so2 extrusion pathway of sas was significantly more stable and exhibited the higher acute and chronic toxicity toward aquatic species krakstrom et al 2020 in contrast the oxidized products of sulfachloropyridazine scp by fevi through so2 extrusion had lower toxicity than its parent compound which may be ascribed to the further oxidation of amino substitution to hydroxylamine nitroso or nitro substitution after so2 extrusion sun et al 2019 hence more optimized methods such as introducing catalysts in the ozonation process to enhance further transformation of the ring closing product krakstrom et al 2020 to resolve the toxic risks of the so2 extrusion products should be further investigated cleavage of sulfonamide moiety lienert et al 2007b proposed the positive correlation between the ecotoxicological hazard of sa metabolites and their octanol water partition coefficients k ow the breakdown products generated from the benzenesulfonamide moiety of sas generally showed low ecotoxicity due to the increazed hydrophilicity majewsky et al 2014 the major products generated from δ cleavage of smx sulfanilic and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole were confirmed less toxic toward d magna than the parent form trovo et al 2009b the 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole has also been demonstrated to exhibit lower toxicity toward fish and non toxicity toward e coli and v fischeri based on the in vitro bacterial growth and inhibition bioassays despite slightly higher toxicity toward daphnid and green algae than smx brown and de vito 1993 guan et al 2019 li et al 2020 majewsky et al 2014 cheng et al 2020 proposed that δ cleavage of smx led to diminishing of antibacterial activity toward e coli but higher acute toxicity on v fischeri due to the increaze of the amount of nh2 group which could interact with flavin mononucleotide the δ cleavage product of sdz 2 aminopyrimidine exhibited the higher acute and chronic toxicity toward aquatic species than sdz based on the ecosar calculation krakstrom et al 2020 the δ cleavage of sulfaquinoxaline sqx led to significantly higher toxicity based on decision trees according to the cramer rules urbano et al 2017 these great differences may be ascribed to the influence of heterocyclic substituent or diversity of estimated methods although the ecotoxicity evaluation for δ cleavage products of smx has been widely reported relevant studies for other sas are scarce hence more attention should be paid to the structure dependent toxicity of the amino r substituents nevertheless existing research has demonstrated that the cleavage of sulfonamide bond is an effective pathway to eliminate ecotoxicity of smx which is among the most extensively used sas ji et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 the cleavage of the s c bond of sas generating aniline and sulfamic acid that are not similar to paba is expected to lose the antimicrobial ability the predicted toxicity data confirmed that the γ cleavage products of sdm were not harmful to three aquatic species zhuang et al 2019 however further oxidized products such as p benzoquinone which was originated from γ cleavage of scp in the electro fenton process may exert higher toxicity than that of the parent compound dirany et al 2012 zazo et al 2007 sulfanilamide which is the major ε cleavage product has been demonstrated less toxic toward v fischeri but more toxic toward e coli compared to sas li et al 2020 majewsky et al 2014 gong and chu 2016 also considered sulfanilamide as a harmful intermediate nevertheless such transformation does not frequently occur in commonly used treatment technology transformation on the heterocyclic ring yang et al 2017 proposed that the isomer of smx would retain antibacterial activity because the sulfonamide toxicophore a paba like structure was not changed other researchers reported the isomerization of the isoxazole ring may lead to the higher toxicity toward d magna trovo et al 2009b hence the isomerization of smx cannot contribute to the elimination of ecotoxicity and must be carefully evaluated by contrast the hydroxylated and heterocyclic ring opening products are generally less toxic than the parent sas due to the increazed hydrophilicity which has been demonstrated to be negatively correlated with the toxicity of sa metabolites guan et al 2019 lienert et al 2007b however the reactivity of the heterocyclic ring especially six membered ring is relatively lower than that of the so2 nh moiety thus the ring opening reactions generally need more reactive oxidants e g oh or so4 yang et al 2018a 4 2 environmental occurrence and behavior of transformation products of sas trovo et al 2009b proposed that the major photolysis products of smx including 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole sulfanilic acid and photoisomer are more resistant to phototransformation su et al 2016 investigated the biodegradation of eight phototransformation products of smx indicating several photo stable products containing intact isoxazole ring including 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole desamino smx and hydroxylation product on the benzene ring were also resistant to microbiological transformation no2 sas have been reported as the most stable metabolite which was very resistant to phototransformation under natural sunlight dopp 1975 furthermore some transformation products or human metabolites of sas such as 4 nitroso 4 nitro n4 acetyl sas and sa n1 glucuronide have been demonstrated to retransform to the parent compounds through either abiotic or biotic processes bonvin et al 2013 nodler et al 2012 radke et al 2009 su et al 2016 considering the evaluated toxicity of some transformation products has been widely demonstrated it is of vital importance to investigate the environmental occurrence and fate of sas transformation products however research on the occurrence of transformation products of sas is quite scarce due to the lack of corresponding standards the n4 acetylated form of sas is the most frequently studied metabolite as it is the most prominent metabolite of sas and has strong potential to retransform to its parent form the distribution and fate of n4 acetyl sas in multiple media including wwtp brown and wong 2018 göbel et al 2004 surface water ashton et al 2004 and river sediments radke et al 2009 have been widely reported in addition the occurrence of 4 nitro smx and desamino smx have been reported in spring samples with the concentration ranges of 3 4 5 4 ng l 1 and 2 9 7 7 ng l 1 respectively nodler et al 2012 4 nitroso smx was generally classified as an unstable product of smx due to its back transformation into smx or its oxidation into a more stable 4 nitro smx which very likely occurred in the presence of oxygen bonvin et al 2013 hence the occurrence of 4 nitroso smx in environments was rarely reported in previous studies however it may be formed in soil and leach to the aquifer with a relative persistence under anoxic conditions for instance brienza et al 2017 detected 4 nitro smx and 4 nitroso smx in groundwater at tens of ng l 1 both of which were not detected in surface water and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent samples nevertheless information on the environmental occurrence of other transformation products such as sa dimer so2 extrusion products sulfonamide or ring cleavage products is not currently available 5 comparison of treatment technologies and future perspectives direct photolysis of sas mainly through two distinct pathways depending on the heterocyclic functional group for five membered sas the δ cleavage or isomerization is the dominant pathway boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2018 poirier larabie et al 2016 zhou and moore 1994 while for six membered sas the triplet mediated so2 extrusion is the main reaction boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009 for indirect photolysis of sas which occurs through reaction with reactive species such as 3dom and oh three main pathways have been reported 1 hydroxylation on either benzene ring or heterocyclic ring by oh attack with the formation of mono or di hydroxyl products of sas 2 cleavage of the c n bond δ cleavage 3 fragmentation of heterocyclic ring such as isoxazole ring which is considered to be resistant to cleavage during direct photolysis due to the lack of chromophores to absorb actinic radiation ge et al 2018 lam and mabury 2005 niu et al 2013 trovo et al 2009b for sas with five membered r e g smx the indirect photolysis did not significantly occur in sunlit surface waters while indirect photodegradation with 3dom was predominant for sas with six membered r e g sdz smd smm and smp bahnmuller et al 2014 ryan et al 2011 wang et al 2018 instead the indirect of smx more likely occurs in wastewater effluent that contains high concentration effluent organic matter efom which may form higher energy triplet sensitizers 3efom compared to 3nom due to their different compositions shon et al 2006 these findings imply that the photolysis of sas should be encouraged in wastewater stabilization ponds or wastewater treatment wetlands before discharge into natural environments because the presence of efom could enhance the removal efficiency ryan et al 2011 however bahnmuller et al 2014 had reported that the phototransformation induced by 3nom 3efom can be greatly inhibited by phenolic antioxidants in water they also domenstrated that efom apparently had a higher antioxidant capacity than nom as the input of wastewater was rich in allochthonous material who had more antioxidant moiety than autochthonous dom bahnmuller et al 2014 moreover oh induced indirect photolysis which is more effective for elimination or mineralization of sas could be enhanced with the addition of photocatalysts such as tio2 cofe2o4 tio2 tio2 fecl3 and reduced graphene oxide wo3 composites rgo wo3 baran et al 2009 gong and chu 2016 hu et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 on the other hand the addition of photocatalysts such as g c3n4 may induce o2 to benefit the nitration of amino group on the benzene ring which likely exerts higher toxicity than the parent sas song et al 2017 therefore more investigations are still required to explore efficient catalysts and to evaluate the ecotoxicity of intermediates some promising metal based oxidants such as mno4 mno2 or fevi might be helpful for the removal of sas the transformation pathways mainly include oxidation of aniline moiety cleavage of the s n bond and so2 extrusion both the degradation efficiency and pathway in metal based oxidation are highly susceptible to reaction conditions such as solution ph and matrix components acosta rangel et al 2020 gao et al 2012a song et al 2019b zhuang et al 2019 the intermediate products may also exhibit opposite changes in the toxicity compared to their parent compounds depending on the oxidants and reaction conditions sun et al 2019 yang et al 2018b hence it is necessary to understand the reaction mechanisms and toxicity changes of sas induced by metal based oxidants to optimize the removal efficiency as shown in fig 7 different treatment technologies for sas were compared from reaction rate and product toxicity aops have become the mainstream and most effective approach for the treatment of sas multiple transformation pathways of sas including cleavage of s n bond nitration and nitrosation of aniline moiety hydroxylation of the benzene ring or heterocyclic ring so2 extrusion cleavage of the heterocyclic ring as well as further oxidation to simple molecules have been widely reported in aop systems tian et al 2020 the ecotoxicity of sas is expected to be more easily eliminated due to the high mineralization degree achieved by strongly oxidative radicals such as oh and so4 however it should be noted that so4 and co3 tend to transform sas to more toxic products compared to oh due to their higher selectivity toward the nh2 group brown and de vito 1993 from economic considerations integration of biochar into aops will become the future trend for sas elimination because biochar is a low cost carbonaceous material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass inyang and dickenson 2015 jung et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that the presence of biochar could effectively enhance the removal of sas during the aops due to the highly porous structure and the enriched functional groups deng et al 2019 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a biochar can act as both adsorbent for sas and catalysts for oxidants such as h2o2 and pds to generate reactive species tian et al 2019 reported that the permanganate oxidation of smx as well as toc removal could be greatly enhanced by adding biochar powder similar enhancement of toc removal was also observed in mn iii oxidation and ozonation of smx tian et al 2019 on the other hand the adsorption of sas on biochar may decrease the reactivity toward oxidants which is also influenced by its surface morphological and chemical features huang et al 2016 thus more investigations on the action mechanism and performance of biochar for sas degradation in aops are still needed furthermore source separated urine has gained increasing attention since it may provide a great opportunity for effectively removing pharmaceuticals and their metabolites human urine contains the majority of the pharmaceuticals despite it account for only about 1 of the municipal wastewater entering into wwtps lienert et al 2007a winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b previous studies have investigated the destruction of sas and metabolites by fevi uv based or biochar based aops in synthetic urine matrix where the bicarbonate or carbonate radical plays an important role luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021 sun et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016a in general the removal efficiency of sas was higher in the hydrolyzed urine than fresh urine however the treatment processes should be carefully considered because some urine components such as chloride ammonium citrate or urea may pose some scavenging effect to reactive species while some may enhance the reactions depending on the oxidative systems luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021 further research is still needed to understand the impact of urine components to fill the gap between synthetic and real urine moreover the simultaneous occurrence of human metabolites such as n4 acetyl sas which are less reactive toward selective so4 or co3 species will pose a significant challenge to the treatment of urine göbel et al 2005 6 conclusions treatment technologies of antibiotics became more reported in the last decades however most of the existing literatures mainly focused on the elimination of parent antibiotics instead of the ecotoxicity changes along with their structural transformation this review comprehensively surveyed previous literatures about reaction kinetics abiotic transformation pathways of sas in various environmental and advanced water treatment processes the structural transformation of sas and corresponding changes of ecotoxicity were firstly reviewed aiming to provide useful information for the development of effective treatment technologies the evaluation of different chemical treatment technologies was also conducted from the point of both toxicity elimination and treatment efficiency however the knowledge gap on the structure activity relationship of sas and their transformation intermediates still exists due to the structural diversity and difference in the evaluation method according to the above discussions the application of biochar or metal based oxidants in aops was identified as a future trend for sa treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16751,sulfonamides sas are among the most widely used antibiotics to treat bacterial infections for humans and animals they are also used in livestock agriculture to improve growth and feed efficiency in many countries recent years there is a growing concern about the environmental fate and treatment technologies of sas in order to eliminate their potential impact on the ecosystem and human health additionally sas are frequently used as model compounds to evaluate the performance of newly developed advanced water treatment processes hence understanding the chemical reaction features of sas can provide valuable information for further technological development in this review the reaction kinetics abiotic transformations and corresponding ecotoxicity changes of sas in natural environments and water treatment processes were comprehensively analyzed to draw critical suggestion and new insights the oh based aop is proposed as an effective method for the elimination of sas toxicity although it is susceptible to water constituent due to low selectivity the application of biochar or metal based oxidants in aops is becoming a future trend for sa treatment overall this review would provide useful information for the development of advanced water treatment technologies and the control of ecological risks related to sas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamides treatment technology abiotic transformation ecological toxicity kinetics 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used for decades to treat bacterial infections for humans and animals since the discovery of penicillin in 1929 burkholder 1959 williams 1985 they are also used extensively as growth promoters and or disease suppressors in livestock and aquaculture farms zhou et al 2013a the global consumption of antibiotics has increased by 65 from 2000 to 2015 bringing about environmental residues and antibiotic resistance that seriously threaten the global health klein et al 2018 sulfonamides sas and their derivatives have been used as synthetic antibiotics for the longest time and are still among the most widely used antibiotics in modern livestock industries mu et al 2015 the sales of sas for food producing animals during 2012 on average per european union member state and in the united states was 31 8 tons and 493 51 tons respectively economou and gousia 2015 the usage amount of sas in china during 2013 was estimated 7920 tons zhang et al 2015a sas consist of two aromatic moieties an aniline ring and a heterocyclic n containing ring r substituent which are joined through a sulfonamide linkage nh so2 feng et al 2019 they are amphoteric compounds that undergo two acid base equilibria with different dissociation constants the aniline amino nitrogen nh2 has a pka value at ph 2 3 while sulfanilamide nitrogen so2 nh has a pka value at ph 4 5 11 baran et al 2011 qiang and adams 2004 sas are commonly divided into five membered and six membered sas on the basis of the atomic number of r substituent which greatly influences their transformation mechanisms and reaction kinetics the structure and physicochemical parameters of common sas are listed in table 1 sas are incompletely metabolized in the body of humans and animals and are difficult to be removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes a large proportion of the consumed sas may enter the environment in their parent and moderately metabolized forms with the discharge of excretions or wastewater effluent ahmed et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a due to their high water solubility and weak adsorption sas and their metabolites are often mobile and can be easily spread in the environment kodesova et al 2016 leal et al 2013 as a result the aquatic environment is a main sink for sas and metabolites ng μg l 1 which are also frequently detected in agricultural soil or river sediments ng μg g 1 gros et al 2010 liu and wong 2013 sarmah et al 2006 zhang et al 2015a once sas enter the environment they may pose adverse effects to the ecosystem by changing the natural microbial communities or developing antibiotic resistant bacteria allen et al 2010 blaser 2016 grenni et al 2018 antibiotic resistance genes args which are widespread in the environment across the world have become one of the biggest threats to public health in the 21st century d costa et al 2011 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 as a consequence of extensive usage of sas over the years sulfonamide resistance genes have been detected in many soil and aquatic environments worldwide gao et al 2012b zhou et al 2017 posing a significant threat to the environment and human health moreover sas have become frequently used model compounds to test the performance of emerging treatment technologies in the environmental discipline bibliometric analysis was conducted by searching with the topic of ppcp and treatment for publications between 2001 and 2021 in the science citation index sci among the 1472 literatures on treatment technologies for pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps about 14 5 used sas as target compounds hence understanding the chemical reaction features of sas would provide valuable information for effective technological development in the future to date numerous treatment technologies including photolysis lian et al 2015 willach et al 2018 ozonization dodd et al 2006 gomez ramos mdel et al 2011 chlorination dong et al 2019 gao et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops acosta rangel et al 2018 yang et al 2017 have been developed for the removal of sas however the decomposition of parent sas may not necessarily lead to the elimination of their ecotoxicity which could be of greater environmental concerns noted that the ecotoxicity in this review includes antimicrobial ability acute toxicity chronic toxicity and genotoxicity for example the nitro derivative of sas generated by the attack of sulfate radical so4 or carbonate radical co3 has been demonstrated to be more toxic toward v fischeri than the parent form yang et al 2017 the elevated ecotoxicity of sas induced by the modification at the para amino group has also been confirmed by majewsky et al 2014 hence it is of vital importance to understand the ecotoxicity changes of sas as they undergo structural transformation in different processes this paper comprehensively reviews the reaction kinetics characteristic structural transformations and corresponding ecotoxicity changes of sas in various abiotic processes including environmental and engineering processes the aim was to provide critical information useful for the development of advanced water treatment technologies and the control of ecological risks related to sas 2 reaction rates of sas in various chemical processes 2 1 photolysis photodegradation has been considered as the major pathway for natural attenuation of sas li et al 2018a several studies boreen et al 2004 2005 ge et al 2019 reported the direct photolysis of sas under natural sunlight the rate constant of which range from 10 7 to 1 3 10 4 s 1 table 2 the half life t 1 2 of sas in winter 31 06 1925 41 h is approximately 1 2 order of magnitude higher than that in summer 3 0 44 78 h demonstrating the photolysis of sas is highly sensitive to seasonal variation ge et al 2019 this indicated the strong dependency of sas photolysis on sunlight condition as they have only spectra tail 290 325 nm overlapping with solar irradiation wei et al 2019 furthermore the triplet excited dissolved organic matter 3dom has been proved to be the most important reactive intermediate for the natural photolysis of sas with six membered r boreen et al 2005 wang et al 2018 ultraviolet uv irradiation has been increasingly used for disinfection of wastewater and drinking water sas are susceptible to photodegradation under uvc irradiation 245 nm the direct photolysis rate constants of which range from 10 5 to 10 3 s 1 under conventional irradiation conditions table 2 however the direct photodegradation of sas was more sensitive to the variation of uvb radiation since they have maximal absorption within the uvb region 290 320 nm moore and zhou 1994 it has also been reported that the photolysis of sas is favored at lower ph conditions where the maximal absorption shifts to lower wavelength wei et al 2019 the direct photolysis of sas varied greatly depending on irradiation source matrix and ph condition boreen et al 2004 challis et al 2013 for example the photolysis rate constants for sulfamethoxazole smx and sulfisoxazole siz greatly decreazed with increasing ph while sulfamethizole smiz sulfathiazole stz and sulfamethazine sm2 showed the opposite change table 2 the inconsistent trends may ascribe to the different photochemical behaviors of sas with different substituents boreen et al 2005 ge et al 2018 niu et al 2013 song et al 2017 generally the sas with five membered r exhibit a higher photolysis rate than those with six membered r due to their different electron densities cui et al 2016 lian et al 2015 tian et al 2020 according to the hückel law the o or s atom located in the five membered r can provide lone pair electrons to form a delocalized π bond leading to the higher electron density and stronger photon absorption ability lian et al 2015 furthermore the energies of the highest lowest occupied molecular orbital and the energy gap which are listed table 1 can indicate the compound reactivity and substituent effect intuitively yin et al 2020 in addition the photolysis rates of sa metabolites are greatly different with their parent compounds due to the effect of substituents on the aniline ring for example n4 acetyl smx no smx and no2 smx showed significantly lower photolysis rate than smx while smx glucuronide had the highest photolysis rate compared to parent smx and other metabolites table 2 specifically the photolysis rates of n4 acetyl sas with six membered r are generally higher than those of parent sas the opposite effects of n4 acetylated substituent suggested that the photolysis of sas with five membered and six membered r were dominated by different mechanisms as discussed in section 3 3 2 2 advanced oxidation processes the pseudo first order and second order rate constants of sas and metabolites with various oxidants or reactive species are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively so4 109 1011 m 1 s 1 and oh 109 1010 m 1 s 1 are the most effective reactive species for sas removal followed by cl 109 m 1 s 1 co3 108 109 m 1 s 1 and cl2 106 m 1 s 1 table 4 the rate constants of anionic sas by so4 were greatly higher than that of neutral sas while oh showed similar reactivity for distinct forms of sas yang et al 2017 in the high carbonate water matrix such as hydrolyzed urine co3 can be easily formed by reactive radicals such as oh or so4 and become the dominant reactive species for sas degradation sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b as the higher selectivity of co3 rendered it less susceptible to the scavenging effects of solution matrix yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015b the rate constants of n4 acetylated sas were greatly lower than that of their parent forms in the reaction with so4 or co3 due to the difference in benzene substituents sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015b by contrast such reactivity difference was not observed under the attack of oh zhang et al 2015b 2 3 non radical oxidation the singlet oxygen 1o2 and o3 are effective non radical oxidants for sas transformation with rate constant of 104 109 m 1 s 1 and 105 106 m 1 s 1 table 4 respectively both exhibited the higher reactivity for anionic sas than the neutral sas dantas et al 2008 dodd et al 2006 ge et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 specifically 1o2 oxidation was demonstrated to play a more important role than oh oxidation and direct photolysis in the natural attenuation of sas in sunlit water ge et al 2019 free available chlorine hocl ocl was the dominant oxidant for sas elimination in water disinfection processes dodd and huang 2004 and hocl 102 105 m 1 s 1 table 4 was greatly more reactive than ocl chamberlain and adams 2006 deborde and von gunten 2008 yang et al 2019 clo2 103 104 m 1 s 1 table 4 was an effective oxidant for sas under acidic conditions ben et al 2017 ferrate vi fevi 10 104 m 1 s 1 was the most reactive metal oxidants for sas while mno4 0 45 m 1 s 1 and mno2 10 4 10 3 s 1 mno2 0 0 36 mm were less reactive tables 3 and 4 generally hfeo4 was more reactive than feo4 2 and the reaction rate greatly decreazed at higher ph table 4 the reactivity of mno2 depended on its redox potential which was mainly influenced by crystalline structure solution ph and concentration of mn2 li et al 2020 song et al 2019b wan et al 2015 in addition peroxymonosulfate pms 10 4 10 3 s 1 pms 0 1 mm and peroxydisulfate pds 10 4 10 3 s 1 pds 0 0 5 0 6 mm could also degrade sas by direct oxidation or non radical reaction table 3 3 characteristic structural transformation of sas 3 1 oxidation of the aniline moiety the frontier electron densities feds theory calculations confirmed that the aniline moiety in sas was the most susceptible site for the attack of electrophilic oxidants or radicals shad et al 2018 density functional theory dft calculations also suggested that the n4 c5 and c8 atoms fig 1 on the aniline ring of sas molecule had high potential to be oxidized yin et al 2018a zhang et al 2020b the transformations of aniline moiety in sas fig 2 by so4 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2015 yin et al 2018a zhou et al 2019 co3 wojnarovits et al 2020 zhang et al 2015b zhang et al 2016b cl liu et al 2020b 1o2 wang et al 2020a yin et al 2020 pms bao et al 2019 liu et al 2020a yin et al 2018b o3 dantas et al 2008 shad et al 2018 hocl dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 fevi feng et al 2019 sharma et al 2006 sun et al 2019 mno4 song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 or mno2 bialk et al 2005 gao et al 2012a li et al 2020 have been widely reported especially elimination of aromatic nh2 or substitution of nh2 by no2 has been uniquely observed by the attack of hno2 or no2 cheng et al 2020 sun et al 2017 previous research demonstrated the majority of oh attacked the benzene ring or reacted directly with nh2 group du et al 2017 solar et al 1986 yang et al 2017 indicating that the benzene ring is also a preferred site in sas for hydroxylation sagi et al 2015 similarly transformations of nh2 group in aniline to form aniline radical cation nitrosobenzene nitrobenzene and azobenzene have been reported in various aops systems chen et al 2018 duran et al 2019 the substitution of nh2 group by oh was also a dominant mechanism for aniline degradation while such reaction was scarcely reported for sas zhao et al 2013 due to the electron donating characteristic of nh2 and electron withdrawing characteristic of so2 nh the hydroxylation of sas tended to occurred at the ortho position c5 and c8 of the amino group ji et al 2015 zhuang et al 2019 in contrast the hydroxylation of the aniline more likely occurred at the para position of the amino group zhao et al 2013 both so4 and co3 are electrophilic radicals that can readily react with the electron rich nh2 group on aniline moiety of sas yang et al 2017 the amino n atom was initially attacked by so4 or co3 through one electron transfer mechanism leading to the formation of n centered radicals which may couple to form dimeric products or be further oxidized to hydroxylamine nitroso or nitro substituted sas ji et al 2017 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 zhang et al 2020b such amino substitution was also observed by direct attack of pms through electrophilic reaction bao et al 2019 yin et al 2018b hydroxylation of benzene ring through h abstraction was another pathway for sas degradation in the so4 based processes mahdi ahmed et al 2012 yang et al 2018a differently co3 was more selective to attack nh2 group than oh and so4 leading to the formation of nitro substituted or dimeric sas instead of hydroxylated products yang et al 2017 ozonation is an effective method to eliminate sas through direct o3 attack or oh attack formed by o3 decomposition urbano et al 2017 the direct oxidation by o3 molecules showed a greater selectivity than oh oxidation and the amino n atom was the first site for o3 attack with the formation of nitrobenzene group followed by the cleavage of s n bond dantas et al 2008 shad et al 2018 the hydroxylation of the benzene ring c5 through electrophilic attack by o3 or oh also occurred during the ozonation of sas shad et al 2018 the amino n atom is also susceptible to the attack of hocl in chlorination processes mainly through nucleophilic substitution leading to the formation of organic chloramines i e n chlorinated and n n dichlorinated sa intermediates dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 n chlorinated sas could undergo a back reaction to generate the parent compounds or rearrange to the ortho chlorinated product dodd and huang 2004 the n n dichlorinated sas could proceed with a coupling reaction to form dimeric products or undergo n cl bond heterolysis to generate an arylnitrenium cation n chlorinated sa nitrenium species dodd and huang 2004 gao et al 2014 the latter is extremely susceptible to nucleophilic attack by h2o at the para position to the nh2 group fishbein and mcclelland 1987 and subsequently rearrange to p benzo quinoneimine structures mcclelland et al 1996 besides oxidation of the amino group hydroxylation on the benzene ring and so2 extrusion were also observed in the chlorination of sas gao et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the oxidation of sas by metal oxidants such as permanganate mno2 or fevi most likely occurs at the amino group rather than at the ortho position of the benzene ring gao et al 2012a sharma et al 2006 song et al 2019a both fevi and mno4 could selectively oxidize the amino group through a stepwise oxidation process with the formation of a hydroxylamine group which further generates a nitroso or nitro compound sharma et al 2006 song et al 2019a yu et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the dimeric products connecting through nh nh were also observed in permanganate based oxidation process song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 however the oxidation of the amino group depended on ph due to the speciation of oxidants it was the dominant pathway by fevi oxidation under neutral ph but more likely occurred at acidic conditions by permanganate acosta rangel et al 2020 zhuang et al 2019 apart from mno4 mno2 and mn iii were also confirmed to attack the amino n atom followed by one electron transfer mechanism that generated sas radicals gao et al 2012a zhuang et al 2019 the sa radicals could proceed with further transformations including self coupling or smiles type rearrangement like so2 extrusion gao et al 2012a li et al 2020 the self coupling reaction could be significantly accelerated in unsaturated soil systems due to the high concentration of sas li et al 2020 furthermore natural organic matters noms may also enhance such transformation through radical radical coupling with sas radicals bialk et al 2005 song et al 2019b overall so4 and co3 are effective oxidants which are more selective for the aniline moiety than oh and exhibit higher oxidative ability than other oxidants e g o3 hocl and high valent metal oxidants however the reaction of sas with so4 or co3 might be significantly inhibited by noms as the reactive radical intermediates that formed through one electron transfer mechanism were likely reduced by antioxidant moieties in dom back to the parent sas canonica and schonenberger 2019 by contrast the intermediates of sas formed in oh induced oxidation could not be regenerated to their parent forms by dom wenk et al 2011 suggesting oh induced transformation differs from so4 or co3 induced transformation o3 and free available chlorine hocl ocl are both strong oxidants under acidic conditions with the redox potentials of 2 076 v and 1 482 v jiang and lloyd 2002 respectively for metal oxidants their oxidative reactivity for sas was consistent with their redox potentials which were in order of fevi 2 20 v mno4 1 507 v mno2 1 23 v jiang and lloyd 2002 especially due to the weaker electron donation ability of acetylated substituent nhcoch3 than nh2 group chen et al 1975 the transformation rates of n4 acetylated sas by selective oxidants including so4 co3 and o3 were significantly lower than the parent sas table 4 3 2 smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion the smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion products have been reported during the transformation of sas by photodegradation boreen et al 2005 challis et al 2013 perisa et al 2013 xu et al 2014 mno2 gao et al 2012a mno4 yang et al 2018b fevi acosta rangel et al 2020 feng et al 2019 feng et al 2018 sun et al 2019 cl liu et al 2020b fenton or fenton like oxidation neafsey et al 2010 wang et al 2010 so4 based oxidation fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2018a yin et al 2020 ozonation krakstrom et al 2020 and chlorination fu et al 2018 the so2 extrusion was identified as the predominant mechanism for sas containing a six membered r in direct or indirect photolysis processes through 3dom boreen et al 2005 which was markedly different from the photodegradation mechanisms of sas with a five membered r boreen et al 2004 the photolysis of n4 acetylated sas with a six membered r under simulated solar irradiation can also induce so2 extrusion products similar to their parent compounds garcia galan et al 2012 perisa et al 2013 although sas with a five membered r can not undergo so2 extrusion during photolysis the so2 extrusion products were observed for the corresponding n4 acetylated sa and sa glucuronide metabolites bonvin et al 2013 evidently the so2 extrusion pathway is greatly influenced by both heterocyclic ring and substituent on aniline ring an intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution mechanism based on dft calculations has been proposed by tentscher et al 2013 to elaborate on the so2 extrusion process the initial step is the formation of an aniline radical cation via single electron oxidation followed by a smiles type radical rearrangement of transition states and final the extrusion of so2 the aniline radical is susceptible to the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of a r nitrogen heteroatom on the para position of the aniline ring due to the low barrier of such rearrangement as for the extrusion of so2 feng et al 2019 proposed a catalytic cycle initiated by fevi in which so2 extrusion is likely to restore the aromaticity of the aniline ring with the formation of an oxidative intermediate that will oxidize another sas to generate a radical cation fig 3 a differently other studies reported that the sulfone group in smiles radical could be further oxidized by an o atom originate from o2 mno2 or mno4 etc addition to the sulfur atom leading to a thermally labile intermediate and readily decomposing by so3 extrusion fig 3 b gao et al 2012a yang et al 2018b furthermore a ring closing reaction joining the nh group from the pyrimidine ring to the aniline ring was observed after so2 extrusion of sulfadimethoxine sdm during ozonation process krakstrom et al 2020 it should be noted that the smiles type rearrangement is unique to sas containing a six membered r in which the ortho nitrogen heteroatom to the amino nitrogen enables the formation of a five membered ring transition state feng et al 2019 in contrast the so2 extrusion of sas with a five membered r was unfavorable in geometry due to the higher energy barriers for rearrangement the nitrogen heteroatom in the five membered r is further away geometrically from the para position of the aniline ring with larger so2n c n anglehan that in a six membered r feng et al 2019 instead oxidation of the aniline moiety or destruction of the heterocyclic ring is more likely to occur for sas with a five membered r by either electrophilic or nucleophilic attack sharma et al 2006 yu et al 2017 this distinction might explain the faster degradation rate of five membered sas than that of six membered ones table 4 feng et al 2019 yin et al 2020 3 3 cleavage of sulfonamide group and adjacent sites c nh so2 c the results of dft calculations indicated that s2 atom was the most susceptible site in sas to be attacked by oxidative nucleophilic species while the c3 n1 and c11 atoms showed high vulnerability to attack by electrophilic species yin et al 2018a as these atoms are concentrated at the sulfonamide group and its adjacent sites the cleavages of sulfonamide bond s n c n bond and s c bond of sas molecule can easily occur to degrade sas fig 1 sulfonamide bond s n bond cleavage the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond δ cleavage of sas yielding sulfanilic acid and corresponding amino r substituent can easily occur by the attack of nucleophilic oxidants on the sulfonamide s atom fig 1 such reactions have been widely reported in multiple processes such as hydrolysis bialk bielinska et al 2012 photolysis boreen et al 2004 garcia galan et al 2012 ge et al 2018 niu et al 2013 trovo et al 2009b photocatalysis baran et al 2009 hu et al 2007 song et al 2017 fenton or fenton like oxidation barhoumi et al 2016 dirany et al 2012 zhou et al 2013b chlorination ben et al 2017 gao et al 2014 ozonation gomez ramos mdel et al 2011 guo et al 2015 urbano et al 2017 fevi oxidation acosta rangel et al 2020 kim et al 2015 mno4 or mno2 mediated oxidation li et al 2020 song et al 2019a zhuang et al 2019 direct oxidation of pms bao et al 2019 yin et al 2018b non radical pds cnt process guan et al 2019 and so4 based oxidation fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 wu et al 2019 yin et al 2018a the sulfonamide bond cleavage is favorable under acidic conditions where the protonated amine group tends to become unreactive towards electrophilic oxidants such as fevi or o3 while the sulfonic group becomes the most reactive site kim et al 2015 hydrolysis of sas mainly through a sulphonyl group substitution mechanism upon h2o attacking was also facilitated in acidic conditions bialk bielinska et al 2012 the reasons are that the protonated substrate attracts the nucleophilic h2o molecule more easily and the neutral leaving group i e amino r substituent under acidic conditions is easier to be substituted than the negatively charged amino heterocycles moreover hydrolysis of sas with a six membered r through sulfonamide bond cleavage is easier than that of five membered sas as the products with an amine group bound to a six membered r should be better stabilized and thus become the better leaving groups in nucleophilic sulphonyl group substitution bialk bielinska et al 2012 however the hydrolysis alone did not show significant contribution to the natural attenuation of sas li et al 2018b the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond is a prevailing mechanism for the photolysis of sas with a five membered r which differs from the so2 extrusion pathway during the direct photolysis of six membered sas bonvin et al 2013 boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2018 willach et al 2018 it should be noted that the δ cleavage mechanisms of sas by direct and indirect photolysis were distinct the cleavage of the s n bond occurs through a one step manner during direct photolysis as the s n bond of five membered sas at the triplet states is significantly weaker than at singlet states ge et al 2018 the higher reactivity of sulfonamide moiety in the excited sas results in the direct decomposition of the s n bond which is much easier to occur than in indirect photolysis process by contrast the oh mediated indirect photolysis is a multi step process via two pathways including h abstraction and electrophilic c3 attack rather than a one step cleavage leading to the cleavage of either s n bond or s c bond fig 4 ge et al 2018 the multi step mechanism is also suitable for oh mediated indirect photolysis of six membered sas despite they undergo different direct photolysis pathways with five membered sas guerard et al 2009 besides the δ cleavage of sas induced by oh has been recognized as the dominant pathway in many aops despite the poor selectivity of such oxidants cheng et al 2019 guo et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2013b the δ cleavage was also confirmed as the dominant photolysis pathway for several sa metabolites including n4 acetylated sa and sa glucuronide bonvin et al 2013 by contrast another metabolite no sa favored the modifications of the substituents no2 nh2 or nhcoch3 instead of cleavage reactions bonvin et al 2013 s c bond cleavage the frontier electron density of the highest occupied molecular orbital 2fed2 homo is an indicator for the reactivity of each atom under the attack of electrophilic agent fukui et al 1954 higher 2fed2 homo values of both c3 and n10 atoms indicate that not only s n bond but also s c bond may cleave upon the attack on the sulfur atom zhuang et al 2019 smaller wiberg bond orders of c3 s2 and s2 n10 which mean weaker bond strength also confirm the possibility of s c bond cleavage zhuang et al 2019 the cleavage of s c bond γ cleavage fig 1 of sas has been reported during hydrolysis bialk bielinska et al 2012 photolysis boreen et al 2004 guerard et al 2009 su et al 2016 zhou and moore 1994 mno4 oxidation zhuang et al 2019 chlorination ben et al 2017 and electro fenton or fenton like processes dirany et al 2012 wang et al 2010 as the aniline is the least suitable leaving group upon the analogous nucleophilic sulphonyl substitution the γ cleavage was more difficult than δ cleavage during hydrolysis processes bialk bielinska et al 2012 the elimination of aniline from sas may occur at high temperature under acidic solutions bialk bielinska et al 2012 c n bond cleavage the c n bond cleavage ε cleavage fig 1 has been confirmed as one of the main pathways of sas hydrolysis by bialk bielinska et al 2012 who proposed an aromatic nucleophilic substitution mechanism that takes place in the heterocyclic aromatic ring such reaction more easily occurs with six membered sas compared to five membered ones as the six membered heterocyclic rings have a stronger electron withdrawing ability that favors nucleophilic attack bialk bielinska et al 2012 the breaking of the c n bond was also observed during photodegradation of sas with the detection of sulfanilamide although to an appreciably lesser extent than dominant pathways boreen et al 2004 the ε cleavage of sas was also reported in mno4 or mno2 mediated oxidation li et al 2020 song et al 2019a and photo fenton process trovo et al 2009a by the attack of oxidants at the central n atom 3 4 transformation of the heterocyclic ring five or six membered r the five membered heterocyclic rings such as isoxazole or thiazole ring can serve as reactive moiety toward so4 attack forming heterocyclic ring hydroxylation or ring cleavage products through either c o bond or n o bond cleavage ghauch et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 feds calculations suggested that c12 of smx c11 of siz and c13 of stz were the preferential sites to be attacked by so4 fig 5 a zhou et al 2019 the reaction of so4 with oxazole or isoxazole ring is initiated by the electrophilic attack at olefinic double bond with formation of allylic radicals followed by the elimination of so4 2 through hydrolysis to form the hydroxylated is oxazole dogan et al 1990 the latter can rearrange to a carbonyl through a hemi ketal equilibrium step which resulted in cleavage of the heterocyclic ring at c o bond and formation of an oxime fig 5 b hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2019 the oxime can release hydroxylamine to form a second carbonyl by addition of h2o similar hydroxylation and cleavage of the isoxazole ring have also been reported during photolysis su et al 2016 willach et al 2018 fevi oxidation sharma et al 2006 yu et al 2017 tio2 photocatalysis hu et al 2007 non radical pds cnt process guan et al 2019 photo fenton or fenton like processes trovo et al 2009a yan et al 2018 it should be noted that the reaction rate of siz with so4 was much higher than that of smx table 3 indicating the methyl substituent could remarkably increaze the reactivity of isoxazole ring ji et al 2015 dogan et al 1990 have provided evidence with electron spin resonance and pulse radiolysis studies that methyl substituent on the isoxazole ring favored the attack of electrophilic so4 due to the increazed electron density by contrast smiz was less amenable to so4 reaction which may ascribe to the lack of olefinic structure in the thiadiazole ring and the addition of the negatively charge n atom zhou et al 2019 the six membered heterocyclic rings which generally consists of two n atoms are expected to be more difficult to mineralize due to the higher stability of the ring structure wang et al 2010 previous studies have revealed that the six membered heterocyclic rings of sas are resistant to so4 attack cui et al 2016 fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 instead the breaking of such heterocyclic rings via n c bonds cleavage could occur during gamma irradiation induced degradation or fenton like processes of sulfadiazine sdz and sm2 barhoumi et al 2016 guo et al 2012 liu and wang 2013 wan and wang 2017 for example the pyrimidine ring can be attacked by oh leading to the breaking of n c bonds due to the stronger negative charge of the nitrogen atom liu and wang 2013 both five and six membered sas can undergo hydroxylation on the heterocyclic rings under the attack of oh acosta rangel et al 2018 dirany et al 2012 du et al 2017 trovo et al 2009a it has been previously observed that five membered r were more susceptible to oh attack than benzene ring batista and nogueira 2012 trovo et al 2009a which contradicted with the observation of six membered ones yang et al 2018a as the hydroxyl group can enhance the electron density of the heterocyclic ring the hydroxylated intermediate may easily undergo further radical or non radical attack to generate more stable dihydroxylated products gao et al 2014 guan et al 2019 hu et al 2007 especially isomerization of the isoxazole ring is one of the dominant photolysis pathways for smx poirier larabie et al 2016 trovo et al 2009b yang et al 2017 zhou and moore 1994 but has not been reported for other sas willach et al 2018 demonstrated that photoisomer was the dominant product for the neutral smx species while the s n bond cleavage and isoxazole ring opening occurred more preferably for the anionic smx species mohatt et al 2011 have proposed an isomerization mechanism initiated by the cleavage of the isoxazole n o bond followed by the recyclization to form an azirine intermediate which can quickly rearrange to an oxazole ring substituted isomer fig 6 such isomerization of smx has also been reported during catalytic photodegradation gong and chu 2016 mno4 oxidation gao et al 2014 and photo fenton process trovo et al 2009a it should be noted that the isomerization from isoxazole ring to oxazole ring could increaze the electron density of the olefinic double bond which is a preferred site for the electrophilic attack thus enhancing the reactivity toward electrophilic and selective oxidants yang et al 2017 on the other hand isomerization transformation during direct photolysis could be suppressed by reactive species such as so4 or co3 zhang et al 2016a 4 toxicity and environmental occurrence of transformation products of sas 4 1 toxicity of transformation products the substituent on aniline ring sas can inhibit bacterial growth by competitively binding to dihydropteroate synthase dhps and therefore inhibiting the synthesis of folate due to the similar structures of sas and para amino benzoic acid paba which is a natural ligand for dhps deng et al 2012 yun et al 2012 the aniline group of sas is essential for their antimicrobial effect prabhu et al 1997 richter et al 2013 nouws et al 1985 has reported that n4 acetyl sas was inactive toward e coli which was ascribed to the lack of free p aminophenyl group the oxidation or substituent of the aniline moiety would be expected to greatly influence the antimicrobial properties of sas the cross coupling products of sas with nom constituent or self coupling dimers formed via the amide nitrogen might eliminate ecotoxicity due to their lower mobility bialk et al 2005 li et al 2020 wang et al 2020b on the contrary other researchers demonstrated that sdm dimers connecting through nh nh were more harmful to common aquatic species i e fish daphnia and green algae yang et al 2017 zhuang et al 2019 the azo carcinogenicity has been previously demonstrated through bond cleavage or oxidation to highly reactive diazonium salts brown and de vito 1993 the nitroso nitro and 4 hydroxyl substituted sas have also been confirmed with more toxicity than the parent sas because these derivative substituents have stronger affinities to bind to dhps majewsky et al 2014 naisbitt et al 1999 shad et al 2018 yang et al 2017 as for hydroxylamine sas naisbitt et al 1999 reported their higher cytotoxicity compared to sas while majewsky et al 2014 found it was less toxic towards v fischeri than the parent form the hydroxyl addition product on the benzene ring was demonstrated not harmful for aquatic taxa shad et al 2018 the deamination of sas also led to the elimination of antibacterial activity toward e coli due to the destruction of paba like toxicophore cheng et al 2020 by contrast the disinfection products of sas during chlorination processes exhibited higher acute toxicity and genotoxic potentials than the precursor drug yang et al 2019 hence the environmental risks of the products generated from the transformation of the aniline moiety should be carefully considered so2 extrusion the acute and chronic toxicity of so2 extrusion products toward common aquatic organisms were far higher than their parent compound yang et al 2018b hence although some promising technologies such as the combination of naturally abundant mno2 and permanganate might be helpful for the elimination of sas containing a six membered r through smiles type rearrangement and so2 extrusion more attentions should be paid to perform further risk assessments the smiles types rearrangement and so2 extrusion of sas as well as further reactions during chlorination or photolysis processes also led to the evaluated acute toxicity towards v fischeri compared to the parent compound xu et al 2014 yin et al 2020 the ring closing product originating from so2 extrusion pathway of sas was significantly more stable and exhibited the higher acute and chronic toxicity toward aquatic species krakstrom et al 2020 in contrast the oxidized products of sulfachloropyridazine scp by fevi through so2 extrusion had lower toxicity than its parent compound which may be ascribed to the further oxidation of amino substitution to hydroxylamine nitroso or nitro substitution after so2 extrusion sun et al 2019 hence more optimized methods such as introducing catalysts in the ozonation process to enhance further transformation of the ring closing product krakstrom et al 2020 to resolve the toxic risks of the so2 extrusion products should be further investigated cleavage of sulfonamide moiety lienert et al 2007b proposed the positive correlation between the ecotoxicological hazard of sa metabolites and their octanol water partition coefficients k ow the breakdown products generated from the benzenesulfonamide moiety of sas generally showed low ecotoxicity due to the increazed hydrophilicity majewsky et al 2014 the major products generated from δ cleavage of smx sulfanilic and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole were confirmed less toxic toward d magna than the parent form trovo et al 2009b the 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole has also been demonstrated to exhibit lower toxicity toward fish and non toxicity toward e coli and v fischeri based on the in vitro bacterial growth and inhibition bioassays despite slightly higher toxicity toward daphnid and green algae than smx brown and de vito 1993 guan et al 2019 li et al 2020 majewsky et al 2014 cheng et al 2020 proposed that δ cleavage of smx led to diminishing of antibacterial activity toward e coli but higher acute toxicity on v fischeri due to the increaze of the amount of nh2 group which could interact with flavin mononucleotide the δ cleavage product of sdz 2 aminopyrimidine exhibited the higher acute and chronic toxicity toward aquatic species than sdz based on the ecosar calculation krakstrom et al 2020 the δ cleavage of sulfaquinoxaline sqx led to significantly higher toxicity based on decision trees according to the cramer rules urbano et al 2017 these great differences may be ascribed to the influence of heterocyclic substituent or diversity of estimated methods although the ecotoxicity evaluation for δ cleavage products of smx has been widely reported relevant studies for other sas are scarce hence more attention should be paid to the structure dependent toxicity of the amino r substituents nevertheless existing research has demonstrated that the cleavage of sulfonamide bond is an effective pathway to eliminate ecotoxicity of smx which is among the most extensively used sas ji et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 the cleavage of the s c bond of sas generating aniline and sulfamic acid that are not similar to paba is expected to lose the antimicrobial ability the predicted toxicity data confirmed that the γ cleavage products of sdm were not harmful to three aquatic species zhuang et al 2019 however further oxidized products such as p benzoquinone which was originated from γ cleavage of scp in the electro fenton process may exert higher toxicity than that of the parent compound dirany et al 2012 zazo et al 2007 sulfanilamide which is the major ε cleavage product has been demonstrated less toxic toward v fischeri but more toxic toward e coli compared to sas li et al 2020 majewsky et al 2014 gong and chu 2016 also considered sulfanilamide as a harmful intermediate nevertheless such transformation does not frequently occur in commonly used treatment technology transformation on the heterocyclic ring yang et al 2017 proposed that the isomer of smx would retain antibacterial activity because the sulfonamide toxicophore a paba like structure was not changed other researchers reported the isomerization of the isoxazole ring may lead to the higher toxicity toward d magna trovo et al 2009b hence the isomerization of smx cannot contribute to the elimination of ecotoxicity and must be carefully evaluated by contrast the hydroxylated and heterocyclic ring opening products are generally less toxic than the parent sas due to the increazed hydrophilicity which has been demonstrated to be negatively correlated with the toxicity of sa metabolites guan et al 2019 lienert et al 2007b however the reactivity of the heterocyclic ring especially six membered ring is relatively lower than that of the so2 nh moiety thus the ring opening reactions generally need more reactive oxidants e g oh or so4 yang et al 2018a 4 2 environmental occurrence and behavior of transformation products of sas trovo et al 2009b proposed that the major photolysis products of smx including 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole sulfanilic acid and photoisomer are more resistant to phototransformation su et al 2016 investigated the biodegradation of eight phototransformation products of smx indicating several photo stable products containing intact isoxazole ring including 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole desamino smx and hydroxylation product on the benzene ring were also resistant to microbiological transformation no2 sas have been reported as the most stable metabolite which was very resistant to phototransformation under natural sunlight dopp 1975 furthermore some transformation products or human metabolites of sas such as 4 nitroso 4 nitro n4 acetyl sas and sa n1 glucuronide have been demonstrated to retransform to the parent compounds through either abiotic or biotic processes bonvin et al 2013 nodler et al 2012 radke et al 2009 su et al 2016 considering the evaluated toxicity of some transformation products has been widely demonstrated it is of vital importance to investigate the environmental occurrence and fate of sas transformation products however research on the occurrence of transformation products of sas is quite scarce due to the lack of corresponding standards the n4 acetylated form of sas is the most frequently studied metabolite as it is the most prominent metabolite of sas and has strong potential to retransform to its parent form the distribution and fate of n4 acetyl sas in multiple media including wwtp brown and wong 2018 göbel et al 2004 surface water ashton et al 2004 and river sediments radke et al 2009 have been widely reported in addition the occurrence of 4 nitro smx and desamino smx have been reported in spring samples with the concentration ranges of 3 4 5 4 ng l 1 and 2 9 7 7 ng l 1 respectively nodler et al 2012 4 nitroso smx was generally classified as an unstable product of smx due to its back transformation into smx or its oxidation into a more stable 4 nitro smx which very likely occurred in the presence of oxygen bonvin et al 2013 hence the occurrence of 4 nitroso smx in environments was rarely reported in previous studies however it may be formed in soil and leach to the aquifer with a relative persistence under anoxic conditions for instance brienza et al 2017 detected 4 nitro smx and 4 nitroso smx in groundwater at tens of ng l 1 both of which were not detected in surface water and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent samples nevertheless information on the environmental occurrence of other transformation products such as sa dimer so2 extrusion products sulfonamide or ring cleavage products is not currently available 5 comparison of treatment technologies and future perspectives direct photolysis of sas mainly through two distinct pathways depending on the heterocyclic functional group for five membered sas the δ cleavage or isomerization is the dominant pathway boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2018 poirier larabie et al 2016 zhou and moore 1994 while for six membered sas the triplet mediated so2 extrusion is the main reaction boreen et al 2005 guerard et al 2009 for indirect photolysis of sas which occurs through reaction with reactive species such as 3dom and oh three main pathways have been reported 1 hydroxylation on either benzene ring or heterocyclic ring by oh attack with the formation of mono or di hydroxyl products of sas 2 cleavage of the c n bond δ cleavage 3 fragmentation of heterocyclic ring such as isoxazole ring which is considered to be resistant to cleavage during direct photolysis due to the lack of chromophores to absorb actinic radiation ge et al 2018 lam and mabury 2005 niu et al 2013 trovo et al 2009b for sas with five membered r e g smx the indirect photolysis did not significantly occur in sunlit surface waters while indirect photodegradation with 3dom was predominant for sas with six membered r e g sdz smd smm and smp bahnmuller et al 2014 ryan et al 2011 wang et al 2018 instead the indirect of smx more likely occurs in wastewater effluent that contains high concentration effluent organic matter efom which may form higher energy triplet sensitizers 3efom compared to 3nom due to their different compositions shon et al 2006 these findings imply that the photolysis of sas should be encouraged in wastewater stabilization ponds or wastewater treatment wetlands before discharge into natural environments because the presence of efom could enhance the removal efficiency ryan et al 2011 however bahnmuller et al 2014 had reported that the phototransformation induced by 3nom 3efom can be greatly inhibited by phenolic antioxidants in water they also domenstrated that efom apparently had a higher antioxidant capacity than nom as the input of wastewater was rich in allochthonous material who had more antioxidant moiety than autochthonous dom bahnmuller et al 2014 moreover oh induced indirect photolysis which is more effective for elimination or mineralization of sas could be enhanced with the addition of photocatalysts such as tio2 cofe2o4 tio2 tio2 fecl3 and reduced graphene oxide wo3 composites rgo wo3 baran et al 2009 gong and chu 2016 hu et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 on the other hand the addition of photocatalysts such as g c3n4 may induce o2 to benefit the nitration of amino group on the benzene ring which likely exerts higher toxicity than the parent sas song et al 2017 therefore more investigations are still required to explore efficient catalysts and to evaluate the ecotoxicity of intermediates some promising metal based oxidants such as mno4 mno2 or fevi might be helpful for the removal of sas the transformation pathways mainly include oxidation of aniline moiety cleavage of the s n bond and so2 extrusion both the degradation efficiency and pathway in metal based oxidation are highly susceptible to reaction conditions such as solution ph and matrix components acosta rangel et al 2020 gao et al 2012a song et al 2019b zhuang et al 2019 the intermediate products may also exhibit opposite changes in the toxicity compared to their parent compounds depending on the oxidants and reaction conditions sun et al 2019 yang et al 2018b hence it is necessary to understand the reaction mechanisms and toxicity changes of sas induced by metal based oxidants to optimize the removal efficiency as shown in fig 7 different treatment technologies for sas were compared from reaction rate and product toxicity aops have become the mainstream and most effective approach for the treatment of sas multiple transformation pathways of sas including cleavage of s n bond nitration and nitrosation of aniline moiety hydroxylation of the benzene ring or heterocyclic ring so2 extrusion cleavage of the heterocyclic ring as well as further oxidation to simple molecules have been widely reported in aop systems tian et al 2020 the ecotoxicity of sas is expected to be more easily eliminated due to the high mineralization degree achieved by strongly oxidative radicals such as oh and so4 however it should be noted that so4 and co3 tend to transform sas to more toxic products compared to oh due to their higher selectivity toward the nh2 group brown and de vito 1993 from economic considerations integration of biochar into aops will become the future trend for sas elimination because biochar is a low cost carbonaceous material produced from the pyrolysis of biomass inyang and dickenson 2015 jung et al 2013 it has been demonstrated that the presence of biochar could effectively enhance the removal of sas during the aops due to the highly porous structure and the enriched functional groups deng et al 2019 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a biochar can act as both adsorbent for sas and catalysts for oxidants such as h2o2 and pds to generate reactive species tian et al 2019 reported that the permanganate oxidation of smx as well as toc removal could be greatly enhanced by adding biochar powder similar enhancement of toc removal was also observed in mn iii oxidation and ozonation of smx tian et al 2019 on the other hand the adsorption of sas on biochar may decrease the reactivity toward oxidants which is also influenced by its surface morphological and chemical features huang et al 2016 thus more investigations on the action mechanism and performance of biochar for sas degradation in aops are still needed furthermore source separated urine has gained increasing attention since it may provide a great opportunity for effectively removing pharmaceuticals and their metabolites human urine contains the majority of the pharmaceuticals despite it account for only about 1 of the municipal wastewater entering into wwtps lienert et al 2007a winker et al 2008a winker et al 2008b previous studies have investigated the destruction of sas and metabolites by fevi uv based or biochar based aops in synthetic urine matrix where the bicarbonate or carbonate radical plays an important role luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021 sun et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016a in general the removal efficiency of sas was higher in the hydrolyzed urine than fresh urine however the treatment processes should be carefully considered because some urine components such as chloride ammonium citrate or urea may pose some scavenging effect to reactive species while some may enhance the reactions depending on the oxidative systems luo et al 2019 luo et al 2021 further research is still needed to understand the impact of urine components to fill the gap between synthetic and real urine moreover the simultaneous occurrence of human metabolites such as n4 acetyl sas which are less reactive toward selective so4 or co3 species will pose a significant challenge to the treatment of urine göbel et al 2005 6 conclusions treatment technologies of antibiotics became more reported in the last decades however most of the existing literatures mainly focused on the elimination of parent antibiotics instead of the ecotoxicity changes along with their structural transformation this review comprehensively surveyed previous literatures about reaction kinetics abiotic transformation pathways of sas in various environmental and advanced water treatment processes the structural transformation of sas and corresponding changes of ecotoxicity were firstly reviewed aiming to provide useful information for the development of effective treatment technologies the evaluation of different chemical treatment technologies was also conducted from the point of both toxicity elimination and treatment efficiency however the knowledge gap on the structure activity relationship of sas and their transformation intermediates still exists due to the structural diversity and difference in the evaluation method according to the above discussions the application of biochar or metal based oxidants in aops was identified as a future trend for sa treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16752,thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activated sludge was before anaerobic digestion ad was reviewed focus of the review was on impact of tap process parameters on biomethane yield by and kinetics of ad and downstream dewatering with higher initial biodegradability of untreated was effect of tap on by decreases depending on initial biodegradability by increase of 22 97 is expected treatment temperatures below 100 c showed to be as effective as temperatures higher than 100 c in terms of by increase alkali dosage and resulting initial ph have a significant effect on by increase and showed to have an optimum range of 40 60 mg naoh per g total solids ts of sludge it is advised that alkali is dosed based on solids content in was and monitored by ph treatment time of 1 5 5 h is sufficient for an effective low temperature tap t 100 c with longer treatment times showing no positive impact on by increase load of sludge liquor with organics and nutrients increases with more intensive tap conditions despite kinetic enhancement of hydrolysis step in ad more research is needed to clarify if tap improves kinetics of entire ad process which determines required digester volume impact of tap on dewaterability of digestate is ambiguous and needs more investigation using standardized methods also with regards to potential effects on polymer demand findings of experimental studies were reflected against available data from commercialized tap process of pondus throughout review finally important process design parameters of tap such as input ts and point of alkali dosage are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant pondus thermal hydrolysis biodegradability anaerobic digestion dewatering 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the unfavorable byproduct of sewage treatment process which accounts for up to 50 of treatment costs on a wastewater treatment plant wwtp appels et al 2008 therefore its reduction can lead to significant savings in disposal costs fresh was from clarifiers typically consists of around 99 water and 1 solids organic and inorganic to reduce sludge handling costs it is favorable to reduce these three parts water organic and inorganic solids as much as possible in most economical ways thickening and dewatering units in a wwtp are responsible for reduction in water content anaerobic digestion ad turns part of organic matter in was into biogas which leads to renewable energy production and sludge solids reduction simultaneously the inorganic solids in was are mostly untouched and remain in final dewatered sludge and must be disposed due to limited and kinetically slow organic solids reduction of was in ad 30 45 and its poor dewatering potential typically not more than 15 20 total solids ts can be reached pretreatment techniques have been broadly investigated in the last decades to improve both aspects carrere et al 2010 dwa 2008 2014 they include mechanical and non mechanical thermal chemical physical and biological techniques or a combination of these which primarily target the low and slowly biodegradable structure of was leading to solubilization of solids and release of organic matter into the liquid phase this consequently accelerates the rate limiting hydrolysis stage of ad and potentially increases biogas yield these techniques differ in efficiency effects complexity costs of operation etc among all thermal pretreatments have gained much interest in terms of full scale installations due to their proven effects and energy integration potentials on a wwtp high temperature thermal pretreatment t 170 c known as thermal hydrolysis th has proven many advantages regarding sludge viscosity reduction organic loading rate increase in ad biogas yield increase solids reduction and dewatering improvements barber 2016 as an alternative to th thermal alkaline pretreatment tap is a combined technique which exploits potentials of both thermal and alkaline pretreatments together it has been tested in high t 100 c as well as low t 100 c temperature ranges however high temperature tap is subject to unfavorable issues associated with high temperatures plus their adverse combined effects with alkali addition delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 stuckey and mccarty 1984 on the contrary low temperature tap has gathered much more attention due to its simpler operating conditions and less intensive drawbacks dwa 2016 advantages and disadvantages of low temperature tap before ad are listed in table 1 moreover table 2 summarizes a brief comparison of low temperature tap with high temperature th process flow schematic of sludge treatment line including tap before ad is shown in fig 1 primary sludge ps has inherently better dewatering potential and higher anaerobic biodegradability than was therefore it is more meaningful to leave ps out of pretreatment and use it for cooling and neutralizing pretreated was instead tap of sewage sludge has been extensively studied in last decades in experimental studies and research interest has increased significantly during recent years figure s1 nevertheless there was no comprehensive literature review on this potential technique reported studies from literature apply various methods for tap trials use different process conditions and investigate the process parameters using different methods for analytics and measurement in addition sludge quality as important input material differs from study to study this diversity makes it very difficult to compare results of different studies to each other and validate or cross check future findings between individual studies therefore the aim of this review was to extract summarize analyze and interpret the results of studies in literature to report on current knowledge and identify topics for future research the focus of this review is on effects of tap process parameters on ad regarding biomethane yield by increase composition of biogas and kinetics of biomethane production subsequently effects of tap on digestate dewaterability and sludge liquor quality as two important economic factors are discussed for all parameters findings of experimental studies are reflected against available data from full scale installations of tap based on the pondus process this commercially available tap process has been installed in several full scale wwtps and is operated with specific process conditions specifications in table 3 process configuration in fig 1 finally important tap process design parameters are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented 2 anaerobic digestion 2 1 biomethane yield increase in this section effect of initial biodegradability of sludge on by increase is clarified first afterwards to determine the effect of different ranges of temperature alkali dosage and treatment time on by increase and consequently finding optimum conditions absolute by increase is used as the target parameter during collection of data it was noticed that researchers use different test methods and various units to report biogas production data this makes collection and interpretation of data challenging while there are already standardized test methods for biomethane potential measurement accordingly it is highly recommended that researchers use recognized standard methods for batch and continuous ad tests to make it easier for authentic cross checking of results from different studies holliger et al 2016 has proposed a procedure for a standardized biomethane potential test it contains necessary information regarding different steps of batch biogas measurement from substrate preparation to analysis validation and reporting of data holliger et al 2021 moreover guideline of association of german engineers for fermentation of organic material is another source which describes all steps of a standard biogas measurement system for batch and continuous digestion processes vdi 2016 2 1 1 effect of initial biodegradability of was one of the main incentives of tap is enhancing by which directly relates to reduction in organic solids regarding relative by increase after tap of was there is a wide range of results in literature effect of different ranges of initial biodegradability on relative by increase is shown in fig 2 non parametric statistical test of kruskal wallis table s2 showed a significant difference between average relative by increase of different initial biodegradability ranges p 0 05 dunn s post hoc comparison test table s3 between different groups showed that range of 0 50 l ch4 per kg added volatile solids vsadded is significantly different p 0 05 from ranges of 50 100 200 250 and 250 300 l ch4 per kg vsadded moreover range of 100 150 l ch4 per kg vsadded has a significantly different average from range of 200 250 l ch4 per kg vsadded all other inter group differences were insignificant p 0 05 the significant difference between average relative by increase related to lower and upper end ranges of initial biodegradability implies that there is a decreasing trend in between this has also been previously reported in thermal hydrolysis by carrere et al 2008 in their study they observed a significant decreasing trend in by with increase in initial biodegradability of was from six wwtps initial anaerobic biodegradability of was is per se dependent on various parameters including raw wastewater characteristics types and configurations of treatment processes and operational conditions of wwtp e g sludge age another point of fig 2 is that upper ends of box plots are more dependent on initial biodegradability than lower ends overall average relative by increase was between 22 97 depending on initial biodegradability of sludge fig 2 researchers sometimes reference their individual results to relative by increases in literature for comparison or validation purposes but this direct comparison needs more careful considerations therefore it is strongly recommended that researchers also compare initial biodegradability of sludge when comparing results of their relative by increase after tap to those of other studies with different source of sludge it should be noted that data in fig 2 are from taps of all ranges of temperature alkali dosage and treatment time 2 1 2 effect of treatment temperature as mentioned earlier to examine effect of temperature ranges on by absolute by increase after tap was chosen as target parameter effect of temperature on absolute by increase of tap studies has been shown in fig 3 a kruskal wallis test table s4 showed that there was no significant difference between means of different temperature ranges p 0 05 accordingly in terms of absolute by increase temperatures below 100 c showed to have comparable results to temperatures above 100 c this means synergies between chemical and thermal effects seemed to show no further improvement for temperatures above 100 c this is not the same as with th process which has been shown to have an optimum temperature range around 160 180 c regarding by increase bougrier et al 2008 above these temperatures formation of refractory organic matter enhances which leads to decreased anaerobic biodegradability of sludge carrere et al 2010 adding alkali to the process increases the possibility of these unwanted organic matter delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 below these temperatures by decreases due to reduced sludge disintegration and solubilization effect devos et al 2020 to take a closer look at the effect of temperature in tap individual by increase measurement points of multiple studies are separately shown in fig 3b as it can be seen by enhances as temperature increases in each study however all these studies investigated temperature ranges either 100 c or 100 c except for one study by zhang et al 2019 they compared low temperature thermal pretreatment 80 c 12 h with low temperature tap 80 c 154 mg naoh per g ts 1 3 h and high temperature th 170 30 min by increase of 16 1 22 8 and 20 4 was reported for these three pretreatments respectively this study showed that low temperature tap can yield even more biogas than energy intensive high temperature th toutian et al 2018 has also shown that low temperature tap 80 mg naoh per g ts 70 c 2 h and high temperature th 170 c 30 min show comparable by increases in batch tests 25 und 26 respectively this is an advantage for low temperature tap in comparison to high temperature th in terms of energy consumption dwa 2016 moreover safety issues regarding high temperatures and pressures are omitted which promotes its popularity for full scale installations on wwtps however it should be noted that low temperature tap is associated with hazardous chemical handling transport storage dosing etc while in th no chemicals are used nevertheless more systematic research investigating by increase after low temperature tap and high temperature th with same sludge still enriches available data in literature 2 1 3 effect of alkali type and dosage regarding alkali type there was no research study which compared the effect of different alkali types on by directly this might be due to the fact that ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 have shown to be less efficient than koh and naoh in solubilization degrees after tap campo et al 2018 huang et al 2016 li et al 2008 mancuso et al 2019 penaud et al 1999 ruffino et al 2016 wang et al 2016a moreover alkalis with divalent cations such as ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 are preferably avoided due to promoting precipitation of struvite brucite etc in digesters and downstream pipeline and equipment heinzmann and engel 2006 finally between koh and naoh the latter is preferred due to lower chemical costs and lower resource value of sodium in comparison to potassium apart from alkali type alkali dosage also plays a significant role on the economics of a tap process as an operational cost factor while some researchers have chosen to dose alkali based on ph as target parameter to study the effect of different phs on by dong et al 2016 kavitha et al 2017 li et al 2017a liu et al 2019 nagle et al 1992 wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 some others have investigated the effect of alkali dosage based on ts of sludge campo et al 2018 demir 2018 guo et al 2016 nagler et al 2016 ruffino et al 2016 zawieja 2019 zhang et al 2015 this makes comparison of these studies difficult as ph of sludge reduces with proceeding of tap due to release of organic acids from sludge organic acids are produced from vs which is itself part of ts therefore it is recommended that researchers use alkali dosage based on vs of sludge as a more fixed and unified parameter beside ph this makes it easier for comparison of alkali consumption among different studies too however ts has been used throughout this study due to being more usual parameter used in literature to understand the effect of alkali dosage on by it is firstly needed to clarify the relationship between ph and alkali dosage as per theoretical relationship between ph and alkali dosage for pure water assumed that water has 7 ts with zero buffer capacity and no release of organic acids from its solid content nearly 6 60 mg naoh per g ts is needed to increase ph of water to 12 13 for an effective disintegration as discussed later to see how these ranges compare to ranges for real was experimental relationship between alkali dosage and ph of real sludge with two different ts percentages is shown in fig 4 not published data by authors measurement method description in supplementary material but briefly ph measured after adding alkali to was and mixing for was with 1 7 and 7 7 ts the alkali dosage to increase ph of sludge to 12 was at least 50 and 70 mg naoh per g ts respectively which is higher than the mentioned ranges for pure water this is to be expected since buffer capacity of was e g bicarbonate and abrupt release of organic acids consume part of dosed alkali pondus with 12 32 mg naoh per g ts suggests a less alkali dosage range for a well designed tap table 3 and fig 4 in order to benefit from self neutralization effect with initiation of tap alkali addition increases ph of was following release of organic acids due to disintegration of microbial cells neutralizes was self neutralization effect during tap this is especially essential as sludge needs to be within neutral ph zone before sending to ad process when alkali dosage surpasses a certain point an extra neutralization step with acids is needed after completion of tap and before ad this worsens economics of tap mechanisms are discussed in detail in section 4 majority of tap studies needed to neutralize pretreated sludge with extra acids before ad chen et al 2020 kim et al 2003 kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 park et al 2005 wang et al 2018 only a few studies did not need to neutralize sludge after pretreatment with acids self neutralization sufficed these studies specifically used low levels of alkali dosage 40 mg naoh per g ts these included toutian et al 2020a and li et al 2017b who practiced pondus in pilot and full scale respectively 12 32 mg naoh per g ts moreover nagler et al 2016 and campo et al 2018 reported on direct ad of pretreated was after tap without neutralization with 32 and 40 mg naoh per g ts beyond the alkali dosage range proposed by pondus i e 32 up to 80 mg naoh per g ts ph of was still increases meaningfully fig 4 however effect of self neutralization starts to decrease with increase of alkali dosage in this range this is due to limited amount of releasable organic acids in was more details in section 4 2 therefore as shown in fig 4 for alkali dosage between 0 and 80 it should be tested to see which dosage leads to self neutralization of pretreated was in tap effluent whilst achieving high enough ph right after dosing alkali dosing alkali beyond 80 mg naoh per g ts has no significant effect on final ph and should be avoided to limit chemical costs effect of different alkali dosage ranges in tap on absolute by increase is shown in fig 5 a kruskal wallis test table s6 showed a statistically significant difference between alkali dosage ranges p 0 001 dunn s post hoc comparison test table s7 between different groups showed that only alkali dosage of 40 60 mg naoh per g ts is significantly different p 0 05 from dosages of 0 20 20 40 and 400 700 mg naoh per g ts all other inter group differences were insignificant p 0 05 as shown in fig 5a as alkali dosage increases from 0 20 up to 20 40 and 40 60 mg naoh per g ts by also increases to its maximum values this increase is due to solubilization enhancement of carbohydrates and proteins as alkali dosage increases kim et al 2003 li et al 2008 rani et al 2012 shehu et al 2012 afterwards with further increase in alkali dosage by is negatively affected and starts to decrease it should be noted that error bars of ranges of 40 60 for upper and lower end 60 100 for upper end and 100 200 mg naoh per g ts for lower end are wider than others this indicates the variability of data for these ranges which might attribute to impact of other parameters e g temperature which is not considered in fig 5a and b thus above mentioned interpretations should be considered with caution decrease in by in higher alkali dosages is due to formation of refractory organic matter known as melanoidins recognizable from produced brown color and aroma which are the products of maillard reactions echavarría et al 2012 these complex set of reactions long known and researched for their application in food industry are initiated by reaction of carbonyl and amine compounds e g sugars and amino acids after heating chung et al 1986 according to fig 4 rate of ph increase falls beyond alkali dosage of 80 mg naoh per g ts therefore decrease in anaerobic biodegradability and formation of melanoidins is not dependent of ph in high alkali dosages it might be possible that reactions and mechanisms leading to formation of these matter vary with alkali dosage increase this interpretation needs more fundamental research to clarify background mechanisms nevertheless high alkali dosage leads to promotion of melanoidins formation ajandouz et al 2001 ajandouz et al 2008 thus reducing anaerobic biodegradability delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 therefore it is recommended to keep the alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts to avoid decreasing anaerobic biodegradability of was and possible increase of recalcitrant matter beside economic savings effect of ph on absolute by increase is shown in fig 5b ph has a significant increasing effect p 0 005 on by table s8 this clearly shows that it is required to increase the ph of sludge to high levels 11 and 12 in the beginning of tap to maximize the effect on solubilization of organic matter leading to biodegradability enhancement in ad this corresponds to alkali dosage range of 50 70 mg naoh per g ts for was with 7 7 ts according to fig 4 it should be noted that as the effect of high ph on disintegration of sludge is abrupt navia et al 2002 it is not needed to keep this ph up for a certain time by constant dosing since this has no meaningful effect on disintegration efficiency and leads to worsening economics of tap through both extra alkali and acid consumption for neutralization if not failure of ad wang et al 2018 for mechanisms of hydrolysis reactions there are two speculations first by adding alkali agent such as naoh to was and increasing ph high enough 12 concertation of hydroxide ion oh goes extremely high the abrupt strong concentration difference of oh around the semi permeable cell membrane causes an osmotic shock subsequently water molecules exit the cell through membrane to compensate for concentration difference leading to decrease of turgor pressure and eventual destruction of cell membrane finally intracellular organic macromolecules release into liquid phase second cell membranes in was microorganisms are composed of phospholipid bilayers proteins and carbohydrates lipid or fats which are esters of glycerol and three long chain carboxylic acids fatty acids are attacked by hydroxide ions this process saponification is a chain of reactions in which fats are converted to alcohol and soap when exposed to a strong alkali agent such as naoh and heat therefore it is indeed ph which should be maximized without introducing too much alkali to maximize the disintegration effect alkali dosage is used as a parameter to indicate alkali consumption to reach this ph and not overdosing sludge self neutralization failure in conclusion targeted ph and alkali dosage both have an important effect on anaerobic biodegradability of was with an optimized alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts for a maximum targeted ph through proper design of tap details in section 4 alkali consumption is reduced significantly while removing further step of neutralization of sludge with acids moreover anaerobic biodegradability is maximized and formation of recalcitrant organic matter is reduced process conditions of pondus has shown to be well designed to achieve this goal table 3 and fig 1 2 1 4 effect of treatment time treatment time or reaction time is one of the main factors in capital costs of a pretreatment process which determines required reactor volume although for some treatment techniques such as microwave or ultrasound it also has a direct effect on energy consumption as an operating cost factor for thermal and chemical pretreatments its main effect is on reactor volume when the reactor is thermally insulated it is extensively reported that for high temperature pretreatments such as th treatment times around 30 min are enough for increase of anaerobic biodegradability donoso bravo et al 2011 li and noike 1992 perez elvira et al 2015 sapkaite et al 2017 increasing treatment time beyond this threshold enhances solubilization of organic matter but has no significant effect on by increase moreover it also leads to increase of solubilized recalcitrant organic matter however as temperature decreases specifically for t 100 c the efficiency of pretreatment declines thus demanding longer treatment times for compensation pilli et al 2014 therefore for low temperature thermal pretreatments treatment times up to several hours have also been investigated ferrer et al 2009 showed that 9 h thermal pretreatment of raw sludge at 70 c leads to 30 increase in by in thermophilic ad which was more than by values of 24 h 48 h and 72 h pretreatment times this indicates that there is a limit in pretreatment time for low temperature thermal pretreatment on the other hand as alkali compensates for low temperatures in tap in relation to solubilization efficiency treatment time could be lessened more with naoh dosing zhang et al 2019 showed that tap 80 c with naoh for 1 3 h increased relative by up to 56 while only thermal pretreatment 80 c for 12 h led to 40 increase in relative by hence treatment time could be reduced by a factor of 10 after adding naoh to reach comparable by increase effect fig 6 shows the effect of treatment time on absolute by increase kruskal wallis test table s9 showed there was no significant difference between means of different treatment times p 0 05 however while treatment time equal or less than 0 5 h has been dominantly practiced for high temperature taps treatment time range of 1 5 5 0 h is the optimal range for low temperature taps in terms of maximum by and reaching self neutralization point of pretreated sludge before ad after fixing temperature and alkali dosage treatment time could be varied in this range to determine self neutralization point of sludge pondus as a low temperature tap 70 c demands treatment time of 2 0 2 5 h which falls within this range in similar tap studies 70 c which did not demand neutralization of was after tap treatment time was 1 h nagler et al 2016 and 1 5 h campo et al 2018 nevertheless even at low temperatures treatment time should be as low as possible while maximizing by to reduce formation of recalcitrant organic matter to conclude section 2 1 optimum conditions of tap for maximum by increase of was have shown to be temperatures below 100 alkali dosages below 80 mg naoh per g ts and treatment time of 1 5 5 0 h furthermore the goal should be achieving neutralization of sludge after tap without using acids to improve economics of process these limited ranges also help reduce formation of refractory organic matter best combination of conditions within these ranges should be further determined experimentally through optimization methods for each sludge sample 2 2 composition of biogas theoretical biogas composition is dependent on the stoichiometry of biogas production reaction taking place in ad and elemental composition of substrate according to buswell equation chernicharo 2007 elemental composition of sludge does not change drastically after pretreatments therefore biogas composition is not significantly affected by pretreatment processes including tap which is also reflected in literature guo et al 2017 kim et al 2003 park et al 2014 shehu et al 2012 toutian et al 2020a nonetheless due to some changes in alkalinity and equilibrium of buffering reactions in ad some slight alterations in ch4 co2 percentage or concentration of trace gases nh3 h2s etc could take place campo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 2 3 kinetics of biomethane production the main purpose of ad is in fact maximum stabilization of sludge meaning minimizing degradation potential of its organic content before disposal dwa 2014 single stage ad is known to be a complex process of four hydrolytical and biochemical stages occurring concomitantly namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis rosenwinkel et al 2015 pretreatment processes have proven to accelerate the hydrolysis step which is indeed the rate limiting stage for process design and retention times gonzalez et al 2018 nevertheless it should be separately considered to what extent a pretreatment process affects kinetics of the whole ad process and not only the hydrolysis step overall kinetics of full ad after implementing tap is improved if two conditions are fulfilled first same stabilization degree of sludge as that of without tap in shorter time is achieved second sludge liquor contains same soluble chemical oxygen demand cod as that of without tap in this case digester volume reduces and overall retention time decreases for more clarification fig 7 schematically shows different by curves for was with and without pretreatment for a normal ad most studies of tap show by curves similar to curve number 3 after pretreatments leading to an increase of final by chi et al 2011 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 nagler et al 2016 however curve number 3 does not lead to reduction of time required for same stabilization degree of sludge as that of without tap since it needs as much time as needed by not pretreated was curve number 1 this might be due to inherent process limitations of ad maximum biogas yield in complex biological system of ad is a result of healthy syntrophy of all participating microorganisms and ongoing biochemical processes this necessitates that all affecting parameters ph vfas alkalinity ammonia microbial populations etc are in certain ranges any deviation from these suitable ranges results in a slight inhibition in biomethane production appels et al 2008 chen et al 2008 therefore significant increase of solubilized organic matter accessible to microorganisms after pretreatment does not necessarily mean that they convert it all faster to biogas in contrast to curve number 3 and ideally preferred curve number 4 represents a pretreatment which leads to increased by and enhanced kinetics of ad with reduction of digestion volume due to less time needed for maximum stabilization curve number 2 represents increase of kinetics of ad and reduction of digestion volume with maximum stabilization degree but without increase in by biomethane potential curves similar to curves number 2 and 4 were not found in literature after tap this implies that increase in kinetics of hydrolysis step enhanced solubilization after tap does not necessarily lead to reduction of time or digestion volume this is also recognizable from multiple peaks in curves of daily biomethane production rates of batch biomethane potential tests guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these peaks represent temporary inhibition of methanogenesis which could be due to concentration increase of metabolite precursors of methanogenesis step i e volatile fatty acids acetate h2 the reason for this hypothesis is that as the inhibition factor is relieved i e consumption of these precursors biomethane production rate increases again however conclusive statements regarding authentic causing reasons need further systematic research liu et al 2020 calculated kinetic rates of four main stages of semi continuous ad after tap for three hydraulic retention times hrt of 25 20 and 15 days recently it was shown that decreasing hrt led to significant increase of soluble cod in hydrolysis step of ad 44 1 155 6 for tap pretreated sludge relative to not pretreated sludge while slightly decreased the kinetics of other three steps of acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 0 1 13 9 this indicated that after pretreatments reduction of hrt of ad could lead to increase of soluble cod in sludge liquor this was accompanied by reduction of methane production kinetics to a slighter degree although final by was still higher than that of sludge without pretreatment in this regard more systematic research still enlightens the effects of tap on reduction of hrt needed for ad with maximum stabilization 2 4 other issues digester volume is mainly dependent on sludge retention time i e hrt and volumetric flow of feed volumetric flow of feed is itself dependent on its water content or ts ad is normally fed with maximum 4 7 ts after mixing mechanically thickened was and primary sludge ps atv 1996 this limit is due to high viscosity of sludge in higher ts contents which hinders mass and heat transport in digester lowering its efficiency viscosity of sludge has shown to decrease significantly during low temperature tap tan and li 2017 wang et al 2016b this fact can be used to double the digestion capacity to actualize this was should be highly dewatered 15 ts before tap this would be similar to th in which ad of sludge with 10 ts is possible due to significant viscosity reduction barber 2016 above which ad is prone to inhibition risks therefore low temperature tap of highly dewatered was with subsequent high solids ad 10 ts should be investigated as a promising alternative to th in terms of doubling digestion capacity one of the challenging issues regarding operation of ad and activated sludge systems is combating foam production ganidi et al 2009 subramanian and pagilla 2015 especially during winter months different operational issues in activated sludge systems lead to enrichment of filamentous bacteria which are responsible for promotion of foam production after being transported from activated sludge tanks to digestion tanks as was they become more problematic foaming problem significantly hinders biogas production and increases the operating costs e g through antifoam addition according to plant operators in germany personal communications tap pondus has shown to be effective in suppression of foam production however due to lack of information in literature systematic research is needed to address its efficiency and mechanisms on foam reduction in ad or activated sludge tanks for countries where digested sludge utilization in agriculture is legally allowed effect of tap on odor suppression and hygienization of digestate is also an area which lacks information in literature and needs more research 3 dewaterability and sludge liquor quality 3 1 dewatering potential improving dewaterability of sludge was the main motivation of implementing early pretreatment techniques and still remains one of top costs saving incentives neyens and baeyens 2003 dewaterability of digested sludge plays a significant role in reduction of costs related to final sludge disposal specifically final wet mass of sludge and polymer consumption are impactful with 59 and 17 share on disposal costs centrifuges for wwtps in germany dwa 2011 dewatering potential of sludge is evaluated by measuring ts of dewatered cake and tss total suspended solids of liquor on wwtps dwa 2008 it is desirable to maximize both of these parameters with optimal polymer use to yield a higher dewatered cake and less loaded liquor therefore it is advised that researchers report on both dewatering potential parameters and polymer consumption to make it easier for economic comparison of different studies mimicking real dewatering processes on wwtps via lab scale equipment is very challenging which makes dewatering potential difficult to be quantified in this regard kopp and dichtl 2001 developed a thermogravimetric method which predicts more precise results parameter known as ds a 1 5 deviation from real achievable ts this method needs special equipment and procedure calibration as well as personal experience more simply measured parameters such as capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf or ts of dewatered cake determined by lab centrifugation of a sludge sample have also been used by researchers these parameters are usually used to compare effects of different process conditions on dewaterability potential however due to different conditions used by researchers it is not easy to deduce conclusive remarks accordingly it is highly recommended that experts develop and propose a unified standard method to measure sludge dewaterability in lab scale similar to that of biochemical methane potential by holliger et al 2016 such a standard method can be used by researchers leading to more authentic comparisons between different studies regarding effect of tap on dewatering potential of digested sludge there is not as much information in literature as for solubilization of organic matter or anaerobic biodegradability a summary of results of dewatering performance after tap or alkaline pretreatment is presented in table 4 it should be noted that data regarding cst or ncst do not represent dewatering potential parameter on full scale wwtps which is cake solids percentage therefore they should be viewed only as results of sludge capability for water release results are categorized into two groups of dewaterability before ad bad or after ad aad dewaterability after pretreatment and before ad is of interest for those wwtps where there is no ad in place and sludge is dewatered and disposed directly or sent to a central ad in these scenarios dewatering liquor can be used as a carbon source for biological wastewater treatment process according to bad results dewaterability generally tends to worsen if naoh or koh are used as alkali reagent on the contrary ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 improved dewaterability this is probably due to decrease in ratio of monovalent to divalent cations when ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 are used instead of naoh or koh which promotes final dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 dewaterability after ad is of more interest for wwtps with ad in place results of dewatering potential after tap showed to be ambiguous some tap studies in full and lab scale showed improvements in dewaterability in terms of ds a parameter dwa 2016 nagler et al 2016 however this was accompanied by increase in polymer usage due to increase of soluble matter on the contrary there were studies in which no increase in dewaterability toutian et al 2020a or even deterioration huang et al 2016 have been reported it should be noted that measurement methods of these two studies were different namely measurement of cake ts after lab centrifuge and measuring of cst respectively to come to more rigorous conclusions further systematic research with standardized dewaterability test methods is needed this is specifically a very important issue when comparing low temperature tap to th since one of main and widely reported advantages of th is improvement of dewaterability at high temperatures t 160 c to shed light into mechanisms through which low temperature tap affects dewaterability it would also be interesting to consider influencing parameters such as sludge age and mixing ratio was ps sludge chemical characteristics ph buffering system and capacity concentration of nh 4 n po 4 3 p ca2 mg2 ch4 etc p removal process type biological or chemical different eps content and seasonal variations of sludge 3 2 sludge liquor quality complex organic matter is broken down by microorganisms to simpler products during ad ch4 and co2 are final products of carbonaceous organic matter degradation which are transported to gaseous phase as biogas organic nitrogen and phosphorous are degraded to ammonium and orthophosphate which remain solubilized in sludge liquor tap targets rigid cell membranes in was which leads to release of intracellular organic matter this facilitates access of microorganisms to a higher fraction of organic matter as a result both organic and inorganic particulate and soluble loads of sludge liquor increase as reflected in increase of parameters total cod soluble cod total phosphorous po 4 3 p total nitrogen nh 4 n and total suspended solids part of load increase in sludge liquor is due to non biodegradable organic matter such as refractory dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen or dissolved organic phosphorous since they cannot be removed by conventional process of wastewater treatment they can pose a risk to concentration increase of the effluent quality parameters on wwtp dwyer et al 2008 knowing that discharge regulations are constantly subject to stricter limits it is important to take this issue into account before implementing a pretreatment on wwtp toutian et al 2020a reported that pondus resulted in 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent scod of wwtps in berlin due to formation of refractory cod in tap while with th 130 170 c this was 2 15 mg l toutian et al 2020b this is expectable considering lower temperature of pondus in comparison to th which leads to less intensive maillard reactions there is not as much information for these parameters as for solubilization degrees and biomethane potentials in literature therefore further research is needed to clarify to what extent different operating conditions of tap affect wwtp effluent quality parameters to do such measurements pretreated was should be digested in continuous ad then liquors from dewatering of digested sludge should be incubated in continuous aerobic tests which mimic conditions of activated sludge systems on a wwtp this procedure should also be followed for a basis scenario in which not pretreated was is tested to make an authentic comparison on the effects of tap this leads to measurement of remaining not biodegradable nutrient fractions in wastewater which were introduced to system vie pretreatment process regarding inorganic load increase in sludge liquor mainly nh 4 n and po 4 3 p concentrations should be considered as these exert extra treatment costs through aeration and chemicals and additional required treatment capacity in the main stream sludge liquor is usually directed to head of wwtp to be treated in main stream alternatively it can be first majorly treated in a separate stage through an added side stream treatment process and then be directed to main stream for further treatment it should be noted that through innovative nutrient recovery processes increase of nh 4 n and po 4 3 p in sludge liquor can be utilized positively especially for phosphorous as a critical nutrient this benefits numerous commercialized processes which aim to recover phosphorous from digested sludge or its liquor there is also a lack of sufficient information regarding increase of these nutrient in sludge liquor after tap and further research is needed to show how tap operating conditions increase sludge liquor quality parameters for more rigorous conclusions on its economic aspects as an example toutian et al 2020a showed that after pondus nh 4 n and po 4 3 p increased 35 and 17 respectively these increases should be taken into consideration in economics studies 4 important process design parameters economic and efficient low temperature tap process involves various factors which are closely related and should all be considered when investigating or designing this process fig 8 deviations from an optimal and correct design of tap results in an inefficient process or worsen its economics in following some of the important process design aspects of tap are discussed in more details 4 1 total solids of was input to tap ts percentage of was plays a key role in economics and efficiency of tap water as the necessary reaction medium in was facilitates mixing leading to better mass and heat transport however as ts of was increases viscosity of was exponentially increases and sludge adopts more of a non newtonian fluid pseudo plastic behavior cao et al 2016 cheng and li 2015 which in turn worsens mixing and pumping efficiency luckily after during pretreatment viscosity of sludge already reduces due to disintegration of its microbial structure farno et al 2016 feng et al 2017 wang et al 2016b on the contrary water unfavorably consumes energy e g heat and reactive reagents e g alkali which are actually intended to affect the solids in was the schematic relationship between ts percentage in sludge its viscosity and heat alkali consumption in tap are shown in fig 9 regarding alkali consumption ph plays the main role in terms of strength of reactive driving force as it directly reflects the concentration of oh in the liquid phase therefore it is important to achieve a certain ph at start of pretreatment to apply the needed reactive ionic strength for attacking microbial biomass and to assure maximum disintegration potential of alkali for a solid weight unit of was e g 1 kg solids as a basis required alkali reagent decreases as its water content decreases increase in ts this is due to alkalinity capacity of sludge which increases alkali consumption alkali consumption is not the only parameter dependent on ts of was due to following neutral ph requirement 6 5 7 5 of sludge before ad it is necessary to reduce ph of was after tap although this can be done through adding inorganic acids e g hcl it is economically favorable to avoid this adding inorganic acids also increases inorganic solids due to formation of salts the goal is to exploit potential of released organic acids during pretreatment to neutralize was after tap self neutralization effect fraction of organic solids in sludge and subsequently its organic acid release yield during tap is limited therefore its solid content or ts should be high enough to allow for neutralization of pretreated thickened sludge and not to consume released organic acids for buffer capacity of extra liquor content in sludge concerning heat consumption amount of heat required to increase temperature of sludge up to a certain point in tap directly correlates with volumetric flow rate of sludge barber 2016 showed crucial importance of reducing water content of sludge prior to th on steam consumption reduction that is in fact the main reason of required pre dewatering stage up to 16 18 ts prior to th in full scale as an example pondus suggests increasing ts of was up to 6 8 before tap this eliminates excessive use of alkali extra neutralization before ad and heating the digester through following procedure was has usually 0 6 0 8 ts after secondary clarifiers dwa 2014 in this range of ts it contains a considerable amount of mechanically separable water which contributes to its significant large volumes therefore it is normally thickened with dewatering equipment up to 6 8 ts this reduces nearly 90 of its original volume contributing to significant subsequent digestion volume savings afterwards was is pretreated through pondus process leading to hydrolyzed was with a final ph of 6 8 7 0 due to its optimized operating conditions and t was 70 c following pretreated was is mixed with same volume of ps which normally has ts in range of 3 6 dwa 2014 before sending to digester leading to ts 5 and neutral ph this leads to a sludge mixture with t 2 40 c according to following equation 1 δ q ρ v c t 2 t was ρ v c t 2 t ps 0 assumptions here were average temperature of ps being 10 c t ps density and heat capacity of was and ps being almost same due to 90 water content in both and fully insulated mixing chamber and digester in this way tap ad would need as much heating energy as an ad alone with optimized alkali dosage and no neutralization with acids accordingly there is an optimal range of ts percentage in was for tap above which mass and energy transport efficiencies decline and below which energy and or reactive reagents are excessively consumed therefore researchers should take ts of sludge into account for a properly designed tap and its techno economic assessment 4 2 optimum alkali dosage after thickening was to a certain ts there is an optimum point or range for alkali reagent dosage to perform a complete and economic tap when dosed below this point there would not be enough reactant ionic strength available to thoroughly disintegrate sludge ph below maximum ph required for a full alkaline disintegration consequently less disintegration products i e organic acids are released which in turn weakens self neutralization process by dosing alkali reagent above optimal point disintegration process would be thorough however due to limited amount of released organic acids sludge would not be able to self neutralize that surplus amount of alkali this in turn necessitates extra step of neutralization with acids on the contrary in case of optimum dosage of alkali reagent not only thermal alkaline disintegration is complete but also organic acids released are enough to self neutralize sludge campo et al 2018 li et al 2017b nagler et al 2016 toutian et al 2020a hence no additional costs of extra alkali or acid are necessary this has also been graphically illustrated in fig 10 for further clarification the progressions in fig 10 are only for illustration of optimum point of alkali dosage and real pathways and above mentioned mechanisms from authors need to be verified by precise lab research pondus consumes 12 32 mg naoh per g ts of sludge which is in the lowest range of alkali dosages reported for taps in literature 4 3 alkali addition prior to thermal heating regarding cost effectiveness of tap it is very important to carry out alkali dosing step before thermal heating the reason lies again in release of organic acids from disintegration of microbial biomass into liquid phase leading to self neutralization of sludge when thermal heating is performed before adding alkali a certain amount of organic acids are released which leads to reduction of ph this in turn leads to two unfavorable issues firstly there would be more alkali reagent needed for a complete alkaline disintegration e g to increase ph up to 12 as some of alkali would be consumed for neutralization of released organic acids by foregoing thermal pretreatment secondly since part of organic acids are already released by thermal pretreatment there would not be sufficient acids released for self neutralization of sludge after the following alkaline pretreatment consequently extra acid addition would be needed to neutralize sludge before ad this has been graphically illustrated in fig 11 for more clarification again the progressions in fig 11 are only for illustration of this issue and real pathways and above mentioned mechanisms from authors need to be determined by precise lab research in pondus alkali addition is performed before thermal heating as reported by heo et al 2003 li et al 2017b nagler et al 2016 toutian et al 2020a 5 conclusions thermal alkaline pretreatment of was as a potential alternative to thermal hydrolysis was reviewed following conclusions were drawn biogas yield increase of was after pretreatment lessens as initial biodegradability of sludge increases depending on initial biodegradability biogas yield increase of 22 97 is expected low temperature tap t 100 c increases biogas yield to a comparable extent as of high temperature thermal hydrolysis t 170 c alkali dosage and resulting initial ph have a significant effect on biogas yield it is recommended to keep alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts of was for maximum biomethane production and achieving self neutralization after tap keeping ph high by constant dosing of alkali should be avoided it is advisable to dose alkali based on organic solid weight unit of sludge e g mg naoh per g vs sludge instead of only adjusting to a fixed ph this makes calculation of alkali consumption possible for comparison between studies treatment time between 1 5 and 5 0 h is sufficient for low temperature tap after fixing temperature and alkali dosage treatment time can be varied in this range to achieve self neutralization point after tap the potential benefit of tap to reduce digestion time needed for maximum stabilization of was kinetics evaluation of biogas production cannot be confirmed and needs more research effect of low temperature tap on dewatering potential of digestate seems to be ambiguous and needs more systematic research especially final ts and polymer consumptions should be investigated for more rigorous conclusions therefore a standardized method for dewaterability measurement in lab scale should be developed for better comparability of results impact of tap on sludge liquor quality parameters dissolved nutrients as well as refractory organic matter suppression of foaming in digester and hygienization of digestate needs more research optimized process conditions temperature alkali dosage and treatment time ts of was and performing alkali dosing step before heating step with goal of self neutralization of was after tap are key factors of an efficient and economic tap finally despite extensive studies in literature and existing full scale installations tap still needs more research for clarification of its underlying mechanisms performance in terms of

16752,thermal alkaline pretreatment tap of waste activated sludge was before anaerobic digestion ad was reviewed focus of the review was on impact of tap process parameters on biomethane yield by and kinetics of ad and downstream dewatering with higher initial biodegradability of untreated was effect of tap on by decreases depending on initial biodegradability by increase of 22 97 is expected treatment temperatures below 100 c showed to be as effective as temperatures higher than 100 c in terms of by increase alkali dosage and resulting initial ph have a significant effect on by increase and showed to have an optimum range of 40 60 mg naoh per g total solids ts of sludge it is advised that alkali is dosed based on solids content in was and monitored by ph treatment time of 1 5 5 h is sufficient for an effective low temperature tap t 100 c with longer treatment times showing no positive impact on by increase load of sludge liquor with organics and nutrients increases with more intensive tap conditions despite kinetic enhancement of hydrolysis step in ad more research is needed to clarify if tap improves kinetics of entire ad process which determines required digester volume impact of tap on dewaterability of digestate is ambiguous and needs more investigation using standardized methods also with regards to potential effects on polymer demand findings of experimental studies were reflected against available data from commercialized tap process of pondus throughout review finally important process design parameters of tap such as input ts and point of alkali dosage are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater treatment plant pondus thermal hydrolysis biodegradability anaerobic digestion dewatering 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the unfavorable byproduct of sewage treatment process which accounts for up to 50 of treatment costs on a wastewater treatment plant wwtp appels et al 2008 therefore its reduction can lead to significant savings in disposal costs fresh was from clarifiers typically consists of around 99 water and 1 solids organic and inorganic to reduce sludge handling costs it is favorable to reduce these three parts water organic and inorganic solids as much as possible in most economical ways thickening and dewatering units in a wwtp are responsible for reduction in water content anaerobic digestion ad turns part of organic matter in was into biogas which leads to renewable energy production and sludge solids reduction simultaneously the inorganic solids in was are mostly untouched and remain in final dewatered sludge and must be disposed due to limited and kinetically slow organic solids reduction of was in ad 30 45 and its poor dewatering potential typically not more than 15 20 total solids ts can be reached pretreatment techniques have been broadly investigated in the last decades to improve both aspects carrere et al 2010 dwa 2008 2014 they include mechanical and non mechanical thermal chemical physical and biological techniques or a combination of these which primarily target the low and slowly biodegradable structure of was leading to solubilization of solids and release of organic matter into the liquid phase this consequently accelerates the rate limiting hydrolysis stage of ad and potentially increases biogas yield these techniques differ in efficiency effects complexity costs of operation etc among all thermal pretreatments have gained much interest in terms of full scale installations due to their proven effects and energy integration potentials on a wwtp high temperature thermal pretreatment t 170 c known as thermal hydrolysis th has proven many advantages regarding sludge viscosity reduction organic loading rate increase in ad biogas yield increase solids reduction and dewatering improvements barber 2016 as an alternative to th thermal alkaline pretreatment tap is a combined technique which exploits potentials of both thermal and alkaline pretreatments together it has been tested in high t 100 c as well as low t 100 c temperature ranges however high temperature tap is subject to unfavorable issues associated with high temperatures plus their adverse combined effects with alkali addition delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 stuckey and mccarty 1984 on the contrary low temperature tap has gathered much more attention due to its simpler operating conditions and less intensive drawbacks dwa 2016 advantages and disadvantages of low temperature tap before ad are listed in table 1 moreover table 2 summarizes a brief comparison of low temperature tap with high temperature th process flow schematic of sludge treatment line including tap before ad is shown in fig 1 primary sludge ps has inherently better dewatering potential and higher anaerobic biodegradability than was therefore it is more meaningful to leave ps out of pretreatment and use it for cooling and neutralizing pretreated was instead tap of sewage sludge has been extensively studied in last decades in experimental studies and research interest has increased significantly during recent years figure s1 nevertheless there was no comprehensive literature review on this potential technique reported studies from literature apply various methods for tap trials use different process conditions and investigate the process parameters using different methods for analytics and measurement in addition sludge quality as important input material differs from study to study this diversity makes it very difficult to compare results of different studies to each other and validate or cross check future findings between individual studies therefore the aim of this review was to extract summarize analyze and interpret the results of studies in literature to report on current knowledge and identify topics for future research the focus of this review is on effects of tap process parameters on ad regarding biomethane yield by increase composition of biogas and kinetics of biomethane production subsequently effects of tap on digestate dewaterability and sludge liquor quality as two important economic factors are discussed for all parameters findings of experimental studies are reflected against available data from full scale installations of tap based on the pondus process this commercially available tap process has been installed in several full scale wwtps and is operated with specific process conditions specifications in table 3 process configuration in fig 1 finally important tap process design parameters are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented 2 anaerobic digestion 2 1 biomethane yield increase in this section effect of initial biodegradability of sludge on by increase is clarified first afterwards to determine the effect of different ranges of temperature alkali dosage and treatment time on by increase and consequently finding optimum conditions absolute by increase is used as the target parameter during collection of data it was noticed that researchers use different test methods and various units to report biogas production data this makes collection and interpretation of data challenging while there are already standardized test methods for biomethane potential measurement accordingly it is highly recommended that researchers use recognized standard methods for batch and continuous ad tests to make it easier for authentic cross checking of results from different studies holliger et al 2016 has proposed a procedure for a standardized biomethane potential test it contains necessary information regarding different steps of batch biogas measurement from substrate preparation to analysis validation and reporting of data holliger et al 2021 moreover guideline of association of german engineers for fermentation of organic material is another source which describes all steps of a standard biogas measurement system for batch and continuous digestion processes vdi 2016 2 1 1 effect of initial biodegradability of was one of the main incentives of tap is enhancing by which directly relates to reduction in organic solids regarding relative by increase after tap of was there is a wide range of results in literature effect of different ranges of initial biodegradability on relative by increase is shown in fig 2 non parametric statistical test of kruskal wallis table s2 showed a significant difference between average relative by increase of different initial biodegradability ranges p 0 05 dunn s post hoc comparison test table s3 between different groups showed that range of 0 50 l ch4 per kg added volatile solids vsadded is significantly different p 0 05 from ranges of 50 100 200 250 and 250 300 l ch4 per kg vsadded moreover range of 100 150 l ch4 per kg vsadded has a significantly different average from range of 200 250 l ch4 per kg vsadded all other inter group differences were insignificant p 0 05 the significant difference between average relative by increase related to lower and upper end ranges of initial biodegradability implies that there is a decreasing trend in between this has also been previously reported in thermal hydrolysis by carrere et al 2008 in their study they observed a significant decreasing trend in by with increase in initial biodegradability of was from six wwtps initial anaerobic biodegradability of was is per se dependent on various parameters including raw wastewater characteristics types and configurations of treatment processes and operational conditions of wwtp e g sludge age another point of fig 2 is that upper ends of box plots are more dependent on initial biodegradability than lower ends overall average relative by increase was between 22 97 depending on initial biodegradability of sludge fig 2 researchers sometimes reference their individual results to relative by increases in literature for comparison or validation purposes but this direct comparison needs more careful considerations therefore it is strongly recommended that researchers also compare initial biodegradability of sludge when comparing results of their relative by increase after tap to those of other studies with different source of sludge it should be noted that data in fig 2 are from taps of all ranges of temperature alkali dosage and treatment time 2 1 2 effect of treatment temperature as mentioned earlier to examine effect of temperature ranges on by absolute by increase after tap was chosen as target parameter effect of temperature on absolute by increase of tap studies has been shown in fig 3 a kruskal wallis test table s4 showed that there was no significant difference between means of different temperature ranges p 0 05 accordingly in terms of absolute by increase temperatures below 100 c showed to have comparable results to temperatures above 100 c this means synergies between chemical and thermal effects seemed to show no further improvement for temperatures above 100 c this is not the same as with th process which has been shown to have an optimum temperature range around 160 180 c regarding by increase bougrier et al 2008 above these temperatures formation of refractory organic matter enhances which leads to decreased anaerobic biodegradability of sludge carrere et al 2010 adding alkali to the process increases the possibility of these unwanted organic matter delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 below these temperatures by decreases due to reduced sludge disintegration and solubilization effect devos et al 2020 to take a closer look at the effect of temperature in tap individual by increase measurement points of multiple studies are separately shown in fig 3b as it can be seen by enhances as temperature increases in each study however all these studies investigated temperature ranges either 100 c or 100 c except for one study by zhang et al 2019 they compared low temperature thermal pretreatment 80 c 12 h with low temperature tap 80 c 154 mg naoh per g ts 1 3 h and high temperature th 170 30 min by increase of 16 1 22 8 and 20 4 was reported for these three pretreatments respectively this study showed that low temperature tap can yield even more biogas than energy intensive high temperature th toutian et al 2018 has also shown that low temperature tap 80 mg naoh per g ts 70 c 2 h and high temperature th 170 c 30 min show comparable by increases in batch tests 25 und 26 respectively this is an advantage for low temperature tap in comparison to high temperature th in terms of energy consumption dwa 2016 moreover safety issues regarding high temperatures and pressures are omitted which promotes its popularity for full scale installations on wwtps however it should be noted that low temperature tap is associated with hazardous chemical handling transport storage dosing etc while in th no chemicals are used nevertheless more systematic research investigating by increase after low temperature tap and high temperature th with same sludge still enriches available data in literature 2 1 3 effect of alkali type and dosage regarding alkali type there was no research study which compared the effect of different alkali types on by directly this might be due to the fact that ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 have shown to be less efficient than koh and naoh in solubilization degrees after tap campo et al 2018 huang et al 2016 li et al 2008 mancuso et al 2019 penaud et al 1999 ruffino et al 2016 wang et al 2016a moreover alkalis with divalent cations such as ca oh 2 and mg oh 2 are preferably avoided due to promoting precipitation of struvite brucite etc in digesters and downstream pipeline and equipment heinzmann and engel 2006 finally between koh and naoh the latter is preferred due to lower chemical costs and lower resource value of sodium in comparison to potassium apart from alkali type alkali dosage also plays a significant role on the economics of a tap process as an operational cost factor while some researchers have chosen to dose alkali based on ph as target parameter to study the effect of different phs on by dong et al 2016 kavitha et al 2017 li et al 2017a liu et al 2019 nagle et al 1992 wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2017 some others have investigated the effect of alkali dosage based on ts of sludge campo et al 2018 demir 2018 guo et al 2016 nagler et al 2016 ruffino et al 2016 zawieja 2019 zhang et al 2015 this makes comparison of these studies difficult as ph of sludge reduces with proceeding of tap due to release of organic acids from sludge organic acids are produced from vs which is itself part of ts therefore it is recommended that researchers use alkali dosage based on vs of sludge as a more fixed and unified parameter beside ph this makes it easier for comparison of alkali consumption among different studies too however ts has been used throughout this study due to being more usual parameter used in literature to understand the effect of alkali dosage on by it is firstly needed to clarify the relationship between ph and alkali dosage as per theoretical relationship between ph and alkali dosage for pure water assumed that water has 7 ts with zero buffer capacity and no release of organic acids from its solid content nearly 6 60 mg naoh per g ts is needed to increase ph of water to 12 13 for an effective disintegration as discussed later to see how these ranges compare to ranges for real was experimental relationship between alkali dosage and ph of real sludge with two different ts percentages is shown in fig 4 not published data by authors measurement method description in supplementary material but briefly ph measured after adding alkali to was and mixing for was with 1 7 and 7 7 ts the alkali dosage to increase ph of sludge to 12 was at least 50 and 70 mg naoh per g ts respectively which is higher than the mentioned ranges for pure water this is to be expected since buffer capacity of was e g bicarbonate and abrupt release of organic acids consume part of dosed alkali pondus with 12 32 mg naoh per g ts suggests a less alkali dosage range for a well designed tap table 3 and fig 4 in order to benefit from self neutralization effect with initiation of tap alkali addition increases ph of was following release of organic acids due to disintegration of microbial cells neutralizes was self neutralization effect during tap this is especially essential as sludge needs to be within neutral ph zone before sending to ad process when alkali dosage surpasses a certain point an extra neutralization step with acids is needed after completion of tap and before ad this worsens economics of tap mechanisms are discussed in detail in section 4 majority of tap studies needed to neutralize pretreated sludge with extra acids before ad chen et al 2020 kim et al 2003 kim et al 2013 liu et al 2019 park et al 2005 wang et al 2018 only a few studies did not need to neutralize sludge after pretreatment with acids self neutralization sufficed these studies specifically used low levels of alkali dosage 40 mg naoh per g ts these included toutian et al 2020a and li et al 2017b who practiced pondus in pilot and full scale respectively 12 32 mg naoh per g ts moreover nagler et al 2016 and campo et al 2018 reported on direct ad of pretreated was after tap without neutralization with 32 and 40 mg naoh per g ts beyond the alkali dosage range proposed by pondus i e 32 up to 80 mg naoh per g ts ph of was still increases meaningfully fig 4 however effect of self neutralization starts to decrease with increase of alkali dosage in this range this is due to limited amount of releasable organic acids in was more details in section 4 2 therefore as shown in fig 4 for alkali dosage between 0 and 80 it should be tested to see which dosage leads to self neutralization of pretreated was in tap effluent whilst achieving high enough ph right after dosing alkali dosing alkali beyond 80 mg naoh per g ts has no significant effect on final ph and should be avoided to limit chemical costs effect of different alkali dosage ranges in tap on absolute by increase is shown in fig 5 a kruskal wallis test table s6 showed a statistically significant difference between alkali dosage ranges p 0 001 dunn s post hoc comparison test table s7 between different groups showed that only alkali dosage of 40 60 mg naoh per g ts is significantly different p 0 05 from dosages of 0 20 20 40 and 400 700 mg naoh per g ts all other inter group differences were insignificant p 0 05 as shown in fig 5a as alkali dosage increases from 0 20 up to 20 40 and 40 60 mg naoh per g ts by also increases to its maximum values this increase is due to solubilization enhancement of carbohydrates and proteins as alkali dosage increases kim et al 2003 li et al 2008 rani et al 2012 shehu et al 2012 afterwards with further increase in alkali dosage by is negatively affected and starts to decrease it should be noted that error bars of ranges of 40 60 for upper and lower end 60 100 for upper end and 100 200 mg naoh per g ts for lower end are wider than others this indicates the variability of data for these ranges which might attribute to impact of other parameters e g temperature which is not considered in fig 5a and b thus above mentioned interpretations should be considered with caution decrease in by in higher alkali dosages is due to formation of refractory organic matter known as melanoidins recognizable from produced brown color and aroma which are the products of maillard reactions echavarría et al 2012 these complex set of reactions long known and researched for their application in food industry are initiated by reaction of carbonyl and amine compounds e g sugars and amino acids after heating chung et al 1986 according to fig 4 rate of ph increase falls beyond alkali dosage of 80 mg naoh per g ts therefore decrease in anaerobic biodegradability and formation of melanoidins is not dependent of ph in high alkali dosages it might be possible that reactions and mechanisms leading to formation of these matter vary with alkali dosage increase this interpretation needs more fundamental research to clarify background mechanisms nevertheless high alkali dosage leads to promotion of melanoidins formation ajandouz et al 2001 ajandouz et al 2008 thus reducing anaerobic biodegradability delgenès et al 2000 penaud et al 1999 penaud et al 2000 therefore it is recommended to keep the alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts to avoid decreasing anaerobic biodegradability of was and possible increase of recalcitrant matter beside economic savings effect of ph on absolute by increase is shown in fig 5b ph has a significant increasing effect p 0 005 on by table s8 this clearly shows that it is required to increase the ph of sludge to high levels 11 and 12 in the beginning of tap to maximize the effect on solubilization of organic matter leading to biodegradability enhancement in ad this corresponds to alkali dosage range of 50 70 mg naoh per g ts for was with 7 7 ts according to fig 4 it should be noted that as the effect of high ph on disintegration of sludge is abrupt navia et al 2002 it is not needed to keep this ph up for a certain time by constant dosing since this has no meaningful effect on disintegration efficiency and leads to worsening economics of tap through both extra alkali and acid consumption for neutralization if not failure of ad wang et al 2018 for mechanisms of hydrolysis reactions there are two speculations first by adding alkali agent such as naoh to was and increasing ph high enough 12 concertation of hydroxide ion oh goes extremely high the abrupt strong concentration difference of oh around the semi permeable cell membrane causes an osmotic shock subsequently water molecules exit the cell through membrane to compensate for concentration difference leading to decrease of turgor pressure and eventual destruction of cell membrane finally intracellular organic macromolecules release into liquid phase second cell membranes in was microorganisms are composed of phospholipid bilayers proteins and carbohydrates lipid or fats which are esters of glycerol and three long chain carboxylic acids fatty acids are attacked by hydroxide ions this process saponification is a chain of reactions in which fats are converted to alcohol and soap when exposed to a strong alkali agent such as naoh and heat therefore it is indeed ph which should be maximized without introducing too much alkali to maximize the disintegration effect alkali dosage is used as a parameter to indicate alkali consumption to reach this ph and not overdosing sludge self neutralization failure in conclusion targeted ph and alkali dosage both have an important effect on anaerobic biodegradability of was with an optimized alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts for a maximum targeted ph through proper design of tap details in section 4 alkali consumption is reduced significantly while removing further step of neutralization of sludge with acids moreover anaerobic biodegradability is maximized and formation of recalcitrant organic matter is reduced process conditions of pondus has shown to be well designed to achieve this goal table 3 and fig 1 2 1 4 effect of treatment time treatment time or reaction time is one of the main factors in capital costs of a pretreatment process which determines required reactor volume although for some treatment techniques such as microwave or ultrasound it also has a direct effect on energy consumption as an operating cost factor for thermal and chemical pretreatments its main effect is on reactor volume when the reactor is thermally insulated it is extensively reported that for high temperature pretreatments such as th treatment times around 30 min are enough for increase of anaerobic biodegradability donoso bravo et al 2011 li and noike 1992 perez elvira et al 2015 sapkaite et al 2017 increasing treatment time beyond this threshold enhances solubilization of organic matter but has no significant effect on by increase moreover it also leads to increase of solubilized recalcitrant organic matter however as temperature decreases specifically for t 100 c the efficiency of pretreatment declines thus demanding longer treatment times for compensation pilli et al 2014 therefore for low temperature thermal pretreatments treatment times up to several hours have also been investigated ferrer et al 2009 showed that 9 h thermal pretreatment of raw sludge at 70 c leads to 30 increase in by in thermophilic ad which was more than by values of 24 h 48 h and 72 h pretreatment times this indicates that there is a limit in pretreatment time for low temperature thermal pretreatment on the other hand as alkali compensates for low temperatures in tap in relation to solubilization efficiency treatment time could be lessened more with naoh dosing zhang et al 2019 showed that tap 80 c with naoh for 1 3 h increased relative by up to 56 while only thermal pretreatment 80 c for 12 h led to 40 increase in relative by hence treatment time could be reduced by a factor of 10 after adding naoh to reach comparable by increase effect fig 6 shows the effect of treatment time on absolute by increase kruskal wallis test table s9 showed there was no significant difference between means of different treatment times p 0 05 however while treatment time equal or less than 0 5 h has been dominantly practiced for high temperature taps treatment time range of 1 5 5 0 h is the optimal range for low temperature taps in terms of maximum by and reaching self neutralization point of pretreated sludge before ad after fixing temperature and alkali dosage treatment time could be varied in this range to determine self neutralization point of sludge pondus as a low temperature tap 70 c demands treatment time of 2 0 2 5 h which falls within this range in similar tap studies 70 c which did not demand neutralization of was after tap treatment time was 1 h nagler et al 2016 and 1 5 h campo et al 2018 nevertheless even at low temperatures treatment time should be as low as possible while maximizing by to reduce formation of recalcitrant organic matter to conclude section 2 1 optimum conditions of tap for maximum by increase of was have shown to be temperatures below 100 alkali dosages below 80 mg naoh per g ts and treatment time of 1 5 5 0 h furthermore the goal should be achieving neutralization of sludge after tap without using acids to improve economics of process these limited ranges also help reduce formation of refractory organic matter best combination of conditions within these ranges should be further determined experimentally through optimization methods for each sludge sample 2 2 composition of biogas theoretical biogas composition is dependent on the stoichiometry of biogas production reaction taking place in ad and elemental composition of substrate according to buswell equation chernicharo 2007 elemental composition of sludge does not change drastically after pretreatments therefore biogas composition is not significantly affected by pretreatment processes including tap which is also reflected in literature guo et al 2017 kim et al 2003 park et al 2014 shehu et al 2012 toutian et al 2020a nonetheless due to some changes in alkalinity and equilibrium of buffering reactions in ad some slight alterations in ch4 co2 percentage or concentration of trace gases nh3 h2s etc could take place campo et al 2018 chen et al 2020 2 3 kinetics of biomethane production the main purpose of ad is in fact maximum stabilization of sludge meaning minimizing degradation potential of its organic content before disposal dwa 2014 single stage ad is known to be a complex process of four hydrolytical and biochemical stages occurring concomitantly namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis rosenwinkel et al 2015 pretreatment processes have proven to accelerate the hydrolysis step which is indeed the rate limiting stage for process design and retention times gonzalez et al 2018 nevertheless it should be separately considered to what extent a pretreatment process affects kinetics of the whole ad process and not only the hydrolysis step overall kinetics of full ad after implementing tap is improved if two conditions are fulfilled first same stabilization degree of sludge as that of without tap in shorter time is achieved second sludge liquor contains same soluble chemical oxygen demand cod as that of without tap in this case digester volume reduces and overall retention time decreases for more clarification fig 7 schematically shows different by curves for was with and without pretreatment for a normal ad most studies of tap show by curves similar to curve number 3 after pretreatments leading to an increase of final by chi et al 2011 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2020 nagler et al 2016 however curve number 3 does not lead to reduction of time required for same stabilization degree of sludge as that of without tap since it needs as much time as needed by not pretreated was curve number 1 this might be due to inherent process limitations of ad maximum biogas yield in complex biological system of ad is a result of healthy syntrophy of all participating microorganisms and ongoing biochemical processes this necessitates that all affecting parameters ph vfas alkalinity ammonia microbial populations etc are in certain ranges any deviation from these suitable ranges results in a slight inhibition in biomethane production appels et al 2008 chen et al 2008 therefore significant increase of solubilized organic matter accessible to microorganisms after pretreatment does not necessarily mean that they convert it all faster to biogas in contrast to curve number 3 and ideally preferred curve number 4 represents a pretreatment which leads to increased by and enhanced kinetics of ad with reduction of digestion volume due to less time needed for maximum stabilization curve number 2 represents increase of kinetics of ad and reduction of digestion volume with maximum stabilization degree but without increase in by biomethane potential curves similar to curves number 2 and 4 were not found in literature after tap this implies that increase in kinetics of hydrolysis step enhanced solubilization after tap does not necessarily lead to reduction of time or digestion volume this is also recognizable from multiple peaks in curves of daily biomethane production rates of batch biomethane potential tests guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 these peaks represent temporary inhibition of methanogenesis which could be due to concentration increase of metabolite precursors of methanogenesis step i e volatile fatty acids acetate h2 the reason for this hypothesis is that as the inhibition factor is relieved i e consumption of these precursors biomethane production rate increases again however conclusive statements regarding authentic causing reasons need further systematic research liu et al 2020 calculated kinetic rates of four main stages of semi continuous ad after tap for three hydraulic retention times hrt of 25 20 and 15 days recently it was shown that decreasing hrt led to significant increase of soluble cod in hydrolysis step of ad 44 1 155 6 for tap pretreated sludge relative to not pretreated sludge while slightly decreased the kinetics of other three steps of acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 0 1 13 9 this indicated that after pretreatments reduction of hrt of ad could lead to increase of soluble cod in sludge liquor this was accompanied by reduction of methane production kinetics to a slighter degree although final by was still higher than that of sludge without pretreatment in this regard more systematic research still enlightens the effects of tap on reduction of hrt needed for ad with maximum stabilization 2 4 other issues digester volume is mainly dependent on sludge retention time i e hrt and volumetric flow of feed volumetric flow of feed is itself dependent on its water content or ts ad is normally fed with maximum 4 7 ts after mixing mechanically thickened was and primary sludge ps atv 1996 this limit is due to high viscosity of sludge in higher ts contents which hinders mass and heat transport in digester lowering its efficiency viscosity of sludge has shown to decrease significantly during low temperature tap tan and li 2017 wang et al 2016b this fact can be used to double the digestion capacity to actualize this was should be highly dewatered 15 ts before tap this would be similar to th in which ad of sludge with 10 ts is possible due to significant viscosity reduction barber 2016 above which ad is prone to inhibition risks therefore low temperature tap of highly dewatered was with subsequent high solids ad 10 ts should be investigated as a promising alternative to th in terms of doubling digestion capacity one of the challenging issues regarding operation of ad and activated sludge systems is combating foam production ganidi et al 2009 subramanian and pagilla 2015 especially during winter months different operational issues in activated sludge systems lead to enrichment of filamentous bacteria which are responsible for promotion of foam production after being transported from activated sludge tanks to digestion tanks as was they become more problematic foaming problem significantly hinders biogas production and increases the operating costs e g through antifoam addition according to plant operators in germany personal communications tap pondus has shown to be effective in suppression of foam production however due to lack of information in literature systematic research is needed to address its efficiency and mechanisms on foam reduction in ad or activated sludge tanks for countries where digested sludge utilization in agriculture is legally allowed effect of tap on odor suppression and hygienization of digestate is also an area which lacks information in literature and needs more research 3 dewaterability and sludge liquor quality 3 1 dewatering potential improving dewaterability of sludge was the main motivation of implementing early pretreatment techniques and still remains one of top costs saving incentives neyens and baeyens 2003 dewaterability of digested sludge plays a significant role in reduction of costs related to final sludge disposal specifically final wet mass of sludge and polymer consumption are impactful with 59 and 17 share on disposal costs centrifuges for wwtps in germany dwa 2011 dewatering potential of sludge is evaluated by measuring ts of dewatered cake and tss total suspended solids of liquor on wwtps dwa 2008 it is desirable to maximize both of these parameters with optimal polymer use to yield a higher dewatered cake and less loaded liquor therefore it is advised that researchers report on both dewatering potential parameters and polymer consumption to make it easier for economic comparison of different studies mimicking real dewatering processes on wwtps via lab scale equipment is very challenging which makes dewatering potential difficult to be quantified in this regard kopp and dichtl 2001 developed a thermogravimetric method which predicts more precise results parameter known as ds a 1 5 deviation from real achievable ts this method needs special equipment and procedure calibration as well as personal experience more simply measured parameters such as capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf or ts of dewatered cake determined by lab centrifugation of a sludge sample have also been used by researchers these parameters are usually used to compare effects of different process conditions on dewaterability potential however due to different conditions used by researchers it is not easy to deduce conclusive remarks accordingly it is highly recommended that experts develop and propose a unified standard method to measure sludge dewaterability in lab scale similar to that of biochemical methane potential by holliger et al 2016 such a standard method can be used by researchers leading to more authentic comparisons between different studies regarding effect of tap on dewatering potential of digested sludge there is not as much information in literature as for solubilization of organic matter or anaerobic biodegradability a summary of results of dewatering performance after tap or alkaline pretreatment is presented in table 4 it should be noted that data regarding cst or ncst do not represent dewatering potential parameter on full scale wwtps which is cake solids percentage therefore they should be viewed only as results of sludge capability for water release results are categorized into two groups of dewaterability before ad bad or after ad aad dewaterability after pretreatment and before ad is of interest for those wwtps where there is no ad in place and sludge is dewatered and disposed directly or sent to a central ad in these scenarios dewatering liquor can be used as a carbon source for biological wastewater treatment process according to bad results dewaterability generally tends to worsen if naoh or koh are used as alkali reagent on the contrary ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 improved dewaterability this is probably due to decrease in ratio of monovalent to divalent cations when ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 are used instead of naoh or koh which promotes final dewaterability higgins and novak 1997 dewaterability after ad is of more interest for wwtps with ad in place results of dewatering potential after tap showed to be ambiguous some tap studies in full and lab scale showed improvements in dewaterability in terms of ds a parameter dwa 2016 nagler et al 2016 however this was accompanied by increase in polymer usage due to increase of soluble matter on the contrary there were studies in which no increase in dewaterability toutian et al 2020a or even deterioration huang et al 2016 have been reported it should be noted that measurement methods of these two studies were different namely measurement of cake ts after lab centrifuge and measuring of cst respectively to come to more rigorous conclusions further systematic research with standardized dewaterability test methods is needed this is specifically a very important issue when comparing low temperature tap to th since one of main and widely reported advantages of th is improvement of dewaterability at high temperatures t 160 c to shed light into mechanisms through which low temperature tap affects dewaterability it would also be interesting to consider influencing parameters such as sludge age and mixing ratio was ps sludge chemical characteristics ph buffering system and capacity concentration of nh 4 n po 4 3 p ca2 mg2 ch4 etc p removal process type biological or chemical different eps content and seasonal variations of sludge 3 2 sludge liquor quality complex organic matter is broken down by microorganisms to simpler products during ad ch4 and co2 are final products of carbonaceous organic matter degradation which are transported to gaseous phase as biogas organic nitrogen and phosphorous are degraded to ammonium and orthophosphate which remain solubilized in sludge liquor tap targets rigid cell membranes in was which leads to release of intracellular organic matter this facilitates access of microorganisms to a higher fraction of organic matter as a result both organic and inorganic particulate and soluble loads of sludge liquor increase as reflected in increase of parameters total cod soluble cod total phosphorous po 4 3 p total nitrogen nh 4 n and total suspended solids part of load increase in sludge liquor is due to non biodegradable organic matter such as refractory dissolved organic carbon dissolved organic nitrogen or dissolved organic phosphorous since they cannot be removed by conventional process of wastewater treatment they can pose a risk to concentration increase of the effluent quality parameters on wwtp dwyer et al 2008 knowing that discharge regulations are constantly subject to stricter limits it is important to take this issue into account before implementing a pretreatment on wwtp toutian et al 2020a reported that pondus resulted in 0 8 1 1 mg l increase in effluent scod of wwtps in berlin due to formation of refractory cod in tap while with th 130 170 c this was 2 15 mg l toutian et al 2020b this is expectable considering lower temperature of pondus in comparison to th which leads to less intensive maillard reactions there is not as much information for these parameters as for solubilization degrees and biomethane potentials in literature therefore further research is needed to clarify to what extent different operating conditions of tap affect wwtp effluent quality parameters to do such measurements pretreated was should be digested in continuous ad then liquors from dewatering of digested sludge should be incubated in continuous aerobic tests which mimic conditions of activated sludge systems on a wwtp this procedure should also be followed for a basis scenario in which not pretreated was is tested to make an authentic comparison on the effects of tap this leads to measurement of remaining not biodegradable nutrient fractions in wastewater which were introduced to system vie pretreatment process regarding inorganic load increase in sludge liquor mainly nh 4 n and po 4 3 p concentrations should be considered as these exert extra treatment costs through aeration and chemicals and additional required treatment capacity in the main stream sludge liquor is usually directed to head of wwtp to be treated in main stream alternatively it can be first majorly treated in a separate stage through an added side stream treatment process and then be directed to main stream for further treatment it should be noted that through innovative nutrient recovery processes increase of nh 4 n and po 4 3 p in sludge liquor can be utilized positively especially for phosphorous as a critical nutrient this benefits numerous commercialized processes which aim to recover phosphorous from digested sludge or its liquor there is also a lack of sufficient information regarding increase of these nutrient in sludge liquor after tap and further research is needed to show how tap operating conditions increase sludge liquor quality parameters for more rigorous conclusions on its economic aspects as an example toutian et al 2020a showed that after pondus nh 4 n and po 4 3 p increased 35 and 17 respectively these increases should be taken into consideration in economics studies 4 important process design parameters economic and efficient low temperature tap process involves various factors which are closely related and should all be considered when investigating or designing this process fig 8 deviations from an optimal and correct design of tap results in an inefficient process or worsen its economics in following some of the important process design aspects of tap are discussed in more details 4 1 total solids of was input to tap ts percentage of was plays a key role in economics and efficiency of tap water as the necessary reaction medium in was facilitates mixing leading to better mass and heat transport however as ts of was increases viscosity of was exponentially increases and sludge adopts more of a non newtonian fluid pseudo plastic behavior cao et al 2016 cheng and li 2015 which in turn worsens mixing and pumping efficiency luckily after during pretreatment viscosity of sludge already reduces due to disintegration of its microbial structure farno et al 2016 feng et al 2017 wang et al 2016b on the contrary water unfavorably consumes energy e g heat and reactive reagents e g alkali which are actually intended to affect the solids in was the schematic relationship between ts percentage in sludge its viscosity and heat alkali consumption in tap are shown in fig 9 regarding alkali consumption ph plays the main role in terms of strength of reactive driving force as it directly reflects the concentration of oh in the liquid phase therefore it is important to achieve a certain ph at start of pretreatment to apply the needed reactive ionic strength for attacking microbial biomass and to assure maximum disintegration potential of alkali for a solid weight unit of was e g 1 kg solids as a basis required alkali reagent decreases as its water content decreases increase in ts this is due to alkalinity capacity of sludge which increases alkali consumption alkali consumption is not the only parameter dependent on ts of was due to following neutral ph requirement 6 5 7 5 of sludge before ad it is necessary to reduce ph of was after tap although this can be done through adding inorganic acids e g hcl it is economically favorable to avoid this adding inorganic acids also increases inorganic solids due to formation of salts the goal is to exploit potential of released organic acids during pretreatment to neutralize was after tap self neutralization effect fraction of organic solids in sludge and subsequently its organic acid release yield during tap is limited therefore its solid content or ts should be high enough to allow for neutralization of pretreated thickened sludge and not to consume released organic acids for buffer capacity of extra liquor content in sludge concerning heat consumption amount of heat required to increase temperature of sludge up to a certain point in tap directly correlates with volumetric flow rate of sludge barber 2016 showed crucial importance of reducing water content of sludge prior to th on steam consumption reduction that is in fact the main reason of required pre dewatering stage up to 16 18 ts prior to th in full scale as an example pondus suggests increasing ts of was up to 6 8 before tap this eliminates excessive use of alkali extra neutralization before ad and heating the digester through following procedure was has usually 0 6 0 8 ts after secondary clarifiers dwa 2014 in this range of ts it contains a considerable amount of mechanically separable water which contributes to its significant large volumes therefore it is normally thickened with dewatering equipment up to 6 8 ts this reduces nearly 90 of its original volume contributing to significant subsequent digestion volume savings afterwards was is pretreated through pondus process leading to hydrolyzed was with a final ph of 6 8 7 0 due to its optimized operating conditions and t was 70 c following pretreated was is mixed with same volume of ps which normally has ts in range of 3 6 dwa 2014 before sending to digester leading to ts 5 and neutral ph this leads to a sludge mixture with t 2 40 c according to following equation 1 δ q ρ v c t 2 t was ρ v c t 2 t ps 0 assumptions here were average temperature of ps being 10 c t ps density and heat capacity of was and ps being almost same due to 90 water content in both and fully insulated mixing chamber and digester in this way tap ad would need as much heating energy as an ad alone with optimized alkali dosage and no neutralization with acids accordingly there is an optimal range of ts percentage in was for tap above which mass and energy transport efficiencies decline and below which energy and or reactive reagents are excessively consumed therefore researchers should take ts of sludge into account for a properly designed tap and its techno economic assessment 4 2 optimum alkali dosage after thickening was to a certain ts there is an optimum point or range for alkali reagent dosage to perform a complete and economic tap when dosed below this point there would not be enough reactant ionic strength available to thoroughly disintegrate sludge ph below maximum ph required for a full alkaline disintegration consequently less disintegration products i e organic acids are released which in turn weakens self neutralization process by dosing alkali reagent above optimal point disintegration process would be thorough however due to limited amount of released organic acids sludge would not be able to self neutralize that surplus amount of alkali this in turn necessitates extra step of neutralization with acids on the contrary in case of optimum dosage of alkali reagent not only thermal alkaline disintegration is complete but also organic acids released are enough to self neutralize sludge campo et al 2018 li et al 2017b nagler et al 2016 toutian et al 2020a hence no additional costs of extra alkali or acid are necessary this has also been graphically illustrated in fig 10 for further clarification the progressions in fig 10 are only for illustration of optimum point of alkali dosage and real pathways and above mentioned mechanisms from authors need to be verified by precise lab research pondus consumes 12 32 mg naoh per g ts of sludge which is in the lowest range of alkali dosages reported for taps in literature 4 3 alkali addition prior to thermal heating regarding cost effectiveness of tap it is very important to carry out alkali dosing step before thermal heating the reason lies again in release of organic acids from disintegration of microbial biomass into liquid phase leading to self neutralization of sludge when thermal heating is performed before adding alkali a certain amount of organic acids are released which leads to reduction of ph this in turn leads to two unfavorable issues firstly there would be more alkali reagent needed for a complete alkaline disintegration e g to increase ph up to 12 as some of alkali would be consumed for neutralization of released organic acids by foregoing thermal pretreatment secondly since part of organic acids are already released by thermal pretreatment there would not be sufficient acids released for self neutralization of sludge after the following alkaline pretreatment consequently extra acid addition would be needed to neutralize sludge before ad this has been graphically illustrated in fig 11 for more clarification again the progressions in fig 11 are only for illustration of this issue and real pathways and above mentioned mechanisms from authors need to be determined by precise lab research in pondus alkali addition is performed before thermal heating as reported by heo et al 2003 li et al 2017b nagler et al 2016 toutian et al 2020a 5 conclusions thermal alkaline pretreatment of was as a potential alternative to thermal hydrolysis was reviewed following conclusions were drawn biogas yield increase of was after pretreatment lessens as initial biodegradability of sludge increases depending on initial biodegradability biogas yield increase of 22 97 is expected low temperature tap t 100 c increases biogas yield to a comparable extent as of high temperature thermal hydrolysis t 170 c alkali dosage and resulting initial ph have a significant effect on biogas yield it is recommended to keep alkali dosage below 80 mg naoh per g ts of was for maximum biomethane production and achieving self neutralization after tap keeping ph high by constant dosing of alkali should be avoided it is advisable to dose alkali based on organic solid weight unit of sludge e g mg naoh per g vs sludge instead of only adjusting to a fixed ph this makes calculation of alkali consumption possible for comparison between studies treatment time between 1 5 and 5 0 h is sufficient for low temperature tap after fixing temperature and alkali dosage treatment time can be varied in this range to achieve self neutralization point after tap the potential benefit of tap to reduce digestion time needed for maximum stabilization of was kinetics evaluation of biogas production cannot be confirmed and needs more research effect of low temperature tap on dewatering potential of digestate seems to be ambiguous and needs more systematic research especially final ts and polymer consumptions should be investigated for more rigorous conclusions therefore a standardized method for dewaterability measurement in lab scale should be developed for better comparability of results impact of tap on sludge liquor quality parameters dissolved nutrients as well as refractory organic matter suppression of foaming in digester and hygienization of digestate needs more research optimized process conditions temperature alkali dosage and treatment time ts of was and performing alkali dosing step before heating step with goal of self neutralization of was after tap are key factors of an efficient and economic tap finally despite extensive studies in literature and existing full scale installations tap still needs more research for clarification of its underlying mechanisms performance in terms of biogas yield increase and downstream effects on sludge dewaterability and liquor quality and finally on its economic benefits for the wwtp operator declaration of competing interest the authors

16753,safeguarding the microbial water quality remains a challenge for drinking water utilities and because of population growth and climate change new issues arise regularly to overcome these problems biostable drinking water production and water reuse will become increasingly important in this respect high resolution online microbial monitoring during treatment and distribution could prove essential here we present the first scientific and practical comparison of multiple online microbial monitoring techniques in which six commercially available devices were set up in a full scale drinking water production plant both the devices response towards operational changes and contaminations as well as their detection limit for different contaminations were evaluated and compared during normal operation all devices were able to detect abrupt operational changes such as backwashing of activated carbon filters and interruption of the production process in a fast and sensitive way to benchmark their response to contaminations the calculation of a dynamic baseline for sensitive separation between noise and events is proposed in order of sensitivity enzymatic analysis atp measurement and flow cytometric fingerprinting were the most performant for detection of rain and groundwater contaminations 0 01 0 1 v on the other hand optical classification and flow cytometric cell counts showed to be more robust techniques requiring less maintenance and providing direct information about the cell concentration even though they were still more sensitive than plate counting the choice for a certain technology will thus depend on the type of application and is a balance between sensitivity price and maintenance all things considered a combination of several devices and use of advanced data analysis such as fingerprinting may be of added value in general the strategic implementation of online microbial monitoring as early warning system will allow for intensive quality control by high frequency sampling as well as a short event response timeframe graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water production online microbial monitoring flow cytometric fingerprinting biostability 1 introduction microbial contamination is the most prevailing risk to public health associated with drinking water who 2017 safeguarding drinking water quality remains a challenge for drinking water utilities with new issues arising regularly droughts and population growth are already stressing the drinking water provision even in moderate climates e g limburg flanders 2020 due to global warming outbreaks of waterborne diseases caused by opportunistic pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa are predicted to take place more frequently and have more severe consequences in the future van der kooij et al 2013 currently microbial regrowth in the distribution network is suppressed by adding a disinfection residual at the end of the treatment train though this approach has several known drawbacks such as formation of harmful disinfection by products and induction of uncontrolled necrotrophic growth on the dead biomass chatzigiannidou et al 2018 li and mitch 2018 temmerman et al 2006 hence drinking water utilities are looking into alternative ways to produce microbially safe drinking water without the use of disinfection residuals as for example the production of biostable water nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016 the latter approach implies that the microbial community remains stable during distribution without the use of a disinfectant lautenschlager et al 2013 rittman and snoeyinck 1984 van der kooij 2000 this can be achieved by focusing on extensive treatment such as nutrient limitation e g assimilable organic carbon aoc 10 µg l and intensive maintenance of the distribution system prest et al 2013 van der kooij et al 1982 van nevel et al 2013 when producing and distributing biostable drinking water monitoring of the microbial drinking water quality becomes even more important heterotrophic and selective plate counting are the legal standard but are not sufficient for detection of short term water quality changes european communities 1998 buysschaert et al 2018 us congress 1996 online monitoring systems are therefore gaining attention as these allow a high resolution quantification of the microbial dynamics with a short time to result i e 10 min to 2 5 hours a variety of online microbial monitoring techniques is commercially available online enzymatic techniques detect the total microbial load by commonly targeting the generic enzyme alkaline phosphatase alp or the total coliforms and escherichia coli by detection of the selective enzymes β d galactosidase and β d glucuronidase respectively hesari et al 2016 koschelnik et al 2015 the microbial abundance is then quantified indirectly by measuring the enzymatic hydrolysis of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates rompré et al 2002 another indirect method for quantifying the microbial activity is online measurement of intracellular atp by detecting the fluorescent conversion of luciferin by the enzyme luciferase de vera and wert 2019 vang et al 2014 direct methods are commercially available as well online optical particle classifiers for example use microscopic images for separation between bacteria and background particles højris et al 2016 højris et al 2018 online flow cytometry which uses nucleic acid staining for quantifying the bacterial cell concentration is another well established research technique which has recently become commercially available as well besmer et al 2014 hammes et al 2012 in combination with advanced data analysis it can even be used to assess the bacterial community characteristics props et al 2016 in this study we present the first scientific and practical comparison of multiple online microbial monitoring techniques six devices were set up in a full scale drinking water production plant

overview of the existing technologies on a scientific basis in order to determine their compatibility with different applications in the drinking water sector or other industries 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up the study was performed in a full scale drinking water production plant de watergroep kluizen belgium where the drinking water is produced from surface water 60 000 m³ day using conventional techniques including coagulation flocculation sedimentation flotation and filtration the last steps of the treatment train include ozone disinfection two step activated carbon filtration

full scale environment without the presence of free chlorine from october 21st until november 18th 2019 routine operational monitoring was performed during this period the devices were directly connected to the drinking water pipeline from november 18th until december 11th 2019 the set up was disconnected from the drinking water pipeline and experiments with different contaminations were performed section 2 5 the set up consisted out of a vessel v 100 l well mixed connected to a bleeding line coming from the main pipeline from this vessel the drinking water was pumped to the online monitoring devices fig si 2 during operational monitoring and flushing periods the vessel served as an overflow to the sewer and during the contamination experiments the vessel was used for spiking and for water recirculation 2 2 online microbial monitoring devices six commercially available online microbial monitoring devices were used all techniques rely on different mechanisms for detection

analysis pcoa and bray curtis dissimilarity calculations were performed using vegan v2 5 6 favere et al 2020 oksanen et al 2019 resampling to the lowest sample size n 16038 cells was performed prior to pcoa and bray curtis analysis to account for size dependent differences the fresh drinking water samples taken before the contaminations with different matrices n 26 for both rainwater and groundwater were respectively used for baseline calculations for dissimilarity comparison fig 4 the bray curtis dissimilarity that was assigned to a sample was calculated as the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between that sample and all of the baseline samples of the respective contamination 3 results 3 1 baseline determination and response to operational changes in the first stage of this study october 21st november 18th the devices were used to follow up the operational dynamics of the drinking water production plant fig 1 for this monitoring period a baseline threshold was calculated for each device as the average plus three times the standard deviation to separate between noise e g operational instrumental below the baseline and events defined as measurements above the baseline fig 1 pink table si 1 this baseline threshold was chosen as it is a conservative and rigid threshold for event detection it is based on the normal distribution where events above the baseline will only make up 0 13 of the data favere et al 2020 howell et al 1998 even though some deviations from normality were observed using q q plots fig si 3 this approach was chosen as the goal is to define a first robust and straightforward screening method for event detection for further applications the use of moving window analysis see below and or transformations could be implemented to increase the sensitivity of the method the two flow cytometers fcm c and fcm h detected respectively 3 1 0 5 105 cells ml and 2 3 0 5 105 cells ml whereas the atp concentration was 3 6 1 6 pg atp ml the total activity detected by enz was on average 53 2 11 9 μu 100 ml which is in the range of expected values for activity after activated carbon filtration 40 60 μu 100 ml as defined by the manufacturer opt measured on average 1 6 1 4 103 cells ml with a high relative standard deviation due to the big difference between the baseline values and the peak events the absolute values of the cell concentration detected by opt are around 2 log units lower than the total cell concentration measured by the flow cytometers this difference may be allocated to the working mechanism as this device reports correct particle sizes in the range of 0 77 3 μm but smaller particles or bacteria may not be detected or classified correctly as the measurement frequency was device specific the percentage of events above the baseline was calculated relative to the number of measurements within this period the flow cytometers 1 44 and 1 58 for fcm c and fcm h respectively and atp 1 33 registered the largest percentage of events above the baseline threshold and atp detected the most independent events in absolute terms on the other hand opt and enz classified respectively only 0 36 and 0 64 of the measurements as events but showed a clear distinction between noise and events after determination of the events above the baseline threshold for each device common peaks n 5 were determined as events detected by two or more devices fcm c detected all common peaks atp detected four out of five common peaks fcm h and opt three and enz two during the monitoring period enz 2 was not functioning properly due to crystallization of the reagents at temperatures below 15 c and the relatively high amount of particles in the water the data was considered to be unreliable hence data from this device was not taken into account for analysis and discussion in a next step the events were linked to operational changes backwashing of the activated carbon filters was shown to be related to several peaks fig 1 blue fig si 4 b moreover all backwashing events that have occurred in this period were detected by one or more devices also interruption of the production process was linked to an increase in the microbial concentration as detected by several devices interrupted production meaning that there was no net flow through the installation resulted in an increase of the water temperature as well fig si 4 a 3 2 response to contaminations and dynamic baseline calculation in the second stage of this study nov 18th dec 11th the devices were disconnected from the drinking water network and contaminations were added to the vessel in the set up in a first experiment relatively high concentrations of rainwater groundwater and effluent of a wwtp were added with decreasing concentrations similar to the previous experiment a baseline was calculated to separate noise and events however because the drinking water quality shows long term variations e g a seasonal temperature decrease of 4 c during the baseline measurements the baseline microbial concentration and activity will also differ over time nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 this is why during the contamination experiments the baseline was calculated using a moving window analysis mwa based on the drinking water samples measured before each respective contamination fig 2 fig 3 table si 2 marzorati et al 2008 wittebolle et al 2005 a similar reaction behavior was observed for all devices and spikes fig 2 after each spike the microbial concentration increased sharply after which an immediate decrease was observed due to the dilution with fresh drinking water then the bacterial concentration increased again strongly and this fast regrowth was promoted by a temperature increase from the heat of the recirculation pump this was confirmed with independent flow cytometry on samples taken after 30 minutes of recycling table si 3 overall the contamination using rainwater collected as runoff from a green roof resulted in the highest responses of the devices and the groundwater contamination resulted in the lowest responses as shown in fig 2 the contamination with effluent of a wwtp resulted in cell concentrations similar to the rainwater contamination fcm c fcm h but resulted in a lower enzymatic activity response than the groundwater contamination enz opt only reacted slightly to the wwtp effluent contamination compared to the other contaminations though still with cell concentrations above the baseline højris et al 2016 due to technical issues atp was not functioning properly during the rainwater contamination and fcm h had several downtime periods as validation the online measurements were compared to plate counts from grab samples table si 3 the coliforms and enterococci plate counts indicated the presence of a contamination and showed a decreasing trend with decreasing concentrations of every spike contrary to the results obtained from the online devices targeting the total microbial concentration coliforms and enterococci plate counts indicated that wwtp effluent was the most contaminated whereas rainwater was the least contaminated regarding the hygienic water quality the total colony counts were above the upper limit for quantification 300 cfu 100 ml as the sampling point was before the chlorination step data not shown 3 3 detection limit for different contaminations of drinking water the results from the previous experiment showed that devices were able to detect contaminations in a fast and consistent way however the volume ratio of these contaminations compared to the drinking water were relatively high 0 5 10 v and as refreshment of the drinking water was only performed after 24 hours of recirculation extensive regrowth could occur fig 2 hence a second contamination experiment was performed by spiking the contaminations in lower volume ratios starting from 0 01 v and gradually increasing every two hours up to 10 20 v as rain and groundwater intrusion in the drinking water network are two major hazards for drinking water utilities in practice the experiment was focused on these two contaminations fig 3 the dynamic baseline was calculated for each contamination using a moving window to account for systematic changes in water characteristics as explained above section 3 2 in this context the baseline forms the boundary between events and noise and thus represents the detection limit of the devices for the different contaminations in question subsequently the sensitivity of each device towards the different contaminations was objectively quantified as the success rate of detection of a certain contamination calculated as the amount of samples with values above the baseline divided by the total amount of samples taken during the respective spike table 1 enz was able to detect contaminations of 0 01 v followed by atp able to detect 0 1 v of each contamination the total cell concentration using flow cytometry fcm c and fcm h could detect 1 v of each contamination fig 3 table 1 and using optical classification between 1 10 or 20 v of the contaminations could be detected these results indicate that the sensitivity of enzymatic techniques atp enz towards rain and groundwater contamination is the highest followed by flow cytometry fcm c fcm h and then the optical technique opt fig 3 or in other words that a rainwater or groundwater contamination resulted in the first place in an increase in enzymatic activity and atp concentration as enz was able to pick up all concentrations its detection limit may even be lower than the lowest concentrations tested in this study additionally the flow cytometric data obtained by fcm c was analyzed through cytometric fingerprinting from which the phenotypic beta diversity i e inter sample diversity was calculated using pcoa analysis fig 4 a this analysis showed that the contaminations contained phenotypically different communities from the baseline measurements furthermore time wise analysis revealed a boomerang effect in which increasing concentrations resulted in a gradually more phenotypically different community from the baseline further away on pcoa plot after which flushing with drinking water resulted in a gradual change to a phenotypically more similar community compared to the baseline back to baseline on pcoa plot both contaminations resulted in a similar extent of phenotypic changes in the microbial community compared to the baseline this was also observed in the bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints the bray curtis dissimilarity is a straightforward parameter expressing the difference between fingerprints with identical fingerprints having a bray curtis dissimilarity of zero samples taken during flushing with drinking water served for baseline calculation 0 085 and 0 053 for resp rainwater and groundwater and as training set fig 4 b the bray curtis dissimilarity of a sample taken during the contaminations was then calculated as the average dissimilarity between this sample and all of the baseline samples this parameter was more sensitive than the flow cytometric cell counts as such table 1 also in contrast to the cell concentrations the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated that the groundwater contamination resulted in a bigger change in the phenotypic microbial community structure than the rainwater contaminations fig 3 fig 4 b the online results were validated with grab sample plate counting table 1 table si 5 the heterotrophic plate counts coliforms and enterococci indicated a presence of contamination but lacked a clear trend the plate counts were around the detection limit of 1 cfu per 100 ml with no enterococci detected in the rainwater contamination 4 discussion 4 1 common operational changes affect the short term microbial dynamics of drinking water in the first part of this study we studied the response of different online microbial monitoring devices towards common operational changes similar average values for all microbial parameters have been reported in literature for unchlorinated drinking water højris et al 2016 liu et al 2013a vang et al 2014 backwashing of the activated carbon filters was linked to an increase in the microbial concentration and or activity as detected by several devices fig 1 fig si 4 b during this process the water is sent through the filter in an up flow and the bed is expanded 30 for removal of biomass and particles the microbial community in activated carbon filters is known to shape the microbial community of the drinking water and the influence of backwashing on the biomass in the filter has been reported by several authors gibert et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 lohwacharin et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 after backwashing filter ripening i e a stabilization period of around 10 minutes is necessary before reconnection to the drinking water supply to prevent the loss of particles in the final drinking due to the increase in flow suthaker et al 1998 still in this study all events of backwashing were detected by one or more devices backwashing a filter with a higher flow e g change from 800 m³ h up to 500 m³ h at nov 17th resulted in detection by more devices indicating that abrupt changes in the flow can cause short term increases in microbial abundance and or activity likewise an increase in turbidity of the filtrate after backwashing has been reported in literature ahmad et al 1998 interruption of the production process also increased the microbial activity and or concentration fig 1 during interruption the water remained stagnant in the installation and a slight but clear increase order of 0 1 1 c in water temperature was observed fig si 4 a the increase in microbial abundance and or activity can hence be explained by a combination of the stagnant water with increasing temperature facilitating growth and as previously mentioned detachment of microorganisms by a sudden increase in flow during start up besmer and hammes 2016 liu et al 2013b nescerecka et al 2018 overall using these online devices the short term dynamics of the microbial community were quantified independent of their technology this temporal resolution and short time to result is a straightforward added value compared to the grab sample plate counts this way online microbial monitoring techniques can assist in optimizing the operational performance of a production site and can be implemented as first barrier for safeguarding the drinking water quality to optimize operational performance or can serve as guidance for more targeted plate count sampling 4 2 data analysis and management of early warning systems for detecting contaminations one of the major challenges during online monitoring is the handling of the immense amount of data that is being generated in this study we have first proposed the use of a straightforward and conservative baseline for operational event detection using online microbial monitoring techniques this approach has shown to work for detection of events linked to operational changes when combining the data generated by all monitoring devices and operational data fig 1 as mentioned above the online microbial monitoring techniques can in this respect serve as a control parameter for drinking water quality when going a step further namely implementing these techniques as an early warning system the calculation of a dynamic baseline is necessary for anticipating to gradually changing water quality fujioka et al 2019 this approach was applied using a moving window during the contamination experiments fig 2 fig 3 the results from the first contamination experiment showed that these devices react clearly and in a similar way to different contaminations and could hence be implemented as early warning systems nevertheless these simulated contaminations were unrealistically high in concentration therefore a second contamination experiment was performed with a lower range of relevant contaminations in practice intrusion of rainwater and groundwater in the network can occur through bad connections by consumers or pipe breaks and leaks vanysacker et al 2019 the results from this experiment indicated that enzymatic techniques enz and atp together with flow cytometric fingerprinting bray curtis dissimilarity were able to pick up contaminations of rain and groundwater of 0 01 0 1 v or 100 ml to 1 l in 1 m³ a concentration that can realistically be achieved when wrongly connecting a rainwater pump without safety valves table 1 vanysacker et al 2019 hereby it should be noted that the actual detection limit of enz may even be lower than the concentrations tested in this study the low detection limit of monitoring devices based on enzymatic activity was also reported in a study of tatari et al 2016 also vang et al 2014 reported that detection of intracellular atp was more sensitive towards contamination in drinking water than the total direct cell counts as the latter includes both viable and non viable cells flow cytometric fingerprinting may overcome this limitation as demonstrated by the use of the bray curtis dissimilarity as sensitive and straightforward parameter derived from the cytometric fingerprint its use in event detection has been demonstrated previously favere et al 2020 though in the current study we demonstrate its sensitivity and added value compared to total cell counts 4 3 practical comparison for implementing online microbial monitoring techniques this study is to our knowledge the first to present a scientific and practical comparison of a wide range of online microbial monitoring techniques on a full scale drinking water production plant a summary of the characteristics of the devices based on our experience obtained during this study is given in table 2 as fcm h is a prototype used in research the maintenance time is the highest of all devices with the maintenance requiring an in depth knowledge of the device also the data analysis requires advanced programming skills whereas the data obtained from atp and opt is the easiest to extract opt and fcm c are the most robust systems requiring little maintenance and allowing full remote control fcm c and enz have a highest sampling frequency of respectively 30 and 15 20 minutes though most devices allow for measuring every 10 minutes the capex of all devices is comparable except for fcm h as this machine was originally developed for research applications the opex depends mainly on the requirements of chemicals this is the reason why opt is the least expensive technology as it does not use any chemicals for the other techniques the price of the consumables is comparable and can usually be suppressed with bulk orders in comparison with conventional plate counting the cost per sample of the online monitoring devices is low due to the requirement of less labor consumables and infrastructure van nevel et al 2017 furthermore flow cytometric fingerprinting is an added value to the use of flow cytometry allowing sensitive and straightforward detection of contaminations even on robust sensors such as fcm c also fingerprinting shows if an increase in cell concentration is related to a shift in the microbial community or not thus indicating if this event is resulting in a change in microbial water quality or not different strategies have been developed for research purposes already however straightforward implementation of this data analysis would be of great added value for the industry in combination with easy to interpret visualization of the data for operational control props et al 2016 rogers and holyst 2009 safford and bischel 2019 overall the choice for implementing a certain technique depends mainly on the type of application for example unmanned water towers require a more robust technique with less maintenance that are compatible with pressurized streams such as opt or fcm c on the other hand high risk production steps in e g drinking water production or wastewater reuse facilities need very sensitive techniques for safeguarding the microbial water quality so in this case implementation of atp or enz may be more suited also it should be noted that the detection limit of a certain technique may vary according to the drinking water characteristics and the used device hammes et al 2008 vang et al 2014 for example hammes et al 2008 demonstrated that atp measurements after ozonation resulted in severe interferences by extracellular atp furthermore a combination of different techniques can provide a more holistic overview of the microbial dynamics for example the combination of atp and flow cytometry has already been reported by several authors as this combines quantification of the cell concentration with the activity of the biomass which can result in complementary information of the microbial community characteristics throughout e g drinking water production steps or the distribution network hammes and egli 2010 lautenschlager et al 2013 prest et al 2016 safford and bischel 2019 finally as all monitoring systems require a certain level of knowledge operational skills data handling and come with a certain investment cost implementing biological online monitoring systems becomes most interesting when these systems are strategically implemented at certain critical control points ccp in the production process because of the speed of analysis the results are available faster and more data points are available as such the online monitoring systems allow to follow the production process continuously and to analyze data trends in relation with the operational conditions this way they can serve as early warning systems in assistance and complementary to the more targeted routine sampling 5 conclusion as biostable drinking water production and water reuse will become more and more important online microbial monitoring of drinking water during treatment and distribution is a fast and sensitive tool to ensure safe drinking water in this study it was concluded that the tested online microbial monitoring devices could detect abrupt changes such as backwashing of activated carbon filters and interruption of a full scale production process a dynamic baseline calculation allowed sensitive separation between noise e g operational instrumental and contaminations of rainwater groundwater and effluent of a wwtp enzymatic analysis atp measurement and flow cytometric fingerprinting showed to be the most sensitive techniques for detection of rain and groundwater contaminations even more sensitive than plate counting however optical classification and flow cytometric cell counts are more robust techniques requiring less maintenance and providing a direct cell concentration the main message of this study is hence that the choice for a certain device or technique will depend on the type of application and is a balance between sensitivity cost and maintenance furthermore a combination of several techniques e g atp and fcm may be of added value as this may provide a more holistic overview of the microbial dynamics in general the strategic implementation of online microbial monitoring as early warning system will allow for intensive quality control by high frequency sampling as well as a short event response timeframe declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16753,safeguarding the microbial water quality remains a challenge for drinking water utilities and because of population growth and climate change new issues arise regularly to overcome these problems biostable drinking water production and water reuse will become increasingly important in this respect high resolution online microbial monitoring during treatment and distribution could prove essential here we present the first scientific and practical comparison of multiple online microbial monitoring techniques in which six commercially available devices were set up in a full scale drinking water production plant both the devices response towards operational changes and contaminations as well as their detection limit for different contaminations were evaluated and compared during normal operation all devices were able to detect abrupt operational changes such as backwashing of activated carbon filters and interruption of the production process in a fast and sensitive way to benchmark their response to contaminations the calculation of a dynamic baseline for sensitive separation between noise and events is proposed in order of sensitivity enzymatic analysis atp measurement and flow cytometric fingerprinting were the most performant for detection of rain and groundwater contaminations 0 01 0 1 v on the other hand optical classification and flow cytometric cell counts showed to be more robust techniques requiring less maintenance and providing direct information about the cell concentration even though they were still more sensitive than plate counting the choice for a certain technology will thus depend on the type of application and is a balance between sensitivity price and maintenance all things considered a combination of several devices and use of advanced data analysis such as fingerprinting may be of added value in general the strategic implementation of online microbial monitoring as early warning system will allow for intensive quality control by high frequency sampling as well as a short event response timeframe graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords drinking water production online microbial monitoring flow cytometric fingerprinting biostability 1 introduction microbial contamination is the most prevailing risk to public health associated with drinking water who 2017 safeguarding drinking water quality remains a challenge for drinking water utilities with new issues arising regularly droughts and population growth are already stressing the drinking water provision even in moderate climates e g limburg flanders 2020 due to global warming outbreaks of waterborne diseases caused by opportunistic pathogens e g pseudomonas aeruginosa are predicted to take place more frequently and have more severe consequences in the future van der kooij et al 2013 currently microbial regrowth in the distribution network is suppressed by adding a disinfection residual at the end of the treatment train though this approach has several known drawbacks such as formation of harmful disinfection by products and induction of uncontrolled necrotrophic growth on the dead biomass chatzigiannidou et al 2018 li and mitch 2018 temmerman et al 2006 hence drinking water utilities are looking into alternative ways to produce microbially safe drinking water without the use of disinfection residuals as for example the production of biostable water nescerecka et al 2014 prest et al 2016 the latter approach implies that the microbial community remains stable during distribution without the use of a disinfectant lautenschlager et al 2013 rittman and snoeyinck 1984 van der kooij 2000 this can be achieved by focusing on extensive treatment such as nutrient limitation e g assimilable organic carbon aoc 10 µg l and intensive maintenance of the distribution system prest et al 2013 van der kooij et al 1982 van nevel et al 2013 when producing and distributing biostable drinking water monitoring of the microbial drinking water quality becomes even more important heterotrophic and selective plate counting are the legal standard but are not sufficient for detection of short term water quality changes european communities 1998 buysschaert et al 2018 us congress 1996 online monitoring systems are therefore gaining attention as these allow a high resolution quantification of the microbial dynamics with a short time to result i e 10 min to 2 5 hours a variety of online microbial monitoring techniques is commercially available online enzymatic techniques detect the total microbial load by commonly targeting the generic enzyme alkaline phosphatase alp or the total coliforms and escherichia coli by detection of the selective enzymes β d galactosidase and β d glucuronidase respectively hesari et al 2016 koschelnik et al 2015 the microbial abundance is then quantified indirectly by measuring the enzymatic hydrolysis of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates rompré et al 2002 another indirect method for quantifying the microbial activity is online measurement of intracellular atp by detecting the fluorescent conversion of luciferin by the enzyme luciferase de vera and wert 2019 vang et al 2014 direct methods are commercially available as well online optical particle classifiers for example use microscopic images for separation between bacteria and background particles højris et al 2016 højris et al 2018 online flow cytometry which uses nucleic acid staining for quantifying the bacterial cell concentration is another well established research technique which has recently become commercially available as well besmer et al 2014 hammes et al 2012 in combination with advanced data analysis it can even be used to assess the bacterial community characteristics props et al 2016 in this study we present the first scientific and practical comparison of multiple online microbial monitoring techniques six devices were set up in a full scale drinking water production plant both the devices response towards operational changes and contaminations as well as their detection limit for different contaminations were evaluated and compared with this study we aim to give an overview of the existing technologies on a scientific basis in order to determine their compatibility with different applications in the drinking water sector or other industries 2 materials and methods 2 1 set up the study was performed in a full scale drinking water production plant de watergroep kluizen belgium where the drinking water is produced from surface water 60 000 m³ day using conventional techniques including coagulation flocculation sedimentation flotation and filtration the last steps of the treatment train include ozone disinfection two step activated carbon filtration and chlorination the set up was installed after the activated carbon filters before chlorination during seven weeks fig si 1 the sampling location was chosen to perform the experiments in a controlled full scale environment without the presence of free chlorine from october 21st until november 18th 2019 routine operational monitoring was performed during this period the devices were directly connected to the drinking water pipeline from november 18th until december 11th 2019 the set up was disconnected from the drinking water pipeline and experiments with different contaminations were performed section 2 5 the set up consisted out of a vessel v 100 l well mixed connected to a bleeding line coming from the main pipeline from this vessel the drinking water was pumped to the online monitoring devices fig si 2 during operational monitoring and flushing periods the vessel served as an overflow to the sewer and during the contamination experiments the vessel was used for spiking and for water recirculation 2 2 online microbial monitoring devices six commercially available online microbial monitoring devices were used all techniques rely on different mechanisms for detection of the total microbial mainly bacterial concentration and were operated with different measurement frequencies ranging from 10 minutes to 2 5 hours all costs are based on belgian quotes vat excluded

eliminate residues in the system an online ez atp hach belgium further referred to as atp was used for detection of intracellular atp the method is based on the atp firefly assay standard method astm d4012 15 using the water glotm reagents promega belgium the amount of reaction product oxyluciferin λmax abs 390 nm is measured with a luminometer and with calibration converted into pg atp ml the analysis consists of two consecutive measurements of extracellular atp filtration and total atp ultrasonic cell lysis the intracellular atp is then calculated as the difference between the total and extracellular atp a sample 1 ml was taken every 30 minutes operational monitoring or every 20 minutes major and minor contaminations after every 10 measurements an automatic cleaning cycle was performed with sodium hydroxide 1m and hydrochloric acid 1m to avoid biofilm formation and remove residual atp two online flow cytometric techniques were used in this study the first online flow

contaminations an optical sensor bacmon grundfos denmark further referred to as opt was also installed the device was connected to the pressurized water stream and measured at a fixed interval of 10 minutes during the study the device consists of a flow cell 6 µl and a camera that fixes and scans the sample respectively after which a patented neural network classification algorithm classifies the particles on the images as bacteria and non bacteria by characterizing every particle using 59 optical parameters and comparison with a preinstalled library højris et al 2016 højris et al 2018 between measurements the flow cell was thoroughly rinsed with fresh drinking water 2 3 offline measurements validation of the microbial water quality was performed independently in the lab standard drinking water samples were taken near the sampling point by the drinking water utility every 4 5 days heterotrophic plate counts were analyzed on r2a 68 h at 36 c and on yeast extract agar 68 4 h at 22 c

devices except for the flow cytometers was provided in microsoft excel format either by remote control or offline data collection and was further analyzed in r v3 6 3 for atp outliers n 4 related to operational interventions at the device were removed prior to processing and for the other devices the data was processed as such the flow cytometric data was obtained as flow cytometry standard fcs files v3 1 and was processed in r v3 6 3 flowcore v1 52 1 was used to import the fcs files hahne et al 2009 based on the bivariate plot of green versus red fluorescence bacterial cells were separated from background noise as this is the configuration for the most optimal signal and noise separation in drinking water samples hammes and egli 2005 hammes and egli 2010 a gate was drawn manually for each flow cytometer and was kept constant throughout the experiments for fcm h further data processing was done using phenoflow v1 1 2 to extract the cell concentration as described by props et al 2016 and flowai v1 16 0 was used to check the data quality and to remove anomalous values in terms of flow rate stability signal acquisition and the dynamic range monaco et al 2016 for fcm c data processing was performed similarly but was based on the fl1 green and fl2 red channel output furthermore advanced cytometric fingerprinting was performed on the data acquired with fcm c during the minor contamination experiment using probability binning approach of flowfp v1 44 0 with a model grid with 5 recursions 25 bins rogers and holyst 2009 from these fingerprints principal coordinates analysis pcoa and bray curtis dissimilarity calculations were performed using vegan v2 5 6 favere et al 2020 oksanen et al 2019 resampling to the lowest sample size n 16038 cells was performed prior to pcoa and bray curtis analysis to account for size dependent differences the fresh drinking water samples taken before the contaminations with different matrices n 26 for both rainwater and groundwater were respectively used for baseline calculations for dissimilarity comparison fig 4 the bray curtis dissimilarity that was assigned to a sample was calculated as the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between that sample and all of the baseline samples of the respective contamination 3 results 3 1 baseline determination and response to operational changes in the first stage of this study october 21st november 18th the devices were used to follow up the operational dynamics of the drinking water production plant fig 1 for this monitoring period a baseline threshold was calculated for each device as the average plus three times the standard deviation to separate between noise e g operational instrumental below the baseline and events defined as measurements above the baseline fig 1 pink table si 1 this baseline threshold was chosen as it is a conservative and rigid threshold for event detection it is based on the normal distribution where events above the baseline will only make up 0 13 of the data favere et al 2020 howell et al 1998 even though some deviations from normality were observed using q q plots fig si 3 this approach was chosen as the goal is to define a first robust and straightforward screening method for event detection for further applications the use of moving window analysis see below and or transformations could be implemented to increase the sensitivity of the method the two flow cytometers fcm c and fcm h detected respectively 3 1 0 5 105 cells ml and 2 3 0 5 105 cells ml whereas the atp concentration was 3 6 1 6 pg atp ml the total activity detected by enz was on average 53 2 11 9 μu 100 ml which is in the range of expected values for activity after activated carbon filtration 40 60 μu 100 ml as defined by the manufacturer opt measured on average 1 6 1 4 103 cells ml with a high relative standard deviation due to the big difference between the baseline values and the peak events the absolute values of the cell concentration detected by opt are around 2 log units lower than the total cell concentration measured by the flow cytometers this difference may be allocated to the working mechanism as this device reports correct particle sizes in the range of 0 77 3 μm but smaller particles or bacteria may not be detected or classified correctly as the measurement frequency was device specific the percentage of events above the baseline was calculated relative to the number of measurements within this period the flow cytometers 1 44 and 1 58 for fcm c and fcm h respectively and atp 1 33 registered the largest percentage of events above the baseline threshold and atp detected the most independent events in absolute terms on the other hand opt and enz classified respectively only 0 36 and 0 64 of the measurements as events but showed a clear distinction between noise and events after determination of the events above the baseline threshold for each device common peaks n 5 were determined as events detected by two or more devices fcm c detected all common peaks atp detected four out of five common peaks fcm h and opt three and enz two during the monitoring period enz 2 was not functioning properly due to crystallization of the reagents at temperatures below 15 c and the relatively high amount of particles in the water the data was considered to be unreliable hence data from this device was not taken into account for analysis and discussion in a next step the events were linked to operational changes backwashing of the activated carbon filters was shown to be related to several peaks fig 1 blue fig si 4 b moreover all backwashing events that have occurred in this period were detected by one or more devices also interruption of the production process was linked to an increase in the microbial concentration as detected by several devices interrupted production meaning that there was no net flow through the installation resulted in an increase of the water temperature as well fig si 4 a 3 2 response to contaminations and dynamic baseline calculation in the second stage of this study nov 18th dec 11th the devices were disconnected from the drinking water network and contaminations were added to the vessel in the set up in a first experiment relatively high concentrations of rainwater groundwater and effluent of a wwtp were added with decreasing concentrations similar to the previous experiment a baseline was calculated to separate noise and events however because the drinking water quality shows long term variations e g a seasonal temperature decrease of 4 c during the baseline measurements the baseline microbial concentration and activity will also differ over time nescerecka et al 2018 pinto et al 2014 this is why during the contamination experiments the baseline was calculated using a moving window analysis mwa based on the drinking water samples measured before each respective contamination fig 2 fig 3 table si 2 marzorati et al 2008 wittebolle et al 2005 a similar reaction behavior was observed for all devices and spikes fig 2 after each spike the microbial concentration increased sharply after which an immediate decrease was observed due to the dilution with fresh drinking water then the bacterial concentration increased again strongly and this fast regrowth was promoted by a temperature increase from the heat of the recirculation pump this was confirmed with independent flow cytometry on samples taken after 30 minutes of recycling table si 3 overall the contamination using rainwater collected as runoff from a green roof resulted in the highest responses of the devices and the groundwater contamination resulted in the lowest responses as shown in fig 2 the contamination with effluent of a wwtp resulted in cell concentrations similar to the rainwater contamination fcm c fcm h but resulted in a lower enzymatic activity response than the groundwater contamination enz opt only reacted slightly to the wwtp effluent contamination compared to the other contaminations though still with cell concentrations above the baseline højris et al 2016 due to technical issues atp was not functioning properly during the rainwater contamination and fcm h had several downtime periods as validation the online measurements were compared to plate counts from grab samples table si 3 the coliforms and enterococci plate counts indicated the presence of a contamination and showed a decreasing trend with decreasing concentrations of every spike contrary to the results obtained from the online devices targeting the total microbial concentration coliforms and enterococci plate counts indicated that wwtp effluent was the most contaminated whereas rainwater was the least contaminated regarding the hygienic water quality the total colony counts were above the upper limit for quantification 300 cfu 100 ml as the sampling point was before the chlorination step data not shown 3 3 detection limit for different contaminations of drinking water the results from the previous experiment showed that devices were able to detect contaminations in a fast and consistent way however the volume ratio of these contaminations compared to the drinking water were relatively high 0 5 10 v and as refreshment of the drinking water was only performed after 24 hours of recirculation extensive regrowth could occur fig 2 hence a second contamination experiment was performed by spiking the contaminations in lower volume ratios starting from 0 01 v and gradually increasing every two hours up to 10 20 v as rain and groundwater intrusion in the drinking water network are two major hazards for drinking water utilities in practice the experiment was focused on these two contaminations fig 3 the dynamic baseline was calculated for each contamination using a moving window to account for systematic changes in water characteristics as explained above section 3 2 in this context the baseline forms the boundary between events and noise and thus represents the detection limit of the devices for the different contaminations in question subsequently the sensitivity of each device towards the different contaminations was objectively quantified as the success rate of detection of a certain contamination calculated as the amount of samples with values above the baseline divided by the total amount of samples taken during the respective spike table 1 enz was able to detect contaminations of 0 01 v followed by atp able to detect 0 1 v of each contamination the total cell concentration using flow cytometry fcm c and fcm h could detect 1 v of each contamination fig 3 table 1 and using optical classification between 1 10 or 20 v of the contaminations could be detected these results indicate that the sensitivity of enzymatic techniques atp enz towards rain and groundwater contamination is the highest followed by flow cytometry fcm c fcm h and then the optical technique opt fig 3 or in other words that a rainwater or groundwater contamination resulted in the first place in an increase in enzymatic activity and atp concentration as enz was able to pick up all concentrations its detection limit may even be lower than the lowest concentrations tested in this study additionally the flow cytometric data obtained by fcm c was analyzed through cytometric fingerprinting from which the phenotypic beta diversity i e inter sample diversity was calculated using pcoa analysis fig 4 a this analysis showed that the contaminations contained phenotypically different communities from the baseline measurements furthermore time wise analysis revealed a boomerang effect in which increasing concentrations resulted in a gradually more phenotypically different community from the baseline further away on pcoa plot after which flushing with drinking water resulted in a gradual change to a phenotypically more similar community compared to the baseline back to baseline on pcoa plot both contaminations resulted in a similar extent of phenotypic changes in the microbial community compared to the baseline this was also observed in the bray curtis dissimilarity between cytometric fingerprints the bray curtis dissimilarity is a straightforward parameter expressing the difference between fingerprints with identical fingerprints having a bray curtis dissimilarity of zero samples taken during flushing with drinking water served for baseline calculation 0 085 and 0 053 for resp rainwater and groundwater and as training set fig 4 b the bray curtis dissimilarity of a sample taken during the contaminations was then calculated as the average dissimilarity between this sample and all of the baseline samples this parameter was more sensitive than the flow cytometric cell counts as such table 1 also in contrast to the cell concentrations the bray curtis dissimilarity indicated that the groundwater contamination resulted in a bigger change in the phenotypic microbial community structure than the rainwater contaminations fig 3 fig 4 b the online results were validated with grab sample plate counting table 1 table si 5 the heterotrophic plate counts coliforms and enterococci indicated a presence of contamination but lacked a clear trend the plate counts were around the detection limit of 1 cfu per 100 ml with no enterococci detected in the rainwater contamination 4 discussion 4 1 common operational changes affect the short term microbial dynamics of drinking water in the first part of this study we studied the response of different online microbial monitoring devices towards common operational changes similar average values for all microbial parameters have been reported in literature for unchlorinated drinking water højris et al 2016 liu et al 2013a vang et al 2014 backwashing of the activated carbon filters was linked to an increase in the microbial concentration and or activity as detected by several devices fig 1 fig si 4 b during this process the water is sent through the filter in an up flow and the bed is expanded 30 for removal of biomass and particles the microbial community in activated carbon filters is known to shape the microbial community of the drinking water and the influence of backwashing on the biomass in the filter has been reported by several authors gibert et al 2013 lautenschlager et al 2014 lohwacharin et al 2015 pinto et al 2012 after backwashing filter ripening i e a stabilization period of around 10 minutes is necessary before reconnection to the drinking water supply to prevent the loss of particles in the final drinking due to the increase in flow suthaker et al 1998 still in this study all events of backwashing were detected by one or more devices backwashing a filter with a higher flow e g change from 800 m³ h up to 500 m³ h at nov 17th resulted in detection by more devices indicating that abrupt changes in the flow can cause short term increases in microbial abundance and or activity likewise an increase in turbidity of the filtrate after backwashing has been reported in literature ahmad et al 1998 interruption of the production process also increased the microbial activity and or concentration fig 1 during interruption the water remained stagnant in the installation and a slight but clear increase order of 0 1 1 c in water temperature was observed fig si 4 a the increase in microbial abundance and or activity can hence be explained by a combination of the stagnant water with increasing temperature facilitating growth and as previously mentioned detachment of microorganisms by a sudden increase in flow during start up besmer and hammes 2016 liu et al 2013b nescerecka et al 2018 overall using these online devices the short term dynamics of the microbial community were quantified independent of their technology this temporal resolution and short time to result is a straightforward added value compared to the grab sample plate counts this way online microbial monitoring techniques can assist in optimizing the operational performance of a production site and can be implemented as first barrier for safeguarding the drinking water quality to optimize operational performance or can serve as guidance for more targeted plate count sampling 4 2 data analysis and management of early warning systems for detecting contaminations one of the major challenges during online monitoring is the handling of the immense amount of data that is being generated in this study we have first proposed the use of a straightforward and conservative baseline for operational event detection using online microbial monitoring techniques this approach has shown to work for detection of events linked to operational changes when combining the data generated by all monitoring devices and operational data fig 1 as mentioned above the online microbial monitoring techniques can in this respect serve as a control parameter for drinking water quality when going a step further namely implementing these techniques as an early warning system the calculation of a dynamic baseline is necessary for anticipating to gradually changing water quality fujioka et al 2019 this approach was applied using a moving window during the contamination experiments fig 2 fig 3 the results from the first contamination experiment showed that these devices react clearly and in a similar way to different contaminations and could hence be implemented as early warning systems nevertheless these simulated contaminations were unrealistically high in concentration therefore a second contamination experiment was performed with a lower range of relevant contaminations in practice intrusion of rainwater and groundwater in the network can occur through bad connections by consumers or pipe breaks and leaks vanysacker et al 2019 the results from this experiment indicated that enzymatic techniques enz and atp together with flow cytometric fingerprinting bray curtis dissimilarity were able to pick up contaminations of rain and groundwater of 0 01 0 1 v or 100 ml to 1 l in 1 m³ a concentration that can realistically be achieved when wrongly connecting a rainwater pump without safety valves table 1 vanysacker et al 2019 hereby it should be noted that the actual detection limit of enz may even be lower than the concentrations tested in this study the low detection limit of monitoring devices based on enzymatic activity was also reported in a study of tatari et al 2016 also vang et al 2014 reported that detection of intracellular atp was more sensitive towards contamination in drinking water than the total direct cell counts as the latter includes both viable and non viable cells flow cytometric fingerprinting may overcome this limitation as demonstrated by the use of the bray curtis dissimilarity as sensitive and straightforward parameter derived from the cytometric fingerprint its use in event detection has been demonstrated previously favere et al 2020 though in the current study we demonstrate its sensitivity and added value compared to total cell counts 4 3 practical comparison for implementing online microbial monitoring techniques this study is to our knowledge the first to present a scientific and practical comparison of a wide range of online microbial monitoring techniques on a full scale drinking water production plant a summary of the characteristics of the devices based on our experience obtained during this study is given in table 2 as fcm h is a prototype used in research the maintenance time is the highest of all devices with the maintenance requiring an in depth knowledge of the device also the data analysis requires advanced programming skills whereas the data obtained from atp and opt is the easiest to extract opt and fcm c are the most robust systems requiring little maintenance and allowing full remote control fcm c and enz have a highest sampling frequency of respectively 30 and 15 20 minutes though most devices allow for measuring every 10 minutes the capex of all devices is comparable except for fcm h as this machine was originally developed for research applications the opex depends mainly on the requirements of chemicals this is the reason why opt is the least expensive technology as it does not use any chemicals for the other techniques the price of the consumables is comparable and can usually be suppressed with bulk orders in comparison with conventional plate counting the cost per sample of the online monitoring devices is low due to the requirement of less labor consumables and infrastructure van nevel et al 2017 furthermore flow cytometric fingerprinting is an added value to the use of flow cytometry allowing sensitive and straightforward detection of contaminations even on robust sensors such as fcm c also fingerprinting shows if an increase in cell concentration is related to a shift in the microbial community or not thus indicating if this event is resulting in a change in microbial water quality or not different strategies have been developed for research purposes already however straightforward implementation of this data analysis would be of great added value for the industry in combination with easy to interpret visualization of the data for operational control props et al 2016 rogers and holyst 2009 safford and bischel 2019 overall the choice for implementing a certain technique depends mainly on the type of application for example unmanned water towers require a more robust technique with less maintenance that are compatible with pressurized streams such as opt or fcm c on the other hand high risk production steps in e g drinking water production or wastewater reuse facilities need very sensitive techniques for safeguarding the microbial water quality so in this case implementation of atp or enz may be more suited also it should be noted that the detection limit of a certain technique may vary according to the drinking water characteristics and the used device hammes et al 2008 vang et al 2014 for example hammes et al 2008 demonstrated that atp measurements after ozonation resulted in severe interferences by extracellular atp furthermore a combination of different techniques can provide a more holistic overview of the microbial dynamics for example the combination of atp and flow cytometry has already been reported by several authors as this combines quantification of the cell concentration with the activity of the biomass which can result in complementary information of the microbial community characteristics throughout e g drinking water production steps or the distribution network hammes and egli 2010 lautenschlager et al 2013 prest et al 2016 safford and bischel 2019 finally as all monitoring systems require a certain level of knowledge operational skills data handling and come with a certain investment cost implementing biological online monitoring systems becomes most interesting when these systems are strategically implemented at certain critical control points ccp in the production process because of the speed of analysis the results are available faster and more data points are available as such the online monitoring systems allow to follow the production process continuously and to analyze data trends in relation with the operational conditions this way they can serve as early warning systems in assistance and complementary to the more targeted routine sampling 5 conclusion as biostable drinking water production and water reuse will become more and more important online microbial monitoring of drinking water during treatment and distribution is a fast and sensitive tool to ensure safe drinking water in this study it was concluded that the tested online microbial monitoring devices could detect abrupt changes such as backwashing of activated carbon filters and interruption of a full scale production process a dynamic baseline calculation allowed sensitive separation between noise e g operational instrumental and contaminations of rainwater groundwater and effluent of a wwtp enzymatic analysis atp measurement and flow cytometric fingerprinting showed to be the most sensitive techniques for detection of rain and groundwater contaminations even more sensitive than plate counting however optical classification and flow cytometric cell counts are more robust techniques requiring less maintenance and providing a direct cell concentration the main message of this study is hence that the choice for a certain device or technique will depend on the type of application and is a balance between sensitivity cost and maintenance furthermore a combination of several techniques e g atp and fcm may be of added value as this may provide a more holistic overview of the microbial dynamics in general the strategic implementation of online microbial monitoring as early warning system will allow for intensive quality control by high frequency sampling as well as a short event response timeframe declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16754,brazil has become one of the epicentres of the covid 19 pandemic with cases heavily concentrated in large cities testing data is extremely limited and unreliable which restricts health authorities ability to deal with the pandemic given the stark demographic social and economic heterogeneities within brazilian cities it is important to identify hotspots so that the limited resources available can have the greatest impact this study shows that decentralised monitoring of sars cov 2 rna in sewage can be used to assess the distribution of covid 19 prevalence in the city the methodology developed in this study allowed the identification of hotspots by comprehensively monitoring sewers distributed through belo horizonte brazil s third largest city our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic indicating that for many brazilians the situation is much worse than reported by official figures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology covid 19 prevalence hotspots decentralised sewage monitoring health vulnerability 1 introduction on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared covid 19 a pandemic covid 19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by the sars cov 2 virus with over 130 million confirmed cases and nearly 3 million confirmed deaths worldwide as of april 12 2021 official data suggest that over 13 million brazilians have been infected with a death toll second only to the usa worldometers 2021 cases have been heavily concentrated in big cities but have spread to the countryside affecting isolated indigenous communities these statistics are fraught with uncertainties because the tests are notoriously unreliable and the sample size less than 0 1 of the population is very small worldometers 2021 in large brazilian cities testing is mainly occurring among people who suffer from symptoms severe enough to seek health care or have private health insurance brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world oecd et a 2019 and its large cities are starkly heterogeneous in demographic social and economic terms during the pandemic it is imperative that limited available resources are directed to neighbourhoods where they will have the greatest impact which requires the spatial distribution of infections to be characterized following the detection of sars cov 2 rna in faeces of covid 19 patients wang et al 2020 and later in sewage medema et al 2020 and sewage sludge peccia et al 2020 an increasing number of studies have reported the use of sewage monitoring as a tool for epidemiological surveillance sewage based surveillance of other viruses has been well documented in the literature wigginton et al 2015 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 and has been successfully applied to assess the spread of polio in populations since 1980s hovi et al 2012 by sampling raw sewage from the inlet of treatment plants and determining sars cov 2 rna concentrations it is possible to extract valuable information on infection levels for the entire population that contributes sewage to the treatment plant this approach has shown that sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage correlated with the local numbers of infected individuals ahmed et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 extending this principle by sampling wastewater directly from the sewers at multiple points upstream of the treatment plant could reveal the spatial distribution in prevalence of the virus in a large city this can be even more critical in cities where not all collected sewage reaches the treatment plant but is instead discharged in water bodies a common limitation in sanitation infrastructure in the developing world in places with severely scarce testing data during the current pandemic such as brazil information obtained from decentralised sewage monitoring could be vital in devising potentially life saving public health interventions we have carried out a comprehensive sewage monitoring programme for sars cov 2 rna in belo horizonte minas gerais brazil since april 2020 early on its epidemic curve our objective was to assess temporal and spatial information on the virus load in different neighbourhoods to assist local health authorities in decision making through weekly bulletins here we present the results for the period between epidemiological weeks 20 and 32 from may 11 to august 07 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to use decentralised sewage monitoring to assess spatial distribution of covid 19 prevalence in a large city 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of sewage sampling points belo horizonte has a population of approximately 2 million people and is located in southeast brazil it has two major sewage treatment plants stps each with a dedicated sewer network arrudas and onça sewersheds weekly samples were collected from the inlet of both treatment plants and from a total of 15 points in the sewer networks chernicharo et al 2020 purposely chosen to collect sewage from regions with starkly different socio economic and health vulnerability indicators therefore a total of 17 points were monitored i two points at the inlet of sewage treatment plants arrudas and onça ii 15 points in the sewer system 7 in the arrudas sewershed and 8 in the onça sewershed a total of 202 samples were collected from may 11 to august 07 fig 1 shows a map with the sampling points and health vulnerability indexes for each region sampled fig 2 shows the single line diagram of both sewer networks including the population served flow rate and distance between sampling points composite samples 24hr composites for both treatment plants and 4 hr composites for all other points were collected on fixed days mondays for points on the arrudas sewershed and wednesdays for points on the onça sewershed from 8 30am to 12 30pm using autosamplers the sewers were designed as separate sewer systems it did not rain during any of the sampling days 2 2 health vulnerability index hvi the health vulnerability index was formulated by belo horizonte city hall pbh belo horizonte city hall 2018 considering socioeconomic residents per household illiteracy rates income skin color and ethnicity and sanitation indicators access to adequate water supply sanitation and municipal solid waste collection and disposal the hvi is divided into four classes extremely vulnerable very vulnerable vulnerable and not vulnerable and published in a shapefile format for each region the layers correspondent to the same class were dissolved and then the area of each class was calculated the final class of each sampled region presented in this study corresponds to the dominant class in terms of area in each region all data used in hvi calculations were derived from the last brazilian census 2010 and the relative weights used in the calculation were defined using the analytic hierarchy process as shown in table 1 2 3 collection preservation and transport of sewage samples the following procedures were adopted for sampling storage and transport of sewage samples isolation of the area near the access of the manhole using signal cones and easels installation of automatic sampling devices fig s1 equipped with battery sampling container and reusable ice packs keeping the samples at 4 c collection of composite samples representing the morning period usually between 8 30am and 12 30pm the sample container 10 liters was kept surrounded by ice packs throughout the sampling duration the automatic sampling device was set to collect one portion of sample of approximate 400 ml every 10 minutes resulting in 10 liters after 4 hours sampling following sampling composite samples were homogenized by vigorously shaking the container and transferred to two 1 liter bottles one bottle was taken to the laboratory in the department of environmental and sanitary engineering desa of the federal university of minas gerais for the quantification of the sars cov 2 rna the second bottle was taken to the central laboratory of the sanitation company for minas gerais for the determination of chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss surfactants and thermotolerant coliforms or e coli according to apha baird and bridgewater 2017 both bottles were kept on ice during transport 2 4 quantification of sars cov 2 rna the virus concentration step was performed according to methods previously described symonds et al 2014 ahmed et al 2015 this method is based on the adsorption extraction method using electronegative membranes 0 45 µm hawp04700 millipore before the sewage filtration average volume of 50 ml through the membrane the method began with the addition of mgcl2 2 5 m followed by adjustment of the sample ph to 3 to 3 5 using acetic acid 1m symonds et al 2014 following sample filtration the membrane was folded put into a 2 ml tube with 600 µl of pm1 solution provided in the dna rna extraction kit glass beads and 6 µl of beta mercaptoethanol and stored at 80 c until rna extraction rna was extracted using a commercial kit allprep powerviral dna rna qiagen hilden germany according to instructions provided by the manufacturer a bead beater was used instead of vortex in the first step of rna extraction to remove viral particles from the membrane following extraction rna was resuspended in 100 µl of ultrapure water free of rnases and stored at 80 c the detection of sars cov 2 was performed using available rt qpcr assays using different primer probe sets recommended by the us center for disease control and prevention center for disease control and prevention 2020 targeting the nucleocapsid protein n gene region n1 lu et al 2020 all rt qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 µl reaction mixtures using itaqtm universal probes one step reaction mix and reverse transcriptase for both rt qpcr assays plasmids were purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa and used as standards or positive controls the rt qpcr assays were performed using an applied biosystems 7500 real time pcr system all rt qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each rt qpcr run a series of three positive and negative controls were included standard curves were built using serial dilutions table s1 of the standard plasmid sars cov 2 obtained from idt 2019 ncov n positive control an exponential model verbyla et al 2016 was used to estimate the limit of detection lod using 95 probability of amplification the exponential model assumes that dna cdna in samples are randomly distributed in reaction wells dna cdna copy has an independent and identical probability of surviving the conditions to complete the qpcr and at least one target dna cdna copy has to be physically present in the qpcr in order to cause amplification within 40 cycles based on these assumptions the lod with a 95 probability of amplification was determined according to eq 1 1 p a x 1 e k x where x represents the mean number of target genome copies added to each qpcr well mean concentration per reaction and k represents the probability of survival the model determined an lod of 15 copies per reaction or 6 copies ml of sewage fig s2 the limit of quantification i e the lowest concentration where the dilution curve stops being linear was 50 copies reaction or 20 gene copies ml of sewage table s1 the master standard curves used in this study were within the prescribed range of minimum information for publication of quantitative miqe real time pcr guidelines bustin et al 2009 the amplification efficiencies for n1 assays ranged from 94 7 to 109 r2 ranged from 0 993 to 0 997 slope ranged from 3 118 to 3 454 and y inter ranged from 35 726 to 38 667 all qpcr assays were performed in triplicate according to the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 in order to check pcr inhibition internal control hsrpp 30 was used as recommended by the cdc center for disease control and prevention 2020 whenever the sample did not amplify with the internal control negative for rnase p the sample was diluted 10x and 100x to check for inhibition and confirm that the result was negative since the rt qpcr standard curves were built using double stranded plasmid and the target molecule in the environmental samples sars cov 2 rna is single stranded all concentrations determined for the environmental samples were multiplied by a factor of 2 this was done because two viral n1 gene fragments n1 gene copies single stranded are required to give the equivalent fluorescence signal ct value on the rt qpcr assay of one molecule n1 gene copy double stranded of the plasmid standard fig s3 in other words if a sample that has the same ct of 1000 copies of the plasmid standard that sample has 1000 copies of double stranded target however 1000 copies of double stranded target would actually correspond to 2000 viral particles since the virus is single stranded alternatively the nominal gene concentrations used to build the standard curve with double stranded plasmid could be divided by a factor of 2 while maintaining unaltered the concentration values determined for the environmental samples 2 5 estimation ofin sewerdecay ofsars cov 2 rna in sewer decay of the rt qpcr signal for sars cov 2 rna was estimated for each of the 15 monitored regions based on the first order decay rate constant determined by ahmed et al 2020 design characteristics of all sampled trunk sewers and interceptors were provided by the sanitation company for minas gerais including pipe diameter and total length average slope and average flow rate at the sampling point sewage flow velocities and in sewer travel time were calculated based on design characteristics table 2 the degradation rate of sars cov 2 rna in sewage was assumed to follow exponential decay therefore the rna concentration that was excreted and discharged into the sewer collection system n0 is described by the following equation eq 1 1a n 0 n t e k t where n t is the rna concentration measured by the sampling campaign i e the amount of rna that resists decay after a time t t is the time elapsed between the time of excretion time 0 and time of sample collection time t i e in sewer travel time and k 0 183 d 1 ref 14 is the first order decay rate constant of the sars cov 2 rna at 25 c average measured sewage temperature sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined for each monitored region over epidemiological weeks 20 to 32 referred to as n t eq 1 as well as the estimated initial rna concentrations taking into account in sewer rna degradation referred as n0 eq 1 are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively table 5 shows the percentage degradation of rna at each sampling point calculated based on data shown in tables 2 and 3 2 6 relative prevalence index rpi determination sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage determined in the laboratory are expressed as the number of viral genome copies per litre of sewage this can be determined based on the population of infected individuals that excrete viral particles and the population that is served by the sewer network eq 2 2 c p i n f n f p v where c is the viral genome concentration rna copies l 1 pin is the number of infected individuals inhabitants f is the faecal mass excreted per inhabitant per day g faeces inhab 1 day 1 nf is the number of viral genome copies per gram of faeces rna copies g faeces 1 p is the population that contributes to the sewershed inhabitants and v is the per capita sewage volume generation l inhab 1 day 1 in the previous equation the term pin p can be interpreted as prevalence index pi therefore eq 2 can be rewritten to highlight the contribution of the pi to the viral genome concentration as follows 3 c p i f n f v the per capita mass of faeces excreted per day ranges from 150 g to 300 g brown et al 1996 the number of viral genome copies per gram of faeces varies by several orders of magnitude between 103 to 107 copies per gram of faeces la rosa et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the volume of sewage generated per inhabitant per day varies between 120 and 200 litters in brazilian urban areas snis diagnóstico dos serviços de água e esgotos 2018 2019 therefore pi determination based on the viral concentration in sewage is marred by uncertainties due to the large intrinsic variations of the parameters required for its calculation however such uncertainties can be reduced if the pi in each region is evaluated relative to the overall pi in the sewershed determined based on the viral genome concentration at the inlet of the sewage treatment plant stp it is reasonable to consider that the ratio between the viral genome load in faeces f x nf and the volume of sewage generated per inhabitant per day is similar for each monitored region and the entire sewershed monitored at the inlet of the stp therefore these parameters can be grouped and expressed as a constant k throughout different regions and the entire sewershed eq 4 4 k f n f v cod was used as a normalisation parameter to account for possible variations in water consumption amongst regions and differences in sewage composition due to distinct sample composite times the measured cod in each sampling point was compared to the cod measured at the respective sewage treatment plant arrudas or onça stp paired kolmogorov smirnov statistical tests using spss statistics software ibm corp v27 were performed on cod data table s2 when significant differences were detected a correction factor was applied to v based on the ratio between the median cod concentration measured at the sampling point and the median cod concentration measured at the respective stp eq 3 can then be rewritten as follows eq 5 5 p i c k the relative prevalence index of each monitored region rpii is calculated as the ratio of the pi of each monitored region pii and the pi of the entire sewershed pistp monitored at the inlet of the stp and is described by the following equation eq 6 6 rp i i p i i p i stp c i k c stp k rp i i c i c stp where ci is the viral genome concentration determined at each monitored region rna copies l 1 adjusted for decay and cstp is the viral genome concentration determined for the entire sewershed inlet of the stp rna copies l 1 adjusted for decay regions with rpi higher than 1 have covid 19 prevalence higher than the average prevalence in the sewershed and could hence be considered hotspots 3 results and discussion due to limitations on covid 19 testing data authorities in belo horizonte have planned their pandemic control actions based on covid 19 bed occupation data collected from local hospitals and municipal health centres and on the effective transmission rate rt likewise we have collected and evaluated data that do not depend on covid 19 testing including the number of people seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms partial lockdown measures were pre emptively introduced to contain the spread of the virus from march 18 2020 epidemiological week 12 when a municipal decree ordered the closure of all non essential services these restrictions were partially lifted on may 25 2020 epidemiological week 22 when virtually the entire retail sector was allowed to open further relaxation of restrictions took place on june 8 2020 epidemiological week 24 when mainly agglomeration prone establishments remained closed including schools bars restaurants and cinemas the lifting of restrictions resulted in the aggravation of the pandemic from week 25 as shown by increases in the number of local covid 19 hospital bed occupations the number of individuals seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms and total sars cov 2 load in sewage fig 3 by week 26 the total number of intensive care and infirmary hospital beds occupied by covid 19 patients reached respectively 85 and 69 of locally available covid 19 beds as a result strict isolation measures were reinstated on week 27 june 29 2020 the four week cumulative number of individuals seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms and the load of sars cov 2 rna in sewage followed similar trends fig 3 with sharp increases in weeks 24 to 26 followed by surges and later decreases in weeks 27 to 32 the comparison based on a four week period was carried out because virus shedding in stool may occur for up to 4 weeks after the onset of respiratory symptoms in mild to severe cases zheng et al 2020 the observed low number of confirmed cases in the same period highlights the scarcity and inadequacy of local clinical testing data sewage monitoring can detect pre and asymptomatic individuals la rosa et al 2020 who may excrete the virus in faeces but are not tested and hence are not included in official statistics accurately estimating the number of covid 19 cases based solely on sewage data may be problematic due to the intrinsic wide variability of some parameters necessary to convert sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage to the number of cases for example the number of viral genome copies excreted per gram of faeces can vary from 103 to 107 woelfel et al 2020 to circumvent that limitation and to identify hotspots within the city we propose data evaluation based on the relative prevalence index rpi section 2 6 material and methods and the concentration of sars cov 2 rna in sewage for each of the sampled regions as both parameters do not depend on conversion factors we define the rpi as the ratio of the regional prevalence based on sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined at each monitored region over the prevalence in the sewershed based on sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined at the treatment plant inlet rpi calculations take into consideration the estimated decay of sars cov 2 rna section 2 5 material and methods as it travels through sewers ahmed et al 2020 a region with rpi higher than 1 has a covid 19 prevalence higher than the average prevalence in the sewershed and could hence be considered a hotspot depending on the uncertainties related to the determination of some of the factors that may affect the rpi e g sampling regime and storage rna quantification protocol etc the alert level for regions of concern could be set at values higher than 1 in order to avoid overly alarmist prognostics based solely on sewage fig 4 shows rpi values determined for each of the 15 monitored regions in three distinct periods during the pandemic epidemiological weeks 20 and 24 prior to the aggravation of the pandemic 25 and 28 includes the onset of the aggravation period and 29 and 32 continuation of the aggravation period and beginning of the attenuation period in addition fig 4 shows the health vulnerability index hvi section 2 2 material and methods for each of the sampled regions regions with high hvi are considered vulnerable as they are dominated by unplanned occupations also known as favelas or shanty towns with poor living conditions characterised by densely populated households with poor access to sanitation health care and other basic public services scalzaretto 2020 our data shows that the most vulnerable regions were the hardest hit by the pandemic for instance the most vulnerable regions in the arrudas aws 1 aws 4 and aws 7 and onça ows 1 ows 5 ows 6 ows 7 and ows 8 sewersheds showed persistently high rpis in the period prior to the aggravation of the pandemic the median covid 19 prevalence in region ows 8 was nearly three times the average prevalence in the onça sewershed in the period comprising weeks 25 to 28 the median covid 19 prevalence in region aws 7 was nearly four times the average prevalence in the arrudas sewershed both these regions are classified as medium to extremely vulnerable regions with low hvi were less affected by the pandemic e g ows 2 aws 2 aws 3 aws 5 and aws 6 with rpi values below one during most of the monitoring period rpi data proved to be particularly relevant as an early warning tool as it helped to identify regions with relatively high covid 19 prevalence before the aggravation of the pandemic that affected the entire city these results are hardly surprising as it has been fairly well documented that socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are being disproportionately affected by covid 19 adhikari et al 2020 wadhera et al 2020 bilal et al 2021 ogedegbe et al 2021 passos et al 2021 however the novelty of the current work is that these findings were achieved using decentralized sewage monitoring rather than based on clinical data a recent study by passos et al passos et al 2021 based on census and calculated excess deaths data also showed that people living in vulnerable areas in belo horizonte were more affected by covid 19 epidemiological weeks 10 to 43 this was especially true for the elderly as the mortality rate per 100 000 for 60 year old and over was 179 2 353 6 and 472 6 in low medium and high very high vulnerability sectors respectively bilal et al 2021 evaluated the correlation between the social vulnerability index svi and the number of covid 19 tests done confirmed covid 19 cases and covid 19 deaths for hundreds of zones in chicago philadelphia and new york city the svi used included 15 variables from the american community survey comprising 4 domains socioeconomic status household composition race and language barriers and housing and transportation sectors with higher svi more vulnerable had lower testing rates higher positivity rates more confirmed cases and greater covid 19 related mortality vulnerable communities are more affected by the pandemic likely due to a number of factors or a combination of them including higher risk of exposure to the virus e g due to their stronger reliance on public transport which can be overcrowded even during the pandemic lower access to safe water and sanitation higher number of people per household cohabitation with relatives who work in essential services higher comorbidity burden decreased access to health care barriers to testing and other factors our data on sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage fig 5 indicate that the monitored regions had distinct epidemiologic dynamics with clear differences in peak duration week of peak occurrence and number of peaks among regions the factors that govern these differences have yet to be determined the current study has important limitations that should be acknowledged for instance rna recovery rates during sample concentration and rna extraction were not systematically assessed therefore any possible extraction biases were assumed constant throughout the study which might not necessarily be accurate sars cov 2 faecal shedding patterns were assumed to be similar among all sampled regions considering that the smallest population equivalent of the monitored regions was fairly large approximately 12 thousand people this basic assumption might be reasonable as viral shedding patterns in large populations tend to be less affected by groups of individuals with highly different shedding rates finally the volume and composition of sewage might differ among monitored regions especially due to socioeconomic factors to address this chemical oxygen demand cod was used to calculate a correction factor for rpi calculations cod is frequently used as a normalizing parameter in wastewater based epidemiology wbe studies rico et al 2017 4 conclusion our data suggested that local restrictions had a strong effect on hospital bed occupation as well as suspected covid 19 cases and sars cov 2 rna loads in sewage the monitoring of wastewater closer to the target population in several neighbourhoods and not only at the treatment plant revealed the spatial distribution in prevalence of the virus in a large heterogeneous brazilian city the relative prevalence index rpi was proposed to help identify hotspots during different periods in the pandemic since the rpi assesses the regional prevalence relative to the prevalence in the entire sewershed several parameters are normalized in its calculation and are therefore not needed including shedding rates per infected person and sewage flow rates this can be greatly advantageous as shedding rates per infected person can vary by several orders of magnitude among individuals and accurately measuring sewage flowrates during sampling can be very challenging in sewer sars cov 2 rna decay was modelled and the results showed negligible decay estimates in the local sewer network the novelty of the current work is that hotspots could be identified in the city based on data generated by decentralized sewage monitoring rather than based on clinical data this could help major cities deal with the current pandemic especially in places with utterly inadequate clinical testing data such as brazil and most developing countries our results highlight the importance of planning and carrying out control measures at targeted areas this is especially true for favelas which tend to be densely populated with limited sanitation infrastructure and where it may be virtually impossible for residents to effectively isolate and follow basic prevention measures such as hand washing our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic indicating that for many brazilians the situation is a lot worse than reported by official figures therefore specific pandemic control actions should be prioritised in the identified hotspots including carrying out targeted epidemiologic surveys intensification of contact tracing of patients implementation of full mandatory local lockdowns and possibly prioritizing vaccination of people

16754,brazil has become one of the epicentres of the covid 19 pandemic with cases heavily concentrated in large cities testing data is extremely limited and unreliable which restricts health authorities ability to deal with the pandemic given the stark demographic social and economic heterogeneities within brazilian cities it is important to identify hotspots so that the limited resources available can have the greatest impact this study shows that decentralised monitoring of sars cov 2 rna in sewage can be used to assess the distribution of covid 19 prevalence in the city the methodology developed in this study allowed the identification of hotspots by comprehensively monitoring sewers distributed through belo horizonte brazil s third largest city our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic indicating that for many brazilians the situation is much worse than reported by official figures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology covid 19 prevalence hotspots decentralised sewage monitoring health vulnerability 1 introduction on march 11 2020 the world health organization who declared covid 19 a pandemic covid 19 is a respiratory syndrome caused by the sars cov 2 virus with over 130 million confirmed cases and nearly 3 million confirmed deaths worldwide as of april 12 2021 official data suggest that over 13 million brazilians have been infected with a death toll second only to the usa worldometers 2021 cases have been heavily concentrated in big cities but have spread to the countryside affecting isolated indigenous communities these statistics are fraught with uncertainties because the tests are notoriously unreliable and the sample size less than 0 1 of the population is very small worldometers 2021 in large brazilian cities testing is mainly occurring among people who suffer from symptoms severe enough to seek health care or have private health insurance brazil is one of the most unequal countries in the world oecd et a 2019 and its large cities are starkly heterogeneous in demographic social and economic terms during the pandemic it is imperative that limited available resources are directed to neighbourhoods where they will have the greatest impact which requires the spatial distribution of infections to be characterized following the detection of sars cov 2 rna in faeces of covid 19 patients wang et al 2020 and later in sewage medema et al 2020 and sewage sludge peccia et al 2020 an increasing number of studies have reported the use of sewage monitoring as a tool for epidemiological surveillance sewage based surveillance of other viruses has been well documented in the literature wigginton et al 2015 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 and has been successfully applied to assess the spread of polio in populations since 1980s hovi et al 2012 by sampling raw sewage from the inlet of treatment plants and determining sars cov 2 rna concentrations it is possible to extract valuable information on infection levels for the entire population that contributes sewage to the treatment plant this approach has shown that sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage correlated with the local numbers of infected individuals ahmed et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 extending this principle by sampling wastewater directly from the sewers at multiple points upstream of the treatment plant could reveal the spatial distribution in prevalence of the virus in a large city this can be even more critical in cities where not all collected sewage reaches the treatment plant but is instead discharged in water bodies a common limitation in sanitation infrastructure in the developing world in places with severely scarce testing data during the current pandemic such as brazil information obtained from decentralised sewage monitoring could be vital in devising potentially life saving public health interventions we have carried out a comprehensive sewage monitoring programme for sars cov 2 rna in belo horizonte minas gerais brazil since april 2020 early on its epidemic curve our objective was to assess temporal and spatial information on the virus load in different neighbourhoods to assist local health authorities in decision making through weekly bulletins here we present the results for the period between epidemiological weeks 20 and 32 from may 11 to august 07 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to use decentralised sewage monitoring to assess spatial distribution of covid 19 prevalence in a large city 2 material and methods 2 1 selection of sewage sampling points belo horizonte has a population of approximately 2 million people and is located in southeast brazil it has two major sewage treatment plants stps each with a dedicated sewer network arrudas and onça sewersheds weekly samples were collected from the inlet of both treatment plants and from a total of 15 points in the sewer networks chernicharo et al 2020 purposely chosen to collect sewage from regions with starkly different socio economic and health vulnerability indicators therefore a total of 17 points were monitored i two points at the inlet of sewage treatment plants arrudas and onça ii 15 points in the sewer system 7 in the arrudas sewershed and 8 in the onça sewershed a total of 202 samples were collected from may 11 to august 07 fig 1 shows a map with the sampling points and health vulnerability indexes for each region sampled fig 2 shows the single line diagram of both sewer networks including the population served flow rate and distance between sampling points composite samples 24hr composites for both treatment plants and 4 hr composites for all other points were collected on fixed days mondays for points on the arrudas sewershed and wednesdays for points on the onça sewershed from 8 30am to 12 30pm using autosamplers the sewers were designed as separate sewer systems it did not rain during any of the sampling days 2 2 health vulnerability index hvi the health vulnerability index was formulated by belo horizonte city hall pbh belo horizonte city hall 2018 considering socioeconomic residents per household illiteracy rates income skin color and ethnicity and sanitation indicators access to adequate water supply sanitation and municipal solid waste collection and disposal the hvi is divided into four classes extremely vulnerable very vulnerable vulnerable and not vulnerable and published in a shapefile format for each region the layers correspondent to the same class were dissolved and then the area of each class was calculated the final class of each sampled region presented in this study corresponds to the dominant class in terms of area in each region all data used in hvi calculations were derived from the last brazilian census 2010 and the relative weights used in the calculation were defined using the analytic hierarchy process as shown in table 1 2 3 collection preservation and transport of sewage samples the following procedures were adopted for sampling storage and transport of sewage samples isolation of the area near the access of the manhole using signal cones and easels installation of automatic sampling devices fig s1 equipped with battery sampling container and reusable ice packs keeping the samples at 4 c collection of composite samples representing the morning period usually between 8 30am and 12 30pm the sample container 10 liters was kept surrounded by ice packs throughout the sampling duration the automatic sampling device was set to collect one portion of sample of approximate 400 ml every 10 minutes resulting in 10 liters after 4 hours sampling following sampling composite samples were homogenized by vigorously shaking the container and transferred to two 1 liter bottles one bottle was taken to the laboratory in the department of environmental and sanitary engineering desa of the federal university of minas gerais for the quantification of the sars cov 2 rna the second bottle was taken to the central laboratory of the sanitation company for minas gerais for the determination of chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss surfactants and thermotolerant coliforms or e coli according to apha baird and bridgewater 2017 both bottles were kept on ice during transport 2 4 quantification of sars cov 2 rna the virus concentration step was performed according to methods previously described symonds et al 2014 ahmed et al 2015 this method is based on the adsorption extraction method using electronegative membranes 0 45 µm hawp04700 millipore before the sewage filtration average volume of 50 ml through the membrane the method began with the addition of mgcl2 2 5 m followed by adjustment of the sample ph to 3 to 3 5 using acetic acid 1m symonds et al 2014 following sample filtration the membrane was folded put into a 2 ml tube with 600 µl of pm1 solution provided in the dna rna extraction kit glass beads and 6 µl of beta mercaptoethanol and stored at 80 c until rna extraction rna was extracted using a commercial kit allprep powerviral dna rna qiagen hilden germany according to instructions provided by the manufacturer a bead beater was used instead of vortex in the first step of rna extraction to remove viral particles from the membrane following extraction rna was resuspended in 100 µl of ultrapure water free of rnases and stored at 80 c the detection of sars cov 2 was performed using available rt qpcr assays using different primer probe sets recommended by the us center for disease control and prevention center for disease control and prevention 2020 targeting the nucleocapsid protein n gene region n1 lu et al 2020 all rt qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 µl reaction mixtures using itaqtm universal probes one step reaction mix and reverse transcriptase for both rt qpcr assays plasmids were purchased from integrated dna technologies coralville ia usa and used as standards or positive controls the rt qpcr assays were performed using an applied biosystems 7500 real time pcr system all rt qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each rt qpcr run a series of three positive and negative controls were included standard curves were built using serial dilutions table s1 of the standard plasmid sars cov 2 obtained from idt 2019 ncov n positive control an exponential model verbyla et al 2016 was used to estimate the limit of detection lod using 95 probability of amplification the exponential model assumes that dna cdna in samples are randomly distributed in reaction wells dna cdna copy has an independent and identical probability of surviving the conditions to complete the qpcr and at least one target dna cdna copy has to be physically present in the qpcr in order to cause amplification within 40 cycles based on these assumptions the lod with a 95 probability of amplification was determined according to eq 1 1 p a x 1 e k x where x represents the mean number of target genome copies added to each qpcr well mean concentration per reaction and k represents the probability of survival the model determined an lod of 15 copies per reaction or 6 copies ml of sewage fig s2 the limit of quantification i e the lowest concentration where the dilution curve stops being linear was 50 copies reaction or 20 gene copies ml of sewage table s1 the master standard curves used in this study were within the prescribed range of minimum information for publication of quantitative miqe real time pcr guidelines bustin et al 2009 the amplification efficiencies for n1 assays ranged from 94 7 to 109 r2 ranged from 0 993 to 0 997 slope ranged from 3 118 to 3 454 and y inter ranged from 35 726 to 38 667 all qpcr assays were performed in triplicate according to the miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 in order to check pcr inhibition internal control hsrpp 30 was used as recommended by the cdc center for disease control and prevention 2020 whenever the sample did not amplify with the internal control negative for rnase p the sample was diluted 10x and 100x to check for inhibition and confirm that the result was negative since the rt qpcr standard curves were built using double stranded plasmid and the target molecule in the environmental samples sars cov 2 rna is single stranded all concentrations determined for the environmental samples were multiplied by a factor of 2 this was done because two viral n1 gene fragments n1 gene copies single stranded are required to give the equivalent fluorescence signal ct value on the rt qpcr assay of one molecule n1 gene copy double stranded of the plasmid standard fig s3 in other words if a sample that has the same ct of 1000 copies of the plasmid standard that sample has 1000 copies of double stranded target however 1000 copies of double stranded target would actually correspond to 2000 viral particles since the virus is single stranded alternatively the nominal gene concentrations used to build the standard curve with double stranded plasmid could be divided by a factor of 2 while maintaining unaltered the concentration values determined for the environmental samples 2 5 estimation ofin sewerdecay ofsars cov 2 rna in sewer decay of the rt qpcr signal for sars cov 2 rna was estimated for each of the 15 monitored regions based on the first order decay rate constant determined by ahmed et al 2020 design characteristics of all sampled trunk sewers and interceptors were provided by the sanitation company for minas gerais including pipe diameter and total length average slope and average flow rate at the sampling point sewage flow velocities and in sewer travel time were calculated based on design characteristics table 2 the degradation rate of sars cov 2 rna in sewage was assumed to follow exponential decay therefore the rna concentration that was excreted and discharged into the sewer collection system n0 is described by the following equation eq 1 1a n 0 n t e k t where n t is the rna concentration measured by the sampling campaign i e the amount of rna that resists decay after a time t t is the time elapsed between the time of excretion time 0 and time of sample collection time t i e in sewer travel time and k 0 183 d 1 ref 14 is the first order decay rate constant of the sars cov 2 rna at 25 c average measured sewage temperature sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined for each monitored region over epidemiological weeks 20 to 32 referred to as n t eq 1 as well as the estimated initial rna concentrations taking into account in sewer rna degradation referred as n0 eq 1 are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively table 5 shows the percentage degradation of rna at each sampling point calculated based on data shown in tables 2 and 3 2 6 relative prevalence index rpi determination sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage determined in the laboratory are expressed as the number of viral genome copies per litre of sewage this can be determined based on the population of infected individuals that excrete viral particles and the population that is served by the

sewage volume generation l inhab 1 day 1 in the previous equation the term pin p can be interpreted as prevalence index pi therefore eq 2 can be rewritten to highlight the contribution of the pi to the viral genome concentration as follows 3 c p i f n f v the per capita mass of faeces excreted per day ranges from 150 g to 300 g brown et al 1996 the number of viral genome copies per gram of faeces varies by several orders of magnitude between 103 to 107 copies per gram of faeces la rosa et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 the volume of sewage generated per inhabitant per day varies between 120 and 200 litters in brazilian urban areas snis diagnóstico dos serviços de água e esgotos 2018 2019 therefore pi determination based on the viral concentration in sewage is marred by uncertainties due to the large intrinsic variations of the parameters required for its calculation however such uncertainties can be reduced if the pi in each region is evaluated relative to the overall pi in the sewershed determined based on the viral genome concentration at the inlet of the sewage treatment plant stp it is reasonable to consider that the ratio between the viral genome load in faeces f x nf and the volume of sewage generated per inhabitant per day is similar for each monitored region and the entire sewershed monitored at the inlet of the stp therefore these parameters can be grouped and expressed as a constant k throughout different regions and the entire sewershed eq 4 4 k f n f v cod was used as a normalisation parameter to account for possible variations in water consumption

correction factor was applied to v based on the ratio between the median cod concentration measured at the sampling point and the median cod concentration measured at the respective stp eq 3 can then be rewritten as follows eq 5 5 p i c k the relative prevalence index of each monitored region rpii is calculated as the ratio of the pi of each monitored region pii and the pi of the entire sewershed pistp monitored at the inlet of the stp and is described by the following equation eq 6 6 rp i i p i i p i stp c i k c stp k rp i i c i c stp where ci is the viral genome concentration determined at each monitored region rna copies l 1 adjusted for decay and cstp is the viral genome concentration determined for the entire sewershed inlet of the stp rna copies l 1 adjusted for decay regions with rpi higher than 1 have covid 19 prevalence higher than the average prevalence in the sewershed and could hence be considered hotspots 3 results and discussion due to limitations on covid 19 testing data authorities in belo horizonte have planned their pandemic control actions based on covid 19 bed occupation data collected from local hospitals and municipal health centres and on the effective transmission rate rt likewise we have collected and evaluated data that do not depend on covid 19 testing including the number of people seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms partial lockdown measures were pre emptively introduced to contain the spread of the virus from march 18 2020 epidemiological week 12 when a municipal decree ordered the closure of all non essential services these restrictions were partially lifted on may 25 2020 epidemiological week 22 when virtually the entire retail sector was allowed to open further relaxation of restrictions took place on june 8 2020 epidemiological week 24 when mainly agglomeration prone establishments remained closed including schools bars restaurants and cinemas the lifting of restrictions resulted in the aggravation of the pandemic from week 25 as shown by increases in the number of local covid 19 hospital bed occupations the number of individuals seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms and total sars cov 2 load in sewage fig 3 by week 26 the total number of intensive care and infirmary hospital beds occupied by covid 19 patients reached respectively 85 and 69 of locally available covid 19 beds as a result strict isolation measures were reinstated on week 27 june 29 2020 the four week cumulative number of individuals seeking health care with covid 19 symptoms and the load of sars cov 2 rna in sewage followed similar trends fig 3 with sharp increases in weeks 24 to 26 followed by surges and later decreases in weeks 27 to 32 the comparison based on a four week period was carried out because virus shedding in stool may occur for up to 4 weeks after the onset of respiratory symptoms in mild to severe cases zheng et al 2020 the observed low number of confirmed cases in the same period highlights the scarcity and inadequacy of local clinical testing data sewage monitoring can detect pre and asymptomatic individuals la rosa et al 2020 who may excrete the virus in faeces but are not tested and hence are not included in official statistics accurately estimating the number of covid 19 cases based solely on sewage data may be problematic due to the intrinsic wide variability of some parameters necessary to convert sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage to the number of cases for example the number of viral genome copies excreted per gram of faeces can vary from 103 to 107 woelfel et al 2020 to circumvent that limitation and to identify hotspots within the city we propose data evaluation based on the relative prevalence index rpi section 2 6 material and methods and the concentration of sars cov 2 rna in sewage for each of the sampled regions as both parameters do not depend on conversion factors we define the rpi as the ratio of the regional prevalence based on sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined at each monitored region over the prevalence in the sewershed based on sars cov 2 rna concentrations determined at the treatment plant inlet rpi calculations take into consideration the estimated decay of sars cov 2 rna section 2 5 material and methods as it travels through sewers ahmed et al 2020 a region with rpi higher than 1 has a covid 19 prevalence higher than the average prevalence in the sewershed and could hence be considered a hotspot depending on the uncertainties related to the determination of some of the factors that may affect the rpi e g sampling regime and storage rna quantification protocol etc the alert level for regions of concern could be set at values higher than 1 in order to avoid overly alarmist prognostics based solely on sewage fig 4 shows rpi values determined for each of the 15 monitored regions in three distinct periods during the pandemic epidemiological weeks 20 and 24 prior to the aggravation of the pandemic 25 and 28 includes the onset of the aggravation period and 29 and 32 continuation of the aggravation period and beginning of the attenuation period in addition fig 4 shows the health vulnerability index hvi section 2 2 material and methods for each of the sampled regions regions with high hvi are considered vulnerable as they are dominated by unplanned occupations also known as favelas or shanty towns with poor living conditions characterised by densely populated households with poor access to sanitation health care and other basic public services scalzaretto 2020 our data shows that the most vulnerable regions were the hardest hit by the pandemic for instance the most vulnerable regions in the arrudas aws 1 aws 4 and aws 7 and onça ows 1 ows 5 ows 6 ows 7 and ows 8 sewersheds showed persistently high rpis in the period prior to the aggravation of the pandemic the median covid 19 prevalence in region ows 8 was nearly three times the average prevalence in the onça sewershed in the period comprising weeks 25 to 28 the median covid 19 prevalence in region aws 7 was nearly four times the average prevalence in the arrudas sewershed both these regions are classified as medium to extremely vulnerable regions with low hvi were less affected by the pandemic e g ows 2 aws 2 aws 3 aws 5 and aws 6 with rpi values below one during most of the monitoring period rpi data proved to be particularly relevant as an early warning tool as it helped to identify regions with relatively high covid 19 prevalence before the aggravation of the pandemic that affected the entire city these results are hardly surprising as it has been fairly well documented that socioeconomically disadvantaged communities are being disproportionately affected by covid 19 adhikari et al 2020 wadhera et al 2020 bilal et al 2021 ogedegbe et al 2021 passos et al 2021 however the novelty of the current work is that these findings were achieved using decentralized sewage monitoring rather than based on clinical data a recent study by passos et al passos et al 2021 based on census and calculated excess deaths data also showed that people living in vulnerable areas in belo horizonte were more affected by covid 19 epidemiological weeks 10 to 43 this was especially true for the elderly as the mortality rate per 100 000 for 60 year old and over was 179 2 353 6 and 472 6 in low medium and high very high vulnerability sectors respectively bilal et al 2021 evaluated the correlation between the social vulnerability index svi and the number of covid 19 tests done confirmed covid 19 cases and covid 19 deaths for hundreds of zones in chicago philadelphia and new york city the svi used included 15 variables from the american community survey comprising 4 domains socioeconomic status household composition race and language barriers and housing and transportation sectors with higher svi more vulnerable had lower testing rates higher positivity rates more confirmed cases and greater covid 19 related mortality vulnerable communities are more affected by the pandemic likely due to a number of factors or a combination of them including higher risk of exposure to the virus e g due to their stronger reliance on public transport which can be overcrowded even during the pandemic lower access to safe water and sanitation higher number of people per household cohabitation with relatives who work in essential services higher comorbidity burden decreased access to health care barriers to testing and other factors our data on sars cov 2 rna concentrations in sewage fig 5 indicate that the monitored regions had distinct epidemiologic dynamics with clear differences in peak duration week of peak occurrence and number of peaks among regions the factors that govern these differences have yet to be determined the current study has important limitations that should be acknowledged for instance rna recovery rates during sample concentration and rna extraction were not systematically assessed therefore any possible extraction biases were assumed constant throughout the study which might not necessarily be accurate sars cov 2 faecal shedding patterns were assumed to be similar among all sampled regions considering that the smallest population equivalent of the monitored regions was fairly large approximately 12 thousand people this basic assumption might be reasonable as viral shedding patterns in large populations tend to be less affected by groups of individuals with highly different shedding rates finally the volume and composition of sewage might differ among monitored regions especially due to socioeconomic factors to address this chemical oxygen demand cod was used to calculate a correction factor for rpi calculations cod is frequently used as a normalizing parameter in wastewater based epidemiology wbe studies rico et al 2017 4 conclusion our data suggested that local restrictions had a strong effect on hospital bed occupation as well as suspected covid 19 cases and sars cov 2 rna loads in sewage the monitoring of wastewater closer to the target population in several neighbourhoods and not only at the treatment plant revealed the spatial distribution in prevalence of the virus in a large heterogeneous brazilian city the relative prevalence index rpi was proposed to help identify hotspots during different periods in the pandemic since the rpi assesses the regional prevalence relative to the prevalence in the entire sewershed several parameters are normalized in its calculation and are therefore not needed including shedding rates per infected person and sewage flow rates this can be greatly advantageous as shedding rates per infected person can vary by several orders of magnitude among individuals and accurately measuring sewage flowrates during sampling can be very challenging in sewer sars cov 2 rna decay was modelled and the results showed negligible decay estimates in the local sewer network the novelty of the current work is that hotspots could be identified in the city based on data generated by decentralized sewage monitoring rather than based on clinical data this could help major cities deal with the current pandemic especially in places with utterly inadequate clinical testing data such as brazil and most developing countries our results highlight the importance of planning and carrying out control measures at targeted areas this is especially true for favelas which tend to be densely populated with limited sanitation infrastructure and where it may be virtually impossible for residents to effectively isolate and follow basic prevention measures such as hand washing our results show that the most vulnerable neighbourhoods in the city were the hardest hit by the pandemic indicating that for many brazilians the situation is a lot worse than reported by official figures therefore specific pandemic control actions should be prioritised in the identified hotspots including carrying out targeted epidemiologic surveys intensification of contact tracing of patients implementation of full mandatory local lockdowns and possibly prioritizing vaccination of people
