7840,study region upper reach of the heihe river basin uhrb study focus we quantified the potential changes in future climate and streamflow as well as their corresponding contribution to the annual variations and the dominant factors of streamflow change were explored in further robust multivariate bias correction was applied to correct the outputs of the general circulation method gcms before applying the climate projection the soil and water assessment tool model was applied to explore streamflow characteristics under the climate projection of bias corrected gcms under four representative emission scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 new hydrological insights for the region by the end of the 21st century climate will follow a warming and wetting trend within the basin the annual streamflow is projected to increase by 18 in the 2030 s and 36 in the 2050 s and 2090 s overall the minimum temperature had a positive impact on streamflow in the cold seasons especially in spring contributing the most to the annual streamflow increment when the temperature increase is greater than 5 42 c the peak streamflow will shift forward from may to april moreover evapotranspiration will increase with temperature leading to a decrease in summer streamflow the results enable us to better understand the climate and streamflow changes at different time scales and provide guidance for the development of climate change response strategies and water resource management planning graphical abstract the seasonal streamflow will significantly increase except for that in summer with the largest increase in spring contributing 38 1 59 5 to annual increment except for july and august the monthly streamflow is projected to increase especially significant in april and may with the continuous rise of temperature the intra annual streamflow curve will change from a unimodal in july pattern to a bimodal in april or may and july pattern the warmer temperature will cause the large increase of evapotranspiration leading to the summer streamflow decrease ga1 keywords climate change hydrological response cmip6 swat upper reach of heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow from alpine regions provides abundant water resources for numerous places worldwide ensuring socioeconomic development as well as ecosystem security su et al 2022 wang et al 2021 studies have reported that the streamflow in alpine regions is sensitive to climate change huntington 2006 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2020 the warmer climate has accelerated environmental changes such as glacier retreat yang et al 2019 and snow melt yan et al 2022 resulting in stronger spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hydrological processes ma and zhang 2022 yang et al 2020 and more uncertainties in streamflow li et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b for the inland river basins in northwest china agricultural development and ecosystems in the middle and lower basins depend on water resources from alpine regions che et al 2019 sun et al 2018 mountainous streamflow change will affect the rational utilisation of water resources and ultimately affect ecological environment protection and social development feng et al 2019 wang and cheng 2000 therefore accurate projection and quantitative analysis of streamflow changes in the alpine regions of inland river basins are vital for formulating climate change response strategies and refined water resource management ahmed et al 2022 in recent decades general circulation model gcm output data have been widely used for climate projections tan et al 2021 zhang and long 2021 lv et al 2022 the latest gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 provide reasonable projections of future climate by coupling social development scenarios and possible emission trends with climate modelling carvalho et al 2021 eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 however coarse resolution of the gcm makes it difficult to characterise the regional climate azmat et al 2020 shrestha et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to downscale and correct the bias to improve the accuracy of regional climate projections worku et al 2021 xu et al 2021 common methods for bias correction include mean and variance bias corrections quantile mapping and trend preserving bias correction which are simple and correct the bias by the individual variable at a single or specific time scale such as annually hao et al 2022 siqueira et al 2021 usman et al 2021 however these methods ignore the correlations between climate variables which often have strong regional characteristics di cecco and gouhier 2018 recently mehrotra and sharma 2021 successfully proved that robust multivariate bias correction rombc could better correct gcm outputs than classical quantile mapping because rombc considers the correlations among climate variables at different time scales daily monthly and annual scales moreover rombc can help gcms reproduce the same daily and annual distribution behaviour of precipitation as observations which could reduce the precipitation uncertainty and enhance the reliability for hydrological simulations in mountainous regions therefore a bias correction method with multiple variables will improve the accuracy of climate and hydrological process evaluation mehrotra and sharma 2015 sa adi et al 2020 hydrological models such as hbv vic mikeshe and soil and water assessment tool swat are the main tools for depicting changes in the hydrological processes and water balance in response to climate change in watersheds costa et al 2021 devia et al 2015 gao et al 2019 mendonça et al 2018 the swat model has been widely applied in hydrological process simulations owing to its user friendly operation and reliable physical mechanisms näschen et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 tan et al 2021 for example yin et al 2016 used swat to quantify the change in water balance in the mountainous region of northwest china xuan et al 2021 analysed the responses of runoff components to future climate change in the yarlung zangbo river basin using the swat model shukla et al 2021 applied the swat model to predict that future streamflow will increase in the western himalaya owing to climate change these results suggest that swat can accurately simulate hydrological processes over mountainous regions the upper reach of the heihe river basin uhrb located in the northeastern tibetan plateau is an important water resource that maintains the middle oasis and lower desert plains of the hexi corridor china feng et al 2019 li et al 2018 yao et al 2018 previous studies have analysed the impact of climate change on streamflow in detail li et al 2018 liu et al 2022 but they have focussed on specific time scales such as monthly and annual scales considering the sensitivity of climate and streamflow in alpine regions to global warming their response might accumulate over time thus more climate and streamflow studies should link the intra annual change to annual variation therefore this study aimed to analyse the characteristics of climate and streamflow change from multiple perspectives in the uhrb the main objective of this study was to quantitatively analyse the change in trends of future climate and potential streamflow response at different time scales monthly seasonal interannual and periodical as well as the dominant factors for streamflow variation seven cmip6 gcms and four classical emission scenarios were selected as future climate scenarios and swat was applied to simulate hydrological processes under them the obtained future climate and streamflow under each scenario were compared with observation to evaluate the possible trends and ranges the results provide a reference for further exploration of the impact of regional climate change on streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china the heihe river originates from the qilian mountains and flows into the juyan lake the main stream is 821 km long and the basin area is 130 000 km2 yin et al 2016 the uhrb is situated in the middle part of the northern qilian mountains between longitudes 98 102 e and latitudes 37 40 n providing 90 of the water resources for oasis ecosystems in the middle and lower areas of the hrb li et al 2021c yang et al 2020 in the uhrb the terrain is high in the southwest and low in the northeast with elevations of 1637 5062 m both vegetation landscapes and soil types demonstrate significant vertical zonality which vary with increasing altitude the vegetation landscapes include shrub grassland at lower altitudes of 2500 m forest grassland at 2500 3300 m alpine grassland at 3300 3800 m and sparse vegetation at higher altitude above 4000 m li et al 2021c yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a similarly the soil types include felty soils in shrub forests dark felty soils in grasslands and frozen frigid soils in glacial areas the regional climatic is typical continental semi arid type with rare precipitation in cold winters and abundant precipitation in hot summers which are controlled by the westerly circulation zhang et al 2019 owing to its special geographic location the annual average temperature is 2 c and the annual average precipitation is 450 mm which increases from west to east as well as with elevation yin et al 2018 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the meteorological and hydrological data used in this study were divided into observed and projected data daily observed climate variable data from 1971 to 2018 were obtained from four national meteorological stations located in and around the study area yeniugou yng qilian ql tuole tl and zhangye zy as references to assess the ability of gcms for reflecting the historical climate scenario the climatic variables include precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed the observed monthly streamflow during 1971 2018 was collected at the outlet of the uhrb i e the yingluoxia gauging station ylx as a reference to evaluate the calibration and validation ability of swat for depicting the hydrological process exact locations of the meteorological and gauging stations are shown in fig 1 the projected data of daily climate variables were obtained from the gcms in the scenariomip which is the primary activity of cmip6 and provides climate projections based on alternative scenarios o neill et al 2016 the alternative scenarios are the combination of the representative concentration pathways rcps and the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which are known to provide reasonable climate projections under the composite scenario of climate and socio economic change o neill et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in this study four representative ssp rcp paths were used to describe the climate scenario from sustainable to fossil fuel development table 1 considering that a higher resolution could better capture the climate heterogeneity in complex terrain seven available gcms table 2 with grid cells smaller than 2 2 in cmip6 were selected which had completed the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 projection of six climate variables involved in the hydrological simulation because the spatial resolution of different models is inconsistent the data were interpolated to 0 5 0 5 grid cells using the bilinear method which is widely applied in remapping climate models fan et al 2022 ying et al 2022 to verify the corrected simulation in cmip6 with observed data grid points closest to the meteorological stations were selected for comparison 2 3 methods 2 3 1 robust multivariate bias correction rombc rombc was applied because it corrects the bias based on the correlation among climate variables at multiple timescales mehrotra and sharma 2021 sarhadi et al 2016 the older version of this method named mbc was adopted to successfully correct the bias and provide accurate climate projections for northwestern china by yin et al 2020 the statistical relations of correction were established using the observed data and historical gcm data the evolution of the model structure was divided into two parts from univariate to multivariate and from one time scale to the next first statistical methods were applied to formulate the base corrected series between the observed and gcm data which are essential to correct the bias in daily distribution and variability at higher timescales including monthly seasonal and annual time scales second rombc checked the necessity and applicability of bias correction for dependence attributes at different time scales to identify a suitable structure for bias correction for a specific time scale at each time scale autocorrelation of the variables was considered first followed by mutual their dependence third rombc modified the daily time series to incorporate correction at all time scales by aggregating the bias corrected time series to higher time scales and assessing the optimal model a detailed description of rombc related to data processing is available in mehrotra et al 2018 and mehrotra and sharma 2021 the major equations of rombc are as follows 1 y y m i v g c y ˆ m i v g c μ m v g c σ m v h σ m v g c μ m v g c 2 y m i v g f y ˆ m i v g f μ m v g f σ m v h σ m v g c μ m v g f where μ m v g c and μ m v g f are means of the current and future climate time series σ m v h is the standard deviation of the observed climate time series and σ m v g c is the standard deviation of the current climate time series similarly y ˆ m i v g c and y m i v g c and y ˆ m i v g f and y m i v g f are monthly time series before and after standard deviation correction for the current and future climate unless otherwise stated the superscript g stands for bias corrected series and subscripts v for climate variables t for day m for month s for season and i for year 3 z v t m s i g m v m s i g m v m s i g s v s i g s v s i g a v i g a v i g z v t m s i g where z v t m s i g m v m s i g s v s i g and a v i g are the daily monthly seasonal and annual corrected values m v m s i g s v s i g and a v i g are the aggregated values corresponding to monthly seasonal and annual simulations respectively z v t m s i g is the daily time series of climate variables and t stands for day in time series to reduce uncertainty from a single gcm and enhance the reliability of projections from several gcms the multi model ensembles methods have been widely applied ahmed et al 2019 tian et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 and the multi model ensembles mean is a simple and effective method that has been successfully used in studies on climate projection li et al 2021a liu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 we calculated the ensemble mean from seven corrected gcms to represent future climate conditions in the uhrb 2 3 2 swat model and set up swat is a physical process based semi distributed hydrological model developed by the agricultural research service in 1990 which accurately simulates the complicated interactions of natural indicators and water resources tamm et al 2018 tan et al 2021 since the late 1990 s swat has been widely applied to assess the impact of climate change on water supply demand and quality rosenberg et al 1999 swat divides the entire watershed into several sub basins according to topography and river network distribution and further into hydrological response units hrus based on the distribution of soil land use and slope the total runoff was accurately estimated by applying the water balance principle to calculate the water yield at each hru yang et al 2020 the water balance principle is as follows 4 sw t sw 0 i 1 t p day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t represents the total soil water content mm sw o represents the initial soil water content on day i mm t represents the simulated days p day represents the quantity of precipitation on day i mm q surf represents the quantity of surface runoff on day i mm e a represents the quantity of evapotranspiration on day i mm w seep represents the amount of water entering the vadose zone through the soil profile on day i mm and q gw denotes the return flow on day i mm in high altitude watersheds snow melting is an important component of runoff recharge for p day we calculated both liquid rainfall and solid snowfall precipitation in the model a threshold temperature was defined to distinguish precipitation as rainfall or snowfall if the mean daily temperature was higher than the threshold temperature the precipitation within the hrus was directly classified as rainfall otherwise it was classified as snowfall and added to the snow pack and the snow melting can be expressed as follows 5 snow mlt h mlt snow cov t snow t mx 2 t mlt where snow mlt is the amount of snow melting on a given day mm h2o h mlt is the melt factor for the day mm h2o day c snow cov is the fraction of the hru area covered by snow t snow is the snowpack temperature on a given day c and t mlt is the base temperature above which snow melt is allowed c considering the impact of altitude on precipitation and temperature the model enables sub basins to be divided according to elevation bands which facilitates the adjustment of the spatial heterogeneity of climate variables cao et al 2022 ur rahman et al 2020 in this study five elevation bands were defined for each subbasin evapotranspiration is the primary way of water removal from the watershed an accurate evapotranspiration estimate is critical for the hydrological process evaluation thus the penman monteith method with physical mechanism was applied and the equation can be written as follows 6 λ e h net g ρ air c p e z o e z r a γ 1 r c r a where λ e is the latent heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 e is the depth rate evaporation mm d 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 h net is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the heat flux density to the ground mj m 2 d 1 ρ air is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure mj kg 1 c 1 e z o is the saturation vapour pressure of air at height z kpa e z is the water vapour pressure of air at height z kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r c is the plant canopy resistance s m 1 and r a is the diffusion resistance of aerodynamic resistance s m 1 2 3 3 calibration and validation of the swat model we simulated hydrological processes based on the daily data of meteorological stations during 1971 2018 a monthly streamflow of 38 years 1981 2018 was used to evaluate the model performance the traditional split sample approach in hydrological simulation adopts older data for calibration and newer data for validation and then predicts the future myers et al 2021 recently shen et al 2022 pointed out that this practice should be avoided as it causes inferior model performance in the testing period in this study the time period 1971 1980 was used as warm up period and initial condition to eliminate the initial bias adib et al 2020 ur rahman et al 2020 the recent 18 years of available data 2001 2018 were completely used for calibration while the earlier 20 years of data 1981 2000 were used for validation although the results of shen et al 2022 suggested skipping the validation the step was conducted to ensure that the modelling results were reliable the selected calibration parameters were based on the current climate change and its impact on streamflow therefore we expected that the same parameter scheme for validation may overestimate streamflow change thirteen sensitive parameters related to streamflow were selected for model calibration table 3 and have been proven to be suitable for reproducing hydrological processes in the uhrb yang et al 2020 yin et al 2016 several evaluation coefficients were selected to assess the model performance comprising the coefficient of determination r2 relative bias in percent pbias and nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse r2 is applied to present the fitting level between the simulation and observation in the historical period pbias can evaluate the bias size of simulation relative to the observation nse is applied to assess the simulation level of the hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relevant formulas are as follow 7 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 8 pbias i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 9 nse 1 t 1 n y i x i 2 t 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i are the simulated and observed streamflow respectively while x and y are the corresponding averages of the simulated and observed values and n is the length of time typically the model performs better if pbias is smaller and closer to 0 while the r2 or nse is larger and closer to 1 golmohammadi et al 2014 2 3 4 contribution rates we used the intra annual contribution to better understand the variation of regional climate and hydrological processes the formula is as follows 10 cr i t f i t o i t f i a o i a 100 where f i t and o i t are the projected and observed data of variable i at a specific time scale t monthly or seasonal scale respectively and f i a and o i a are the annual averages of the corresponding variable i the value of cr i t was high and the closer it was to 1 the greater was the contribution of the corresponding time scale moreover the four seasons were spring march april may summer june july august autumn september october november and winter december january february 3 results 3 1 bias correction and streamflow simulation 3 1 1 bias correction performance precision of the climate projection varied with application of the bias correction fig 2 the distances between the observation and projection were inversely proportional to the precision for example before the correction the distances between observation and projection were relatively far for precipitation indicating that the gcm projection might underestimate monthly precipitation the distances reduced after correction with the greatest reduction in precipitation indicating that bias correction largely improved the precision of precipitation projection which is significant for mountainous regions where precipitation has a large uncertainty moreover the corrected tmax and tmin values also moved closer to the observations confirming the ability of rombc to reduce the bias in gcms which is significant for projections to accurately capture the climate characteristics in mountainous regions 3 1 2 performance of streamflow simulation the best streamflow simulation had nse 0 91 and fitted well with the observation fig 3a and 3b high nse values indicate that the results of the model simulation met the well level according to the performance classification of moriasi et al 2007 positive pbias values indicated that the average tendency of the simulation slightly overestimated the observed streamflow which was within a reasonable range furthermore the scatter points in the calibration and validation were distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line and the values of r2 were the same as those of nse fig 3c the higher the r2 value the better is the simulated hydrological process furthermore the detailed results showed that swat could capture some peak flow events from june to august which confirms that swat is an excellent tool for accurately representing the hydrological process in mountainous regions 3 2 projection of future climate change and streamflow responses 3 2 1 projected precipitation change until the end of this century the annual precipitation is projected to increase at rates of 4 84 6 19 5 51 and 12 04 mm 10a under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively fig 4a at the seasonal scale the increase in precipitation in summer will be the highest 18 85 27 97 mm contributing the most 30 to the annual precipitation increase while the corresponding values in winter will be the least 4 58 9 43 mm 11 44 fig 5a at the monthly scale some months january april and october december will have less increment but high increment rate relative to the baseline 2 13 4 67 mm 70 39 while the opposite will be true for july september 6 95 10 07 mm 17 38 indicating that future monthly precipitation will significantly increase in cold seasons while that in warm seasons will increase relatively less fig 6a the precipitation increments in september will contribute the most to the annual increments but their contributions will decrease from 22 01 to 14 69 from low to high emission scenarios while those in april will increase from 5 67 to 9 33 fig 7a 3 2 2 projected temperature change the annual tmax tmin will rise by 1 27 c 1 08 c 3 13 c 2 30 c 4 58 c 3 98 c and 5 88 c 4 67 c under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively indicating that temperature will increase with radiative forcing and the increase in annual tmax will be higher than those in tmin furthermore the differences in tmax change among the emission scenarios will not be significant until 2040 figs 4b and 4c at the seasonal scale both the tmax and tmin increments in summer will contribute the most to the annual tmax and tmin increments under low emission scenarios however the tmin increments in winter will be greater than those in summer and the corresponding contribution to the annual tmin increments will be the largest under higher emission scenarios fig 5b and c basically the monthly tmax and tmin increments and the contribution rates to the annual tmax and tmin increments will be least in march 1 39 3 24 c 6 11 6 41 and highest in august 2 63 4 93 c 10 45 11 6 however under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the increments of tmin in november and december will up to 5 41 c and their contributions to the annual tmin increment will far exceed those of other months causing significant impacts on seasonal and annual tmin figs 6b 6c 7b and 7c 3 2 3 future streamflow responses although the increases in annual precipitation and temperature showed significant differences among the climate scenarios the difference in the future annual streamflow was not obvious with an increase ranging from 32 38 to 40 30 compared to the baseline fig 4d at the seasonal scale the streamflow was projected to increase except for summer with highest increments in spring 85 91 155 43 and most contribution 38 11 54 95 to the annual streamflow increments notably although summer precipitation will increase significantly 9 61 14 34 the streamflow will decrease slightly 1 74 2 48 relative to the baseline indicating that the large recharge of precipitation might be offset by the others fig 5d in general heavy precipitation in july and august often promotes a peak monthly streamflow however the distributions of future monthly streamflow will follow a bimodal curve with one peak around july and the other in may in this case the streamflow increments in may will contribute the most to the annual streamflow increment 25 unexpectedly although the precipitation increments in july were obvious its peak streamflow was projected to decrease relative to the baseline contributing negatively to annual streamflow increments moreover the contributions of changing streamflow in april will increase significantly while the contributions in may and june will decrease with rising radiative forcing fig 6d and fig 7d to further explore the distribution characteristics of the monthly streamflow in response to climate change the long periods were divided into three phases including 2021 2040 2030 s 2041 2060 2050 s and 2081 2100 2090 s because of the continuous influence of precipitation changes and accumulated temperature the increasing streamflow in later years is larger for example the increasing streamflow in the 2090 s is approximately twice as high as the baseline table 3 interestingly although the streamflow distributions exhibit monthly bimodal curves the first peak streamflow appears change with the radiative forcing indicating that the monthly streamflow is affected differently by climate change in different scenarios basically the first peak streamflow will appear in may with a significant increase of more than double the baseline however as the radiative forcing increases to a higher state the increasing rates of streamflow in may will decline over time which is especially significant in the 2090 s when this occurs the appearing time of peak streamflow will shift from may to april fig 8l 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of bias correction and streamflow simulation based on the observed data and the cmip6 dataset we assessed and quantitatively analysed the potential trends of future climate and streamflow responses at different time scales including monthly seasonal interannual and periodical scale in the uhrb before applying the gcms to analyse climate characteristics their outputs were corrected using the rombc method the correlations and standard deviations of the corrected outputs and the observed data were observed to be enhanced by 0 5 13 67 and 45 52 31 09 respectively indicating that rombc can effectively reduce the bias and enhance the reliability for gcm projection although streamflow in mountainous areas is less influenced by human activities the hydrological process might change differently owing to sensitive climate change high altitude and other regional characteristics this study applied the swat model to simulate streamflow in the uhrb and the calibration and validation results were consistent with those of previous studies in this region for example both nse and r2 were 0 91 and the pbias was 2 in the calibration and validation periods which were close to the results of lu et al 2015 nse and r2 0 81 0 94 and pbias 2 the results from both bias correction and hydrological modelling suggest that using gcms to estimate the potential changes in streamflow in response to climate change is feasible the results enable us to better understand the variability and differences in climate and streamflow changes at different time scales and provide guidance for the development of climate change response strategies and water resource management planning 4 2 impact of climate change on streamflow previous studies have confirmed that the average temperature and annual precipitation in northwest china have increased by 2 6 mm 10a and 0 28 c 10a over the past 50 years li et al 2021b in this study the future rising rates were estimated to be larger than 5 51 mm 10a in precipitation and higher than 0 29 c 10a in temperature in uhrb except for the ssp1 2 6 which indicates that the warming wetting phenomenon in mountainous regions may become increasingly obvious with time chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 sun et al 2013 in this context we explored the impact of precipitation and temperature on streamflow on a monthly scale from 2021 to 2100 by spearman correlation analysis across all climate scenarios the peak streamflow in may was mainly affected by the combined impact of precipitation and temperature change fig 9 the positive correlation of precipitation and streamflow was generally significant and greater than that of temperature indicating that streamflow changes in may would be dominated by an increase in precipitation interestingly the tmin in may correlated positively with streamflow especially in the 2030 s and 2050 s indicating that rising tmin will promote an increase in streamflow in near future fig s3 it is likely that the warmer tmin will have an indirect impact on streamflow promoting the earlier conversion of snowfall to rainfall thus enriching streamflow recharge pellicciotti et al 2010 however we also observed that the positive impacts of tmin on streamflow will clearly shift if the rising tmin exceeds a certain threshold because the accumulated increase in temperature may promote earlier melting thus affecting the distribution of intra annual streamflow azmat et al 2020 xu et al 2021 for example when the monthly average tmin increments were 5 42 c ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the streamflow in may and the positive impact of tmin would decline whereas the streamflow in april and the positive impact of tmin would increase significantly and become a new peak in the 2090s fig 8 s2 and s3 however this result is slightly different from the conclusions of su et al 2016 with intra annual streamflow remaining practically unchanged for all monsoon dominated basins this may be due to the differences in the study areas our study only focused on the northeastern tibetan plateau whereas su et al 2016 primarily focused on the major upstream region in the southern tibetan plateau moreover the streamflow in july and august had significant negative correlations with tmax and tmin which was much larger than the significant positive correlation with precipitation indicating that the decrease in streamflow in summer was highly related to temperature previous studies in alpine regions have confirmed that under the combined effect of precipitation and temperature increase the decrease in alpine streamflow in summer is due to the large increase in evapotranspiration which will offset and exceed the streamflow recharge hao et al 2022 kopytkovskiy et al 2015 moraga et al 2021 additionally we observed that streamflow will increase in cold seasons spring and winter which is similar to the results in mountainous watersheds in switzerland and the upper colorado etter et al 2017 kopytkovskiy et al 2015 the positive impacts of tmax and tmin were higher than those of precipitation from january april and september december especially significant in april and september it is likely that the rising temperature not only boosts the conversion of snowfall but also results in an earlier snowmelt flood peak and permafrost degradation which increases the streamflow in cold seasons chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 li et al 2018 confirmed that early melting could alleviate the spring drought in this region benefitting both agriculture in the midstream area and natural ecosystems in the downstream area however chen et al 2016 pointed out that the snow ice day would be delayed and end earlier owing to the warmer temperature which likely impacts the accumulation of solid water this means that while optimistic in the short term the positive impact of increased streamflow due to warming is limited in the long run overall the future changes in both precipitation and temperature will significantly impact alpine streamflow and the changes in tmin will play a dominant role in intra annual streamflow and should be paid attention in inland river basins chen et al 2018 and yang et al 2022 pointed out that rising temperatures will lead to the disappearance of small sized glaciers and the increase of snowmelt streamflow in the uhrb if global warming continues to impact the uhrb its water balance will be affected showing streamflow increase with an early peak in spring and decrease in summer and definitely amplify the crisis of regional water resources consequently threatening the natural environment and the sustainable development of human society you et al 2017 have reported that floods droughts and other disasters caused by climate change have occurred more often in recent years on the tibetan plateau zhao et al 2019b projected that 50 of the glacier area in the five catchments of the tibetan plateau would decline until the end of this century yao et al 2022 confirmed that the balance in the asian water tower has been broken by the accelerated transformation of ice and snow into liquid water therefore to avoid the aggravation of climate change and water resource crises it is necessary to implement policies to combat climate change in this region taking immediate measures to slow the increasing rate of regional temperature will help slow down the melting rate of glacial snow in spring and winter and maintain steady summer streamflow change to avoid the occurrence of floods or droughts which is significant for water resource security in inland basins 4 3 uncertainty limitation and future prospects uncertainties are inevitable in climate change projection and hydrological modelling studies in this study the major uncertainties were attributed to climate projections correction methods and hydrological simulations to understand the level of uncertainty in the results rather than to quantify the specific uncertainty we explored the range of possible variations in the results using shading and error bars we observed that the uncertainty ranges of the climate variables were narrower than those of the streamflow and especially significant in spring and summer it is possible that the superposition of projected uncertainties of precipitation temperature and hydrological process increase the uncertainty of the streamflow simulation additionally precipitation and temperature are sensitive to altitude in mountainous regions of china the uneven spatial distribution of meteorological stations in the uhrb may affect the observations of actual climate which further influence the bias corrected results of climate projections therefore high resolution remote sensing data can be used as a supplement to recognise the features of climatic variables in the future although the hydrological simulation accuracy has reached a reliable level our streamflow projections are mainly related to precipitation and temperature which may not completely reflect the interactions between snow glacier and streamflow increasing the uncertainty in streamflow change moreover land use soil and vegetation can also have a significant impact on streamflow babur et al 2020 li et al 2021a yang et al 2020 thus future studies would consider the combination of underlying surface and climate change to explore a comprehensive assessment of future streamflow furthermore with the intensified impact of climate change on the water cycle in alpine mountains the uncertainty of streamflow is more difficult to quantify because of the complexity of hydrological processes and the limitations of hydrological models therefore it is necessary to further explore high quality coupled hydrological models to reduce the uncertainty associated with traditional hydrological models 5 conclusions to deepen our understanding of future climate change and impact we accurately quantified the climate and streamflow changes and their contribution to the corresponding annual variations at different time scales the impact of climate variables on streamflow was explored using correlations from different periods to ensure that robust results the entire basin was projected to become warmer and wetter and the future streamflow was projected to increase owing to the significant increase in minimum temperature and precipitation in cold seasons the streamflow increments will have a positive contribution to the annual increment which is significant in spring especially in april and may with a significant increase in temperature 5 42 c in the late 21st century the appearance of peak streamflow will shift forward from may to april meanwhile with the increase in temperature increasing evapotranspiration will decrease the streamflow in summer which is significant in july overall the minimum temperature was inferred to play a dominant role in intra annual streamflow variation and its impact on streamflow in the short term was optimistic in the longer term it is necessary to slow the warming rate to ensure water resource security in inland basins such as the uhrb our study highlights the changes and contributions of climate and streamflow at multiple timescales in alpine regions which are helpful in assessing the relationship between climate change and streamflow for inland river basins although the projected dataset based on meteorological data and cmip6 gcms can explore the impacts and variation characteristics of climate change on streamflow future studies are required to improve the precision of the projected streamflow by considering other relevant factors and comprehensive hydrological models table 4 credit authorship contribution statement rui zhu conceptualization methodology software zhenliang yin

7840,study region upper reach of the heihe river basin uhrb study focus we quantified the potential changes in future climate and streamflow as well as their corresponding contribution to the annual variations and the dominant factors of streamflow change were explored in further robust multivariate bias correction was applied to correct the outputs of the general circulation method gcms before applying the climate projection the soil and water assessment tool model was applied to explore streamflow characteristics under the climate projection of bias corrected gcms under four representative emission scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 new hydrological insights for the region by the end of the 21st century climate will follow a warming and wetting trend within the basin the annual streamflow is projected to increase by 18 in the 2030 s and 36 in the 2050 s and 2090 s overall the minimum temperature had a positive impact on streamflow in the cold seasons especially in spring contributing the most to the annual streamflow increment when the temperature increase is greater than 5 42 c the peak streamflow will shift forward from may to april moreover evapotranspiration will increase with temperature leading to a decrease in summer streamflow the results enable us to better understand the climate and streamflow changes at different time scales and provide guidance for the development of climate change response strategies and water resource management planning graphical abstract the seasonal streamflow will significantly increase except for that in summer with the largest increase in spring contributing 38 1 59 5 to annual increment except for july and august the monthly streamflow is projected to increase especially significant in april and may with the continuous rise of temperature the intra annual streamflow curve will change from a unimodal in july pattern to a bimodal in april or may and july pattern the warmer temperature will cause the large increase of evapotranspiration leading to the summer streamflow decrease ga1 keywords climate change hydrological response cmip6 swat upper reach of heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow from alpine regions provides abundant water resources for numerous places worldwide ensuring socioeconomic development as well as ecosystem security su et al 2022 wang et al 2021 studies have reported that the streamflow in alpine regions is sensitive to climate change huntington 2006 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2020 the warmer climate has accelerated environmental changes such as glacier retreat yang et al 2019 and snow melt yan et al 2022 resulting in stronger spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hydrological processes ma and zhang 2022 yang et al 2020 and more uncertainties in streamflow li et al 2019 zhao et al 2019b for the inland river basins in northwest china agricultural development and ecosystems in the middle and lower basins depend on water resources from alpine regions che et al 2019 sun et al 2018 mountainous streamflow change will affect the rational utilisation of water resources and ultimately affect ecological environment protection and social development feng et al 2019 wang and cheng 2000 therefore accurate projection and quantitative analysis of streamflow changes in the alpine regions of inland river basins are vital for formulating climate change response strategies and refined water resource management ahmed et al 2022 in recent decades general circulation model gcm output data have been widely used for climate projections tan et al 2021 zhang and long 2021 lv et al 2022 the latest gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 provide reasonable projections of future climate by coupling social development scenarios and possible emission trends with climate modelling carvalho et al 2021 eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 however coarse resolution of the gcm makes it difficult to characterise the regional climate azmat et al 2020 shrestha et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to downscale and correct the bias to improve the accuracy of regional climate projections worku et al 2021 xu et al 2021 common methods for bias correction include mean and variance bias corrections quantile mapping and trend preserving bias correction which are simple and correct the bias by the individual variable at a single or specific time scale such as annually hao et al 2022 siqueira et al 2021 usman et al 2021 however these methods ignore the correlations between climate variables which often have strong regional characteristics di cecco and gouhier 2018 recently mehrotra and sharma 2021 successfully proved that robust multivariate bias correction rombc could better correct gcm outputs than classical quantile mapping because rombc considers the correlations among climate variables at different time scales daily monthly and annual scales moreover rombc can help gcms reproduce the same daily and annual distribution behaviour of precipitation as observations which could reduce the precipitation uncertainty and enhance the reliability for hydrological simulations in mountainous regions therefore a bias correction method with multiple variables will improve the accuracy of climate and hydrological process evaluation mehrotra and sharma 2015 sa adi et al 2020 hydrological models such as hbv vic mikeshe and soil and water assessment tool swat are the main tools for depicting changes in the hydrological processes and water balance in response to climate change in watersheds costa et al 2021 devia et al 2015 gao et al 2019 mendonça et al 2018 the swat model has been widely applied in hydrological process simulations owing to its user friendly operation and reliable physical mechanisms näschen et al 2019 sharma et al 2022 tan et al 2021 for example yin et al 2016 used swat to quantify the change in water balance in the mountainous region of northwest china xuan et al 2021 analysed the responses of runoff components to future climate change in the yarlung zangbo river basin using the swat model shukla et al 2021 applied the swat model to predict that future streamflow will increase in the western himalaya owing to climate change these results suggest that swat can accurately simulate hydrological processes over mountainous regions the upper reach of the heihe river basin uhrb located in the northeastern tibetan plateau is an important water resource that maintains the middle oasis and lower desert plains of the hexi corridor china feng et al 2019 li et al 2018 yao et al 2018 previous studies have analysed the impact of climate change on streamflow in detail li et al 2018 liu et al 2022 but they have focussed on specific time scales such as monthly and annual scales considering the sensitivity of climate and streamflow in alpine regions to global warming their response might accumulate over time thus more climate and streamflow studies should link the intra annual change to annual variation therefore this study aimed to analyse the characteristics of climate and streamflow change from multiple perspectives in the uhrb the main objective of this study was to quantitatively analyse the change in trends of future climate and potential streamflow response at different time scales monthly seasonal interannual and periodical as well as the dominant factors for streamflow variation seven cmip6 gcms and four classical emission scenarios were selected as future climate scenarios and swat was applied to simulate hydrological processes under them the obtained future climate and streamflow under each scenario were compared with observation to evaluate the possible trends and ranges the results provide a reference for further exploration of the impact of regional climate change on streamflow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china the heihe river originates from the qilian mountains and flows into the juyan lake the main stream is 821 km long and the basin area is 130 000 km2 yin et al 2016 the uhrb is situated in the middle part of the northern qilian mountains between longitudes 98 102 e and latitudes 37 40 n providing 90 of the water resources for oasis ecosystems in the middle and lower areas of the hrb li et al 2021c yang et al 2020 in the uhrb the terrain is high in the southwest and low in the northeast with elevations of 1637 5062 m both vegetation landscapes and soil types demonstrate significant vertical zonality which vary with increasing altitude the vegetation landscapes include shrub grassland at lower altitudes of 2500 m forest grassland at 2500 3300 m alpine grassland at 3300 3800 m and sparse vegetation at higher altitude above 4000 m li et al 2021c yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a similarly the soil types include felty soils in shrub forests dark felty soils in grasslands and frozen frigid soils in glacial areas the regional climatic is typical continental semi arid type with rare precipitation in cold winters and abundant precipitation in hot summers which are controlled by the westerly circulation zhang et al 2019 owing to its special geographic location the annual average temperature is 2 c and the annual average precipitation is 450 mm which increases from west to east as well as with elevation yin et al 2018 2 2 meteorological and hydrological data the meteorological and hydrological data used in this study were divided into observed and projected data daily observed climate variable data from 1971 to 2018 were obtained from four national meteorological stations located in and around the study area yeniugou yng qilian ql tuole tl and zhangye zy as references to assess the ability of gcms for reflecting the historical climate scenario the climatic variables include precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin relative humidity sunshine duration and wind speed the observed monthly streamflow during 1971 2018 was collected at the outlet of the uhrb i e the yingluoxia gauging station ylx as a reference to evaluate the calibration and validation ability of swat for depicting the hydrological process exact locations of the meteorological and gauging stations are shown in fig 1 the projected data of daily climate variables were obtained from the gcms in the scenariomip which is the primary activity of cmip6 and provides climate projections based on alternative scenarios o neill et al 2016 the alternative scenarios are the combination of the representative concentration pathways rcps and the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps which are known to provide reasonable climate projections under the composite scenario of climate and socio economic change o neill et al 2016 yang et al 2020 in this study four representative ssp rcp paths were used to describe the climate scenario from sustainable to fossil fuel development table 1 considering that a higher resolution could better capture the climate heterogeneity in complex terrain seven available gcms table 2 with grid cells smaller than 2 2 in cmip6 were selected which had completed the historical 1850 2014 and future 2015 2100 projection of six climate variables involved in the hydrological simulation because the spatial resolution of different models is inconsistent the data were interpolated to 0 5 0 5 grid cells using the bilinear method which is widely applied in remapping climate models fan et al 2022 ying et al 2022 to verify the corrected simulation in cmip6 with observed data grid points closest to the meteorological stations were selected for comparison 2 3 methods 2 3 1 robust multivariate bias correction rombc rombc was applied because it corrects the bias based on the correlation among climate variables at multiple timescales mehrotra and sharma 2021 sarhadi et al 2016 the older version of this method named mbc was adopted to successfully correct the bias and provide accurate climate projections for northwestern china by yin et al 2020 the statistical relations of correction were established using the observed data and historical gcm data the evolution of the model structure was divided into two parts from univariate to multivariate and from one time scale to the next first statistical methods were applied to formulate the base corrected series between the observed and gcm data which are essential to correct the bias in daily distribution and variability at higher timescales including monthly seasonal and annual time scales second rombc checked the necessity and applicability of bias correction for dependence attributes at different time scales to identify a suitable structure for bias correction for a specific time scale at each time scale autocorrelation of the variables was considered first followed by mutual their dependence third rombc modified the daily time series to incorporate correction at all time scales by aggregating the bias corrected time series to higher time scales and assessing the optimal model a detailed description of rombc related to data processing is available in mehrotra et al 2018 and mehrotra and sharma 2021 the major equations of rombc are as follows 1 y y m i v g c y ˆ m i v g c μ m v g c σ m v h σ m v g c μ m v g c 2 y m i v g f y ˆ m i v g f μ m v g f σ m v h σ m v g c μ m v g f where μ m v g c and μ m v g f are means of the current and future climate time series σ m v h is the standard deviation of the observed climate time series and σ m v g c is the standard deviation of the current climate time series similarly y ˆ m i v g c and y m i v g c and y ˆ m i v g f and y m i v g f are monthly time series before and after standard deviation correction for the current and future climate unless otherwise stated the superscript g stands for bias corrected series and subscripts v for climate variables t for day m for month s for season and i for year 3 z v t m s i g m v m s i g m v m s i g s v s i g s v s i g a v i g a v i g z v t m s i g where z v t m s i g m v m s i g s v s i g and a v i g are the daily monthly seasonal and annual corrected values m v m s i g s v s i g and a v i g are the aggregated values corresponding to monthly seasonal and annual simulations respectively z v t m s i g is the daily time series of climate variables and t stands for day in time series to reduce uncertainty from a single gcm and enhance the reliability of projections from several gcms the multi model ensembles methods have been widely applied ahmed et al 2019 tian et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 and the multi model ensembles mean is a simple and effective method that has been successfully used in studies on climate projection li et al 2021a liu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 we calculated the ensemble mean from seven corrected gcms to represent future climate conditions in the uhrb 2 3 2 swat model and set up swat is a physical process based semi distributed hydrological model developed by the agricultural research service in 1990 which accurately simulates the complicated interactions of natural indicators and water resources tamm et al 2018 tan et al 2021 since the late 1990 s swat has been widely applied to assess the impact of climate change on water supply demand and quality rosenberg et al 1999 swat divides the entire watershed into several sub basins according to topography and river network distribution and further into hydrological response units hrus based on the distribution of soil land use and slope the total runoff was accurately estimated by applying the water balance principle to calculate the water yield at each hru yang et al 2020 the water balance principle is as follows 4 sw t sw 0 i 1 t p day q surf e a w seep q gw where sw t represents the total soil water content mm sw o represents the initial soil water content on day i mm t represents the simulated days p day represents the quantity of precipitation on day i mm q surf represents the quantity of surface runoff on day i mm e a represents the quantity of evapotranspiration on day i mm w seep represents the amount of water entering the vadose zone through the soil profile on day i mm and q gw denotes the return flow on day i mm in high altitude watersheds snow melting is an important component of runoff recharge for p day we calculated both liquid rainfall and solid snowfall precipitation in the model a threshold temperature was defined to distinguish precipitation as rainfall or snowfall if the mean daily temperature was higher than the threshold temperature the precipitation within the hrus was directly classified as rainfall otherwise it was classified as snowfall and added to the snow pack and the snow melting can be expressed as follows 5 snow mlt h mlt snow cov t snow t mx 2 t mlt where snow mlt is the amount of snow melting on a given day mm h2o h mlt is the melt factor for the day mm h2o day c snow cov is the fraction of the hru area covered by snow t snow is the snowpack temperature on a given day c and t mlt is the base temperature above which snow melt is allowed c considering the impact of altitude on precipitation and temperature the model enables sub basins to be divided according to elevation bands which facilitates the adjustment of the spatial heterogeneity of climate variables cao et al 2022 ur rahman et al 2020 in this study five elevation bands were defined for each subbasin evapotranspiration is the primary way of water removal from the watershed an accurate evapotranspiration estimate is critical for the hydrological process evaluation thus the penman monteith method with physical mechanism was applied and the equation can be written as follows 6 λ e h net g ρ air c p e z o e z r a γ 1 r c r a where λ e is the latent heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 e is the depth rate evaporation mm d 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 h net is the net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is the heat flux density to the ground mj m 2 d 1 ρ air is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat at constant pressure mj kg 1 c 1 e z o is the saturation vapour pressure of air at height z kpa e z is the water vapour pressure of air at height z kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r c is the plant canopy resistance s m 1 and r a is the diffusion resistance of aerodynamic resistance s m 1 2 3 3 calibration and validation of the swat model we simulated hydrological processes based on the daily data of meteorological stations during 1971 2018 a monthly streamflow of 38 years 1981 2018 was used to evaluate the model performance the traditional split sample approach in hydrological simulation adopts older data for calibration and newer data for validation and then predicts the future myers et al 2021 recently shen et al 2022 pointed out that this practice should be avoided as it causes inferior model performance in the testing period in this study the time period 1971 1980 was used as warm up period and initial condition to eliminate the initial bias adib et al 2020 ur rahman et al 2020 the recent 18 years of available data 2001 2018 were completely used for calibration while the earlier 20 years of data 1981 2000 were used for validation although the results of shen et al 2022 suggested skipping the validation the step was conducted to ensure that the modelling results were reliable the selected calibration parameters were based on the current climate change and its impact on streamflow therefore we expected that the same parameter scheme for validation may overestimate streamflow change thirteen sensitive parameters related to streamflow were selected for model calibration table 3 and have been proven to be suitable for reproducing hydrological processes in the uhrb yang et al 2020 yin et al 2016 several evaluation coefficients were selected to assess the model performance comprising the coefficient of determination r2 relative bias in percent pbias and nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse r2 is applied to present the fitting level between the simulation and observation in the historical period pbias can evaluate the bias size of simulation relative to the observation nse is applied to assess the simulation level of the hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relevant formulas are as follow 7 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 8 pbias i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 9 nse 1 t 1 n y i x i 2 t 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i are the simulated and observed streamflow respectively while x and y are the corresponding averages of the simulated and observed values and n is the length of time typically the model performs better if pbias is smaller and closer to 0 while the r2 or nse is larger and closer to 1 golmohammadi et al 2014 2 3 4 contribution rates we used the intra annual contribution to better understand the variation of regional climate and hydrological processes the formula is as follows 10 cr i t f i t o i t f i a o i a 100 where f i t and o i t are the projected and observed data of variable i at a specific time scale t monthly or seasonal scale respectively and f i a and o i a are the annual averages of the corresponding variable i the value of cr i t was high and the closer it was to 1 the greater was the contribution of the corresponding time scale moreover the four seasons were spring march april may summer june july august autumn september october november and winter december january february 3 results 3 1 bias correction and streamflow simulation 3 1 1 bias correction performance precision of the climate projection varied with application of the bias correction fig 2 the distances between the observation and projection were inversely proportional to the precision for example before the correction the distances between observation and projection were relatively far for precipitation indicating that the gcm projection might underestimate monthly precipitation the distances reduced after correction with the greatest reduction in precipitation indicating that bias correction largely improved the precision of precipitation projection which is significant for mountainous regions where precipitation has a large uncertainty moreover the corrected tmax and tmin values also moved closer to the observations confirming the ability of rombc to reduce the bias in gcms which is significant for projections to accurately capture the climate characteristics in mountainous regions 3 1 2 performance of streamflow simulation the best streamflow simulation had nse 0 91 and fitted well with the observation fig 3a and 3b high nse values indicate that the results of the model simulation met the well level according to the performance classification of moriasi et al 2007 positive pbias values indicated that the average tendency of the simulation slightly overestimated the observed streamflow which was within a reasonable range furthermore the scatter points in the calibration and validation were distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line and the values of r2 were the same as those of nse fig 3c the higher the r2 value the better is the simulated hydrological process furthermore the detailed results showed that swat could capture some peak flow events from june to august which confirms that swat is an excellent tool for accurately representing the hydrological process in mountainous regions 3 2 projection of future climate change and streamflow responses 3 2 1 projected precipitation change until the end of this century the annual precipitation is projected to increase at rates of 4 84 6 19 5 51 and 12 04 mm 10a under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively fig 4a at the seasonal scale the increase in precipitation in summer will be the highest 18 85 27 97 mm contributing the most 30 to the annual precipitation increase while the corresponding values in winter will be the least 4 58 9 43 mm 11 44 fig 5a at the monthly scale some months january april and october december will have less increment but high increment rate relative to the baseline 2 13 4 67 mm 70 39 while the opposite will be true for july september 6 95 10 07 mm 17 38 indicating that future monthly precipitation will significantly increase in cold seasons while that in warm seasons will increase relatively less fig 6a the precipitation increments in september will contribute the most to the annual increments but their contributions will decrease from 22 01 to 14 69 from low to high emission scenarios while those in april will increase from 5 67 to 9 33 fig 7a 3 2 2 projected temperature change the annual tmax tmin will rise by 1 27 c 1 08 c 3 13 c 2 30 c 4 58 c 3 98 c and 5 88 c 4 67 c under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively indicating that temperature will increase with radiative forcing and the increase in annual tmax will be higher than those in tmin furthermore the differences in tmax change among the emission scenarios will not be significant until 2040 figs 4b and 4c at the seasonal scale both the tmax and tmin increments in summer will contribute the most to the annual tmax and tmin increments under low emission scenarios however the tmin increments in winter will be greater than those in summer and the corresponding contribution to the annual tmin increments will be the largest under higher emission scenarios fig 5b and c basically the monthly tmax and tmin increments and the contribution rates to the annual tmax and tmin increments will be least in march 1 39 3 24 c 6 11 6 41 and highest in august 2 63 4 93 c 10 45 11 6 however under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the increments of tmin in november and december will up to 5 41 c and their contributions to the annual tmin increment will far exceed those of other months causing significant impacts on seasonal and annual tmin figs 6b 6c 7b and 7c 3 2 3 future streamflow responses although the increases in annual precipitation and temperature showed significant differences among the climate scenarios the difference in the future annual streamflow was not obvious with an increase ranging from 32 38 to 40 30 compared to the baseline fig 4d at the seasonal scale the streamflow was projected to increase except for summer with highest increments in spring 85 91 155 43 and most contribution 38 11 54 95 to the annual streamflow increments notably although summer precipitation will increase significantly 9 61 14 34 the streamflow will decrease slightly 1 74 2 48 relative to the baseline indicating that the large recharge of precipitation might be offset by the others fig 5d in general heavy precipitation in july and august often promotes a peak monthly streamflow however the distributions of future monthly streamflow will follow a bimodal curve with one peak around july and the other in may in this case the streamflow increments in may will contribute the most to the annual streamflow increment 25 unexpectedly although the precipitation increments in july were obvious its peak streamflow was projected to decrease relative to the baseline contributing negatively to annual streamflow increments moreover the contributions of changing streamflow in april will increase significantly while the contributions in may and june will decrease with rising radiative forcing fig 6d and fig 7d to further explore the distribution characteristics of the monthly streamflow in response to climate change the long periods were divided into three phases including 2021 2040 2030 s 2041 2060 2050 s and 2081 2100 2090 s because of the continuous influence of precipitation changes and accumulated temperature the increasing streamflow in later years is larger for example the increasing streamflow in the 2090 s is approximately twice as high as the baseline table 3 interestingly although the streamflow distributions exhibit monthly bimodal curves the first peak streamflow appears change with the radiative forcing indicating that the monthly streamflow is affected differently by climate change in different scenarios basically the first peak streamflow will appear in may with a significant increase of more than double the baseline however as the radiative forcing increases to a higher state the increasing rates of streamflow in may will decline over time which is especially significant in the 2090 s when this occurs the appearing time of peak streamflow will shift from may to april fig 8l 4 discussion 4 1 assessment of bias correction and streamflow simulation based on the observed data and the cmip6 dataset we assessed and quantitatively analysed the potential trends of future climate and streamflow responses at different time scales including monthly seasonal interannual and periodical scale in the uhrb before applying the gcms to analyse climate characteristics their outputs were corrected using the rombc method the correlations and standard deviations of the corrected outputs and the observed data were observed to be enhanced by 0 5 13 67 and 45 52 31 09 respectively indicating that rombc can effectively reduce the bias and enhance the reliability for gcm projection although streamflow in mountainous areas is less influenced by human activities the hydrological process might change differently owing to sensitive climate change high altitude and other regional characteristics this study applied the swat model to simulate streamflow in the uhrb and the calibration and validation results were consistent with those of previous studies in this region for example both nse and r2 were 0 91 and the pbias was 2 in the calibration and validation periods which were close to the results of lu et al 2015 nse and r2 0 81 0 94 and pbias 2 the results from both bias correction and hydrological modelling suggest that using gcms to estimate the potential changes in streamflow in response to climate change is feasible the results enable us to better understand the variability and differences in climate and streamflow changes at different time scales and provide guidance for the development of climate change response strategies and water resource management planning 4 2 impact of climate change on streamflow previous studies have confirmed that the average temperature and annual precipitation in northwest china have increased by 2 6 mm 10a and 0 28 c 10a over the past 50 years li et al 2021b in this study the future rising rates were estimated to be larger than 5 51 mm 10a in precipitation and higher than 0 29 c 10a in temperature in uhrb except for the ssp1 2 6 which indicates that the warming wetting phenomenon in mountainous regions may become increasingly obvious with time chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 sun et al 2013 in this context we explored the impact of precipitation and temperature on streamflow on a monthly scale from 2021 to 2100 by spearman correlation analysis across all climate scenarios the peak streamflow in may was mainly affected by the combined impact of precipitation and temperature change fig 9 the positive correlation of precipitation and streamflow was generally significant and greater than that of temperature indicating that streamflow changes in may would be dominated by an increase in precipitation interestingly the tmin in may correlated positively with streamflow especially in the 2030 s and 2050 s indicating that rising tmin will promote an increase in streamflow in near future fig s3 it is likely that the warmer tmin will have an indirect impact on streamflow promoting the earlier conversion of snowfall to rainfall thus enriching streamflow recharge pellicciotti et al 2010 however we also observed that the positive impacts of tmin on streamflow will clearly shift if the rising tmin exceeds a certain threshold because the accumulated increase in temperature may promote earlier melting thus affecting the distribution of intra annual streamflow azmat et al 2020 xu et al 2021 for example when the monthly average tmin increments were 5 42 c ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 the streamflow in may and the positive impact of tmin would decline whereas the streamflow in april and the positive impact of tmin would increase significantly and become a new peak in the 2090s fig 8 s2 and s3 however this result is slightly different from the conclusions of su et al 2016 with intra annual streamflow remaining practically unchanged for all monsoon dominated basins this may be due to the differences in the study areas our study only focused on the northeastern tibetan plateau whereas su et al 2016 primarily focused on the major upstream region in the southern tibetan plateau moreover the streamflow in july and august had significant negative correlations with tmax and tmin which was much larger than the significant positive correlation with precipitation indicating that the decrease in streamflow in summer was highly related to temperature previous studies in alpine regions have confirmed that under the combined effect of precipitation and temperature increase the decrease in alpine streamflow in summer is due to the large increase in evapotranspiration which will offset and exceed the streamflow recharge hao et al 2022 kopytkovskiy et al 2015 moraga et al 2021 additionally we observed that streamflow will increase in cold seasons spring and winter which is similar to the results in mountainous watersheds in switzerland and the upper colorado etter et al 2017 kopytkovskiy et al 2015 the positive impacts of tmax and tmin were higher than those of precipitation from january april and september december especially significant in april and september it is likely that the rising temperature not only boosts the conversion of snowfall but also results in an earlier snowmelt flood peak and permafrost degradation which increases the streamflow in cold seasons chen et al 2018 li et al 2019 li et al 2018 confirmed that early melting could alleviate the spring drought in this region benefitting both agriculture in the midstream area and natural ecosystems in the downstream area however chen et al 2016 pointed out that the snow ice day would be delayed and end earlier owing to the warmer temperature which likely impacts the accumulation of solid water this means that while optimistic in the short term the positive impact of increased streamflow due to warming is limited in the long run overall the future changes in both precipitation and temperature will significantly impact alpine streamflow and the changes in tmin will play a dominant role in intra annual streamflow and should be paid attention in inland river basins chen et al 2018 and yang et al 2022 pointed out that rising temperatures will lead to the disappearance of small sized glaciers and the increase of snowmelt streamflow in the uhrb if global warming continues to impact the uhrb its water balance will be affected showing streamflow increase with an early peak in spring and decrease in summer and definitely amplify the crisis of regional water resources consequently threatening the natural environment and the sustainable development of human society you et al 2017 have reported that floods droughts and other disasters caused by climate change have occurred more often in recent years on the tibetan plateau zhao et al 2019b projected that 50 of the glacier area in the five catchments of the tibetan plateau would decline until the end of this century yao et al 2022 confirmed that the balance in the asian water tower has been broken by the accelerated transformation of ice and snow into liquid water therefore to avoid the aggravation of climate change and water resource crises it is necessary to implement policies to combat climate change in this region taking immediate measures to slow the increasing rate of regional temperature will help slow down the melting rate of glacial snow in spring and winter and maintain steady summer streamflow change to avoid the occurrence of floods or droughts which is significant for water resource security in inland basins 4 3 uncertainty limitation and future prospects uncertainties are inevitable in climate change projection and hydrological modelling studies in this study the major uncertainties were attributed to climate projections correction methods and hydrological simulations to understand the level of uncertainty in the results rather than to quantify the specific uncertainty we explored the range of possible variations in the results using shading and error bars we observed that the uncertainty ranges of the climate variables were narrower than those of the streamflow and especially significant in spring and summer it is possible that the superposition of projected uncertainties of precipitation temperature and hydrological process increase the uncertainty of the streamflow simulation additionally precipitation and temperature are sensitive to altitude in mountainous regions of china the uneven spatial distribution of meteorological stations in the uhrb may affect the observations of actual climate which further influence the bias corrected results of climate projections therefore high resolution remote sensing data can be used as a supplement to recognise the features of climatic variables in the future although the hydrological simulation accuracy has reached a reliable level our streamflow projections are mainly related to precipitation and temperature which may not completely reflect the interactions between snow glacier and streamflow increasing the uncertainty in streamflow change moreover land use soil and vegetation can also have a significant impact on streamflow babur et al 2020 li et al 2021a yang et al 2020 thus future studies would consider the combination of underlying surface and climate change to explore a comprehensive assessment of future streamflow furthermore with the intensified impact of climate change on the water cycle in alpine mountains the uncertainty of streamflow is more difficult to quantify because of the complexity of hydrological processes and the limitations of hydrological models therefore it is necessary to further explore high quality coupled hydrological models to reduce the uncertainty associated with traditional hydrological models 5 conclusions to deepen our understanding of future climate change and impact we accurately quantified the climate and streamflow changes and their contribution to the corresponding annual variations at different time scales the impact of climate variables on streamflow was explored using correlations from different periods to ensure that robust results the entire basin was projected to become warmer and wetter and the future streamflow was projected to increase owing to the significant increase in minimum temperature and precipitation in cold seasons the streamflow increments will have a positive contribution to the annual increment which is significant in spring especially in april and may with a significant increase in temperature 5 42 c in the late 21st century the appearance of peak streamflow will shift forward from may to april meanwhile with the increase in temperature increasing evapotranspiration will decrease the streamflow in summer which is significant in july overall the minimum temperature was inferred to play a dominant role in intra annual streamflow variation and its impact on streamflow in the short term was optimistic in the longer term it is necessary to slow the warming rate to ensure water resource security in inland basins such as the uhrb our study highlights the changes and contributions of climate and streamflow at multiple timescales in alpine regions which are helpful in assessing the relationship between climate change and streamflow for inland river basins although the projected dataset based on meteorological data and cmip6 gcms can explore the impacts and variation characteristics of climate change on streamflow future studies are required to improve the precision of the projected streamflow by considering other relevant factors and comprehensive hydrological models table 4 credit authorship contribution statement rui zhu conceptualization methodology software zhenliang yin

7841,study region australia study focus our incomplete knowledge of groundwater systems and processes imposes barriers in attempting to manage groundwater sustainably challenges also arise through complex institutional arrangements and decision making processes and the difficulty in involving stakeholders in some areas these difficulties have led to water table decline and impacts on groundwater users and groundwater dependent ecosystems however there is potential to improve the sustainable use of groundwater resources through improvements in management practices we discuss some of the challenges and present survey results of research government and industry professionals across the groundwater sector in australia new hydrological insights for the region the highest ranked challenge identified in the survey was the difficulty in determining regional scale volumetric water extraction limits this is surprising given the criticism in the international literature of volumetric based approaches for groundwater management and the decreased reliance on this approach in australia and elsewhere in recent years other major challenges are the difficulty in determining and implementing maximum drawdown criteria for groundwater levels determining water needs of ecosystems and managing groundwater impacts on surface water notwithstanding these gaps in technical understanding and tools and a lack of resources for groundwater studies improvements in stakeholder communication should enable more effective decision making and improve compliance with regulations designed to protect groundwater and dependent ecosystems graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater management sustainability research gaps implementation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the last 50 years have seen large increases in global groundwater extraction principally driven by population growth gleeson et al 2012 margat and van der gun 2013 in australia groundwater use increased from approximately 2 6 109 m3 y 1 in 1983 1984 to 4 2 109 m3 y 1 in 1996 1997 nlwra 2001 mostly driven by an increase in irrigation water use fairweather et al 2003 by 2015 2016 groundwater use had increased to approximately 5 0 109 m3 y 1 barnett et al 2020 partly driven by restrictions on surface water extraction approximately 70 of groundwater used is for agricultural or pastoral purposes predominantly irrigation with the remainder used to support mining activities and for domestic and town water supplies in many areas of australia widespread groundwater extraction for irrigation of crops commenced before sophisticated groundwater management regimes were in place indeed the slow response times of many groundwater systems can allow unsustainable extraction rates to exist for a period of time before significant impacts are observed either on users or on dependent ecosystems this has created challenges where management approaches have been imposed on extraction systems that have already been established in australia major policy developments in the mid 1990 s led the way for improvements in groundwater management including attempts to return unsustainable extraction regimes to sustainable levels doolan 2016 significant developments have included widespread recognition of the importance of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes from the late 1990 s hatton and evans 1998 a coordinated approach to bore rehabilitation to reduce uncontrolled groundwater loss in the great artesian basin from 2000 gabcc 2000 and limits on groundwater pumping in some areas of the murray darling basin from 2012 see box 1 despite major steps forward in groundwater management pressure on groundwater resources has continued reinforcing the need to manage groundwater extraction to ensure the future sustainability of the resource increasing evidence globally of groundwater depletion and environmental impact gorelick and zheng 2015 de graaf et al 2019 suggests either that groundwater use has reached unsustainable levels and or that our current management approaches are not producing the best outcomes for the resource the assumption of the current paper is that there is room for improvement in how we are managing groundwater both in australia and globally the first step towards improved groundwater management and the focus of this paper is an assessment of where the problems lie while several recent studies have considered research opportunities in hydrogeology and related disciplines e g miller and gray 2008 blöschl et al 2019 kreamer et al 2021 few have directly addressed management challenges barber et al 1995 convened a series of meetings with hydrogeological researchers and managers to identify priority water issues in australia and the research and development needed to address these national challenges lowry et al 2003 identified 28 gaps that were thought to be hindering effective management of groundwater systems in new zealand their analysis was based on surveys and discussions with groundwater managers and they identified gaps in information implementation and technological and management tools as well as the understanding of fundamental processes our approach is similar to that of barber et al 1995 and lowry et al 2003 although more targeted as we focus on groundwater quantity management and water allocations we only consider groundwater quality issues that are directly affected by groundwater extraction we therefore do not consider contamination of groundwater from anthropogenic sources such as leaching of pesticides and nitrates or urban and industrial contamination li et al 2021 these are usually managed separately from water allocation either through licensing of discharge and safety protocols or through land use controls and remediation also we do not consider water management issues related to high water tables water logging and dryland salinity e g ghassemi et al 1995 these issues often take precedence in areas of poorer groundwater quality where there is less demand for groundwater rather we focus on groundwater allocation issues and discuss the main impediments to improving sustainable groundwater quantity management in this context we also present the findings from a survey of government employees private industry and the research community the focus is on australian conditions but we expect that many of the issues are universally applicable 2 background a thorough discussion of groundwater allocation management and legislation in australia is beyond the scope of the current paper but a very brief introduction is presented here so that the following discussion of challenges and opportunities can be more readily understood more detailed information can be found in nelson and quevauviller 2016 gardner et al 2017 rohde et al 2017 and rinaudo et al 2020 each of the six australian states and two territories fig 1 allocates groundwater under its own water legislation gardner et al 2017 the federal i e national government also influences groundwater management in some areas most notably within the murray darling basin which spans several states fig 1 and box 1 and in the assessment of unconventional gas developments 1 1 https federalfinancialrelations gov au sites federalfinancialrelations gov au files 2021 01 coal seam gas mining devel np pdf however while there are some differences in approaches between the different jurisdictions and between management areas within the jurisdictions there are many similarities in 2016 there were 288 groundwater management areas in australia covering approximately 75 of the continent of these 136 had volumetric limits on extraction barnett et al 2020 these limits impose upper bounds on the total volume of water that can be taken from the management areas for irrigation water supply and commercial and industrial uses stock and domestic users are excluded from these calculations and new applications are only permitted if the limits are not exceeded some management areas have subzones with their own volumetric limits water trading is often permitted once these regional or subzone limits are reached wheeler et al 2016 and this enables access for new users areas with high rates of groundwater use often use numerical groundwater models for predicting impacts of groundwater extraction e g namoi river alluvium nsw government 2019 walker et al 2020 these models are sometimes used to assess individual licence applications for very large water volumes but it is generally considered too costly to run these models for all licence applications simpler analytical approaches such as analytical pumping test solutions are also sometimes used to assess potential impacts of new licences applications can be refused if the estimated drawdown at ecosystems or existing bores exceeds a threshold value in some areas when management plans were first developed regional limits were set equal to the total water extraction at that time barnett and williamson 2020 since meters were often not in place the total extraction was sometimes estimated from irrigated areas and nominal irrigation rates for different crop types in other areas extraction limits for unconfined aquifers were set equal to the volume of recharge a practice referred to as safe yield in recent years increased recognition that extraction equal to recharge does not prevent impacts on gdes bredehoeft 1997 devlin and sophocleous 2005 means that it is now more common to allocate a fraction of recharge with the remaining volume representing a notional allocation to the environment and or conservative factor that acknowledges uncertainty of our knowledge the groundwater system meyland 2011 mdba 2020 the fraction reserved for the environment can be as high as 100 of recharge in areas with high value assets nsw government 2016 but 20 30 is more common walker et al 2020 in some cases groundwater models are also used for setting regional extraction limits pierce et al 2020 in areas with very low rates of recharge the extraction limit may be deliberately set above the recharge rate thus permitting gradual mining of the resource the northern territory water allocation planning framework links extraction limits to groundwater storage rather than recharge rates for the arid zone depws 2020 for alice springs town water supply for example groundwater extraction of 1 3 107 m3 y 1 is licenced from aquifers with an annual recharge of only 7 5 105 m3 y 1 dlrm 2016 local management rules are designed to address impacts that cannot be adequately managed using volumetric limits they include buffer zones that exclude groundwater pumping completely although licences that pre date delineation of buffer zones are usually allowed to continue or regulate pumping depending on proximity to ecosystems or other groundwater users in some cases the distance that a bore needs to be from a gde or other groundwater user is not fixed but rather varies in proportion to the volume of the water licence northern and yorke natural resources management board 2009 groundwater response triggers are another form of local management rule and use actual groundwater observations e g maximum drawdown or salinity value at key observation bores to control rates of groundwater extraction e g goulburn murray water 2017 actions following exceedance of trigger values might include temporary or permanent reductions in licenced allocations for some or all groundwater users it is now becoming more common for jurisdictions to use an adaptive management approach by announcing allocations annually based on groundwater quantity or quality observations e g eyre peninsula natural resources management board 2016 announced allocations usually take the form of a percentage of the licenced volume that can be extracted and have proven to be more palatable than permanent reductions in licenced allocations pierce et al 2020 in most states and territories legislation gives the minister responsible for water resources broad powers to consider environmental issues and resource condition in setting water allocations and to attach conditions to licences to extract water most state and territory legislation also provides for stakeholder consultation for example through advisory bodies active in the water planning process stakeholder consultation in decision making about issuing and trading allocations and entitlements is less common gardner et al 2017 a recent development is legal provisions requiring special consideration of and consultation with first nations australians in water planning mdbc 2004 nelson r 2022 productivity commission australia 2021 3 methods the collective experience of the authors of this paper supplemented by discussions with groundwater experts in research institutions governments and private industry enabled the identification of 18 primary challenges which need to be overcome to optimally manage groundwater extraction rates a survey of groundwater professionals was then conducted where participants were asked to score the challenges on a scale of 1 5 with 1 being not an impediment and 5 being a major impediment fractional scores were not permitted respondents were also invited to make comments on impediments and list additional impediments or challenges the survey was distributed through the quarterly newsletter of the national centre for groundwater research and training and with direct emails to key groundwater agencies and was open for a period of eight weeks respondents came from state and federal government agencies research institutions universities and csiro and private industry primarily engineering consulting firms and mining companies a total of 95 responses were received from the australian groundwater community of these 35 of respondents 33 responses were from state government 25 24 responses were from private industry 21 20 responses were from research institutions 17 16 responses were from the federal government department of agriculture water and the environment office of water science and geoscience australia and 2 2 responses were from other organisations 1 from local government and 1 unspecified 42 of respondents identified as having more than 20 years of experience 31 as having between 10 and 20 years of experience 24 as less than 10 years of experience and 3 did not complete this question for each challenge we present the percent of respondents who ranked it within each of the different categories and calculate an average score thus an average score of 1 means that all respondents rated the challenge as not an impediment and an average score of 5 means that all respondents rated the challenge as a major impediment the average score would be 3 0 if exactly half the respondents rated the challenge as not an impediment and half rated the challenge as a major impediment although of course an average score of three could also be arrived at in other ways the average score is analysed for all respondents and for the different groundwater sectors i e state government federal government research organisations and private industry statistical two sided t tests are used to assess significance of differences between responses from the different groundwater sectors 4 results the eighteen challenges identified by the authors through their collective experience and discussions with industry professionals are listed in fig 2 where they are also grouped into seven subject areas across all challenges and respondents 28 of responses were a score of 5 major impediment 31 were 4 26 were 3 13 were 2 and 2 were 1 not an impediment fig 3 the average score for each challenge ranged between 3 3 and 4 1 fig 4 indicating that all surveyed issues represented impediments of some concern the average score across all challenges and respondents was 3 70 in general respondents from research organisations were the most concerned average score across all challenges of 3 92 followed by those from federal government 3 86 state government 3 59 and private industry 3 52 the nature of the different impediments and their individual scores from survey responses are discussed below within the subject areas differences in the responses between the groundwater sectors are represented in fig 5 4 1 groundwater characterisation and data availability if groundwater decision making is evidence based then good decision making relies on the amount and quality of information that is used for the decision making process in australia the intensity of groundwater development largely determines the spatial coverage of monitoring networks fig 6 large sedimentary basins alluvial aquifers areas of high population density and regions of high economic interest large scale irrigated agriculture oil and gas extraction mining operations often have higher data density than areas where groundwater may only support small communities e g hard rock geology areas with low population density monitoring may be available over long periods of time sometimes multiple decades but periods of network rationalisation and cost cutting have led to incomplete monitoring data for many bores and sometimes to an overall reduction in monitoring programs fig 7 groundwater infrastructure is aging skm 2012 and failed or damaged monitoring bores are not always replaced also a more sophisticated understanding of groundwater systems cannot necessarily be delivered simply with denser monitoring networks and often requires targeted studies into processes such as recharge and discharge leakage between aquifers and water requirements of gdes these studies are often conducted at small spatial scales and are not uniformly available across different groundwater management areas while national maps of groundwater attributes have been developed either by extrapolating data from site specific studies e g recharge leaney et al 2011 or from remote sensing e g gdes doody et al 2017 national maps often lack precision and detail in local areas there are cases where monitoring networks have been extended and financial resources provided due to a strict environmental regulatory framework around for example extensive extraction of mineral resources unconventional gas extraction in the surat basin which underlies part of the great artesian basin fig 1 is a good example of this development where stakeholder pressure on politicians drove investment to improve the understanding of recharge groundwater flow and inter aquifer connectivity habermehl 2020 radke and ransley 2020 vink et al 2020 however many areas have not benefitted from such programs and limited resources for groundwater investigations was ranked 2nd overall as an impediment to sustainable groundwater management fig 4 and highest by researchers and state government survey respondents fig 5 difficulties in managing groundwater in data poor areas was ranked 11th overall but more highly by respondents from state and federal governments and research organisations fig 5 problems can also arise when data sets are split between different agencies fundamental groundwater data stratigraphy bore construction hydraulic head major ion chemistry are available in state and territory databases which are publicly available and user friendly sharples et al 2020 the bureau of meteorology has the responsibility of collating groundwater data into a single database bureau of meteorology 2022 although not all the data in state and territory databases are represented in the national database in some jurisdictions groundwater data were initially held by different government departments and some information was lost when these databases were merged also data collected by private entities and research organisations are often not replicated in government databases partly because the latter are mostly limited to certain datatypes and partly because data gathered by other institutions are often not provided to the database managers government departments are increasingly engaging private companies for groundwater monitoring and this can sometimes make data more difficult to access or require a fee for access data collected by some private entities e g mining companies are often considered to be commercial in confidence while mining companies are required to make some monitoring data available as part of the mining license conditions detailed studies and specialised data e g geophysical surveys isotope data are rarely publicly available while generally not considered to be a major issue by state agencies who are often the custodians of key data sets the difficulty in accessing data has been highlighted by federal government and private organization survey respondents in this fig 5 and previous nelson 2019 surveys 4 2 setting extraction limits setting regional extraction limits to protect groundwater resources groundwater dependent ecosystems and existing groundwater users is a challenge and was ranked as the greatest overall impediment to sustainable groundwater management fig 4 in unconfined aquifers the recharge rate often informs setting of the regional extraction limits and sometimes limits are set to be a fraction of recharge which itself may not be well constrained crosbie et al 2012 the fraction of recharge that is allowed to be extracted is usually determined by the perceived value of gdes within the management area and or their perceived sensitivity to impact doody et al 2018 but the link between ecosystem value and the environmental allocation is often not well defined and somewhat subjective where a groundwater model is available it may be used to determine extraction limits that will limit drawdown to acceptable levels pierce et al 2020 but this necessarily involves assumptions regarding the spatial pattern of future groundwater use even with carefully determined regional limits areas of intense development and groundwater drawdown may develop despite average use across a management area being relatively low in 2016 25 of groundwater management areas in australia were considered to be over allocated barnett et al 2020 and there are examples where limits have been reduced due to impact of drawdown on ecosystems in the barwon river basin central victoria groundwater extraction from deep aquifers for the water supply of geelong population approximately 250 000 fig 1 was increased during the 2001 2009 drought petrides and cartwright 2006 environmental impacts of this extraction included reduced surface water flows in headwater streams with the subsequent drying of swamps generation of acidic runoff fish kills and increased bushfire risk following community pressure the agency responsible for water supply withdrew its licence application and committed to restoration works in the impacted streams barwonwater 2020 nelson 2022 see also box 2 in principle groundwater response triggers sometimes called resource condition limits are a better approach for protecting ecosystems and other groundwater users and are usually applied in combination with volumetric approaches they represent a form of adaptive management but while the use of trigger levels is conceptually appealing its ultimate success is determined by the adequacy of observation well coverage selection of appropriate trigger levels and ability to observe and quickly respond when trigger levels are exceeded even if water level or water quality needs of gdes are known see below determining monitoring bore trigger levels to prevent critical values from being exceeded at the gde location is difficult noorduijn et al 2019 the problem arises because drawdown cones continue to expand and groundwater levels subside even after extraction ceases observation bores therefore need to be located to allow for early warning and provide sufficient time for intervention to prevent the exceedance of maximum permitted declines at the gdes the use of triggers is particularly difficult where the intent is to maintain groundwater flow to streams as a very small reduction in groundwater level near a stream may still result in a reversal of the hydraulic gradient hence causing a river to change from gaining to losing mccallum et al 2013 currently the use of trigger levels in australia is not very sophisticated and rarely directly linked to the protection of particular ecosystems for example in the west goulburn groundwater management area which covers an area of 5400 km2 fig 1 the trigger for possible additional controls on groundwater pumping relies on the average rate of decline in only two observation bores goulburn murray water 2017 thus while it provides some control on regional groundwater level decline it will not prevent local areas of drawdown from occurring and potentially impacting sensitive ecosystems or other groundwater users if water level decline is to be used to trigger management intervention then distinguishing between possible causes groundwater pumping land use change or a prolonged period of low rainfall becomes important this can be difficult several approaches have been developed for separating water level fluctuations due to rainfall variations from longer term trends that might be attributed to groundwater extraction or land use change e g peterson and western 2014 kong et al 2021 but these models are not widely used thus in the southeast of south australia for example uncertainty over the relative impacts of forestry plantations versus irrigated agriculture has complicated discussions over management intervention to arrest the water table decline government of south australia 2020 4 3 incorporating groundwater quality in australia groundwater salinity exceeds 1500 mg l across almost 40 of the continent harrington and cook 2014 and many remote communities in arid areas are exposed to nitrate and uranium in bore water which occurs naturally at concentrations above who guidelines western australian auditor general 2015 moggridge 2020 this limits beneficial use options the major challenge for groundwater allocation management however is understanding when groundwater extraction can lead to deterioration in water quality groundwater extraction in aquifer systems of heterogeneous permeability results in changes in the hydraulic gradients between layers which can increase rates of inter aquifer mixing or leakage from aquitards konikow and neuzil 2007 reversals in the direction of vertical leakage are also possible if there is contrasting water quality between the different units this can result in movement of contaminants into water supply aquifers hofmann and cartwright 2013 iverach et al 2017 in the eyre peninsula south australia fig 1 increases in salinity of groundwater extracted from town water supply bores installed in the unconfined aquifer have been linked to increased leakage from the more saline underlying confined aquifer dew 2020 where groundwater pumping is for irrigation recycling of salts can lead to increases in groundwater salinity in the unconfined aquifer cook and keane 2021 foster 2022 deterioration in water quality due to seawater intrusion can occur when groundwater extraction occurs in coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 rottnest island fig 1 is an example of where a freshwater lens has contracted due to a combination of reduced recharge and groundwater extraction bryan et al 2016 management approaches to seawater intrusion include the setting of level and or volume based triggers werner et al 2011 engineered solutions and ongoing salinity monitoring for advanced warning in dedicated monitoring bores in perth a groundwater replenishment scheme injects treated wastewater into the confined groundwater system to offset groundwater use and ameliorate the threat of seawater intrusion smith et al 2012 box 2 other geochemical processes triggered by groundwater extraction can also impact on water quality exposure of sediments to oxygen has led to arsenic and fluoride contamination of groundwater across parts of asia africa and south america ravenscroft et al 2009 rodriguez lado et al 2013 and these elements occur at elevated concentrations in some parts of australia nhrmc and nrmmc 2011 a change to more oxic and lower ph conditions in water supply aquifers can also cause increased mobility of uranium and radium lauria et al 2004 ayotte et al 2011 in coastal areas the release of sulfuric acid due to lowering of the water table and oxidation of sediments containing sulfides can lead to reductions in groundwater ph and mobilisation of heavy metals and other trace elements to the point where they are hazardous to human health and or ecosystems ljung et al 2009 shand et al 2018 in determining water allocation water quality issues have generally received less attention than water quantity issues largely because there is often no obvious direct link between extraction and quality change where they do occur water quality changes are typically slow and lag behind water level changes and water quality monitoring is more difficult and expensive than water level monitoring understanding the link between groundwater extraction and water quality change and incorporating the knowledge into comprehensive and effective monitoring schemes and into the setting of sustainable extraction limits remains a challenge ayotte et al 2011 4 4 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes require access to groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet their water requirements eamus et al 2006 and limitations exist in identifying and mapping gdes and determining their water needs groundwater extraction from unconfined aquifers with shallow water tables poses substantial risks to gdes and can lead to ecosystem degradation loss of ecosystem services and environmental damage tomlinson and boulton 2008 eamus et al 2015 many approaches have been undertaken to locally identify and map gdes eamus et al 2006 doody et al 2017 while intensive field techniques are valuable they are mostly restricted to research studies and are considered too costly for widespread application over the last decade advances in technology and requirements to detect and monitor gdes across broader spatial scales has seen an emphasis placed on developing and applying remote sensing methods eamus et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2019 for example in regions with distinct dry periods gdes can be mapped by identifying vegetation which remains green through dry seasons or drought episodes in australia a continental scale map the gde atlas has been developed using a combination of local expert knowledge and remote sensing of wetter and greener pixels barron et al 2014 or evapotranspiration van dijk et al 2015 doody et al 2017 this map provides a good first step for water managers but coverage is incomplete and there can be issues of scale and resolution brim box et al 2022 of course the functional dependence of ecosystems on groundwater as defined by the degree or seasonality of groundwater dependence eamus et al 2006 is difficult to infer from remote sensing analyses which only provide information on potential gdes some jurisdictions have also undertaken their own gde mapping using a combination of remote sensing and mapping of vegetation community structure and depth to groundwater kuginis et al 2016 in new south wales mapping of terrestrial vegetation gdes is supplemented by assessments of gde value including assessments of distinctiveness diversity habitat value and degree of disturbance dabovic et al 2019 once gdes have been identified characterising the degree of groundwater dependence or the ecological water requirements of gdes is challenging and best determined using direct measurement of groundwater use from several lines of evidence benyon et al 2006 froend and sommer 2010 remote sensing approaches can include the use of flux tower networks which when positioned in gdes can provide a measurement of actual evapotranspiration cleverly et al 2006 in the united states the flux tower network was fundamental for effectively developing remote sensing models of et nagler et al 2005 in australia however flux tower data in gdes are limited or unavailable glenn et al 2011 and so other approaches to understand gde water requirements are required toolboxes that describe the different field methods are available e g richardson et al 2011 but not all tools are suitable for broadscale application determining the impact of reduced water availability on gdes is even more difficult the lack of knowledge of gde environmental water requirements can be a major impediment to ensuring sustainable groundwater management and is perceived to be a much greater impediment than gde identification and mapping fig 4 4 5 groundwater surface water interaction it is now widely understood that pumping groundwater from bores located adjacent to rivers and streams can impact streamflow mccallum et al 2013 gleeson and richter 2017 this can be a problem for stream condition where reduced flows inhibit ecosystem function or result in poor water quality e g stagnant conditions or high summer water temperatures it is also a problem for downstream water users that are no longer able to extract permitted volumes most water resource plans in australia now require impacts of groundwater extraction on surface water systems to be considered and surface water and groundwater resources are assumed to be connected unless it can be demonstrated otherwise national water commission 2009 the predicted impact of groundwater pumping on surface water systems within the murray darling basin was one of the reasons for the adoption in 2012 of a cap on groundwater extraction in the basin walker et al 2020 see box 1 tools for quantifying changes in river flow due to groundwater pumping range from simple stream depletion equations glover and balmer 1954 to approaches based on numerical models leake et al 2010 the commonly used stream depletion equations typically assume a hydraulic connection between groundwater and rivers brunner et al 2011 and that all groundwater pumping will eventually be sourced from streamflow they may therefore over estimate river loss particularly in areas with shallow water tables where reductions in evapotranspiration loss may also occur evans 2007 while numerical models can consider such processes parameterising groundwater models to accurately simulate river groundwater connectivity and changes in evaporative loss is difficult the impacts of groundwater extraction on intermittent streams which are especially prevalent in australia are particularly poorly understood and difficult to quantify in part due to a lack of gauging stations on these systems krabbenhoft et al 2022 despite this estimation of pumping impacts on streams is not generally considered to be a major impediment for sustainable groundwater management figs 3 and 4 possibly due to several recent studies to estimate stream depletion rates walker et al 2020 2021 conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water is more difficult approaches for determining the degree of groundwater surface water exchange that warrants either joint water plans or consideration of the impacts of groundwater pumping on surface water vary across jurisdictions nelson 2013 and in some areas surface water and groundwater are managed separately even where there is a strong case for joint management while there have been many studies aimed at quantifying the groundwater surface water exchange fluxes e g gardner et al 2011 atkins et al 2016 the current degree of gw sw exchange is not directly related to the potential for development to alter the exchange rate it should not therefore limit the need for joint plans while most groundwater plans consider impacts on surface water few surface water plans consider connectivity to be significant or include any assessment of impacts of surface water diversions on groundwater systems ross 2018 there are few examples of truly conjunctive groundwater surface water management and it is unclear how conjunctive management should be implemented some jurisdictions now consider groundwater licences for bores located close to rivers as part of the surface water allocation limit however this approach simply shifts the boundary between the surface water and groundwater domains and does not represent true conjunctive management young and mccoll 2009 propose that all groundwater licences should involve subtraction of an equivalent amount of water from the surface water cap this is the case in the upper ovens river northeast victoria for groundwater allocations from the coarse grained alluvial sediments goulburn murray water 2012 for example however while this approach offers maximum protection for the surface water system it may be overly restrictive on groundwater development in many areas not all groundwater that is pumped will cause a reduction in streamflow as some may be derived from reductions in other forms of groundwater discharge such as evapotranspiration or outflow to the ocean evans 2007 a four zone system has been proposed where bores closest to the river are treated as surface water a second zone where impacts of pumping are transmitted to the river in less than six months effectively in the same irrigation season a zone where impacts take longer than six months and one where pumping effects are never felt at the stream evans et al 2006 while the principle embodied in this approach is sound zone based systems can be problematic as they can allow bores located just outside of a boundary and which may have a very similar impact to bores inside the boundary to pump when bores inside the boundary cannot nelson 2013 where numerical groundwater models are available some jurisdictions use these to predict the impact of groundwater pumping on surface water flow when licence applications are made and hence ensure that the total impact of surface water and groundwater pumping is within acceptable limits the difficulty is that surface water groundwater connectivity is a function of time and so the impact of pumping any bore on streamflow will depend upon the timescale being considered in many catchments past lack of consideration of groundwater surface water interaction will mean that a future reduction in river flow due to widespread groundwater pumping is yet to be realised many of the planning tools do not consider long time frames and do not deal with legacy or future impacts 4 6 modelling groundwater futures under uncertainty groundwater models are one of the main tools used for forecasting future system states they provide a means of collating available data and knowledge of how a groundwater system functions and integrating this information to provide predictions however uncertainty is pervasive in groundwater modelling and there is no such thing as an accurate model any model based prediction is uncertain uncertainty stems broadly from three sources 1 uncertainty in characterizing a groundwater system 2 simplified representations of the real world system and 3 uncertainty regarding future conditions the first two points apply to most groundwater modelling problems the latter is particularly pertinent where decision support modelling is undertaken for groundwater management decision making whether for environmental management or other purposes requires knowledge of the risk associated with the decision being taken freeze et al 1990 characterizing risk requires analysis of the probability of a management action resulting in an undesired outcome modelling enables evaluation of the risk associated with a groundwater management action more importantly it provides a mechanism for assimilating available information and thus reducing the uncertainty associated with that risk knowledge of groundwater systems is always imprecise and our ability to simulate system and process detail is limited often requiring rough approximations these approximations introduce model induced error thus it is never possible to calculate the outcome of a management action exactly as these depend on too many unknown and unknowable details of the groundwater system it is however possible to calculate probabilistically modelling undertaken to support sustainable groundwater management aims to quantify the uncertainty of management actions not achieving some stakeholder derived criteria of sustainability forecast uncertainty should reflect lack of information as well as inherent model structural defects data assimilation may reduce uncertainty derived from hydraulic properties historical stresses or multiple conceptual models and data worth analysis methods can assist in targeting further site characterisation and data collection e g kikuchi 2017 partington et al 2020 however data assimilation cannot reduce predictive uncertainty caused by unknown future conditions given that sustainable management is usually interested in long term effects unknown future conditions can contribute significantly to uncertainty of management outcomes if this is the case uncertainty of future stresses should be addressed during uncertainty analysis while models frequently include assessment of the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources this assessment is often limited to the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge crosbie et al 2012 and less commonly examines changes in irrigation rates that might occur due to reductions in rainfall or increases in evaporation or even possible changes in crop types and land management e g stigter et al 2014 hugman et al 2017 gorelick and zheng 2015 have emphasised the need for modelling efforts to represent the complex coupled interactions between human and natural systems and to incorporate uncertainties in economic and policy aspects which may exceed uncertainties in the natural system in some cases irreducible uncertainty may be so high as to preclude the ability to determine whether management outcomes will be effective or not nevertheless decisions must be made adaptive management may be employed specifying reactions to triggers or thresholds to avoid undesired outcomes in principle adaptive management provides a framework for uncertainty reduction with iterative cycles of data assimilation successively improving confidence in predicted management outcomes unfortunately real world examples of appropriate adaptive groundwater management are rare thomann et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge there are no demonstrated cases in which modelling provides assurance that an adaptive management plan will reduce the risk of an unwanted outcome the science of groundwater data assimilation and uncertainty quantification has matured over the last several decades and the importance of associating uncertainties with decision critical groundwater model predictions is rapidly gaining recognition e g middlemis and peeters 2018 iesc 2018 documented methodologies and software tools are readily available e g doherty 2015 white et al 2016 yet unfortunately the groundwater industry still lacks personnel with sufficient knowledge and experience in data assimilation and uncertainty analysis in a recent report gmdsi 2022 documents the outcomes of a series of discussions with australian environmental regulators faced with reviewing environmental impact reports informed by groundwater modelling in these discussions amongst other things regulators note the challenge in finding personnel skilled in uncertainty analysis other challenges with groundwater models are scale and resolution many of the models that have been developed for groundwater management cover large areas and are not appropriate for making decisions regarding individual licence applications and impacts at individual bores or gdes also many areas do not have any models or have only models that are insufficiently calibrated for management purposes in new zealand it was estimated that in 1999 only 20 of allocated groundwater was from an aquifer where there was a calibrated numerical model fenemor and robb 2001 in australia the fraction of groundwater withdrawn from an aquifer where there is a calibrated numerical model would likely be higher but the accuracy of many of our models for decision making purposes is unproven model uncertainty and prediction of climate change impacts were ranked 7th and 10th overall with similar rankings given by each industry group 4 7 decision making institutions and processes in australia decisions relating to groundwater governance are made by a combination of federal state and territory governments and non government organisations including local water boards ross 2016 groundwater governance is a complex task in part due to the significant time and effort required for multiple organisations spanning several environment and resource sectors and administrative levels to address issues mendham and curtis 2014 ross 2016 this fragmented nature of groundwater governance in some parts of australia has been criticised however attempts to improve governance have proven to be difficult due to the diversity of users and complexity of groundwater resources ross 2016 increased partnerships between governing authorities and the vast array of water users have been identified as potential solutions for improving groundwater governance and reducing regional disparities in management approaches e g schlager 2006 robust management of groundwater resources requires the consideration of land use biodiversity and surface water resources the distribution of these portfolios across government departments and effectiveness of the linkages between them varies across australia but where they are managed by different authorities effective governance of groundwater resources can be hindered nelson 2020 a transparent and inclusive approvals process provides a genuine opportunity for the best available science to be utilised and for potentially affected stakeholders to be appropriately consulted in some jurisdictions important steps have been taken to ensure transparency in the decision making process relating to groundwater entitlements for example the northern territory government has established a water licensing portal depws 2021 that provides access to supporting scientific documentation and factors considered when assessing groundwater licence applications however this type of information is not uniformly available across all jurisdictions yet the approvals process is delegitimised when the available evidence is not effectively and transparently incorporated o donnell and nelson 2020 the approvals process for groundwater withdrawals or groundwater affecting activities varies depending on the scale of the proposed operation for major groundwater affecting projects e g mining applications environmental impact assessments eias allow deficiencies in proposed plans including issues with data gaps to be identified they can also highlight points of potential scientific disagreement to be addressed in subsequent investigations eias are the most open and transparent part of the approvals process currell et al 2017 and therefore a greater emphasis on eias may reduce uncertainties in the level and type of impact to groundwater systems at the outset of major projects lee 2014 currell et al 2017 suggest that transparency in the approvals process can be improved by ensuring that monitoring criteria and mitigation strategies be made available for scrutiny prior to project approval transparency of post approval operational monitoring data is particularly important to ensure that project proponents are accountable for project impacts given the hidden nature of groundwater and the likelihood that impacts are not immediately obvious nelson 2019 transparency in decision making was identified to be a greater challenge by the research community than by other organisations perhaps partly because the research community are often not connected with decision making processes fig 5 groundwater management plans outline long term management strategies that provide valuable certainty to water users but they can also lead to inflexible decision making that is slow to respond to changing knowledge or circumstances ross 2016 the use of rigid groundwater management plans that do not seek to update system understanding based on new knowledge can lead to situations where the potential for lagged aquifer responses is overlooked saito et al 2021 adaptive management strategies e g williams et al 2009 can provide flexibility in the management process with a focus on uncertainty reduction through management actions adaptive management also provides a framework whereby elements of the plan are periodically revisited as new data and improved understanding of system behaviour are identified williams et al 2009 it allows for multiple conceptual models to be considered along with documented responses to potential future project impacts based on each conceptual model however adaptive management can have challenges where it involves changes to be made to volumetric allocations to water users reductions in water allocations involves costs in productivity equity and trust iftekhar and fogarty 2017 schuster et al 2020 and the aim should be to manage groundwater to prevent the need for such reductions a recent review of its application in groundwater affecting projects demonstrated that many plans which purportedly used adaptive management deviated significantly from formal definitions of the strategy thomann et al 2020 for groundwater management plans and water licenses to ensure that water resources are appropriately utilised compliance of water users and a willingness of and resources for administrators to enforce limits is vital regulations alone are insufficient to ensure the protection of a resource without the willingness of regulators to enforce their regulatory power molle and closas 2020 widespread use of meters for groundwater extraction critical infrastructure for compliance and enforcement activities has significantly lagged their use in the surface water context and in some cases has been met with opposition from groundwater users holley and sinclair 2013 ongoing concerns about compliance with groundwater extraction limits and inadequate enforcement programs have drawn the attention of the australian competition and consumer commission because of the implications for water markets commonwealth government 2021 in the murray darling basin concern about compliance led to a new agreement between basin states the basin compliance compact and the creation of a new federal compliance oversight agency now known as the inspector general of water compliance compliance concerns may also arise in the context of major mining projects that are subject to unclear or ambiguous licence conditions which may hinder enforcement insufficient monitoring may also make it difficult to determine if mining projects are causing impermissible impacts a difficulty which has emerged in the case of coal mining under sydney s water catchments waternsw 2018 an approach to establishing and improving compliance with protections for gdes that is yet to be fully explored in australia is to establish environmental groundwater entitlements that can be held and enforced by third parties nelson 2022 the need to build stakeholders and decision makers understanding of hydrogeological concepts is hindered by the complexity of natural systems and organisational complexities that must be overcome to achieve effective groundwater governance people s intuition about how surface water moves through landscapes is formed by easily observable flows in streams and rivers while groundwater flow processes are hidden studies in australia e g mendham and curtis 2014 and the united states e g brasier et al 2013 have shown that stakeholders level of groundwater knowledge can be a strong indicator of their perception of risk mendham and curtis 2014 suggest that engaging with stakeholders who are unsure about the risks of potential impacts as opposed to stakeholders who are strongly for or against a project early in the project approval process could allow stakeholders to make more informed decisions efforts to communicate with stakeholders more clearly are required from across the water sector various strategies have been used and 3d visualisation models have been shown to be highly effective e g baldwin et al 2012 wolhuter et al 2020 ultimately the decision making and project approval process can be improved through an increased understanding of hydrogeological concepts by stakeholders and decision makers and consequently groundwater education has been identified as a significant challenge figs 3 and 4 more informed stakeholders will relieve some pressures on decision makers where an understanding of complex groundwater processes is important villarroya and aldwell 1998 our survey did not specifically target irrigator groups or other stakeholders e g first nations and other communities benefitting from gdes the challenge associated with a lack of transparency in the decision making processes is likely to have rated much higher if it had 5 discussion sustainable use of groundwater implies the availability of the resource for future generations and that environmental impacts of extraction both now and in the future are acceptable and or manageable we deliberately avoid using the term sustainable yield in this paper because the term implies a volume or at least has been used to mean that and the spatial and temporal pattern of use is as important as the volume of water extracted however if sustainable use of groundwater is a balance between different potential uses and environmental impact then this is also hard to define as attitudes differ across stakeholder groups and change over time in australia and elsewhere many groundwater systems have areas with declining water levels with competition between users reduced streamflow and impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems e g taylor 2006 kelly et al 2013 of course there have been many successes including reductions in allocation in some of the worst affected areas schulte and cuadrado quesada 2020 schuster et al 2020 the use of water recycling and managed aquifer recharge to increase supply and arrest declining groundwater levels keremane and mckay 2007 zulfic and barnett 2007 and increased participation of stakeholders in setting allocation limits pierce et al 2020 however interventions have not always been sufficient to arrest declining groundwater levels schulte and cuadrado quesada 2020 and management should be seeking to prevent these impacts occurring rather than respond when groundwater level decline negatively impacts other users or the environment lowry et al 2003 concluded that gaps affecting management of groundwater quantity in new zealand were predominantly gaps in information and implementation knowledge of groundwater processes was generally considered to be adequate and technical methods and tools were available even if they were not being widely applied of the 18 challenges described in the current paper seven are principally gaps in information 6 7 11 15 16 17 and 18 fig 2 six are gaps in implementation 2 8 9 12 13 and 14 three are gaps in technical tools 1 3 and 5 and only two are principally gaps in the understanding of fundamental processes 4 10 however of those impediments ranked in the top six overall three are principally gaps with technical tools 1 3 and 5 with one of each of the gaps in process understanding 4 information 6 and implementation 2 the highest ranked impediment was the difficulty in determining regional scale volumetric water extraction limits this is interesting given the criticism of volumetric based approaches in the international literature particularly those based on groundwater recharge while volumetric limits are important protection of ecosystems cannot be achieved with basin scale limits and there appears to still be an emphasis on getting this number right other impediments ranked within the top six are the difficulties in determining and implementing minimum water level criteria in managing groundwater impacts on surface water and in determining water needs of ecosystems these issues are at the core of our attempts to balance groundwater allocation with the environment also ranked within the top six challenges are stakeholder communication improving knowledge of groundwater processes within the community and the limited resources to support groundwater studies the latter was ranked second overall and applies across all areas of groundwater investigations lack of staff and financial resources has also been identified as a major issue for groundwater management in other countries e g fenemor and robb 2001 zingraff hamed et al 2020 in addition to the 18 impediments originally identified by the authors several other challenges and needs were identified by survey respondents these included the need for more accurate bore metering data and finer temporal resolution of these data improved consideration of mining issues in some areas mine water sits outside the usual water accounting framework see timms and holley 2016 and nelson and quevauviller 2019 the slow adoption of new research and technologies and the lack of cost recovery for groundwater management future research involving greater numbers and diversity of stakeholder respondents could valuably explore other challenges reported in the literature associated with stakeholders and governance including insufficient processes for first nations australians to engage in influence and benefit from water allocation and planning o donnell et al 2022 and larger issues related to governance accountability and collaborative policy making e g zingraff hamed et al 2020 strategies to improve groundwater management should include both an assessment of the current impediments and also an assessment of the ease with which these impediments can be addressed stakeholder communication should be a priority as there is high potential for improvement in this area community education was identified as a high priority and is linked to transparency in decision making also a major challenge decision making is better understood and accepted when groundwater processes and concepts are also well understood and when informed stakeholders are involved in the decision making process limited resources which is an issue across all areas of groundwater science and management is often identified as a major challenge in surveys of this type improved knowledge of groundwater issues should contribute to increased funding while the difficulty in determining volumetric extraction limits was identified as the greatest challenge through the survey in many management areas this challenge is being resolved by announcements of the fraction of a groundwater allocation that can be used in the upcoming season the use of announced allocations linked to resource conditions e g water levels reduces the need to carefully define basin volumetric extraction limits the difficulty in determining water needs of ecosystems 4 and in managing groundwater impacts on surface water 6 are major challenges that do not have simple solutions identifying water needs of gdes remains a critical factor in protecting gdes yet most fine scale available methods are cost and labour intensive while broadscale methods can lack precision due to lack of appropriate geospatial data as the global population increases pressures on water resources will also increase this is likely to see changing emphasis in water resources planning and management and water allocations to the environment may come under increasing pressure in australia as in many countries there is not an overall shortage of water the problem is that water is not available where and when it is needed there is thus likely to be increased emphasis on engineering interventions including water supply pipelines to transport water from where it is available to where it is needed water recycling and managed aquifer recharge reduction in water demand through increased efficiency of water use is also an important part of the solution koech and langat 2018 the need for water pricing that more accurately reflects its value will also likely receive increased attention this includes but is not limited to recovery of management costs commonwealth government 2009 6 conclusions this study examined 18 challenges involved in sustainably managing groundwater allocations and conducted a survey of industry professionals to rank these challenges of the top six ranked challenges identifying water requirements of groundwater dependent ecosystems is predominantly a gap in process understanding of the others three are gaps in technical tools one represents a gap in information and one is a gap in implementation there is scope for improved approaches for managing water levels and surface water groundwater interaction and for improved involvement of stakeholders in decision making processes importantly our survey did not include irrigators and other water users if it had challenges related to implementation may have rated more highly while this study focussed on water allocation issues in australia other countries face similar water management issues and many of the challenges are of global interest issues related to water allocation oecd 2017 management of gdes erostate et al 2020 groundwater metering molle and closas 2021 governance zingraff hamed et al 2020 water pricing european environment agency 2009 and provision of sufficient resourcing zingraff hamed et al 2020 are receiving increased attention globally of course sustainable groundwater management involves more than water allocation and there is also scope for further improvements in water efficiency to reduce demand and water quality protection both in australia and globally credit authorship contribution

7841,study region australia study focus our incomplete knowledge of groundwater systems and processes imposes barriers in attempting to manage groundwater sustainably challenges also arise through complex institutional arrangements and decision making processes and the difficulty in involving stakeholders in some areas these difficulties have led to water table decline and impacts on groundwater users and groundwater dependent ecosystems however there is potential to improve the sustainable use of groundwater resources through improvements in management practices we discuss some of the challenges and present survey results of research government and industry professionals across the groundwater sector in australia new hydrological insights for the region the highest ranked challenge identified in the survey was the difficulty in determining regional scale volumetric water extraction limits this is surprising given the criticism in the international literature of volumetric based approaches for groundwater management and the decreased reliance on this approach in australia and elsewhere in recent years other major challenges are the difficulty in determining and implementing maximum drawdown criteria for groundwater levels determining water needs of ecosystems and managing groundwater impacts on surface water notwithstanding these gaps in technical understanding and tools and a lack of resources for groundwater studies improvements in stakeholder communication should enable more effective decision making and improve compliance with regulations designed to protect groundwater and dependent ecosystems graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater management sustainability research gaps implementation data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the last 50 years have seen large increases in global groundwater extraction principally driven by population growth gleeson et al 2012 margat and van der gun 2013 in australia groundwater use increased from approximately 2 6 109 m3 y 1 in 1983 1984 to 4 2 109 m3 y 1 in 1996 1997 nlwra 2001 mostly driven by an increase in irrigation water use fairweather et al 2003 by 2015 2016 groundwater use had increased to approximately 5 0 109 m3 y 1 barnett et al 2020 partly driven by restrictions on surface water extraction approximately 70 of groundwater used is for agricultural or pastoral purposes predominantly irrigation with the remainder used to support mining activities and for domestic and town water supplies in many areas of australia widespread groundwater extraction for irrigation of crops commenced before sophisticated groundwater management regimes were in place indeed the slow response times of many groundwater systems can allow unsustainable extraction rates to exist for a period of time before significant impacts are observed either on users or on dependent ecosystems this has created challenges where management approaches have been imposed on extraction systems that have already been established in australia major policy developments in the mid 1990 s led the way for improvements in groundwater management including attempts to return unsustainable extraction regimes to sustainable levels doolan 2016 significant developments have included widespread recognition of the importance of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes from the late 1990 s hatton and evans 1998 a coordinated approach to bore rehabilitation to reduce uncontrolled groundwater loss in the great artesian basin from 2000 gabcc 2000 and limits on groundwater pumping in some areas of the murray darling basin from 2012 see box 1 despite major steps forward in groundwater management pressure on groundwater resources has continued reinforcing the need to manage groundwater extraction to ensure the future sustainability of the resource increasing evidence globally of groundwater depletion and environmental impact gorelick and zheng 2015 de graaf et al 2019 suggests either that groundwater use has reached unsustainable levels and or that our current management approaches are not producing the best outcomes for the resource the assumption of the current paper is that there is room for improvement in how we are managing groundwater both in australia and globally the first step towards improved groundwater management and the focus of this paper is an assessment of where the problems lie while several recent studies have considered research opportunities in hydrogeology and related disciplines e g miller and gray 2008 blöschl et al 2019 kreamer et al 2021 few have directly addressed management challenges barber et al 1995 convened a series of meetings with hydrogeological researchers and managers to identify priority water issues in australia and the research and development needed to address these national challenges lowry et al 2003 identified 28 gaps that were thought to be hindering effective management of groundwater systems in new zealand their analysis was based on surveys and discussions with groundwater managers and they identified gaps in information implementation and technological and management tools as well as the understanding of fundamental processes our approach is similar to that of barber et al 1995 and lowry et al 2003 although more targeted as we focus on groundwater quantity management and water allocations we only consider groundwater quality issues that are directly affected by groundwater extraction we therefore do not consider contamination of groundwater from anthropogenic sources such as leaching of pesticides and nitrates or urban and industrial contamination li et al 2021 these are usually managed separately from water allocation either through licensing of discharge and safety protocols or through land use controls and remediation also we do not consider water management issues related to high water tables water logging and dryland salinity e g ghassemi et al 1995 these issues often take precedence in areas of poorer groundwater quality where there is less demand for groundwater rather we focus on groundwater allocation issues and discuss the main impediments to improving sustainable groundwater quantity management in this context we also present the findings from a survey of government employees private industry and the research community the focus is on australian conditions but we expect that many of the issues are universally applicable 2 background a thorough discussion of groundwater allocation management and legislation in australia is beyond the scope of the current paper but a very brief introduction is presented here so that the following discussion of challenges and opportunities can be more readily understood more detailed information can be found in nelson and quevauviller 2016 gardner et al 2017 rohde et al 2017 and rinaudo et al 2020 each of the six australian states and two territories fig 1 allocates groundwater under its own water legislation gardner et al 2017 the federal i e national government also influences groundwater management in some areas most notably within the murray darling basin which spans several states fig 1 and box 1 and in the assessment of unconventional gas developments 1 1 https federalfinancialrelations gov au sites federalfinancialrelations gov au files 2021 01 coal seam gas mining devel np pdf however while there are some differences in approaches between the different jurisdictions and between management areas within the jurisdictions there are many similarities in 2016 there were 288 groundwater management areas in australia covering approximately 75 of the continent of these 136 had volumetric limits on extraction barnett et al 2020 these limits impose upper bounds on the total volume of water that can be taken from the management areas for irrigation water supply and commercial and industrial uses stock and domestic users are excluded from these calculations and new applications are only permitted if the limits are not exceeded some management areas have subzones with their own volumetric limits water trading is often permitted once these regional or subzone limits are reached wheeler et al 2016 and this enables access for new users areas with high rates of groundwater use often use numerical groundwater models for predicting impacts of groundwater extraction e g namoi river alluvium nsw government 2019 walker et al 2020 these models are sometimes used to assess individual licence applications for very large water volumes but it is generally considered too costly to run these models for all licence applications simpler analytical approaches such as analytical pumping test solutions are also sometimes used to assess potential impacts of new licences applications can be refused if the estimated drawdown at ecosystems or existing bores exceeds a threshold value in some areas when management plans were first developed regional limits were set equal to the total water extraction at that time barnett and williamson 2020 since meters were often not in place the total extraction was sometimes estimated from irrigated areas and nominal irrigation rates for different crop types in other areas extraction limits for unconfined aquifers were set equal to the volume of recharge a practice referred to as safe yield in recent years increased recognition that extraction equal to recharge does not prevent impacts on gdes bredehoeft 1997 devlin and sophocleous 2005 means that it is now more common to allocate a fraction of recharge with the remaining volume representing a notional allocation to the environment and or conservative factor that acknowledges uncertainty of our knowledge the groundwater system meyland 2011 mdba 2020 the fraction reserved for the environment can be as high as 100 of recharge in areas with high value assets nsw government 2016 but 20 30 is more common walker et al 2020 in some cases groundwater models are also used for setting regional extraction limits pierce et al 2020 in areas with very low rates of recharge the extraction limit may be deliberately set above the recharge rate thus permitting gradual mining of the resource the northern territory water allocation planning framework links extraction limits to groundwater storage rather than recharge rates for the arid zone depws 2020 for alice springs town water supply for example groundwater extraction of 1 3 107 m3 y 1 is licenced from aquifers with an annual recharge of only 7 5 105 m3 y 1 dlrm 2016 local management rules are designed to address impacts that cannot be adequately managed using volumetric limits they include buffer zones that exclude groundwater pumping completely although licences that pre date delineation of buffer zones are usually allowed to continue or regulate pumping depending on proximity to ecosystems or other groundwater users in some cases the distance that a bore needs to be from a gde or other groundwater user is not fixed but rather varies in proportion to the volume of the water licence northern and yorke natural resources management board 2009 groundwater response triggers are another form of local management rule and use actual groundwater observations e g maximum drawdown or salinity value at key observation bores to control rates of groundwater extraction e g goulburn murray water 2017 actions following exceedance of trigger values might include temporary or permanent reductions in licenced allocations for some or all groundwater users it is now becoming more common for jurisdictions to use an adaptive management approach by announcing allocations annually based on groundwater quantity or quality observations e g eyre peninsula natural resources management board 2016 announced allocations usually take the form of a percentage of the licenced volume that can be extracted and have proven to be more palatable than permanent reductions in licenced allocations pierce et al 2020 in most states and territories legislation gives the minister responsible for water resources broad powers to consider environmental issues and resource condition in setting water allocations and to attach conditions to licences to extract water most state and territory legislation also provides for stakeholder consultation for example through advisory bodies active in the water planning process stakeholder consultation in decision making about issuing and trading allocations and entitlements is less common gardner et al 2017 a recent development is legal provisions requiring special consideration of and consultation with first nations australians in water planning mdbc 2004 nelson r 2022 productivity commission australia 2021 3 methods the collective experience of the authors of this paper supplemented by discussions with groundwater experts in research institutions governments and private industry enabled the identification of 18 primary challenges which need to be overcome to optimally manage groundwater extraction rates a survey of groundwater professionals was then conducted where participants were asked to score the challenges on a scale of 1 5 with 1 being not an impediment and 5 being a major impediment fractional scores were not permitted respondents were also invited to make comments on impediments and list additional impediments or challenges the survey was distributed through the quarterly newsletter of the national centre for groundwater research and training and with direct emails to key groundwater agencies and was open for a period of eight weeks respondents came from state and federal government agencies research institutions universities and csiro and private industry primarily engineering consulting firms and mining companies a total of 95 responses were received from the australian groundwater community of these 35 of respondents 33 responses were from state government 25 24 responses were from private industry 21 20 responses were from research institutions 17 16 responses were from the federal government department of agriculture water and the environment office of water science and geoscience australia and 2 2 responses were from other organisations 1 from local government and 1 unspecified 42 of respondents identified as having more than 20 years of experience 31 as having between 10 and 20 years of experience 24 as less than 10 years of experience and 3 did not complete this question for each challenge we present the percent of respondents who ranked it within each of the different categories and calculate an average score thus an average score of 1 means that all respondents rated the challenge as not an impediment and an average score of 5 means that all respondents rated the challenge as a major impediment the average score would be 3 0 if exactly half the respondents rated the challenge as not an impediment and half rated the challenge as a major impediment although of course an average score of three could also be arrived at in other ways the average score is analysed for all respondents and for the different groundwater sectors i e state government federal government research organisations and private industry statistical two sided t tests are used to assess significance of differences between responses from the different groundwater sectors 4 results the eighteen challenges identified by the authors through their collective experience and discussions with industry professionals are listed in fig 2 where they are also grouped into seven subject areas across all challenges and respondents 28 of responses were a score of 5 major impediment 31 were 4 26 were 3 13 were 2 and 2 were 1 not an impediment fig 3 the average score for each challenge ranged between 3 3 and 4 1 fig 4 indicating that all surveyed issues represented impediments of some concern the average score across all challenges and respondents was 3 70 in general respondents from research organisations were the most concerned average score across all challenges of 3 92 followed by those from federal government 3 86 state government 3 59 and private industry 3 52 the nature of the different impediments and their individual scores from survey responses are discussed below within the subject areas differences in the responses between the groundwater sectors are represented in fig 5 4 1 groundwater characterisation and data availability if groundwater decision making is evidence based then good decision making relies on the amount and quality of information that is used for the decision making process in australia the intensity of groundwater development largely determines the spatial coverage of monitoring networks fig 6 large sedimentary basins alluvial aquifers areas of high population density and regions of high economic interest large scale irrigated agriculture oil and gas extraction mining operations often have higher data density than areas where groundwater may only support small communities e g hard rock geology areas with low population density monitoring may be available over long periods of time sometimes multiple decades but periods of network rationalisation and cost cutting have led to incomplete monitoring data for many bores and sometimes to an overall reduction in monitoring programs fig 7 groundwater infrastructure is aging skm 2012 and failed or damaged monitoring bores are not always replaced also a more sophisticated understanding of groundwater systems cannot necessarily be delivered simply with denser monitoring networks and often requires targeted studies into processes such as recharge and discharge leakage between aquifers and water requirements of gdes these studies are often conducted at small spatial scales and are not uniformly available across different groundwater management areas while national maps of groundwater attributes have been developed either by extrapolating data from site specific studies e g recharge leaney et al 2011 or from remote sensing e g gdes doody et al 2017 national maps often lack precision and detail in local areas there are cases where monitoring networks have been extended and financial resources provided due to a strict environmental regulatory framework around for example extensive extraction of mineral resources unconventional gas extraction in the surat basin which underlies part of the great artesian basin fig 1 is a good example of this development where stakeholder pressure on politicians drove investment to improve the understanding of recharge groundwater flow and inter aquifer connectivity habermehl 2020 radke and ransley 2020 vink et al 2020 however many areas have not benefitted from such programs and limited resources for groundwater investigations was ranked 2nd overall as an impediment to sustainable groundwater management fig 4 and highest by researchers and state government survey respondents fig 5 difficulties in managing groundwater in data poor areas was ranked 11th overall but more highly by respondents from state and federal governments and research organisations fig 5 problems can also arise when data sets are split between different agencies fundamental groundwater data stratigraphy bore construction hydraulic head major ion chemistry are available in state and territory databases which are publicly available and user friendly sharples et al 2020 the bureau of meteorology has the responsibility of collating groundwater data into a single database bureau of meteorology 2022 although not all the data in state and territory databases are represented in the national database in some jurisdictions groundwater data were initially held by different government departments and some information was lost when these databases were merged also data collected by private entities and research organisations are often not replicated in government databases partly because the latter are mostly limited to certain datatypes and partly because data gathered by other institutions are often not provided to the database managers government departments are increasingly engaging private companies for groundwater monitoring and this can sometimes make data more difficult to access or require a fee for access data collected by some private entities e g mining companies are often considered to be commercial in confidence while mining companies are required to make some monitoring data available as part of the mining license conditions detailed studies and specialised data e g geophysical surveys isotope data are rarely publicly available while generally not considered to be a major issue by state agencies who are often the custodians of key data sets the difficulty in accessing data has been highlighted by federal government and private organization survey respondents in this fig 5 and previous nelson 2019 surveys 4 2 setting extraction limits setting regional extraction limits to protect groundwater resources groundwater dependent ecosystems and existing groundwater users is a challenge and was ranked as the greatest overall impediment to sustainable groundwater management fig 4 in unconfined aquifers the recharge rate often informs setting of the regional extraction limits and sometimes limits are set to be a fraction of recharge which itself may not be well constrained crosbie et al 2012 the fraction of recharge that is allowed to be extracted is usually determined by the perceived value of gdes within the management area and or their perceived sensitivity to impact doody et al 2018 but the link between ecosystem value and the environmental allocation is often not well defined and somewhat subjective where a groundwater model is available it may be used to determine extraction limits that will limit drawdown to acceptable levels pierce et al 2020 but this necessarily involves assumptions regarding the spatial pattern of future groundwater use even with carefully determined regional limits areas of intense development and groundwater drawdown may develop despite average use across a management area being relatively low in 2016 25 of groundwater management areas in australia were considered to be over allocated barnett et al 2020 and there are examples where limits have been reduced due to impact of drawdown on ecosystems in the barwon river basin central victoria groundwater extraction from deep aquifers for the water supply of geelong population approximately 250 000 fig 1 was increased during the 2001 2009 drought petrides and cartwright 2006 environmental impacts of this extraction included reduced surface water flows in headwater streams with the subsequent drying of swamps generation of acidic runoff fish kills and increased bushfire risk following community pressure the agency responsible for water supply withdrew its licence application and committed to restoration works in the impacted streams barwonwater 2020 nelson 2022 see also box 2 in principle groundwater response triggers sometimes called resource condition limits are a better approach for protecting ecosystems and other groundwater users and are usually applied in combination with volumetric approaches they represent a form of adaptive management but while the use of trigger levels is conceptually appealing its ultimate success is determined by the adequacy of observation well coverage selection of appropriate trigger levels and ability to observe and quickly respond when trigger levels are exceeded even if water level or water quality needs of gdes are known see below determining monitoring bore trigger levels to prevent critical values from being exceeded at the gde location is difficult noorduijn et al 2019 the problem arises because drawdown cones continue to expand and groundwater levels subside even after extraction ceases observation bores therefore need to be located to allow for early warning and provide sufficient time for intervention to prevent the exceedance of maximum permitted declines at the gdes the use of triggers is particularly difficult where the intent is to maintain groundwater flow to streams as a very small reduction in groundwater level near a stream may still result in a reversal of the hydraulic gradient hence causing a river to change from gaining to losing mccallum et al 2013 currently the use of trigger levels in australia is not very sophisticated and rarely directly linked to the protection of particular ecosystems for example in the west goulburn groundwater management area which covers an area of 5400 km2 fig 1 the trigger for possible additional controls on groundwater pumping relies on the average rate of decline in only two observation bores goulburn murray water 2017 thus while it provides some control on regional groundwater level decline it will not prevent local areas of drawdown from occurring and potentially impacting sensitive ecosystems or other groundwater users if water level decline is to be used to trigger management intervention then distinguishing between possible causes groundwater pumping land use change or a prolonged period of low rainfall becomes important this can be difficult several approaches have been developed for separating water level fluctuations due to rainfall variations from longer term trends that might be attributed to groundwater extraction or land use change e g peterson and western 2014 kong et al 2021 but these models are not widely used thus in the southeast of south australia for example uncertainty over the relative impacts of forestry plantations versus irrigated agriculture has complicated discussions over management intervention to arrest the water table decline government of south australia 2020 4 3 incorporating groundwater quality in australia groundwater salinity exceeds 1500 mg l across almost 40 of the continent harrington and cook 2014 and many remote communities in arid areas are exposed to nitrate and uranium in bore water which occurs naturally at concentrations above who guidelines western australian auditor general 2015 moggridge 2020 this limits beneficial use options the major challenge for groundwater allocation management however is understanding when groundwater extraction can lead to deterioration in water quality groundwater extraction in aquifer systems of heterogeneous permeability results in changes in the hydraulic gradients between layers which can increase rates of inter aquifer mixing or leakage from aquitards konikow and neuzil 2007 reversals in the direction of vertical leakage are also possible if there is contrasting water quality between the different units this can result in movement of contaminants into water supply aquifers hofmann and cartwright 2013 iverach et al 2017 in the eyre peninsula south australia fig 1 increases in salinity of groundwater extracted from town water supply bores installed in the unconfined aquifer have been linked to increased leakage from the more saline underlying confined aquifer dew 2020 where groundwater pumping is for irrigation recycling of salts can lead to increases in groundwater salinity in the unconfined aquifer cook and keane 2021 foster 2022 deterioration in water quality due to seawater intrusion can occur when groundwater extraction occurs in coastal areas ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013 rottnest island fig 1 is an example of where a freshwater lens has contracted due to a combination of reduced recharge and groundwater extraction bryan et al 2016 management approaches to seawater intrusion include the setting of level and or volume based triggers werner et al 2011 engineered solutions and ongoing salinity monitoring for advanced warning in dedicated monitoring bores in perth a groundwater replenishment scheme injects treated wastewater into the confined groundwater system to offset groundwater use and ameliorate the threat of seawater intrusion smith et al 2012 box 2 other geochemical processes triggered by groundwater extraction can also impact on water quality exposure of sediments to oxygen has led to arsenic and fluoride contamination of groundwater across parts of asia africa and south america ravenscroft et al 2009 rodriguez lado et al 2013 and these elements occur at elevated concentrations in some parts of australia nhrmc and nrmmc 2011 a change to more oxic and lower ph conditions in water supply aquifers can also cause increased mobility of uranium and radium lauria et al 2004 ayotte et al 2011 in coastal areas the release of sulfuric acid due to lowering of the water table and oxidation of sediments containing sulfides can lead to reductions in groundwater ph and mobilisation of heavy metals and other trace elements to the point where they are hazardous to human health and or ecosystems ljung et al 2009 shand et al 2018 in determining water allocation water quality issues have generally received less attention than water quantity issues largely because there is often no obvious direct link between extraction and quality change where they do occur water quality changes are typically slow and lag behind water level changes and water quality monitoring is more difficult and expensive than water level monitoring understanding the link between groundwater extraction and water quality change and incorporating the knowledge into comprehensive and effective monitoring schemes and into the setting of sustainable extraction limits remains a challenge ayotte et al 2011 4 4 groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes require access to groundwater on a permanent or intermittent basis to meet their water requirements eamus et al 2006 and limitations exist in identifying and mapping gdes and determining their water needs groundwater extraction from unconfined aquifers with shallow water tables poses substantial risks to gdes and can lead to ecosystem degradation loss of ecosystem services and environmental damage tomlinson and boulton 2008 eamus et al 2015 many approaches have been undertaken to locally identify and map gdes eamus et al 2006 doody et al 2017 while intensive field techniques are valuable they are mostly restricted to research studies and are considered too costly for widespread application over the last decade advances in technology and requirements to detect and monitor gdes across broader spatial scales has seen an emphasis placed on developing and applying remote sensing methods eamus et al 2015 castellazzi et al 2019 for example in regions with distinct dry periods gdes can be mapped by identifying vegetation which remains green through dry seasons or drought episodes in australia a continental scale map the gde atlas has been developed using a combination of local expert knowledge and remote sensing of wetter and greener pixels barron et al 2014 or evapotranspiration van dijk et al 2015 doody et al 2017 this map provides a good first step for water managers but coverage is incomplete and there can be issues of scale and resolution brim box et al 2022 of course the functional dependence of ecosystems on groundwater as defined by the degree or seasonality of groundwater dependence eamus et al 2006 is difficult to infer from remote sensing analyses which only provide information on potential gdes some jurisdictions have also undertaken their own gde mapping using a combination of remote sensing and mapping of vegetation community structure and depth to groundwater kuginis et al 2016 in new south wales mapping of terrestrial vegetation gdes is supplemented by assessments of gde value including assessments of distinctiveness diversity habitat value and degree of disturbance dabovic et al 2019 once gdes have been identified characterising the degree of groundwater dependence or the ecological water requirements of gdes is challenging and best determined using direct measurement of groundwater use from several lines of evidence benyon et al 2006 froend and sommer 2010 remote sensing approaches can include the use of flux tower networks which when positioned in gdes can provide a measurement of actual evapotranspiration cleverly et al 2006 in the united states the flux tower network was fundamental for effectively developing remote sensing models of et nagler et al 2005 in australia however flux tower data in gdes are limited or unavailable glenn et al 2011 and so other approaches to understand gde water requirements are required toolboxes that describe the different field methods are available e g richardson et al 2011 but not all tools are suitable for broadscale application determining the impact of reduced water availability on gdes is even more difficult the lack of knowledge of gde environmental water requirements can be a major impediment to ensuring sustainable groundwater management and is perceived to be a much greater impediment than gde identification and mapping fig 4 4 5 groundwater surface water interaction it is now widely understood that pumping groundwater from bores located adjacent to rivers and streams can impact streamflow mccallum et al 2013 gleeson and richter 2017 this can be a problem for stream condition where reduced flows inhibit ecosystem function or result in poor water quality e g stagnant conditions or high summer water temperatures it is also a problem for downstream water users that are no longer able to extract permitted volumes most water resource plans in australia now require impacts of groundwater extraction on surface water systems to be considered and surface water and groundwater resources are assumed to be connected unless it can be demonstrated otherwise national water commission 2009 the predicted impact of groundwater pumping on surface water systems within the murray darling basin was one of the reasons for the adoption in 2012 of a cap on groundwater extraction in the basin walker et al 2020 see box 1 tools for quantifying changes in river flow due to groundwater pumping range from simple stream depletion equations glover and balmer 1954 to approaches based on numerical models leake et al 2010 the commonly used stream depletion equations typically assume a hydraulic connection between groundwater and rivers brunner et al 2011 and that all groundwater pumping will eventually be sourced from streamflow they may therefore over estimate river loss particularly in areas with shallow water tables where reductions in evapotranspiration loss may also occur evans 2007 while numerical models can consider such processes parameterising groundwater models to accurately simulate river groundwater connectivity and changes in evaporative loss is difficult the impacts of groundwater extraction on intermittent streams which are especially prevalent in australia are particularly poorly understood and difficult to quantify in part due to a lack of gauging stations on these systems krabbenhoft et al 2022 despite this estimation of pumping impacts on streams is not generally considered to be a major impediment for sustainable groundwater management figs 3 and 4 possibly due to several recent studies to estimate stream depletion rates walker et al 2020 2021 conjunctive management of groundwater and surface water is more difficult approaches for determining the degree of groundwater surface water exchange that warrants either joint water plans or consideration of the impacts of groundwater pumping on surface water vary across jurisdictions nelson 2013 and in some areas surface water and groundwater are managed separately even where there is a strong case for joint management while there have been many studies aimed at quantifying the groundwater surface water exchange fluxes e g gardner et al 2011 atkins et al 2016 the current degree of gw sw exchange is not directly related to the potential for development to alter the exchange rate it should not therefore limit the need for joint plans while most groundwater plans consider impacts on surface water few surface water plans consider connectivity to be significant or include any assessment of impacts of surface water diversions on groundwater systems ross 2018 there are few examples of truly conjunctive groundwater surface water management and it is unclear how conjunctive management should be implemented some jurisdictions now consider groundwater licences for bores located close to rivers as part of the surface water allocation limit however this approach simply shifts the boundary between the surface water and groundwater domains and does not represent true conjunctive management young and mccoll 2009 propose that all groundwater licences should involve subtraction of an equivalent amount of water from the surface water cap this is the case in the upper ovens river northeast victoria for groundwater allocations from the coarse grained alluvial sediments goulburn murray water 2012 for example however while this approach offers maximum protection for the surface water system it may be overly restrictive on groundwater development in many areas not all groundwater that is pumped will cause a reduction in streamflow as some may be derived from reductions in other forms of groundwater discharge such as evapotranspiration or outflow to the ocean evans 2007 a four zone system has been proposed where bores closest to the river are treated as surface water a second zone where impacts of pumping are transmitted to the river in less than six months effectively in the same irrigation season a zone where impacts take longer than six months and one where pumping effects are never felt at the stream evans et al 2006 while the principle embodied in this approach is sound zone based systems can be problematic as they can allow bores located just outside of a boundary and which may have a very similar impact to bores inside the boundary to pump when bores inside the boundary cannot nelson 2013 where numerical groundwater models are available some jurisdictions use these to predict the impact of groundwater pumping on surface water flow when licence applications are made and hence ensure that the total impact of surface water and groundwater pumping is within acceptable limits the difficulty is that surface water groundwater connectivity is a function of time and so the impact of pumping any bore on streamflow will depend upon the timescale being considered in many catchments past lack of consideration of groundwater surface water interaction will mean that a future reduction in river flow due to widespread groundwater pumping is yet to be realised many of the planning tools do not consider long time frames and do not deal with legacy or future impacts 4 6 modelling groundwater futures under uncertainty groundwater models are one of the main tools used for forecasting future system states they provide a means of collating available data and knowledge of how a groundwater system functions and integrating this information to provide predictions however uncertainty is pervasive in groundwater modelling and there is no such thing as an accurate model any model based prediction is uncertain uncertainty stems broadly from three sources 1 uncertainty in characterizing a groundwater system 2 simplified representations of the real world system and 3 uncertainty regarding future conditions the first two points apply to most groundwater modelling problems the latter is particularly pertinent where decision support modelling is undertaken for groundwater management decision making whether for environmental management or other purposes requires knowledge of the risk associated with the decision being taken freeze et al 1990 characterizing risk requires analysis of the probability of a management action resulting in an undesired outcome modelling enables evaluation of the risk associated with a groundwater management action more importantly it provides a mechanism for assimilating available information and thus reducing the uncertainty associated with that risk knowledge of groundwater systems is always imprecise and our ability to simulate system and process detail is limited often requiring rough approximations these approximations introduce model induced error thus it is never possible to calculate the outcome of a management action exactly as these depend on too many unknown and unknowable details of the groundwater system it is however possible to calculate probabilistically modelling undertaken to support sustainable groundwater management aims to quantify the uncertainty of management actions not achieving some stakeholder derived criteria of sustainability forecast uncertainty should reflect lack of information as well as inherent model structural defects data assimilation may reduce uncertainty derived from hydraulic properties historical stresses or multiple conceptual models and data worth analysis methods can assist in targeting further site characterisation and data collection e g kikuchi 2017 partington et al 2020 however data assimilation cannot reduce predictive uncertainty caused by unknown future conditions given that sustainable management is usually interested in long term effects unknown future conditions can contribute significantly to uncertainty of management outcomes if this is the case uncertainty of future stresses should be addressed during uncertainty analysis while models frequently include assessment of the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources this assessment is often limited to the impact of climate change on groundwater recharge crosbie et al 2012 and less commonly examines changes in irrigation rates that might occur due to reductions in rainfall or increases in evaporation or even possible changes in crop types and land management e g stigter et al 2014 hugman et al 2017 gorelick and zheng 2015 have emphasised the need for modelling efforts to represent the complex coupled interactions between human and natural systems and to incorporate uncertainties in economic and policy aspects which may exceed uncertainties in the natural system in some cases irreducible uncertainty may be so high as to preclude the ability to determine whether management outcomes will be effective or not nevertheless decisions must be made adaptive management may be employed specifying reactions to triggers or thresholds to avoid undesired outcomes in principle adaptive management provides a framework for uncertainty reduction with iterative cycles of data assimilation successively improving confidence in predicted management outcomes unfortunately real world examples of appropriate adaptive groundwater management are rare thomann et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge there are no demonstrated cases in which modelling provides assurance that an adaptive management plan will reduce the risk of an unwanted outcome the science of groundwater data assimilation and uncertainty quantification has matured over the last several decades and the importance of associating uncertainties with decision critical groundwater model predictions is rapidly gaining recognition e g middlemis and peeters 2018 iesc 2018 documented methodologies and software tools are readily available e g doherty 2015 white et al 2016 yet unfortunately the groundwater industry still lacks personnel with sufficient knowledge and experience in data assimilation and uncertainty analysis in a recent report gmdsi 2022 documents the outcomes of a series of discussions with australian environmental regulators faced with reviewing environmental impact reports informed by groundwater modelling in these discussions amongst other things regulators note the challenge in finding personnel skilled in uncertainty analysis other challenges with groundwater models are scale and resolution many of the models that have been developed for groundwater management cover large areas and are not appropriate for making decisions regarding individual licence applications and impacts at individual bores or gdes also many areas do not have any models or have only models that are insufficiently calibrated for management purposes in new zealand it was estimated that in 1999 only 20 of allocated groundwater was from an aquifer where there was a calibrated numerical model fenemor and robb 2001 in australia the fraction of groundwater withdrawn from an aquifer where there is a calibrated numerical model would likely be higher but the accuracy of many of our models for decision making purposes is unproven model uncertainty and prediction of climate change impacts were ranked 7th and 10th overall with similar rankings given by each industry group 4 7 decision making institutions and processes in australia decisions relating to groundwater governance are made by a combination of federal state and territory governments and non government organisations including local water boards ross 2016 groundwater governance is a complex task in part due to the significant time and effort required for multiple organisations spanning several environment and resource sectors and administrative levels to address issues mendham and curtis 2014 ross 2016 this fragmented nature of groundwater governance in some parts of australia has been criticised however attempts to improve governance have proven to be difficult due to the diversity of users and complexity of groundwater resources ross 2016 increased partnerships between governing authorities and the vast array of water users have been identified as potential solutions for improving groundwater governance and reducing regional disparities in management approaches e g schlager 2006 robust management of groundwater resources requires the consideration of land use biodiversity and surface water resources the distribution of these portfolios across government departments and effectiveness of the linkages between them varies across australia but where they are managed by different authorities effective governance of groundwater resources can be hindered nelson 2020 a transparent and inclusive approvals process provides a genuine opportunity for the best available science to be utilised and for potentially affected stakeholders to be appropriately consulted in some jurisdictions important steps have been taken to ensure transparency in the decision making process relating to groundwater entitlements for example the northern territory government has established a water licensing portal depws 2021 that provides access to supporting scientific documentation and factors considered when assessing groundwater licence applications however this type of information is not uniformly available across all jurisdictions yet the approvals process is delegitimised when the available evidence is not effectively and transparently incorporated o donnell and nelson 2020 the approvals process for groundwater withdrawals or groundwater affecting activities varies depending on the scale of the proposed operation for major groundwater affecting projects e g mining applications environmental impact assessments eias allow deficiencies in proposed plans including issues with data gaps to be identified they can also highlight points of potential scientific disagreement to be addressed in subsequent investigations eias are the most open and transparent part of the approvals process currell et al 2017 and therefore a greater emphasis on eias may reduce uncertainties in the level and type of impact to groundwater systems at the outset of major projects lee 2014 currell et al 2017 suggest that transparency in the approvals process can be improved by ensuring that monitoring criteria and mitigation strategies be made available for scrutiny prior to project approval transparency of post approval operational monitoring data is particularly important to ensure that project proponents are accountable for project impacts given the hidden nature of groundwater and the likelihood that impacts are not immediately obvious nelson 2019 transparency in decision making was identified to be a greater challenge by the research community than by other organisations perhaps partly because the research community are often not connected with decision making processes fig 5 groundwater management plans outline long term management strategies that provide valuable certainty to water users but they can also lead to inflexible decision making that is slow to respond to changing knowledge or circumstances ross 2016 the use of rigid groundwater management plans that do not seek to update system understanding based on new knowledge can lead to situations where the potential for lagged aquifer responses is overlooked saito et al 2021 adaptive management strategies e g williams et al 2009 can provide flexibility in the management process with a focus on uncertainty reduction through management actions adaptive management also provides a framework whereby elements of the plan are periodically revisited as new data and improved understanding of system behaviour are identified williams et al 2009 it allows for multiple conceptual models to be considered along with documented responses to potential future project impacts based on each conceptual model however adaptive management can have challenges where it involves changes to be made to volumetric allocations to water users reductions in water allocations involves costs in productivity equity and trust iftekhar and fogarty 2017 schuster et al 2020 and the aim should be to manage groundwater to prevent the need for such reductions a recent review of its application in groundwater affecting projects demonstrated that many plans which purportedly used adaptive management deviated significantly from formal definitions of the strategy thomann et al 2020 for groundwater management plans and water licenses to ensure that water resources are appropriately utilised compliance of water users and a willingness of and resources for administrators to enforce limits is vital regulations alone are insufficient to ensure the protection of a resource without the willingness of regulators to enforce their regulatory power molle and closas 2020 widespread use of meters for groundwater extraction critical infrastructure for compliance and enforcement activities has significantly lagged their use in the surface water context and in some cases has been met with opposition from groundwater users holley and sinclair 2013 ongoing concerns about compliance with groundwater extraction limits and inadequate enforcement programs have drawn the attention of the australian competition and consumer commission because of the implications for water markets commonwealth government 2021 in the murray darling basin concern about compliance led to a new agreement between basin states the basin compliance compact and the creation of a new federal compliance oversight agency now known as the inspector general of water compliance compliance concerns may also arise in the context of major mining projects that are subject to unclear or ambiguous licence conditions which may hinder enforcement insufficient monitoring may also make it difficult to determine if mining projects are causing impermissible impacts a difficulty which has emerged in the case of coal mining under sydney s water catchments waternsw 2018 an approach to establishing and improving compliance with protections for gdes that is yet to be fully explored in australia is to establish environmental groundwater entitlements that can be held and enforced by third parties nelson 2022 the need to build stakeholders and decision makers understanding of hydrogeological concepts is hindered by the complexity of natural systems and organisational complexities that must be overcome to achieve effective groundwater governance people s intuition about how surface water moves through landscapes is formed by easily observable flows in streams and rivers while groundwater flow processes are hidden studies in australia e g mendham and curtis 2014 and the united states e g brasier et al 2013 have shown that stakeholders level of groundwater knowledge can be a strong indicator of their perception of risk mendham and curtis 2014 suggest that engaging with stakeholders who are unsure about the risks of potential impacts as opposed to stakeholders who are strongly for or against a project early in the project approval process could allow stakeholders to make more informed decisions efforts to communicate with stakeholders more clearly are required from across the water sector various strategies have been used and 3d visualisation models have been shown to be highly effective e g baldwin et al 2012 wolhuter et al 2020 ultimately the decision making and project approval process can be improved through an increased understanding of hydrogeological concepts by stakeholders and decision makers and consequently groundwater education has been identified as a significant challenge figs 3 and 4 more informed stakeholders will relieve some pressures on decision makers where an understanding of complex groundwater processes is important villarroya and aldwell 1998 our survey did not specifically target irrigator groups or other stakeholders e g first nations and other communities benefitting from gdes the challenge associated with a lack of transparency in the decision making processes is likely to have rated much higher if it had 5 discussion sustainable use of groundwater implies the availability of the resource for future generations and that environmental impacts of extraction both now and in the future are acceptable and or manageable we deliberately avoid using the term sustainable yield in this paper because the term implies a volume or at least has been used to mean that and the spatial and temporal pattern of use is as important as the volume of water extracted however if sustainable use of groundwater is a balance between different potential uses and environmental impact then this is also hard to define as attitudes differ across stakeholder groups and change over time in australia and elsewhere many groundwater systems have areas with declining water levels with competition between users reduced streamflow and impacts on groundwater dependent ecosystems e g taylor 2006 kelly et al 2013 of course there have been many successes including reductions in allocation in some of the worst affected areas schulte and cuadrado quesada 2020 schuster et al 2020 the use of water recycling and managed aquifer recharge to increase supply and arrest declining groundwater levels keremane and mckay 2007 zulfic and barnett 2007 and increased participation of stakeholders in setting allocation limits pierce et al 2020 however interventions have not always been sufficient to arrest declining groundwater levels schulte and cuadrado quesada 2020 and management should be seeking to prevent these impacts occurring rather than respond when groundwater level decline negatively impacts other users or the environment lowry et al 2003 concluded that gaps affecting management of groundwater quantity in new zealand were predominantly gaps in information and implementation knowledge of groundwater processes was generally considered to be adequate and technical methods and tools were available even if they were not being widely applied of the 18 challenges described in the current paper seven are principally gaps in information 6 7 11 15 16 17 and 18 fig 2 six are gaps in implementation 2 8 9 12 13 and 14 three are gaps in technical tools 1 3 and 5 and only two are principally gaps in the understanding of fundamental processes 4 10 however of those impediments ranked in the top six overall three are principally gaps with technical tools 1 3 and 5 with one of each of the gaps in process understanding 4 information 6 and implementation 2 the highest ranked impediment was the difficulty in determining regional scale volumetric water extraction limits this is interesting given the criticism of volumetric based approaches in the international literature particularly those based on groundwater recharge while volumetric limits are important protection of ecosystems cannot be achieved with basin scale limits and there appears to still be an emphasis on getting this number right other impediments ranked within the top six are the difficulties in determining and implementing minimum water level criteria in managing groundwater impacts on surface water and in determining water needs of ecosystems these issues are at the core of our attempts to balance groundwater allocation with the environment also ranked within the top six challenges are stakeholder communication improving knowledge of groundwater processes within the community and the limited resources to support groundwater studies the latter was ranked second overall and applies across all areas of groundwater investigations lack of staff and financial resources has also been identified as a major issue for groundwater management in other countries e g fenemor and robb 2001 zingraff hamed et al 2020 in addition to the 18 impediments originally identified by the authors several other challenges and needs were identified by survey respondents these included the need for more accurate bore metering data and finer temporal resolution of these data improved consideration of mining issues in some areas mine water sits outside the usual water accounting framework see timms and holley 2016 and nelson and quevauviller 2019 the slow adoption of new research and technologies and the lack of cost recovery for groundwater management future research involving greater numbers and diversity of stakeholder respondents could valuably explore other challenges reported in the literature associated with stakeholders and governance including insufficient processes for first nations australians to engage in influence and benefit from water allocation and planning o donnell et al 2022 and larger issues related to governance accountability and collaborative policy making e g zingraff hamed et al 2020 strategies to improve groundwater management should include both an assessment of the current impediments and also an assessment of the ease with which these impediments can be addressed stakeholder communication should be a priority as there is high potential for improvement in this area community education was identified as a high priority and is linked to transparency in decision making also a major challenge decision making is better understood and accepted when groundwater processes and concepts are also well understood and when informed stakeholders are involved in the decision making process limited resources which is an issue across all areas of groundwater science and management is often identified as a major challenge in surveys of this type improved knowledge of groundwater issues should contribute to increased funding while the difficulty in determining volumetric extraction limits was identified as the greatest challenge through the survey in many management areas this challenge is being resolved by announcements of the fraction of a groundwater allocation that can be used in the upcoming season the use of announced allocations linked to resource conditions e g water levels reduces the need to carefully define basin volumetric extraction limits the difficulty in determining water needs of ecosystems 4 and in managing groundwater impacts on surface water 6 are major challenges that do not have simple solutions identifying water needs of gdes remains a critical factor in protecting gdes yet most fine scale available methods are cost and labour intensive while broadscale methods can lack precision due to lack of appropriate geospatial data as the global population increases pressures on water resources will also increase this is likely to see changing emphasis in water resources planning and management and water allocations to the environment may come under increasing pressure in australia as in many countries there is not an overall shortage of water the problem is that water is not available where and when it is needed there is thus likely to be increased emphasis on engineering interventions including water supply pipelines to transport water from where it is available to where it is needed water recycling and managed aquifer recharge reduction in water demand through increased efficiency of water use is also an important part of the solution koech and langat 2018 the need for water pricing that more accurately reflects its value will also likely receive increased attention this includes but is not limited to recovery of management costs commonwealth government 2009 6 conclusions this study examined 18 challenges involved in sustainably managing groundwater allocations and conducted a survey of industry professionals to rank these challenges of the top six ranked challenges identifying water requirements of groundwater dependent ecosystems is predominantly a gap in process understanding of the others three are gaps in technical tools one represents a gap in information and one is a gap in implementation there is scope for improved approaches for managing water levels and surface water groundwater interaction and for improved involvement of stakeholders in decision making processes importantly our survey did not include irrigators and other water users if it had challenges related to implementation may have rated more highly while this study focussed on water allocation issues in australia other countries face similar water management issues and many of the challenges are of global interest issues related to water allocation oecd 2017 management of gdes erostate et al 2020 groundwater metering molle and closas 2021 governance zingraff hamed et al 2020 water pricing european environment agency 2009 and provision of sufficient resourcing zingraff hamed et al 2020 are receiving increased attention globally of course sustainable groundwater management involves more than water allocation and there is also scope for further improvements in water efficiency to reduce demand and water quality protection both in australia and globally credit authorship contribution

7842,study region the poyang lake watershed is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china it has been hit by frequent floods in past few decades study focus lake reservoir groups lrg are important in extreme hydrologic event mitigation in watersheds this study used runoff weighted model to quantify the influence of lrg on the flood mitigation in poyang lake based on weekly observations of gf 1 and sentinel 1 new hydrological insights for the region the weekly water storage volume of lrg in the poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing april september first and then decreasing october march from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model has a better effect on the calculation of detained flood volume and residence time of retained flood the average annual total detained flood volume of lrg were 4 39 108 m3 5 06 108 m3 1 64 108 m3 0 54 108 m3 and 0 15 108 m3 in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins respectively among which xiushui and ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention the residence time of retained flood by lrg in the five basins are long during the dry season october to march but short during the wet season april to september and they are generally longer than those in the natural state with no reservoir the delay days of the lrg to flood peaks were about 12 7 13 22 and 26 d for each basin respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords multi source remote sensing lake reservoir group lrg flood detention residence time flood peak delay data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction human activities have aggravated the uneven distribution of water resources leading to an increase in the probability of droughts and floods luo et al 2016 this has a serious impact on the production and life of human society and restricts the high quality development of the regional economy wing et al 2020 davenport et al 2021 the flood detention effect of lakes and reservoirs has played an important role in mitigating flood disaster events deng et al 2014 flood detention simulation and flood detention effect research are of great significance for flood control and disaster mitigation cao et al 2011 wang et al 2021 they are also important for water cycles in basins a flood is a catastrophic natural disaster that will cause a large number of casualties lüdtke et al 2019 the coordinated development of human activities and nature in a basin needs to be closely watched and studied in depth especially in the flooded areas aghsaei et al 2020 lin et al 2018 lin et al 2021 as a flood prone area the southeast asian continent is often hit by floods causing asia to have the highest death rate in the world chen et al 2020 southern china has been frequently hit by floods in the past few decades they have caused substantial social and economic losses especially in the yangtze river basin chen et al 2021b in addition the frequency of severe floods in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is increasing and lakes and reservoirs play an important role in buffering and regulating extreme hydrological events during the flood period larsen et al 2019 luo et al 2021 due to many challenges it is difficult to determine the water storage of lakes and reservoirs in the basin cai et al 2016 proposed a model for estimating the storage capacity of large lakes and reservoirs which was applied and verified in the yangtze river basin both lakes and reservoirs have water storage functions which can effectively reduce the intensity of flood peaks and delay the arrival time of flood peaks during floods nakayama et al 2013 countries with rapid economic development such as china have built more reservoirs to meet the growing population mcnally et al 2009 mao et al 2016 according to research by zhang due to the high degree of temporal and spatial variability of the climate china has built more than 85 000 reservoirs to use existing water resources to achieve various protection purposes and control floods zhang et al 2008 in recent years studies on the dynamics of lakes and reservoirs at the basin scale have mainly focused on remote sensing observations ling et al 2020 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhu et al 2020 remote sensing technology provides an effective solution to monitor water surface area surface elevation and the water storage of lakes and reservoirs at local and global scales chen et al 2021a huang et al 2020 2021 song et al 2014a yao et al 2019 traditionally optical images have been used to monitor the changes in the inundation area of poyang lake and the surrounding target lakes and reservoirs chen et al 2018a song et al 2014b however optical sensors are obstructed easily by rainfall and clouds which obscures the image observation results thus limiting the application of flood monitoring synthetic aperture radar sar can transmit and receive signals at night or under cloudy conditions so it is particularly suitable for describing the extent of water during flood events liang et al 2020 remote sensing technology has been widely used in water resources management and environmental pollution monitoring wang et al 2004 it focuses on the delineation and spatial distribution of reservoirs nie et al 2017 it quantitatively estimate the water storage of reservoirs in detail ran et al 2012 the flood detention simulation of the lakes and reservoirs in the basin helps to assess their flood detention capacity the traditional flood detention simulation method is quite mature cao et al 2011 proposed a method for the flood detention simulation of small reservoirs the purpose of this method is to solve the problem of the impact of small scale water conservancy projects on the accuracy of flood forecasting it can help in estimating the water storage of small reservoirs without operating data wang et al 2021 developed a framework to optimize flood diversion site selection and operation strategies in flood detention areas gate control upstream is the optimal strategy to reduce flood losses in these areas terêncio et al 2020 developed a flood attenuation model based on flood detention basins in 23 key flood risk areas in mainland portugal which can eliminate high flood risk areas dai et al 2021 found that after the operation of the three gorges reservoir the water storage of the tributary lakes decreased which weakened their ability to recharge the yangtze river s main stream molénat et al 2021 used mass balance methods to estimate runoff based on small reservoirs as the time resolution increases the error and uncertainty of global river runoff estimates will decrease in addition many different deep learning models have been used to identify water bodies and monitor water resources or floods and they show good results abid et al 2021 chen et al 2018b wang et al 2022 therefore special attention should be paid to changes in water storage of lakes and reservoirs and their associated effects when conducting flood detention simulations dube et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however most traditional flood detention simulation research is based on annual or monthly scales which leads to difficulties in effectively quantifying the flood detention capacity of lakes and reservoirs and in precisely capturing the changes in the water storage volume of lakes and reservoirs in a period of time it is impossible to accurately estimate the detained flood volume residence time and flood peak delay time without intensive observations in addition traditional work has focused on flood detention of the cascade reservoirs along the river effects of the lrg distributed in the watershed on flood detention have not been sufficiently investigated therefore the intensive monitoring of small water bodies such as medium and large lakes and reservoirs and their mitigation effects on watershed floods should be investigated it is of great significance to water resource management in a river lake system affected by lakes and reservoirs the objectives of this research are as follows 1 estimating the water storage of the lrg weekly based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 2 quantifying the detained flood volume based on a proposed runoff weighted model 3 determining the residence time of retained floods for the lrg this paper uses weekly multi source remote sensing data to evaluate the change trend of runoff and lake storage during the flooding period in the poyang lake watershed the purpose is to help decision makers and stakeholders determine the flood storage capacity of the lakes and reservoirs in the basin to reduce the losses caused by future floods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the poyang lake watershed is located in jiangxi province china covering an area of 162 200 square kilometers accounting for 9 of the yangtze river basin fig 1 according to the names of the five major tributaries it can be divided into the five basins namely the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins lu et al 2018 the hydrological stations controlling the five major tributaries at the entrance of the lake are the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan stations fig 1 poyang lake is not only a water transportation channel but also a water storage carrier that changes with the seasonal landscape it is a typical seasonal lake with a rich wetland landscape zhang et al 2017b the climate in this area is a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average temperature of 17 4 c and an annual precipitation of 1569 mm zhang et al 2017c 2019 during the flood season abundant rainfall widens the lake surface due to the influence of the floods in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the lake water is easily blocked and returned qi et al 2016 in contrast due to the lack of water in the dry season most of the ground is exposed the land use types of the watershed are dominated by forests shrubs crops water bodies and cities xu et al 2020 in addition poyang lake is one of the most severe floodplains in china it suffered floods in 1954 1973 1977 1983 1992 1995 1998 2010 2016 and 2020 wu et al 2022 yang et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 in recent years with the intensification of global extreme weather events the number of serious floods in the poyang lake area has increased sharply thus the flood detention effect of the medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the upper reaches of poyang lake is worth exploring according to the rule that the area of lakes and reservoirs is greater than 3 km2 27 medium and large lakes and reservoirs fig 1 that meet the conditions in the poyang lake watershed were selected as the study area based on the information from the chinese lake science database 2 2 datasets weekly gf 1 and sentinel 1 image databases from 2016 to 2020 daily discharge data from hydrological stations and some known water storage data of medium and large reservoirs in the poyang lake watershed were used in this study gf 1 was successfully launched on april 26 2013 it adopts a sun synchronous orbit and is an optical imaging remote sensing satellite equipped with two 2 m resolution panchromatic 8 m resolution multispectral cameras table 2 and four 16 m resolution multispectral cameras chen et al 2022 this satellite is used for conventional earth observation and can obtain multispectral data with a moderate spatial resolution a high time resolution and wide coverage guo et al 2021a the gf 1 wfv wide field of the view sensor has a spatial resolution of 16 m and a revisit time of 4 days it has a width of 800 kilometers which is suitable for water body identification zhang et al 2017d we used about 1300 gf 1 wfv images of lakes and reservoirs in different time phases between 2016 and 2020 and a weekly high resolution long term image library was constructed the accurate and rapid extraction of water body information from gf 1 images is successively applied in water resource surveys monitoring and management and natural disaster assessments sentinel 1 is composed of two polar orbiting satellites a c band synthetic aperture radar imager is used to obtain images without being affected by the weather sentinel 1 a and sentinel 1 b were launched on april 3 2014 and april 25 2016 respectively the orbital period of a single satellite is 12 d the regular revisit period of a two satellite network is 6 d table 3 and the orbit is about 700 km high the fastest revisit time is 1 3 d sentinel 1 s c band imaging system uses stripmap sm an interferometric wide swath iw an extra wide swath ew and wave wv four imaging modes to generate observation data rucci et al 2012 we used the 10 m resolution sentinel 1 iw grd vv vh dual polarization interference wide mode constructing weekly high resolution long term image library of about 3500 images of lakes and reservoirs in different time phases from 2016 to 2020 radar satellites can pass through clouds and fog to obtain surface information in bad weather so they have a wide range of applications in flood monitoring and other aspects an increasing number of studies are using sentinel 1 sar images to extract lakes floods and other water bodies around the world bioresita et al 2018 peng et al 2021 guo et al 2021b daily runoff data of the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan hydrological stations from 1955 to 2001 and from 2016 to 2020 were used http slt jiangxi gov cn col col28224 index html the poyang lake watershed consists of five main rivers which flow into poyang lake as described above flow data were collected from the hydrological stations of these five rivers fig 1 among them the wanjiabu hydrometric station measures the discharge of the xiushui basin waizhou measures the ganjiang basin lijiadu measures the fuhe basin meigang measures the xinjiang basin and hushan measures the raohe basin in addition water storage information of some medium and large reservoirs with operating data is recorded in the poyang lake watershed these data come from the jiangxi hydrological monitoring center http slt jiangxi gov cn col col28225 index html from 2020 04 06 2020 07 15 and was used for the construction of a water storage area model 3 methods 3 1 water storage estimation of the lrg based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 satellite data the normalized difference water index ndwi and sentinel 1 dual polarized water index sdwi were applied for water extraction from satellite images the ndwi t operation was performed on a gf 1 image where the threshold t was determined by an iterative algorithm iterative algorithm is a method based on continuous iteration to automatically select the best threshold for image binarization its basic idea is to first obtain the maximum gray value and the minimum gray value of the image take the average value of the two as the initial threshold then divide the image into two parts the foreground and the background according to the initial threshold and find the average gray value of two parts respectively the average gray value of the two parts is averaged as a new threshold and the estimated value is continuously improved in this way until the threshold no longer changes the sdwi t operation was performed on a sentinel 1 image and the threshold t was determined by the otsu algorithm chen et al 2021c the otsu algorithm is an automatic threshold selection method based on the maximum inter class variance its basic idea is to find a threshold that maximizes the variance between classes according to the grayscale characteristics of the image the image is divided into background and foreground parts to achieve binarization after the image was binarized except for the target lake or reservoir all other areas were masked as unneeded map information a maximum connected domain algorithm was used to retain the target lake or reservoir and remove unneeded map information new noise was inevitably induced in data processing and conversion the manifestation was a hole in the image in which the pixel value was nan here a surface filling method was used to remove these areas the surface filling method is to vectorize the binary image of the lake library and fill the noise holes in the image based on the filling module in arcgis so as to obtain a complete water surface raster image without nan values finally the water surface area was calculated by using the pixel statistic fig 2 in this paper gf 1 and sentinel 1 are used to achieve weekly remote sensing observations different sensors acquire different image products the monitoring results water surface area of their respective products are obtained after a lot of processing operations even the water surface areas of gf 1 and sentinel 1 on the same day but they are different therefore the water areas of gf 1 and sentinel 1 on the same or adjacent collection days from 2018 to 2020 were selected for linear regression the regression coefficients of each lake and reservoir were obtained and the optimized linear regression model was used to correct the water surface area of lower resolution images on other collection days so as to achieve the consistency of multi source remote sensing monitoring results of lake and reservoir area in the poyang lake watershed fig 2 due to the three dimensional irregularity of the lakes and reservoirs it can be assumed to approximate the shape of a square pyramid cut in half diagonally liebe et al 2005 the water storage area model was constructed by using the water storage information of some reservoirs obtained from the jiangxi hydrological monitoring center and area information was obtained by remote sensing on the corresponding date the empirical relationship between the water storage and the area of the lakes and reservoirs can be expressed as 1 v a area b where v is the water storage of the lake or reservoir area is the water surface area of the lake or reservoir and a and b are parameters especially in areas with a similar topography the parameters a and b are very similar annor et al 2009 this correlation is quite stable and can be replicated in time and space annor et al 2009 liebe et al 2005 therefore the expression of the empirical relationship between the water storage and the area of known reservoirs can be extended to unknown lake or reservoir regions with similar geomorphological relationships to make a more accurate estimation of the water storage all lakes and reservoirs were divided into two categories based on the similarity of geomorphology by the threshold of average slope cao et al 2011 a large number of experiments have proved that this average slope threshold is 17 in the poyang lake watershed the expressions of the empirical relationship between the water storage and area were respectively calculated fig 3 the appropriate relational expression was selected based on the average slope of all lakes and reservoirs the water storage of the lakes and reservoirs without operation data was calculated and combined with area information from 2016 to 2020 the complete water storage sequence of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 was thus obtained 3 2 determination of the flood peak threshold based on the pot model in order to describe the flood event quantitatively the peaks over threshold pot model was used to obtain the flood peak threshold the key is the determination of the independence of flood peak samples and the determination of the threshold value of the over quantitative sequence lang et al 1999 independent flood peak identification criterion proposed by the united states water resources association uswrc is as follows 2 θ ln area 5 and x min 0 75 min q 1 q 2 where θ is the time interval between the two flood peaks area is the area of the basin x min is the minimum value of the selected sample q i is the daily runoff of the i th flood peak among the continuous flood peaks that do not meet the above conditions only the largest one is selected the threshold value s is an important parameter to determine the sample of an over quantitative sequence the key to the selection of the threshold s is to make the extracted pot samples subject to certain standards lang et al 1999 suggested that the threshold should be determined based on the distribution of the number of occurrences of the over quantitative series the frequency of the over quantitative flood and the assumption of independent and identical distribution in combination with the over quantitative sample mean method davison et al 1990 the dispersion index method and the annual average number of over quantitative occurrences n method a larger threshold that meets the annual average number of an over quantity greater than 2 was selected 3 3 detained flood volume estimation based on the runoff weighted model flood detention refers to measures taken to retard or delay the speed of floods in a short period its purpose is to detain floods temporarily reduce peak flow and relieve the burden of floods in downstream rivers a traditional method is used to calculate the flood detention of small reservoirs cao et al 2011 the method is improved according to the specific conditions of the poyang lake watershed without the need to obtain precipitation and surface evapotranspiration data at the location of the lakes or reservoirs the detained flood volume of the entire lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins can be modeled only through remote sensing image information and runoff hydrological data the specific method is as follows the daily runoff data of the basins during the flood period were introduced and normalized to obtain the normalized daily runoff value between the adjacent two collection days during the flood occurrence period the water storage of the two adjacent collection days during the flood period is represented by v d k 1 and v d k 2 respectively the interval between the two collection days is d k 2 d k 1 days v d k 2 v d k 1 represents the detained flood volume of lrg during two adjacent collection days in the flood period then multiply the normalized runoff value of each day by the detained flood volume to obtain the daily detained flood volume during the adjacent two collection days the water storage volume v d k 1 of first collection day plus the detained flood volume of d k 1 1 day to obtain the water storage v d k 1 1 of d k 1 1 day during the flood period the above operations are performed on multiple collection days to obtain the daily water storage of single lake or reservoir during the flood period the daily water storage of lrg was obtained by summing the daily water storage of multiple lakes and reservoirs during the flood period the total detained flood volume of lrg in the basin during any flood period can be obtained by subtracting the water storage on the start date from end date of the flood 3 v d k 1 m v d k 1 i 1 m n d k 1 i v d k 2 v d k 1 v d k 1 and v d k 2 respectively represent the water storage of two adjacent collection days during the flood period the time interval between the two collection days is d k 2 d k 1 days n d k 1 i represents the normalized runoff value of day i during two adjacent collection days in the flood period m represents the m th day starting from d k 1 and v d k 1 m represents the water storage of lrg on the m th day starting from d k 1 3 4 the residence time calculation of retained floods for the lrg reservoirs are an integral part of water resource planning and management previous studies have shown that due to the residence of reservoirs these built up reservoirs have even reduced the magnitude of global sea level rise when the reservoir is built and put into operation the incoming water will be intercepted and the flow of released water will be reduced to varying degrees ran et al 2012 the residence of the reservoir increases the time needed for water to flow along the river to the ocean which affects the water flow and the water cycle in turn wisser et al 2010 the average time during which water stays in the reservoir is one of the key parameters that determine many direct and indirect changes in physical biogeochemical geomorphological and hydrological behavior wisser et al 2010 for all lakes and reservoirs located in the study area the average residence time is calculated as follows vörösmarty et al 2003 4 τ i 1 n v i q where v i represents the water storage of the lrg km3 q represents the flow of the hydrological station weekly that controls the runoff km3 week and n represents the number of lakes and reservoirs in the basin τ represents the average residence time week of the lrg in the basin multi source remote sensing data are used to form a weekly water storage sequence to more accurately describe the residence time of the lrg the unit of residence time is one week 4 results 4 1 satellite observed lrg water storage dynamics from 2016 to 2020 based on multi source remote sensing data the region of interest roi of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the poyang lake watershed was obtained water body extraction and water storage calculations were performed a frequency map of the water storage changes of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs was constructed in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 fig 4 a weekly total water storage sequence of the lrg was formed for each basin and the poyang lake watershed fig 5 floodplains refer to areas along rivers lakes and coastal areas that are prone to flooding they are alluvial plains formed by flooding here the inundation range of lakes and reservoirs in the floodplain changed substantially while the inundation range of the lakes and reservoirs in the mountainous area changed little fig 4 this is due to the fact that the reservoir is mostly built in mountainous area with a large drop covers a wide area and is controlled by the water storage and discharge all year round it results that the surface area of the reservoir does not change much over the same period of time each year it is reflected in remote sensing images as a slight spatial change in the inundation frequency the lakes around the floodplain are affected by the rising and falling tides of poyang lake and the flooding of the lake during the flood season and the spatial changes in the inundation frequency are more obvious which is shown in fig 4 in addition the lakes and reservoirs with larger storage capacity generally showed little spatial change in inundation frequency from 2016 2020 the water storage of each lrg in poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the first few months of each year water storage tends to decrease this trend continues until april when it starts to increase reaches a maximum in september and then declines again until it reaches its lowest point around march of the following year the weekly water storage sequence of the lrg in each basin of the poyang lake watershed fig 5 shows that the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins follow the pattern of low water storage during the dry season october march and large water storage during the wet season april september the same pattern is true in the poyang lake watershed and there is a clear trend of change it is reflected in the figure that the peak from october to march is concave and the peak from april to september is convex this is consistent with the changes in runoff during the dry and wet seasons among them the xiushui basin has the largest water storage mainly because the zhelin reservoir located in that basin has a large storage capacity even the water storage of the medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in this basin accounts for half of the entire poyang lake watershed 4 2 flood detention simulation of the lrg in the basin a quantitative description of flood events is provided based on independent flood peak discrimination criteria and the pot model combined with runoff data it can be seen that the number of flood peaks in each basin in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 is 1 and there is no continuous flood peak table 4 in order to explore the flood detention effect of the lrg in the basin the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins in the poyang lake watershed were taken as examples the flood peak sequence was extracted based on the pot method and indicators such as the number of annual over quantity the mean of the excess of sample the dispersion index i and the poisson distribution 5 95 confidence interval were selected to quantitatively describe flood daily runoff data from the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan stations in the poyang lake watershed from 1955 to 2001 were used and combined with the pot model fig 6 to calculate the flood peak thresholds of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins the results are 1162 m3 s 11 500 m3 s 4150 m3 s 6224 m3 s and 2967 m3 s respectively table 4 the runoff data from 2016 to 2020 were combined with the flood peak thresholds to determine the peak date for each basin in the five year period this data was used as a benchmark to look forward and backward for the first lowest point of runoff in the overall downward trend and to mark it as the start and end date of the flood this paper proposes a runoff weighted model that is more mature than the traditional flood detention model it improves the calculation efficiency and applicability greatly without a loss of accuracy the pearson correlation coefficient between the traditional flood detention model and the runoff weighted model is 0 95 fig 7 three time points 2020 6 11 2020 6 18 and 2020 6 19 were selected for verification the results show that the accuracy of the two models is extremely similar which proves that there is indeed a positive relationship between flood detention and runoff in addition the runoff weighted model also solves the problem of missing water storage information at the time of interest due to insufficient image data according to the weekly water storage sequence of the lrg in each basin of the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model was used to calculate the detained flood volume the average annual total detained flood volume values of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins are 4 395 108 m3 5 061 108 m3 1 640 108 m3 0 535 108 m3 and 0 147 108 m3 respectively table 5 the xiushui and ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention mainly due to the large annual rainfall and the total water storage of the lrg in the xiushui and ganjiang basins the trend change in the flood detention capacity of the lrg during the flood period of different years was analyzed using the detained flood volume data of the past five years the commonalities and differences of the flood detention capacity in different basins can provide reference significance for lake and reservoir management and water resources dispatch 4 3 the residence time of retained flood by lrg according to the weekly water storage of the lrg and runoff in each basin of the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model was used to calculate the residence time of retained flood by lrg in recent years the annual flow of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers has become larger than the natural state in the dry season and smaller in the wet season as the water storage of lakes and reservoirs has a certain impact on the state of runoff when evaluating the hydrological changes caused by lakes and reservoirs special attention should be paid to the changes in the lakes and reservoirs and their related effects on runoff natural state fig 8 flow data without human activity no reservoir interference was calculated by averaging the runoff data from 1955 to 1960 the residence times of the average and annual state were each calculated from 2016 to 2020 fig 8 there will be a certain difference in the residence time of the two cases which can indicate whether the residence time of the lrg has a direct cumulative effect in addition according to the water storage time series of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 combined with the residence time model date residence time series of the lrg in the basin of the poyang lake watershed were constructed fig 8 which can clarify the annual magnitude analysis of flow regulation and serve as a basis for predicting future runoff flow regulation all basins follow the pattern of a long residence time in the dry season october to march and a short residence time in the wet season april to september fig 8 this is consistent with the changes in the runoff of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers during the dry and wet periods in recent years the residence time of the lrg in the basin during the dry season has become shorter than in the natural state especially in the xiushui and ganjiang basins fig 8 due to the increase of annual rainfall in the xiushui and ganjiang basins shown in the runoff data climate change has alleviated the drought in the study area as well as the frequent human water extraction activities irrigation and drinking water because the study area is small it takes a short time for the water to flow into poyang lake along the river the cumulative effect of stagnant water in the time dimension of the lrg is not obvious fig 8 the samples are only medium and large lakes and reservoirs there is a lack of small lakes and reservoirs and there may be slight errors in the results reservoir construction and other human activities have led to the continuous increase of water storage in the basin which may further extend the residence time of retained flood by lrg during dry season in the future thereby affecting the water cycle of the entire basin 4 4 delayed time of flood peaks by lrg medium and large lakes and reservoirs have not only changed the natural flow patterns of streams and rivers but also changed their flood cycle and peak magnitude the occurrence of flood peaks implies the continuous increase of runoff which is usually caused by continuous rainfall during the flood period the lakes and reservoirs consistently collect rainwater during the raining process the amount of rainfall that enters the surface runoff is reduced compared to the absence of lakes and reservoirs collection since flooding began the lakes and reservoirs have been constantly weakening the amount of runoff which can be considered as delaying the arrival of the flood peak this period of time is called the flood peak delay time in order to explore the delaying effect of the lrg on flood peaks the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins were considered as examples the pot model was used to calculate the threshold of flood peaks in each basin and the peak occurrence time of each basin from 2016 to 2020 was obtained the start and end times of the flood were determined by combining the water storage time series a statistical analysis of the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in each basin from 2016 to 2020 was carried out and the delay time of the lrg to flood peaks was estimated in each basin according to the delay capacity of the lrg in each basin the reservoirs were guided to construct the natural time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins was 18 33 15 19 and 19 days respectively table 6 in recent years the time taken to weaken the flood peak after the construction of the reservoir has been 30 40 28 41 and 45 days respectively table 7 from the perspective of the time dimension the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins from 2016 to 2020 has increased compared with the natural state except for the ganjiang basin the time taken to weaken the flood peak of other basins has increased approximately twofold compared to the natural state the construction of medium and large lakes and reservoirs does have a certain delay effect on flood peaks and the delay days of the lrg to flood peaks in each basin are about 12 7 13 22 and 26 days respectively from the perspective of the basin dimension the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins is up to 40 days while the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui and fuhe basins is about 29 days the main reasons for the difference between these times are as follows in terms of climate the annual average rainfall in the xiushui and fuhe basins is greater than that of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins the accumulation of flood peaks is strong and the formation time is fast so the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg is short in terms of the number and size of lakes and reservoirs the number of lakes and reservoirs in the xiushui and fuhe basins is lower than that of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins the total storage capacity of medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the former basin is also smaller than that of the latter as a result the water detention capacity of the former is insufficient and the time taken to weaken the flood peak is short in terms of the number of lake and reservoir samples this study selected medium and large lakes and reservoirs according to certain rules as the research sample based on information from a chinese lake database but some lake and reservoir samples that did not quite meet the inclusion criteria may have been missed resulting in slight errors in the results 5 discussion 5 1 implications of measures for flood prevention and mitigation lakes and reservoirs play an important role in buffering and regulating extreme hydrological events during the flood season larsen et al 2019 luo et al 2021 traditional flood detention simulation methods dai et al 2021 li and niu 2022 molénat et al 2021 terêncio et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and deep learning methods abid et al 2021 jing et al 2021 yaseen et al 2022 are quite mature we have done some work on water body extraction and water storage estimation chen et al 2021a liang et al 2020 ling et al 2020 the flood detention effect of lrgs in basins has been studied based on weekly long term water storage sequences the problem of large errors between research and real results caused by an insufficient amount of data and the time scale of the traditional methods has been solved however traditional research work limited to cascade reservoirs along the rivers do not consider the impact of lrgs that distribute far away the rivers this paper divides the poyang lake watershed into five basins the comprehensive effects of the lrg in the basins on hydrological changes are considered and the flood detention effect of the upstream lrg on floods is discussed the operation of reservoirs in a region is of great significance to water resource management especially in mitigating flood disasters therefore determining the relationship between the water storage of the lrg and the runoff in the basin is one of the most important problems faced by hydrologists and engineering technicians this type of information is needed for hydrological engineering construction and water resource management the comprehensive effect of the lrg is more convincing than the impact of a single reservoir on runoff in a basin higher time scales can describe flood events more accurately and this is impossible with traditional low time scale methods therefore in terms of flood disaster research it is important to expand the scope of the research and consider the comprehensive impact of the lrg on runoff in addition the acquisition of higher time scales in related research will also make the research results more accurate this is also an endeavor for future research 5 2 uncertainty and limitation this paper constructed a weekly image sequence of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 imagery experiments suggest that the iterative algorithm is more suitable for extracting lakes from gf 1 images the ostu algorithm is more suitable for extracting the inundation area of lakes and reservoirs from sentinel 1 images these conclusions are consistent with the views of chen et al 2021c compared with traditional water storage estimation methods based on the dem and 3d gis tools the water storage area model cao et al 2011 ran et al 2012 solves the limitations of the traditional methods since the traditional method is limited by the shape of the reservoir and the size of the contour distance the calculation is cumbersome because the water level information is difficult to measure for small water body and the calculation of each parameter requires the participation of water level information an empirical model that is more mature than the traditional flood detention model is proposed here which greatly improves the calculation efficiency and applicability without a loss of accuracy this method does not need to obtain precipitation and surface evapotranspiration data at the locations of the lakes and reservoirs only the water storage information obtained from remote sensing images and the hydrological runoff data are needed these are applied to simulate the detained flood volume of medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins the pearson correlation coefficient between the traditional flood detention model cao et al 2011 and the proposed runoff weighted model is 0 95 and three time points 2020 6 11 2020 6 18 and 2020 6 19 were selected for verification the results suggest that the accuracy of the two is very similar fig 7 which suggests that there is indeed a positive relationship between flood detention and runoff in addition the runoff weighted model also solves the problem of missing water storage information at the time of interest due to insufficient image data compared with the traditional work ran et al 2012 we used a more high scale series of water storage of the lrg in the basin and the study area was narrowed to the poyang lake watershed this solves a number of problems that the scope of the study area and the research objects is too wide that there is no quantitative analysis of the residence effect of individual lakes and reservoirs in the study area that the research scale is relatively short and that it is impossible to assess the problem of changing trends in addition the hydrological model is suitable for long term hydrological and related process simulation and some scholars use it for flood simulation huo et al 2021 jin et al 2017 however it is difficult to acquire sufficient data for such a massive lakes and reservoirs in the hydrological model our remote sensing monitoring results provide a wealth of time series weekly data of the lrg for the hydrological model the weekly water storage data obtained in this study can be used to drive the hydrological model that is integrated with lake and reservoir regulations in the watershed this can allow for a more accurate understanding of the water cycle process in the basin and for hydrological and flood forecasts with high accuracy 6 conclusions this study provides an effective method for the remote sensing estimation of water storage of the lrgs in a basin with high temporal and spatial resolution the weekly high temporal spatial resolution image library was built from gf 1 and sentinel 1 the extracted water surface area sequence can better capture changes in the water storage of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed during the flood events of 2016 2020 the weekly water storage volume of lrg in the poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing april september first and then decreasing october march from 2016 to 2020 the inundation range of lrg in the floodplain changed substantially while in the mountainous area changed little the lrg with larger storage capacity generally showed little spatial change in inundation frequency and this applies to any area the average annual total detained flood volume values of the lrg from 2016 to 2020 in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins are 4 395 108 m3 5 061 108 m3 1 640 108 m3 0 535 108 m3 and 0 147 108 m3 the detained flood volume in the xiushui and ganjiang basins is greater than that in the other basins and the contribution of flood detention is the greatest all basins follow the pattern of a long residence time during the dry season from october to march and a short residence time during the wet season from april to september the cumulative effect of stagnant water in the time dimension of the lrg is not obvious the construction of medium and large lakes or reservoirs will indeed delay flood peaks to a certain extent more importantly the flood detention effect of the lrg played an important role in mitigating extreme hydrological events in the poyang lake watershed this fills the gap in the comprehensive understanding of the role of lakes and reservoirs and other small water bodies in mitigating extreme hydrological events in the basin the method used in this study is expected to be applicable to other areas to resist floods it can help decision makers and stakeholders determine the flood storage capacity of lakes and reservoirs in the basin reducing losses caused by future floods in addition the evaluation of the change trend of runoff and water storage in the poyang lake watershed during the flooding period this can provide a certain scientific basis for flood prevention and mitigation to ensure the healthy development of the region credit

7842,study region the poyang lake watershed is located on the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china it has been hit by frequent floods in past few decades study focus lake reservoir groups lrg are important in extreme hydrologic event mitigation in watersheds this study used runoff weighted model to quantify the influence of lrg on the flood mitigation in poyang lake based on weekly observations of gf 1 and sentinel 1 new hydrological insights for the region the weekly water storage volume of lrg in the poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing april september first and then decreasing october march from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model has a better effect on the calculation of detained flood volume and residence time of retained flood the average annual total detained flood volume of lrg were 4 39 108 m3 5 06 108 m3 1 64 108 m3 0 54 108 m3 and 0 15 108 m3 in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins respectively among which xiushui and ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention the residence time of retained flood by lrg in the five basins are long during the dry season october to march but short during the wet season april to september and they are generally longer than those in the natural state with no reservoir the delay days of the lrg to flood peaks were about 12 7 13 22 and 26 d for each basin respectively graphical abstract ga1 keywords multi source remote sensing lake reservoir group lrg flood detention residence time flood peak delay data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction human activities have aggravated the uneven distribution of water resources leading to an increase in the probability of droughts and floods luo et al 2016 this has a serious impact on the production and life of human society and restricts the high quality development of the regional economy wing et al 2020 davenport et al 2021 the flood detention effect of lakes and reservoirs has played an important role in mitigating flood disaster events deng et al 2014 flood detention simulation and flood detention effect research are of great significance for flood control and disaster mitigation cao et al 2011 wang et al 2021 they are also important for water cycles in basins a flood is a catastrophic natural disaster that will cause a large number of casualties lüdtke et al 2019 the coordinated development of human activities and nature in a basin needs to be closely watched and studied in depth especially in the flooded areas aghsaei et al 2020 lin et al 2018 lin et al 2021 as a flood prone area the southeast asian continent is often hit by floods causing asia to have the highest death rate in the world chen et al 2020 southern china has been frequently hit by floods in the past few decades they have caused substantial social and economic losses especially in the yangtze river basin chen et al 2021b in addition the frequency of severe floods in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river is increasing and lakes and reservoirs play an important role in buffering and regulating extreme hydrological events during the flood period larsen et al 2019 luo et al 2021 due to many challenges it is difficult to determine the water storage of lakes and reservoirs in the basin cai et al 2016 proposed a model for estimating the storage capacity of large lakes and reservoirs which was applied and verified in the yangtze river basin both lakes and reservoirs have water storage functions which can effectively reduce the intensity of flood peaks and delay the arrival time of flood peaks during floods nakayama et al 2013 countries with rapid economic development such as china have built more reservoirs to meet the growing population mcnally et al 2009 mao et al 2016 according to research by zhang due to the high degree of temporal and spatial variability of the climate china has built more than 85 000 reservoirs to use existing water resources to achieve various protection purposes and control floods zhang et al 2008 in recent years studies on the dynamics of lakes and reservoirs at the basin scale have mainly focused on remote sensing observations ling et al 2020 ma et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhu et al 2020 remote sensing technology provides an effective solution to monitor water surface area surface elevation and the water storage of lakes and reservoirs at local and global scales chen et al 2021a huang et al 2020 2021 song et al 2014a yao et al 2019 traditionally optical images have been used to monitor the changes in the inundation area of poyang lake and the surrounding target lakes and reservoirs chen et al 2018a song et al 2014b however optical sensors are obstructed easily by rainfall and clouds which obscures the image observation results thus limiting the application of flood monitoring synthetic aperture radar sar can transmit and receive signals at night or under cloudy conditions so it is particularly suitable for describing the extent of water during flood events liang et al 2020 remote sensing technology has been widely used in water resources management and environmental pollution monitoring wang et al 2004 it focuses on the delineation and spatial distribution of reservoirs nie et al 2017 it quantitatively estimate the water storage of reservoirs in detail ran et al 2012 the flood detention simulation of the lakes and reservoirs in the basin helps to assess their flood detention capacity the traditional flood detention simulation method is quite mature cao et al 2011 proposed a method for the flood detention simulation of small reservoirs the purpose of this method is to solve the problem of the impact of small scale water conservancy projects on the accuracy of flood forecasting it can help in estimating the water storage of small reservoirs without operating data wang et al 2021 developed a framework to optimize flood diversion site selection and operation strategies in flood detention areas gate control upstream is the optimal strategy to reduce flood losses in these areas terêncio et al 2020 developed a flood attenuation model based on flood detention basins in 23 key flood risk areas in mainland portugal which can eliminate high flood risk areas dai et al 2021 found that after the operation of the three gorges reservoir the water storage of the tributary lakes decreased which weakened their ability to recharge the yangtze river s main stream molénat et al 2021 used mass balance methods to estimate runoff based on small reservoirs as the time resolution increases the error and uncertainty of global river runoff estimates will decrease in addition many different deep learning models have been used to identify water bodies and monitor water resources or floods and they show good results abid et al 2021 chen et al 2018b wang et al 2022 therefore special attention should be paid to changes in water storage of lakes and reservoirs and their associated effects when conducting flood detention simulations dube et al 2014 liu et al 2014 however most traditional flood detention simulation research is based on annual or monthly scales which leads to difficulties in effectively quantifying the flood detention capacity of lakes and reservoirs and in precisely capturing the changes in the water storage volume of lakes and reservoirs in a period of time it is impossible to accurately estimate the detained flood volume residence time and flood peak delay time without intensive observations in addition traditional work has focused on flood detention of the cascade reservoirs along the river effects of the lrg distributed in the watershed on flood detention have not been sufficiently investigated therefore the intensive monitoring of small water bodies such as medium and large lakes and reservoirs and their mitigation effects on watershed floods should be investigated it is of great significance to water resource management in a river lake system affected by lakes and reservoirs the objectives of this research are as follows 1 estimating the water storage of the lrg weekly based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 2 quantifying the detained flood volume based on a proposed runoff weighted model 3 determining the residence time of retained floods for the lrg this paper uses weekly multi source remote sensing data to evaluate the change trend of runoff and lake storage during the flooding period in the poyang lake watershed the purpose is to help decision makers and stakeholders determine the flood storage capacity of the lakes and reservoirs in the basin to reduce the losses caused by future floods 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the poyang lake watershed is located in jiangxi province china covering an area of 162 200 square kilometers accounting for 9 of the yangtze river basin fig 1 according to the names of the five major tributaries it can be divided into the five basins namely the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins lu et al 2018 the hydrological stations controlling the five major tributaries at the entrance of the lake are the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan stations fig 1 poyang lake is not only a water transportation channel but also a water storage carrier that changes with the seasonal landscape it is a typical seasonal lake with a rich wetland landscape zhang et al 2017b the climate in this area is a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate with an average temperature of 17 4 c and an annual precipitation of 1569 mm zhang et al 2017c 2019 during the flood season abundant rainfall widens the lake surface due to the influence of the floods in the upper reaches of the yangtze river the lake water is easily blocked and returned qi et al 2016 in contrast due to the lack of water in the dry season most of the ground is exposed the land use types of the watershed are dominated by forests shrubs crops water bodies and cities xu et al 2020 in addition poyang lake is one of the most severe floodplains in china it suffered floods in 1954 1973 1977 1983 1992 1995 1998 2010 2016 and 2020 wu et al 2022 yang et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 in recent years with the intensification of global extreme weather events the number of serious floods in the poyang lake area has increased sharply thus the flood detention effect of the medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the upper reaches of poyang lake is worth exploring according to the rule that the area of lakes and reservoirs is greater than 3 km2 27 medium and large lakes and reservoirs fig 1 that meet the conditions in the poyang lake watershed were selected as the study area based on the information from the chinese lake science database 2 2 datasets weekly gf 1 and sentinel 1 image databases from 2016 to 2020 daily discharge data from hydrological stations and some known water storage data of medium and large reservoirs in the poyang lake watershed were used in this study gf 1 was successfully launched on april 26 2013 it adopts a sun synchronous orbit and is an optical imaging remote sensing satellite equipped with two 2 m resolution panchromatic 8 m resolution multispectral cameras table 2 and four 16 m resolution multispectral cameras chen et al 2022 this satellite is used for conventional earth observation and can obtain multispectral data with a moderate spatial resolution a high time resolution and wide coverage guo et al 2021a the gf 1 wfv wide field of the view sensor has a spatial resolution of 16 m and a revisit time of 4 days it has a width of 800 kilometers which is suitable for water body identification zhang et al 2017d we used about 1300 gf 1 wfv images of lakes and reservoirs in different time phases between 2016 and 2020 and a weekly high resolution long term image library was constructed the accurate and rapid extraction of water body information from gf 1 images is successively applied in water resource surveys monitoring and management and natural disaster assessments sentinel 1 is composed of two polar orbiting satellites a c band synthetic aperture radar imager is used to obtain images without being affected by the weather sentinel 1 a and sentinel 1 b were launched on april 3 2014 and april 25 2016 respectively the orbital period of a single satellite is 12 d the regular revisit period of a two satellite network is 6 d table 3 and the orbit is about 700 km high the fastest revisit time is 1 3 d sentinel 1 s c band imaging system uses stripmap sm an interferometric wide swath iw an extra wide swath ew and wave wv four imaging modes to generate observation data rucci et al 2012 we used the 10 m resolution sentinel 1 iw grd vv vh dual polarization interference wide mode constructing weekly high resolution long term image library of about 3500 images of lakes and reservoirs in different time phases from 2016 to 2020 radar satellites can pass through clouds and fog to obtain surface information in bad weather so they have a wide range of applications in flood monitoring and other aspects an increasing number of studies are using sentinel 1 sar images to extract lakes floods and other water bodies around the world bioresita et al 2018 peng et al 2021 guo et al 2021b daily runoff data of the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan hydrological stations from 1955 to 2001 and from 2016 to 2020 were used http slt jiangxi gov cn col col28224 index html the poyang lake watershed consists of five main rivers which flow into poyang lake as described above flow data were collected from the hydrological stations of these five rivers fig 1 among them the wanjiabu hydrometric station measures the discharge of the xiushui basin waizhou measures the ganjiang basin lijiadu measures the fuhe basin meigang measures the xinjiang basin and hushan measures the raohe basin in addition water storage information of some medium and large reservoirs with operating data is recorded in the poyang lake watershed these data come from the jiangxi hydrological monitoring center http slt jiangxi gov cn col col28225 index html from 2020 04 06 2020 07 15 and was used for the construction of a water storage area model 3 methods 3 1 water storage estimation of the lrg based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 satellite data the normalized difference water index ndwi and sentinel 1 dual polarized water index sdwi were applied for water extraction from satellite images the ndwi t operation was performed on a gf 1 image where the threshold t was determined by an iterative algorithm iterative algorithm is a method based on continuous iteration to automatically select the best threshold for image binarization its basic idea is to first obtain the maximum gray value and the minimum gray value of the image take the average value of the two as the initial threshold then divide the image into two parts the foreground and the background according to the initial threshold and find the average gray value of two parts respectively the average gray value of the two parts is averaged as a new threshold and the estimated value is continuously improved in this way until the threshold no longer changes the sdwi t operation was performed on a sentinel 1 image and the threshold t was determined by the otsu algorithm chen et al 2021c the otsu algorithm is an automatic threshold selection method based on the maximum inter class variance its basic idea is to find a threshold that maximizes the variance between classes according to the grayscale characteristics of the image the image is divided into background and foreground parts to achieve binarization after the image was binarized except for the target lake or reservoir all other areas were masked as unneeded map information a maximum connected domain algorithm was used to retain the target lake or reservoir and remove unneeded map information new noise was inevitably induced in data processing and conversion the manifestation was a hole in the image in which the pixel value was nan here a surface filling method was used to remove these areas the surface filling method is to vectorize the binary image of the lake library and fill the noise holes in the image based on the filling module in arcgis so as to obtain a complete water surface raster image without nan values finally the water surface area was calculated by using the pixel statistic fig 2 in this paper gf 1 and sentinel 1 are used to achieve weekly remote sensing observations different sensors acquire different image products the monitoring results water surface area of their respective products are obtained after a lot of processing operations even the water surface areas of gf 1 and sentinel 1 on the same day but they are different therefore the water areas of gf 1 and sentinel 1 on the same or adjacent collection days from 2018 to 2020 were selected for linear regression the regression coefficients of each lake and reservoir were obtained and the optimized linear regression model was used to correct the water surface area of lower resolution images on other collection days so as to achieve the consistency of multi source remote sensing monitoring results of lake and reservoir area in the poyang lake watershed fig 2 due to the three dimensional irregularity of the lakes and reservoirs it can be assumed to approximate the shape of a square pyramid cut in half diagonally liebe et al 2005 the water storage area model was constructed by using the water storage information of some reservoirs obtained from the jiangxi hydrological monitoring center and area information was obtained by remote sensing on the corresponding date the empirical relationship between the water storage and the area of the lakes and reservoirs can be expressed as 1 v a area b where v is the water storage of the lake or reservoir area is the water surface area of the lake or reservoir and a and b are parameters especially in areas with a similar topography the parameters a and b are very similar annor et al 2009 this correlation is quite stable and can be replicated in time and space annor et al 2009 liebe et al 2005 therefore the expression of the empirical relationship between the water storage and the area of known reservoirs can be extended to unknown lake or reservoir regions with similar geomorphological relationships to make a more accurate estimation of the water storage all lakes and reservoirs were divided into two categories based on the similarity of geomorphology by the threshold of average slope cao et al 2011 a large number of experiments have proved that this average slope threshold is 17 in the poyang lake watershed the expressions of the empirical relationship between the water storage and area were respectively calculated fig 3 the appropriate relational expression was selected based on the average slope of all lakes and reservoirs the water storage of the lakes and reservoirs without operation data was calculated and combined with area information from 2016 to 2020 the complete water storage sequence of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 was thus obtained 3 2 determination of the flood peak threshold based on the pot model in order to describe the flood event quantitatively the peaks over threshold pot model was used to obtain the flood peak threshold the key is the determination of the independence of flood peak samples and the determination of the threshold value of the over quantitative sequence lang et al 1999 independent flood peak identification criterion proposed by the united states water resources association uswrc is as follows 2 θ ln area 5 and x min 0 75 min q 1 q 2 where θ is the time interval between the two flood peaks area is the area of the basin x min is the minimum value of the selected sample q i is the daily runoff of the i th flood peak among the continuous flood peaks that do not meet the above conditions only the largest one is selected the threshold value s is an important parameter to determine the sample of an over quantitative sequence the key to the selection of the threshold s is to make the extracted pot samples subject to certain standards lang et al 1999 suggested that the threshold should be determined based on the distribution of the number of occurrences of the over quantitative series the frequency of the over quantitative flood and the assumption of independent and identical distribution in combination with the over quantitative sample mean method davison et al 1990 the dispersion index method and the annual average number of over quantitative occurrences n method a larger threshold that meets the annual average number of an over quantity greater than 2 was selected 3 3 detained flood volume estimation based on the runoff weighted model flood detention refers to measures taken to retard or delay the speed of floods in a short period its purpose is to detain floods temporarily reduce peak flow and relieve the burden of floods in downstream rivers a traditional method is used to calculate the flood detention of small reservoirs cao et al 2011 the method is improved according to the specific conditions of the poyang lake watershed without the need to obtain precipitation and surface evapotranspiration data at the location of the lakes or reservoirs the detained flood volume of the entire lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins can be modeled only through remote sensing image information and runoff hydrological data the specific method is as follows the daily runoff data of the basins during the flood period were introduced and normalized to obtain the normalized daily runoff value between the adjacent two collection days during the flood occurrence period the water storage of the two adjacent collection days during the flood period is represented by v d k 1 and v d k 2 respectively the interval between the two collection days is d k 2 d k 1 days v d k 2 v d k 1 represents the detained flood volume of lrg during two adjacent collection days in the flood period then multiply the normalized runoff value of each day by the detained flood volume to obtain the daily detained flood volume during the adjacent two collection days the water storage volume v d k 1 of first collection day plus the detained flood volume of d k 1 1 day to obtain the water storage v d k 1 1 of d k 1 1 day during the flood period the above operations are performed on multiple collection days to obtain the daily water storage of single lake or reservoir during the flood period the daily water storage of lrg was obtained by summing the daily water storage of multiple lakes and reservoirs during the flood period the total detained flood volume of lrg in the basin during any flood period can be obtained by subtracting the water storage on the start date from end date of the flood 3 v d k 1 m v d k 1 i 1 m n d k 1 i v d k 2 v d k 1 v d k 1 and v d k 2 respectively represent the water storage of two adjacent collection days during the flood period the time interval between the two collection days is d k 2 d k 1 days n d k 1 i represents the normalized runoff value of day i during two adjacent collection days in the flood period m represents the m th day starting from d k 1 and v d k 1 m represents the water storage of lrg on the m th day starting from d k 1 3 4 the residence time calculation of retained floods for the lrg reservoirs are an integral part of water resource planning and management previous studies have shown that due to the residence of reservoirs these built up reservoirs have even reduced the magnitude of global sea level rise when the reservoir is built and put into operation the incoming water will be intercepted and the flow of released water will be reduced to varying degrees ran et al 2012 the residence of the reservoir increases the time needed for water to flow along the river to the ocean which affects the water flow and the water cycle in turn wisser et al 2010 the average time during which water stays in the reservoir is one of the key parameters that determine many direct and indirect changes in physical biogeochemical geomorphological and hydrological behavior wisser et al 2010 for all lakes and reservoirs located in the study area the average residence time is calculated as follows vörösmarty et al 2003 4 τ i 1 n v i q where v i represents the water storage of the lrg km3 q represents the flow of the hydrological station weekly that controls the runoff km3 week and n represents the number of lakes and reservoirs in the basin τ represents the average residence time week of the lrg in the basin multi source remote sensing data are used to form a weekly water storage sequence to more accurately describe the residence time of the lrg the unit of residence time is one week 4 results 4 1 satellite observed lrg water storage dynamics from 2016 to 2020 based on multi source remote sensing data the region of interest roi of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the poyang lake watershed was obtained water body extraction and water storage calculations were performed a frequency map of the water storage changes of all medium and large lakes and reservoirs was constructed in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 fig 4 a weekly total water storage sequence of the lrg was formed for each basin and the poyang lake watershed fig 5 floodplains refer to areas along rivers lakes and coastal areas that are prone to flooding they are alluvial plains formed by flooding here the inundation range of lakes and reservoirs in the floodplain changed substantially while the inundation range of the lakes and reservoirs in the mountainous area changed little fig 4 this is due to the fact that the reservoir is mostly built in mountainous area with a large drop covers a wide area and is controlled by the water storage and discharge all year round it results that the surface area of the reservoir does not change much over the same period of time each year it is reflected in remote sensing images as a slight spatial change in the inundation frequency the lakes around the floodplain are affected by the rising and falling tides of poyang lake and the flooding of the lake during the flood season and the spatial changes in the inundation frequency are more obvious which is shown in fig 4 in addition the lakes and reservoirs with larger storage capacity generally showed little spatial change in inundation frequency from 2016 2020 the water storage of each lrg in poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the first few months of each year water storage tends to decrease this trend continues until april when it starts to increase reaches a maximum in september and then declines again until it reaches its lowest point around march of the following year the weekly water storage sequence of the lrg in each basin of the poyang lake watershed fig 5 shows that the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins follow the pattern of low water storage during the dry season october march and large water storage during the wet season april september the same pattern is true in the poyang lake watershed and there is a clear trend of change it is reflected in the figure that the peak from october to march is concave and the peak from april to september is convex this is consistent with the changes in runoff during the dry and wet seasons among them the xiushui basin has the largest water storage mainly because the zhelin reservoir located in that basin has a large storage capacity even the water storage of the medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in this basin accounts for half of the entire poyang lake watershed 4 2 flood detention simulation of the lrg in the basin a quantitative description of flood events is provided based on independent flood peak discrimination criteria and the pot model combined with runoff data it can be seen that the number of flood peaks in each basin in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 is 1 and there is no continuous flood peak table 4 in order to explore the flood detention effect of the lrg in the basin the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins in the poyang lake watershed were taken as examples the flood peak sequence was extracted based on the pot method and indicators such as the number of annual over quantity the mean of the excess of sample the dispersion index i and the poisson distribution 5 95 confidence interval were selected to quantitatively describe flood daily runoff data from the wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang and hushan stations in the poyang lake watershed from 1955 to 2001 were used and combined with the pot model fig 6 to calculate the flood peak thresholds of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins the results are 1162 m3 s 11 500 m3 s 4150 m3 s 6224 m3 s and 2967 m3 s respectively table 4 the runoff data from 2016 to 2020 were combined with the flood peak thresholds to determine the peak date for each basin in the five year period this data was used as a benchmark to look forward and backward for the first lowest point of runoff in the overall downward trend and to mark it as the start and end date of the flood this paper proposes a runoff weighted model that is more mature than the traditional flood detention model it improves the calculation efficiency and applicability greatly without a loss of accuracy the pearson correlation coefficient between the traditional flood detention model and the runoff weighted model is 0 95 fig 7 three time points 2020 6 11 2020 6 18 and 2020 6 19 were selected for verification the results show that the accuracy of the two models is extremely similar which proves that there is indeed a positive relationship between flood detention and runoff in addition the runoff weighted model also solves the problem of missing water storage information at the time of interest due to insufficient image data according to the weekly water storage sequence of the lrg in each basin of the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model was used to calculate the detained flood volume the average annual total detained flood volume values of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins are 4 395 108 m3 5 061 108 m3 1 640 108 m3 0 535 108 m3 and 0 147 108 m3 respectively table 5 the xiushui and ganjiang basins contributed the most to flood detention mainly due to the large annual rainfall and the total water storage of the lrg in the xiushui and ganjiang basins the trend change in the flood detention capacity of the lrg during the flood period of different years was analyzed using the detained flood volume data of the past five years the commonalities and differences of the flood detention capacity in different basins can provide reference significance for lake and reservoir management and water resources dispatch 4 3 the residence time of retained flood by lrg according to the weekly water storage of the lrg and runoff in each basin of the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 the runoff weighted model was used to calculate the residence time of retained flood by lrg in recent years the annual flow of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers has become larger than the natural state in the dry season and smaller in the wet season as the water storage of lakes and reservoirs has a certain impact on the state of runoff when evaluating the hydrological changes caused by lakes and reservoirs special attention should be paid to the changes in the lakes and reservoirs and their related effects on runoff natural state fig 8 flow data without human activity no reservoir interference was calculated by averaging the runoff data from 1955 to 1960 the residence times of the average and annual state were each calculated from 2016 to 2020 fig 8 there will be a certain difference in the residence time of the two cases which can indicate whether the residence time of the lrg has a direct cumulative effect in addition according to the water storage time series of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 combined with the residence time model date residence time series of the lrg in the basin of the poyang lake watershed were constructed fig 8 which can clarify the annual magnitude analysis of flow regulation and serve as a basis for predicting future runoff flow regulation all basins follow the pattern of a long residence time in the dry season october to march and a short residence time in the wet season april to september fig 8 this is consistent with the changes in the runoff of the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe rivers during the dry and wet periods in recent years the residence time of the lrg in the basin during the dry season has become shorter than in the natural state especially in the xiushui and ganjiang basins fig 8 due to the increase of annual rainfall in the xiushui and ganjiang basins shown in the runoff data climate change has alleviated the drought in the study area as well as the frequent human water extraction activities irrigation and drinking water because the study area is small it takes a short time for the water to flow into poyang lake along the river the cumulative effect of stagnant water in the time dimension of the lrg is not obvious fig 8 the samples are only medium and large lakes and reservoirs there is a lack of small lakes and reservoirs and there may be slight errors in the results reservoir construction and other human activities have led to the continuous increase of water storage in the basin which may further extend the residence time of retained flood by lrg during dry season in the future thereby affecting the water cycle of the entire basin 4 4 delayed time of flood peaks by lrg medium and large lakes and reservoirs have not only changed the natural flow patterns of streams and rivers but also changed their flood cycle and peak magnitude the occurrence of flood peaks implies the continuous increase of runoff which is usually caused by continuous rainfall during the flood period the lakes and reservoirs consistently collect rainwater during the raining process the amount of rainfall that enters the surface runoff is reduced compared to the absence of lakes and reservoirs collection since flooding began the lakes and reservoirs have been constantly weakening the amount of runoff which can be considered as delaying the arrival of the flood peak this period of time is called the flood peak delay time in order to explore the delaying effect of the lrg on flood peaks the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins were considered as examples the pot model was used to calculate the threshold of flood peaks in each basin and the peak occurrence time of each basin from 2016 to 2020 was obtained the start and end times of the flood were determined by combining the water storage time series a statistical analysis of the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in each basin from 2016 to 2020 was carried out and the delay time of the lrg to flood peaks was estimated in each basin according to the delay capacity of the lrg in each basin the reservoirs were guided to construct the natural time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins was 18 33 15 19 and 19 days respectively table 6 in recent years the time taken to weaken the flood peak after the construction of the reservoir has been 30 40 28 41 and 45 days respectively table 7 from the perspective of the time dimension the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins from 2016 to 2020 has increased compared with the natural state except for the ganjiang basin the time taken to weaken the flood peak of other basins has increased approximately twofold compared to the natural state the construction of medium and large lakes and reservoirs does have a certain delay effect on flood peaks and the delay days of the lrg to flood peaks in each basin are about 12 7 13 22 and 26 days respectively from the perspective of the basin dimension the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins is up to 40 days while the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg in the xiushui and fuhe basins is about 29 days the main reasons for the difference between these times are as follows in terms of climate the annual average rainfall in the xiushui and fuhe basins is greater than that of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins the accumulation of flood peaks is strong and the formation time is fast so the time taken to weaken the flood peak of the lrg is short in terms of the number and size of lakes and reservoirs the number of lakes and reservoirs in the xiushui and fuhe basins is lower than that of the ganjiang xinjiang and raohe basins the total storage capacity of medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the former basin is also smaller than that of the latter as a result the water detention capacity of the former is insufficient and the time taken to weaken the flood peak is short in terms of the number of lake and reservoir samples this study selected medium and large lakes and reservoirs according to certain rules as the research sample based on information from a chinese lake database but some lake and reservoir samples that did not quite meet the inclusion criteria may have been missed resulting in slight errors in the results 5 discussion 5 1 implications of measures for flood prevention and mitigation lakes and reservoirs play an important role in buffering and regulating extreme hydrological events during the flood season larsen et al 2019 luo et al 2021 traditional flood detention simulation methods dai et al 2021 li and niu 2022 molénat et al 2021 terêncio et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and deep learning methods abid et al 2021 jing et al 2021 yaseen et al 2022 are quite mature we have done some work on water body extraction and water storage estimation chen et al 2021a liang et al 2020 ling et al 2020 the flood detention effect of lrgs in basins has been studied based on weekly long term water storage sequences the problem of large errors between research and real results caused by an insufficient amount of data and the time scale of the traditional methods has been solved however traditional research work limited to cascade reservoirs along the rivers do not consider the impact of lrgs that distribute far away the rivers this paper divides the poyang lake watershed into five basins the comprehensive effects of the lrg in the basins on hydrological changes are considered and the flood detention effect of the upstream lrg on floods is discussed the operation of reservoirs in a region is of great significance to water resource management especially in mitigating flood disasters therefore determining the relationship between the water storage of the lrg and the runoff in the basin is one of the most important problems faced by hydrologists and engineering technicians this type of information is needed for hydrological engineering construction and water resource management the comprehensive effect of the lrg is more convincing than the impact of a single reservoir on runoff in a basin higher time scales can describe flood events more accurately and this is impossible with traditional low time scale methods therefore in terms of flood disaster research it is important to expand the scope of the research and consider the comprehensive impact of the lrg on runoff in addition the acquisition of higher time scales in related research will also make the research results more accurate this is also an endeavor for future research 5 2 uncertainty and limitation this paper constructed a weekly image sequence of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed from 2016 to 2020 based on gf 1 and sentinel 1 imagery experiments suggest that the iterative algorithm is more suitable for extracting lakes from gf 1 images the ostu algorithm is more suitable for extracting the inundation area of lakes and reservoirs from sentinel 1 images these conclusions are consistent with the views of chen et al 2021c compared with traditional water storage estimation methods based on the dem and 3d gis tools the water storage area model cao et al 2011 ran et al 2012 solves the limitations of the traditional methods since the traditional method is limited by the shape of the reservoir and the size of the contour distance the calculation is cumbersome because the water level information is difficult to measure for small water body and the calculation of each parameter requires the participation of water level information an empirical model that is more mature than the traditional flood detention model is proposed here which greatly improves the calculation efficiency and applicability without a loss of accuracy this method does not need to obtain precipitation and surface evapotranspiration data at the locations of the lakes and reservoirs only the water storage information obtained from remote sensing images and the hydrological runoff data are needed these are applied to simulate the detained flood volume of medium and large lakes and reservoirs in the lrg in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins the pearson correlation coefficient between the traditional flood detention model cao et al 2011 and the proposed runoff weighted model is 0 95 and three time points 2020 6 11 2020 6 18 and 2020 6 19 were selected for verification the results suggest that the accuracy of the two is very similar fig 7 which suggests that there is indeed a positive relationship between flood detention and runoff in addition the runoff weighted model also solves the problem of missing water storage information at the time of interest due to insufficient image data compared with the traditional work ran et al 2012 we used a more high scale series of water storage of the lrg in the basin and the study area was narrowed to the poyang lake watershed this solves a number of problems that the scope of the study area and the research objects is too wide that there is no quantitative analysis of the residence effect of individual lakes and reservoirs in the study area that the research scale is relatively short and that it is impossible to assess the problem of changing trends in addition the hydrological model is suitable for long term hydrological and related process simulation and some scholars use it for flood simulation huo et al 2021 jin et al 2017 however it is difficult to acquire sufficient data for such a massive lakes and reservoirs in the hydrological model our remote sensing monitoring results provide a wealth of time series weekly data of the lrg for the hydrological model the weekly water storage data obtained in this study can be used to drive the hydrological model that is integrated with lake and reservoir regulations in the watershed this can allow for a more accurate understanding of the water cycle process in the basin and for hydrological and flood forecasts with high accuracy 6 conclusions this study provides an effective method for the remote sensing estimation of water storage of the lrgs in a basin with high temporal and spatial resolution the weekly high temporal spatial resolution image library was built from gf 1 and sentinel 1 the extracted water surface area sequence can better capture changes in the water storage of the lrg in the poyang lake watershed during the flood events of 2016 2020 the weekly water storage volume of lrg in the poyang lake watershed showed a unimodal trend of increasing april september first and then decreasing october march from 2016 to 2020 the inundation range of lrg in the floodplain changed substantially while in the mountainous area changed little the lrg with larger storage capacity generally showed little spatial change in inundation frequency and this applies to any area the average annual total detained flood volume values of the lrg from 2016 to 2020 in the xiushui ganjiang fuhe xinjiang and raohe basins are 4 395 108 m3 5 061 108 m3 1 640 108 m3 0 535 108 m3 and 0 147 108 m3 the detained flood volume in the xiushui and ganjiang basins is greater than that in the other basins and the contribution of flood detention is the greatest all basins follow the pattern of a long residence time during the dry season from october to march and a short residence time during the wet season from april to september the cumulative effect of stagnant water in the time dimension of the lrg is not obvious the construction of medium and large lakes or reservoirs will indeed delay flood peaks to a certain extent more importantly the flood detention effect of the lrg played an important role in mitigating extreme hydrological events in the poyang lake watershed this fills the gap in the comprehensive understanding of the role of lakes and reservoirs and other small water bodies in mitigating extreme hydrological events in the basin the method used in this study is expected to be applicable to other areas to resist floods it can help decision makers and stakeholders determine the flood storage capacity of lakes and reservoirs in the basin reducing losses caused by future floods in addition the evaluation of the change trend of runoff and water storage in the poyang lake watershed during the flooding period this can provide a certain scientific basis for flood prevention and mitigation to ensure the healthy development of the region credit

7843,study region wami ruvu basin wrb 66 899 km2 in tanzania study focus the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance sensitivity and uncertainty of the conceptual hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model in wrb the sensitivity interdependency and identifiability analysis was conducted to determine the most influential and uncertain parameters the one factor at a time oat method was used for evaluating parameter sensitivity whereas monte carlo simulation mcs was employed for parameter identifiability analysis model calibration and quantifying prediction uncertainties the model performance was evaluated by using statistical criteria hydrographs and flow duration curves fdcs new hydrological insights for the region the sensitivity analysis revealed that 7 parameters have a significant influence on model output the degree of sensitivity was found to depend on objective functions and catchment characteristics the identifiability analysis revealed significant parameter uncertainties which influence model predictions however most of the observed and simulated streamflow were within the 95 uncertainty range also the performance evaluation revealed that the observed streamflow were simulated with an acceptable degree of accuracy therefore the model is suitable for wrb these results will assist in efficient calibration reducing uncertainties and application of the hbv model which is useful for planning and decision making in light of challenges associated with climate change design and management of water resources infrastructures in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords hbv model hydrological modeling sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis wami ruvu basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction hydrological models are currently among the essential tools for understanding hydrological processes and ensuring water availability in catchments devia et al 2015 in most cases they are developed for use in areas with diverse characteristics such as land use soil type topography and climate song et al 2015 consequently they have parameters that are usually adjusted with respect to catchment characteristics and climatic conditions pechlivanidis et al 2011 however most parameters cannot be directly accurately measured hence calibration is usually required in order to increase the accuracy of prediction in the area of interest herrera et al 2022 model calibration is the process of identifying optimal model parameters by comparing the observed and simulated values wagener et al 2003 in this process the parameters are adjusted by using automatic or manual techniques until the observed and predicted values show the predefined degree of similarity this is usually not an easy task partly because parameters may not represent accurately the processes in the catchment and thus uncertainties are always encountered abebe et al 2010 according to song et al 2015 model uncertainties are also amplified by input data boundary conditions and model structure which essentially degrades the accuracy of the predictions in hydrological studies it is considered good practice to analyze the uncertainties in the model output and quantifying the extent to which the model parameters contribute to these uncertainties i e sensitivity analysis song et al 2015 over the past years several methods have been developed to optimize parameters and quantify uncertainties encountered in hydrological models pechlivanidis et al 2011 however it is not always practical to incorporate all parameters during calibration process because not all parameters have significant impact on model outputs song et al 2015 thus less sensitive parameters are usually fixed in order to increase the speed of the calibration process the sensitivity of model parameters depends on the catchment physical characteristics and climatic conditions ouyang et al 2014 hence sensitivity results are usually not transferable from one catchment to another ouatiki et al 2020 there are two main categories of methods for sensitivity analysis the first category is global sensitivity analysis gsa which examines the sensitivity with respect to entire parameter space over the predefined feasible parameter range pechlivanidis et al 2011 the gsa can be done through various methods including stepwise regression analysis mutual information analysis classification tree analysis and meta modeling method song et al 2015 the second category is local sensitivity analysis lsa which employs tradition methods that involve perturbation of each parameter with a reference objective function whilst fixing the others song et al 2015 in most cases the selection of sensitivity analysis method depend on the study purpose because each method has own advantages and limitations ouatiki et al 2020 however lsa is considered advantageous due to its simplicity and less computation requirements herrera et al 2022 characterization of model inputs uncertainties and parameter sampling usually follows after identification of sensitive parameters nonki et al 2021 pechlivanidis et al 2011 since most hydrological models are non linear computation probability density functions are usually required for assessing parameter uncertainties pechlivanidis et al 2011 in this context probability distributions are usually computed by using a number of methods including monte carlo simulation mcs khu and werner 2003 or more advanced uncertainty analysis frameworks such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi abbaspour et al 2004 in hydrological modeling the mcs is still widely used because of its flexibility and robustness in parameter sampling herrera et al 2022 osuch et al 2015 the performance of hydrological models is usually quantified by selected objective functions ouyang et al 2014 the objective functions assess the model performance in different aspects hence the results are usually biased on individual aspects of the hydrograph in this context studies recommend employing multi objective functions for evaluating the overall performance of the model abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 this study focuses on the performance sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation of the hbv model hbv is a semi distributed conceptual model that is among the widely used hydrologic models around the globe bergström 2006 bizuneh et al 2021 pervin et al 2021 shiwakoti 2017 in sub saharan catchments the model has been widely used for climate change studies hydrological predictions and computing the design floods for numerous catchments goshime et al 2021 shagega et al 2019 valimba and mahe 2020 in addition several studies show that the hbv model offers comparable better performance than other widely used hydrological models in the region ayalew 2019 bizuneh et al 2021 tibangayuka et al 2022a since the hbv is a conceptual model the parameters have to be determined through model calibration partly because they cannot be directly measured bergström 1992 thus sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are important in order to obtain efficient results seibert 1997 this study is following the results of abebe et al 2010 in covington county mississippi seibert 1997 in savannah and svartbn river catchments of sweden osuch et al 2015 in wieprz catchment of poland ouatiki et al 2020 in oum er rbia catchment of morocco nonki et al 2021 in upper benue river basin of cameroon uhlenbrook et al 1999 in brugga basin of southwestern germany and ouyang et al 2014 in pailugou catchment of northwest china all these studies have indicated that the sensitivity and uncertainty of hbv model parameters vary depending on the characteristics of an area of interest they also concluded that uncertainty analysis is important when the hbv model predictions are used for decision making however previous studies only examined the uncertainty of the hbv model in small and medium sized catchments mostly less than 5000 square kilometers besides few studies have been carried out in sub humid watersheds which is the focus of this study also several studies have showed that most catchments in the region are faced with the impacts of climate change gulacha and mulungu 2017 rotich and mulungu 2017 shagega et al 2018 tibangayuka et al 2022b and hence hydrological modeling is highly required for planning and management of water resources infrastructures therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the sensitivity and interdependency of hbv model parameters 2 evaluate the identifiability of the hbv model parameters 3 evaluate the implications of parameter uncertainties in hbv model predictions and 4 evaluate the performance of hbv model in wrb understanding hbv model uncertainties and performance will potentially enable efficient calibration and improvement of hydrological predictions since it is among the widely used models in the region kamwaga et al 2018 koutsouris et al 2017 shagega et al 2019 valimba and mahe 2020 besides the results of this study will enable a better understanding of the hydrological processes in the sub humid tropical region 2 study area this study focuses on the wami ruvu basin located between latitude 5 s and 8 s and longitude 35 e and 39 e the basin extends from a semi arid region in central tanzania to the indian ocean with a drainage area of approximately 66 899 square kilometers fig 1a the basin elevation ranges between 7 and 2636 masl and the slope ranges between 0 and 199 fig 1b higher elevations and slopes are found in the uluguru mountains which are part of the eastern arc mountains the basin main rivers are wami and ruvu which drain an area of approximately 43 700 and 18 000 square kilometers respectively the major soil types in the basin are ferralic cambiso rhodic ferrasols chromic luvisols and mollic fluvisols which occupy approximately 66 of the basin area fig 1c other soil types include eutric fluvisols umbric nitisols eutric vertisols eutric planosols eutric leptosols cambic arenosols haplic luvisols haplic phaeozems umbric acrisols lithic leptosols haplic acrisols and haplic lixisols which occupy a total area of approximately 34 in recent years the basin land cover has been slightly disturbed due to ongoing cultivation deforestation and the establishment of human settlements as shown in fig 1d approximately 11 and 0 3 of the basin area are occupied by cultivated land and urban areas respectively about 88 7 of the basin area remains undisturbed comprising natural vegetation the hydrology of the wami ruvu basin is comprised of the wami and ruvu rivers along with their tributaries these rivers have economic importance for the central and eastern regions of tanzania serving a population of approximately 10 918 185 urt 2020 both rivers are used for irrigation and industrial and domestic water supply also there are a total of eight proposed hydropower plants 5 in wami and 3 in ruvu that are at the initial stage of implementation urt 2020 the rainfall pattern varies spatially and temporarily in the basin the northeastern area which falls in the central region of tanzania has a unimodal rainfall pattern occurring between december and april whereas the eastern area has a bi modal rainfall pattern occurring between october and december and march to may the rainfall distribution and variability in the basin are mostly driven by the migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz in the north and south across the equator tma 2020 the itcz migrates from the south to northern areas of tanzania between march and may and reverses toward the southern areas between october and december as a result of this movement some areas in the basin have a single and double passage of itcz that causes unimodal and bi modal patterns respectively the mean monthly temperature in the basin ranges from 14 c to 27 c the streamflow varies spatially and temporally depending on the sub catchment characteristics and the rainfall pattern however the peak flows are normally observed between april and may while the low flows are normally observed in october on the other hand the magnitude of peak and low flows varies significantly across sub catchments fig 2 presents the temporal variability of streamflow for three sub catchments considered in this study upper ruvu wami and mkondoa 3 data availability in this study the observed rainfall temperature and streamflow datasets were used for the setup and calibration of the hbv model the observed daily rainfall and streamflow data for 34 rainfall and 15 streamflow gauging stations fig 1a were obtained from the wami ruvu water basin offices and the water resources department database at the university of dar es salaam the data quality check revealed that 9 rainfall stations had more than 20 of missing data hence they were not suitable for use in this study consequently the rainfall data from 25 rainfall stations were used in this study similarly 3 streamflow gauging stations 1h10 1g1 1gd2 were found to represent significant drainage areas and have adequate data for hbv model calibration 1h10 is located in upper ruvu river with a drainage area of 6237 km2 1g1 is located in wami river with a drainage area of 5095 km2 and 1gd2 is located in mkondoa river with a drainage area of 17 826 km2 however approximately 13 550 km2 of the drainage area for 1gd2 corresponds to the kinyasungwe river fig 1a the observed temperature data for 2 stations morogoro meteorological station and dodoma airport station were also acquired from the water resource department of the university of dar es salaam database the potential evapotranspiration pet were computed from minimum and maximum temperature values by using the hargreaves formula hargreaves 1994 hargreaves and allen 2003 hargreaves and samani 1982 this method is highly recommended for the calculation of pet in areas with limited data allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 the areal values of rainfall were computed by using the thiessen polygon method shown in eq 1 this method was selected because the basin rainfall stations are not evenly distributed hence areal significance of each point rainfall value should be considered olawoyin and acheampong 2017 besides several studies recommend the use of the thiessen polygon method in the region aliye et al 2020 gumindoga et al 2017 tegegne et al 2017 valimba and mahe 2020 1 p a i 1 n p i a i a t where a i a t is an area weighting factor pi is a point value recorded at particular station and pa is mean areal rainfall also the space shuttle radar topographical mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer and used for catchment delineation the soil and land use cover data were obtained from the fao harmonized world soil database https www fao org soils portal data hub and usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov respectively these data were used for the analysis of basin characteristics 4 methods 4 1 description of hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv fig 3 is a semi distributed and conceptual rainfall runoff model originally developed by swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergström 1992 the hbv model was selected for this study because apart from being the widely used model in the region it offers better performance as opposed to other models in the region tibangayuka et al 2022a it requires less data i e rainfall temperature and pet which are normally available in most catchments in the region it has a simple structure and is hence easy to set up and calibrate and it is freely available and thus very useful in developing countries where the funds for commercial software are usually scarce urt 2020 the model computes daily river discharge by utilizing daily areal precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs it consists of five modules namely precipitation routine soil moisture routine baseflow routine fast runoff routine and flow routing routine seibert 2005 the precipitation is either simulated as snowfall or rainfall depending on whether the measured temperature is below or above the specified threshold tt snowfall is added to the dry snow reservoir while meltwater and rainfall are directly added to the free water reservoir bergström 1992 the snow component of the model was not used in this study hence the precipitation was only simulated as rainfall the rainfall from the precipitation routine is input into the soil moisture routine ouyang et al 2014 seibert 2005 the soil moisture reservoir represents the amount of soil moisture available in the catchment ouyang et al 2014 its inflows are precipitation and snowmelt and its outflows are direct runoff seepage and evapotranspiration when the maximum storage in this reservoir is reached direct runoff occurs seibert 2005 the contribution of soil moisture routine to the generation of surface runoff from a given rainfall event is small for dry soil but it increases during wet conditions seibert 2005 the runoff delay is computed by using two reservoirs the first reservoir represents fast runoff which includes direct runoff and interflow while the second reservoir represents baseflow bergström 1992 the fast runoff is the first part of the response routine in which the outflows from the soil moisture routine direct runoff and seepage are used as inflows the water from the upper groundwater reservoir percolates into the baseflow reservoir until the specified threshold is exceeded the baseflow reservoir represents the groundwater storage that contributes to the stream baseflow seibert and vis 2012 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is usually important to identify the most influential parameters and understand the extent to which the model realistically represents the real world song et al 2015 in this study the local sensitivity analysis i e one factor at a time oat was employed pechlivanidis et al 2011 it is a robust and widely used method for identifying influential parameters in hydrological models abebe et al 2010 ayalew 2019 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 in this technique one parameter is varied repeatedly while keeping the others constant prior to sensitivity analysis the model was calibrated to get the baseline model performance the sensitivity analysis was done with respect to four objective functions namely nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the kling gupta efficiency kge these statistical criteria are highly recommended and widely used in hydrological modeling gupta and kling 2011 their mathematical description optimal values and thresholds are presented in table 1 during sensitivity analysis 5000 random values for each model parameter were generated by monte carlo sampling of which uniform distribution was utilized then the model was run for each generated parameter value while keeping other parameters constant and the model performance based on four objective functions shown in table 1 was recorded 4 3 parameter interdependency as part of sensitivity analysis assessing the parameter interdependency is considered important for understanding model processes and determining the interaction between model parameters furthermore parameter interdependency help in the identification of parameter pairs that yield the optimum model performance ouatiki et al 2020 the parameters are considered interdependent when the change in one parameter offsets the other parameter in order to provide optimum model performance ouatiki et al 2020 in other words the optimum parameters are usually found on a narrow or wider region for non dependent and interdependent parameters respectively in this study the interdependency of sensitive parameters was assessed by the two factors at a time tat method which involves varying two parameters while keeping other parameters constant ouatiki et al 2020 in this step the objective function was the nse described in table 1 the single objective function was selected as opposed to multi objective functions in order to reduce the number of computations 4 4 parameter identifiability parameter identifiability helps to understand the extent to which a parameter is defined within the model structure abebe et al 2010 identifiability essentially measures the closeness of grouped values among the parameter sets that yield good results the parameter is considered well or ill defined when the behavioral parameter values are found on a narrow or wide range respectively in other words if the parameter lies within a narrow band then it can be precisely identified nonki et al 2021 in this study the monte carlo simulation was employed for parameter identifiability analysis the number of simulations was set to 100 000 and then behavioral parameter sets were selected based on the threshold nse r2 kge and pbias of 0 65 0 7 0 65 and 25 respectively the number of simulations and threshold values were selected based on the recommendation from past studies abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 the cumulative probabilities and their corresponding gradients for behavior parameters were then computed and used as the measure for the extent of parameter identifiability for non identifiable parameters the posterior probability distribution and cumulative probability distribution will have a slope of nearly 1 1 abebe et al 2010 4 5 uncertainties in model simulations and performance evaluation in this step the uncertainties of the model simulations resulting from parameters uncertainty were assessed firstly the model was run by using behavioral parameter sets identified in identifiability analysis then the lower and upper uncertainty bounds based on 95 confidence intervals were computed the model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed and simulated hydrograph statistical ratings nse kge r2 and pbias and the flow duration curves fdcs the flow hydrographs help to assess the difference in the overall pattern of streamflow as well as the magnitude and timing of the peak and low flows nonki et al 2021 the statistical criteria help to express the similarity between observed and simulated streamflow as a single number hence the model performance can be quickly assessed gupta and kling 2011 and the fdcs help to assess the model performance over the specified range of streamflows saez et al 2018 the best simulated streamflow based on these criteria was then selected and compared to the observed streamflow 5 results and discussion 5 1 individual sensitivity analysis fig 4 presents the results of individual parameter sensitivity analysis with respect to 4 objective functions nse kge r2 and pbias employed in this study the results show that the limit of potential evapotranspiration lp and beta were the most sensitive parameters in all sub catchments however their influence on model output varies depending on the gauging station sub catchment and the objective functions in the hbv model structure fig 3 the lp parameter determines the shape of the reduction curve for potential evapotranspiration which is reduced when the soil moisture values are below the specified value of lp seibert 1997 on the other hand the beta parameter determines the relative contribution of runoff from a given amount of rain with respect to soil moisture deficit bergström 1992 therefore the differences in sensitivity of lp and beta parameters across catchments are supposedly associated with the variation of land use cover climate and topography in the basin as showed in fig 1d the wami and mkondoa sub catchments are predominated by bushland grassland and cultivated areas which are characterized by high evapotranspiration and low infiltration rates as opposed to natural forests and woodland which predominate the upper ruvu sub catchment chandler and chappell 2008 gonzalez sosa et al 2010 the difference in sensitivity of these parameters might also be associated with the variability of rainfall across basin sub catchments with areas located in the eastern part of the basin upper ruvu receiving more rainfall compared to other areas high rainfall increases the amount of surface runoff which alters the effect of the beta parameter moreover higher slopes in the upper ruvu sub catchment limit the amount of water available for evaporation which might also alter the influence of the lp parameter furthermore the difference in sensitivity for these parameters can be attributed to variations in soil type across sub catchments fig 1c the mkondoa and wami sub catchments are predominated by chromic luvisols umbric nitisols and ferralic cambiso which are well drained as opposed to umbric acrisols and rhodic ferrasols which predominates the upper ruvu sub catchment moroke et al 2009 also the results revealed that the sensitivity of k0 k1 k2 and maxbas parameters varies spatially in the basin in the hbv model structure these parameters are part of the response routine which controls the overland flow surface runoff and groundwater contribution bergström 1992 therefore they are also affected by land use cover and soil characteristics which explains their spatial variability in addition these parameters were revealed to be more sensitive with respect to nse r2 and kge but they were not sensitive with respect to the pbias objective function which implies that they control the shape of outflow hydrographs but have less impact on overall volume conversely the k0 parameter was found to be not sensitive in all sub catchments in the hbv model structure the k0 parameter only influences the streamflow when the limit for the upper groundwater reservoir fast interflow component uzl is exceeded fig 3 hence low sensitivity of k0 implies that all infiltrated water percolates to the deeper layer of the soil to form groundwater furthermore the results revealed that fc and perc parameters are relatively sensitive across all sub catchments however it was also found that their degree of sensitivity varies across sub catchments and depends on the objective function in the hbv model structure the perc parameter controls the amount of water that escapes from the upper to a deep groundwater reservoir the fc is the maximum soil moisture storage which also determines the amount of water moving to the upper groundwater reservoir seibert 2005 therefore both fc and perc are directly linked to topography and soil properties high porous soils have higher hydraulic conductivity hence large values of the perc parameter tarawally et al 2004 whereas ground slope alters the amount of water available for percolation alam et al 2017 mu et al 2015 this explains the high sensitivity of perc in mkondoa and upper ruvu which have relatively high slopes compared to the wami sub catchment fig 1b the fc parameter highly depends on the water holding capacity of the soil hence differences in its sensitivity across sub catchments can also be associated with variation in soil types fig 1b on the other hand the high sensitivity of perc to nse r2 and kge imply that it influences the outflow hydrograph whereas low sensitivity to pbias suggests that it has no impact on overall volume in contrast the sensitivity of the fc parameter to all objective functions implies that it affects both the outflow hydrograph and the overall volume 5 2 parameter interdependency the results revealed that there is interaction for some sensitive parameters as shown in fig 5 in general the lp and beta parameters showed more influence on model performance when they are simultaneously varied with other sensitive parameters in other words their influence on model output cannot be counterbalanced by any other parameters in addition the lp and beta pair yielded the maximum model performance these results are not astonishing considering these parameters directly affect the generation of surface runoff in wami ruvu basin sub catchments hence they have more influence compared to response routine parameters k0 k1 k2 and maxbas remarkably the lp and beta couple showed some interdependency but lp exhibited more influence in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments figs 5b and 5c the strong influence of lp suggests that the hydrology of these sub catchments is highly sensitive to the amount of water lost by evapotranspiration these findings are not surprising considering the predominance of land use cover grassland bushland and cultivated land that favors evapotranspiration in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments on the other hand the beta parameter exhibited more influence in the upper ruvu sub catchment fig 5a theoretically more influence of the beta parameter is an indication that the surface runoff is significantly greater than the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration therefore the influence of beta in upper ruvu can be related to the presence of natural forests and woodland which potentially reduce the amount of water lost by evapotranspiration in contrast the k2 and maxbas consistently indicated less influence across all sub catchments when they varied simultaneously with other parameters as opposed to combinations of beta and lp parameters this is partly because the generation of basin streamflow is more dependent on surface runoff and evapotranspiration than on baseflow which is determined by these parameters 5 3 parameter identifiability and model calibration fig 6 presents the results of the parameters identifiability analysis carried out by using mcs in this step the parameters were sampled simultaneously whereby 23 641 and 76 359 in upper ruvu 32 803 and 67 197 in wami and 12 182 and 87 818 in mkondoa sub catchments were classified as behavioral and non behavioral runs respectively the ranges of model parameters used during mcs are presented in table 2 in general the results revealed that the identifiability of model parameters varies across catchments however it was found that lp and beta parameters are precisely identifiable in all sub catchments these findings are not surprising given that the lp and beta parameters are directly related to the generation of surface runoff and hence have a considerable effect on the streamflow hydrograph particularly the peak flows also the results revealed that the k2 parameter is well identifiable in all sub catchments in the hbv model the k2 parameter controls the deep groundwater reservoir and hence has a direct influence on the outflow hydrograph the higher value of k2 is an indication that the percolated water does not reach the stream because it remains in the deep aquifer abebe et al 2010 in contrast perc fc uzl k0 and k1 parameters were less identifiable across all sub catchments in the hbv model structure the uzl and k0 control the third groundwater reservoir which was not filled in all catchments hence they do not influence model output at all on the other hand less identifiability of perc and fc parameters can be associated with the low contribution of baseflow on basin sub catchments also the less identifiability of these parameters can be attributed to the use of nse as an objective function the nse emphasizes better simulation of peak flows which are largely influenced by surface runoff mccuen et al 2006 the identifiability of the maxbas parameter was found to vary spatially in the basin it showed to be well identifiable in the upper ruvu and mkondoa and less identifiable in the wami sub catchment in the hbv model the maxbas parameter is the routing parameter that determines the shape of the hydrograph by delaying the computed outflow hence the difference in its identifiability can be related to the variation of topography across catchments the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments have relatively higher ground slopes compared to the wami sub catchment fig 1b which causes faster movement of streamflow towards the sub catchment outlets consequently the streamflow delay has more impact on the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments resulting in higher influence and identifiability of the maxbas parameter in general it was found that highly sensitive parameters tend to be more identifiable as compared to less sensitive parameters these results are consistent with nonki et al 2021 who also found that sensitive parameters are more identifiable compared to less sensitive parameters this highlights the need of fixing the less sensitive parameters during the model calibration process in order to reduce uncertainties in the model predictions abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 5 4 implications of parameters uncertainty in model simulations fig 7 presents the uncertainty bounds of model simulations computed by running the model against each of the behavioral parameter sets the results indicate that most of the simulated streamflow lies within the 95 uncertainty range but some of the observed peak flows were outside of the range during model calibration and validation this might be associated with the climate and basin characteristics the basin usually experiences extreme climatic events which are normally associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod tma 2020 on the other hand surface runoff plays a significant role in the generation of streamflow due to basin topography thus the occurrence of heavy rainfall events results in distinct peak floods that are not well matched by the model however underestimation of peak flows has also been reported in several studies bizuneh et al 2021 goshime et al 2021 koutsouris et al 2017 nonki et al 2021 shagega et al 2019 hence it might also be associated with the model structure 5 5 model calibration results and performance evaluation table 2 presents the calibrated model parameters in the wrb sub catchments in general the optimal parameters vary across sub catchments the soil moisture parameters fc beta and lp showed significant differences in each sub catchment especially in upper ruvu these parameters depend on the land use cover and soil type which differ significantly in upper ruvu the response parameters also indicated some differences especially perc k1 and maxbas the higher value of the perc parameter in the wami sub catchment is an indication that the amount of rainfall contributing to groundwater is relatively higher compared to the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments this can be attributed to basin topography particularly the lower ground slopes in the wami sub catchment that potentially allow more water to infiltrate in addition the k2 parameter showed consistency in the upper ruvu and wami sub catchments but a significant difference was indicated in the mkondoa sub catchment different values of k2 might also be associated with variations in land use soil type and topography fig 1 which alter groundwater contribution in these sub catchments on the other hand the uzl and k0 were not sensitive in all sub catchments hence any value could not have changed model performance performance evaluation by using the statistical criteria table 3 indicates that the model was able to simulate the basin streamflow adequately the calibration results yielded the nse range of 0 67 0 73 the kge range of 0 71 0 83 the r2 range of 0 69 0 73 and the pbias of 1 11 in all sub catchments on the other hand the nse range of 0 6 0 83 the kge range of 0 57 0 58 the r2 range of 0 72 0 91 and the pbias range of 8 26 were obtained during validation according to moriasi et al 2007 the nse range of 0 65 0 75 and more than 0 75 are interpreted as good and very good respectively whereas the pbias range of 25 50 and less than 25 are interpreted as good and very good respectively additionally the hydrographs of observed and best simulated streamflow fig 8 showed that the hbv model was able to simulate well the overall pattern and timing of low and high flows however the magnitude of peak flows was not matched well in all sub catchments in general the statistical ratings and hydrographs of observed and simulated streamflow revealed that the model performed with an acceptable degree of accuracy during both calibration and validation periods in all sub catchments the flow duration curves fdcs help to assess the model performance in the quantile domain hence the flow ranges for which the model performs best can be accurately determined saez et al 2018 fig 9 presents the fdcs for observed and simulated streamflow during calibration and validation for effective analysis of fdcs the streamflow was classified into five segments namely very high flow more than q5 high flow q5 q20 medium flow q20 q70 low flow q70 q95 and very low flow less than q95 whereby qj is the discharge q with the probability of exceedance j these segments were selected because they are widely used by planners in designing and managing water resources in catchments saez et al 2018 as shown in fig 9a the observed streamflow in the upper ruvu sub catchment lies within the uncertainty range except for low flows q20 which were above the uncertainty range also the best simulated matched well with observed streamflow in the calibration period however the high flows q20 and low flows q70 were slightly underestimated during validation in upper ruvu in contrast the low and moderate streamflow q10 were within the uncertainty range in the wami sub catchment but the observed high flows q10 were above of uncertainty range fig 9b also the best simulated did not match well with the observed streamflow in wami sub catchment for all ranges except q10 and q90 during calibration and q20 and q70 during validation on the other hand the observed moderate streamflows q25 q60 were within the uncertainty range in the mkondoa sub catchment fig 9c but very high q5 and low flows q60 were below the uncertainty range notably the validation results revealed that all flow segments except for q90 were not accurately simulated in the mkondoa sub catchment these results are not surprising because of the temporal variation of streamflow in wrb as explained in section 5 4 there are distinct peak flows caused by heavy rainfall events in the basin sub catchments hence the model tries to counterbalance these peaks with the rest of the streamflow range to yield optimal performance 6 summary and conclusion sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are among the essential components for the calibration and application of hydrological models the predictions of hydrological models are usually less reliable when associated uncertainties are unknown rafiei emam et al 2018 this work focused on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis as well as performance evaluation of the hbv model in three sub catchments of the wami ruvu basin in tanzania the individual parameter sensitivity and parameter interdependency analysis was done by using local sensitivity methods varying one and two parameters at a time respectively whereas the model calibration and uncertainty analysis were done by monte carlo simulation mcs performance evaluation was done by using multi objective functions nse kge r2 and pbias hydrographs and flow duration curves fdcs the results revealed that the lp and beta parameters are more sensitive with reference to nse r2 kge and pbias measures for all catchments the k1 k2 and maxbas parameters were also sensitive with respect to nse kge and r2 measures but their influence was less significant as compared to the lp and beta parameters in addition the perc k1 k2 and maxbas parameters were less sensitive with respect to pbias on the other hand the fc parameter was relatively sensitive in all catchments with respect to all objective functions but it has less influence compared to the perc lp beta k2 and maxbas parameters with respect to the nse r2 and kge measures on the contrary the uzl and k0 parameters were not sensitive in all catchments with respect to all objective functions the parameter interdependency analysis revealed that the lp and beta parameters are the least dependent hence their influence cannot be counterbalanced by other parameters also the combination of these parameters yields maximum performance this highlighted the significance of surface runoff and evapotranspiration processes in the basin furthermore the monte carlo simulation revealed that the identifiability of the model parameters varies from one catchment to another however it was found that lp beta and k2 parameters are more identifiable whereas perc fc uzl k0 and k1 parameters are least identifiable in all catchments in general less sensitive and least identifiable parameters can be kept constant during hbv model calibration this will essentially reduce uncertainties in the model predictions and save time as well as computation resources that are consumed during the calibration process abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 the sensitivity results also highlighted the importance of employing multi objective functions toward reducing uncertainties in hbv model predictions furthermore the results revealed that parameter uncertainties have significant implications on model output in general it was found that the observed flows were within the uncertainty range but the peak flows were mostly outside of the uncertainty range moreover the hydrographs of observed and simulated streamflow indicated that the overall streamflow pattern and timing of low and high flows were well matched the statistical criteria also showed that the model performed well in wrb however the extent of performance was found to vary across basin sub catchments during calibration the best simulated streamflow had the nse of 0 71 0 67 and 0 73 the kge of 0 71 0 76 and 0 83 the r2 of 0 72 0 69 and 0 73 and the pbias of 3 11 and 1 in upper ruvu wami and mkondoa sub catchments respectively during the model validation the nse of 0 60 0 81 and 0 73 the kge of 0 57 0 78 and 0 73 the r2 of 0 75 0 72 and 0 91 and pbias of 26 8 and 14 were obtained at upper ruvu wami and mkondoa sub catchments respectively on the other hand the flow duration curves revealed that the model performed well in all flow segments at upper ruvu during calibration however the low and peak flows were underestimated during model validation furthermore the results indicated that moderate and low flows were not adequately simulated during validation in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments in summary the results revealed that sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of hbv model parameters is important for efficient calibration and streamflow prediction the performance evaluation revealed that the model simulates well the daily streamflow of wrb hence it can be applied in all of its sub catchments this study gave insight into the performance sensitivity and uncertainties associated with hbv model parameters and predictions in wrb also it will be a starting point for the application of the model in other watersheds found in the humid tropical region moreover these findings will assist water resource planners researchers and decision makers in addressing the current

7843,study region wami ruvu basin wrb 66 899 km2 in tanzania study focus the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance sensitivity and uncertainty of the conceptual hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model in wrb the sensitivity interdependency and identifiability analysis was conducted to determine the most influential and uncertain parameters the one factor at a time oat method was used for evaluating parameter sensitivity whereas monte carlo simulation mcs was employed for parameter identifiability analysis model calibration and quantifying prediction uncertainties the model performance was evaluated by using statistical criteria hydrographs and flow duration curves fdcs new hydrological insights for the region the sensitivity analysis revealed that 7 parameters have a significant influence on model output the degree of sensitivity was found to depend on objective functions and catchment characteristics the identifiability analysis revealed significant parameter uncertainties which influence model predictions however most of the observed and simulated streamflow were within the 95 uncertainty range also the performance evaluation revealed that the observed streamflow were simulated with an acceptable degree of accuracy therefore the model is suitable for wrb these results will assist in efficient calibration reducing uncertainties and application of the hbv model which is useful for planning and decision making in light of challenges associated with climate change design and management of water resources infrastructures in the region graphical abstract ga1 keywords hbv model hydrological modeling sensitivity analysis uncertainty analysis wami ruvu basin data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction hydrological models are currently among the essential tools for understanding hydrological processes and ensuring water availability in catchments devia et al 2015 in most cases they are developed for use in areas with diverse characteristics such as land use soil type topography and climate song et al 2015 consequently they have parameters that are usually adjusted with respect to catchment characteristics and climatic conditions pechlivanidis et al 2011 however most parameters cannot be directly accurately measured hence calibration is usually required in order to increase the accuracy of prediction in the area of interest herrera et al 2022 model calibration is the process of identifying optimal model parameters by comparing the observed and simulated values wagener et al 2003 in this process the parameters are adjusted by using automatic or manual techniques until the observed and predicted values show the predefined degree of similarity this is usually not an easy task partly because parameters may not represent accurately the processes in the catchment and thus uncertainties are always encountered abebe et al 2010 according to song et al 2015 model uncertainties are also amplified by input data boundary conditions and model structure which essentially degrades the accuracy of the predictions in hydrological studies it is considered good practice to analyze the uncertainties in the model output and quantifying the extent to which the model parameters contribute to these uncertainties i e sensitivity analysis song et al 2015 over the past years several methods have been developed to optimize parameters and quantify uncertainties encountered in hydrological models pechlivanidis et al 2011 however it is not always practical to incorporate all parameters during calibration process because not all parameters have significant impact on model outputs song et al 2015 thus less sensitive parameters are usually fixed in order to increase the speed of the calibration process the sensitivity of model parameters depends on the catchment physical characteristics and climatic conditions ouyang et al 2014 hence sensitivity results are usually not transferable from one catchment to another ouatiki et al 2020 there are two main categories of methods for sensitivity analysis the first category is global sensitivity analysis gsa which examines the sensitivity with respect to entire parameter space over the predefined feasible parameter range pechlivanidis et al 2011 the gsa can be done through various methods including stepwise regression analysis mutual information analysis classification tree analysis and meta modeling method song et al 2015 the second category is local sensitivity analysis lsa which employs tradition methods that involve perturbation of each parameter with a reference objective function whilst fixing the others song et al 2015 in most cases the selection of sensitivity analysis method depend on the study purpose because each method has own advantages and limitations ouatiki et al 2020 however lsa is considered advantageous due to its simplicity and less computation requirements herrera et al 2022 characterization of model inputs uncertainties and parameter sampling usually follows after identification of sensitive parameters nonki et al 2021 pechlivanidis et al 2011 since most hydrological models are non linear computation probability density functions are usually required for assessing parameter uncertainties pechlivanidis et al 2011 in this context probability distributions are usually computed by using a number of methods including monte carlo simulation mcs khu and werner 2003 or more advanced uncertainty analysis frameworks such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi abbaspour et al 2004 in hydrological modeling the mcs is still widely used because of its flexibility and robustness in parameter sampling herrera et al 2022 osuch et al 2015 the performance of hydrological models is usually quantified by selected objective functions ouyang et al 2014 the objective functions assess the model performance in different aspects hence the results are usually biased on individual aspects of the hydrograph in this context studies recommend employing multi objective functions for evaluating the overall performance of the model abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 this study focuses on the performance sensitivity and uncertainty evaluation of the hbv model hbv is a semi distributed conceptual model that is among the widely used hydrologic models around the globe bergström 2006 bizuneh et al 2021 pervin et al 2021 shiwakoti 2017 in sub saharan catchments the model has been widely used for climate change studies hydrological predictions and computing the design floods for numerous catchments goshime et al 2021 shagega et al 2019 valimba and mahe 2020 in addition several studies show that the hbv model offers comparable better performance than other widely used hydrological models in the region ayalew 2019 bizuneh et al 2021 tibangayuka et al 2022a since the hbv is a conceptual model the parameters have to be determined through model calibration partly because they cannot be directly measured bergström 1992 thus sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are important in order to obtain efficient results seibert 1997 this study is following the results of abebe et al 2010 in covington county mississippi seibert 1997 in savannah and svartbn river catchments of sweden osuch et al 2015 in wieprz catchment of poland ouatiki et al 2020 in oum er rbia catchment of morocco nonki et al 2021 in upper benue river basin of cameroon uhlenbrook et al 1999 in brugga basin of southwestern germany and ouyang et al 2014 in pailugou catchment of northwest china all these studies have indicated that the sensitivity and uncertainty of hbv model parameters vary depending on the characteristics of an area of interest they also concluded that uncertainty analysis is important when the hbv model predictions are used for decision making however previous studies only examined the uncertainty of the hbv model in small and medium sized catchments mostly less than 5000 square kilometers besides few studies have been carried out in sub humid watersheds which is the focus of this study also several studies have showed that most catchments in the region are faced with the impacts of climate change gulacha and mulungu 2017 rotich and mulungu 2017 shagega et al 2018 tibangayuka et al 2022b and hence hydrological modeling is highly required for planning and management of water resources infrastructures therefore the specific objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the sensitivity and interdependency of hbv model parameters 2 evaluate the identifiability of the hbv model parameters 3 evaluate the implications of parameter uncertainties in hbv model predictions and 4 evaluate the performance of hbv model in wrb understanding hbv model uncertainties and performance will potentially enable efficient calibration and improvement of hydrological predictions since it is among the widely used models in the region kamwaga et al 2018 koutsouris et al 2017 shagega et al 2019 valimba and mahe 2020 besides the results of this study will enable a better understanding of the hydrological processes in the sub humid tropical region 2 study area this study focuses on the wami ruvu basin located between latitude 5 s and 8 s and longitude 35 e and 39 e the basin extends from a semi arid region in central tanzania to the indian ocean with a drainage area of approximately 66 899 square kilometers fig 1a the basin elevation ranges between 7 and 2636 masl and the slope ranges between 0 and 199 fig 1b higher elevations and slopes are found in the uluguru mountains which are part of the eastern arc mountains the basin main rivers are wami and ruvu which drain an area of approximately 43 700 and 18 000 square kilometers respectively the major soil types in the basin are ferralic cambiso rhodic ferrasols chromic luvisols and mollic fluvisols which occupy approximately 66 of the basin area fig 1c other soil types include eutric fluvisols umbric nitisols eutric vertisols eutric planosols eutric leptosols cambic arenosols haplic luvisols haplic phaeozems umbric acrisols lithic leptosols haplic acrisols and haplic lixisols which occupy a total area of approximately 34 in recent years the basin land cover has been slightly disturbed due to ongoing cultivation deforestation and the establishment of human settlements as shown in fig 1d approximately 11 and 0 3 of the basin area are occupied by cultivated land and urban areas respectively about 88 7 of the basin area remains undisturbed comprising natural vegetation the hydrology of the wami ruvu basin is comprised of the wami and ruvu rivers along with their tributaries these rivers have economic importance for the central and eastern regions of tanzania serving a population of approximately 10 918 185 urt 2020 both rivers are used for irrigation and industrial and domestic water supply also there are a total of eight proposed hydropower plants 5 in wami and 3 in ruvu that are at the initial stage of implementation urt 2020 the rainfall pattern varies spatially and temporarily in the basin the northeastern area which falls in the central region of tanzania has a unimodal rainfall pattern occurring between december and april whereas the eastern area has a bi modal rainfall pattern occurring between october and december and march to may the rainfall distribution and variability in the basin are mostly driven by the migration of the intertropical convergence zone itcz in the north and south across the equator tma 2020 the itcz migrates from the south to northern areas of tanzania between march and may and reverses toward the southern areas between october and december as a result of this movement some areas in the basin have a single and double passage of itcz that causes unimodal and bi modal patterns respectively the mean monthly temperature in the basin ranges from 14 c to 27 c the streamflow varies spatially and temporally depending on the sub catchment characteristics and the rainfall pattern however the peak flows are normally observed between april and may while the low flows are normally observed in october on the other hand the magnitude of peak and low flows varies significantly across sub catchments fig 2 presents the temporal variability of streamflow for three sub catchments considered in this study upper ruvu wami and mkondoa 3 data availability in this study the observed rainfall temperature and streamflow datasets were used for the setup and calibration of the hbv model the observed daily rainfall and streamflow data for 34 rainfall and 15 streamflow gauging stations fig 1a were obtained from the wami ruvu water basin offices and the water resources department database at the university of dar es salaam the data quality check revealed that 9 rainfall stations had more than 20 of missing data hence they were not suitable for use in this study consequently the rainfall data from 25 rainfall stations were used in this study similarly 3 streamflow gauging stations 1h10 1g1 1gd2 were found to represent significant drainage areas and have adequate data for hbv model calibration 1h10 is located in upper ruvu river with a drainage area of 6237 km2 1g1 is located in wami river with a drainage area of 5095 km2 and 1gd2 is located in mkondoa river with a drainage area of 17 826 km2 however approximately 13 550 km2 of the drainage area for 1gd2 corresponds to the kinyasungwe river fig 1a the observed temperature data for 2 stations morogoro meteorological station and dodoma airport station were also acquired from the water resource department of the university of dar es salaam database the potential evapotranspiration pet were computed from minimum and maximum temperature values by using the hargreaves formula hargreaves 1994 hargreaves and allen 2003 hargreaves and samani 1982 this method is highly recommended for the calculation of pet in areas with limited data allen et al 1998 droogers and allen 2002 the areal values of rainfall were computed by using the thiessen polygon method shown in eq 1 this method was selected because the basin rainfall stations are not evenly distributed hence areal significance of each point rainfall value should be considered olawoyin and acheampong 2017 besides several studies recommend the use of the thiessen polygon method in the region aliye et al 2020 gumindoga et al 2017 tegegne et al 2017 valimba and mahe 2020 1 p a i 1 n p i a i a t where a i a t is an area weighting factor pi is a point value recorded at particular station and pa is mean areal rainfall also the space shuttle radar topographical mission srtm digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer and used for catchment delineation the soil and land use cover data were obtained from the fao harmonized world soil database https www fao org soils portal data hub and usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov respectively these data were used for the analysis of basin characteristics 4 methods 4 1 description of hbv model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv fig 3 is a semi distributed and conceptual rainfall runoff model originally developed by swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergström 1992 the hbv model was selected for this study because apart from being the widely used model in the region it offers better performance as opposed to other models in the region tibangayuka et al 2022a it requires less data i e rainfall temperature and pet which are normally available in most catchments in the region it has a simple structure and is hence easy to set up and calibrate and it is freely available and thus very useful in developing countries where the funds for commercial software are usually scarce urt 2020 the model computes daily river discharge by utilizing daily areal precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs it consists of five modules namely precipitation routine soil moisture routine baseflow routine fast runoff routine and flow routing routine seibert 2005 the precipitation is either simulated as snowfall or rainfall depending on whether the measured temperature is below or above the specified threshold tt snowfall is added to the dry snow reservoir while meltwater and rainfall are directly added to the free water reservoir bergström 1992 the snow component of the model was not used in this study hence the precipitation was only simulated as rainfall the rainfall from the precipitation routine is input into the soil moisture routine ouyang et al 2014 seibert 2005 the soil moisture reservoir represents the amount of soil moisture available in the catchment ouyang et al 2014 its inflows are precipitation and snowmelt and its outflows are direct runoff seepage and evapotranspiration when the maximum storage in this reservoir is reached direct runoff occurs seibert 2005 the contribution of soil moisture routine to the generation of surface runoff from a given rainfall event is small for dry soil but it increases during wet conditions seibert 2005 the runoff delay is computed by using two reservoirs the first reservoir represents fast runoff which includes direct runoff and interflow while the second reservoir represents baseflow bergström 1992 the fast runoff is the first part of the response routine in which the outflows from the soil moisture routine direct runoff and seepage are used as inflows the water from the upper groundwater reservoir percolates into the baseflow reservoir until the specified threshold is exceeded the baseflow reservoir represents the groundwater storage that contributes to the stream baseflow seibert and vis 2012 4 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is usually important to identify the most influential parameters and understand the extent to which the model realistically represents the real world song et al 2015 in this study the local sensitivity analysis i e one factor at a time oat was employed pechlivanidis et al 2011 it is a robust and widely used method for identifying influential parameters in hydrological models abebe et al 2010 ayalew 2019 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 in this technique one parameter is varied repeatedly while keeping the others constant prior to sensitivity analysis the model was calibrated to get the baseline model performance the sensitivity analysis was done with respect to four objective functions namely nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the kling gupta efficiency kge these statistical criteria are highly recommended and widely used in hydrological modeling gupta and kling 2011 their mathematical description optimal values and thresholds are presented in table 1 during sensitivity analysis 5000 random values for each model parameter were generated by monte carlo sampling of which uniform distribution was utilized then the model was run for each generated parameter value while keeping other parameters constant and the model performance based on four objective functions shown in table 1 was recorded 4 3 parameter interdependency as part of sensitivity analysis assessing the parameter interdependency is considered important for understanding model processes and determining the interaction between model parameters furthermore parameter interdependency help in the identification of parameter pairs that yield the optimum model performance ouatiki et al 2020 the parameters are considered interdependent when the change in one parameter offsets the other parameter in order to provide optimum model performance ouatiki et al 2020 in other words the optimum parameters are usually found on a narrow or wider region for non dependent and interdependent parameters respectively in this study the interdependency of sensitive parameters was assessed by the two factors at a time tat method which involves varying two parameters while keeping other parameters constant ouatiki et al 2020 in this step the objective function was the nse described in table 1 the single objective function was selected as opposed to multi objective functions in order to reduce the number of computations 4 4 parameter identifiability parameter identifiability helps to understand the extent to which a parameter is defined within the model structure abebe et al 2010 identifiability essentially measures the closeness of grouped values among the parameter sets that yield good results the parameter is considered well or ill defined when the behavioral parameter values are found on a narrow or wide range respectively in other words if the parameter lies within a narrow band then it can be precisely identified nonki et al 2021 in this study the monte carlo simulation was employed for parameter identifiability analysis the number of simulations was set to 100 000 and then behavioral parameter sets were selected based on the threshold nse r2 kge and pbias of 0 65 0 7 0 65 and 25 respectively the number of simulations and threshold values were selected based on the recommendation from past studies abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 the cumulative probabilities and their corresponding gradients for behavior parameters were then computed and used as the measure for the extent of parameter identifiability for non identifiable parameters the posterior probability distribution and cumulative probability distribution will have a slope of nearly 1 1 abebe et al 2010 4 5 uncertainties in model simulations and performance evaluation in this step the uncertainties of the model simulations resulting from parameters uncertainty were assessed firstly the model was run by using behavioral parameter sets identified in identifiability analysis then the lower and upper uncertainty bounds based on 95 confidence intervals were computed the model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed and simulated hydrograph statistical ratings nse kge r2 and pbias and the flow duration curves fdcs the flow hydrographs help to assess the difference in the overall pattern of streamflow as well as the magnitude and timing of the peak and low flows nonki et al 2021 the statistical criteria help to express the similarity between observed and simulated streamflow as a single number hence the model performance can be quickly assessed gupta and kling 2011 and the fdcs help to assess the model performance over the specified range of streamflows saez et al 2018 the best simulated streamflow based on these criteria was then selected and compared to the observed streamflow 5 results and discussion 5 1 individual sensitivity analysis fig 4 presents the results of individual parameter sensitivity analysis with respect to 4 objective functions nse kge r2 and pbias employed in this study the results show that the limit of potential evapotranspiration lp and beta were the most sensitive parameters in all sub catchments however their influence on model output varies depending on the gauging station sub catchment and the objective functions in the hbv model structure fig 3 the lp parameter determines the shape of the reduction curve for potential evapotranspiration which is reduced when the soil moisture values are below the specified value of lp seibert 1997 on the other hand the beta parameter determines the relative contribution of runoff from a given amount of rain with respect to soil moisture deficit bergström 1992 therefore the differences in sensitivity of lp and beta parameters across catchments are supposedly associated with the variation of land use cover climate and topography in the basin as showed in fig 1d the wami and mkondoa sub catchments are predominated by bushland grassland and cultivated areas which are characterized by high evapotranspiration and low infiltration rates as opposed to natural forests and woodland which predominate the upper ruvu sub catchment chandler and chappell 2008 gonzalez sosa et al 2010 the difference in sensitivity of these parameters might also be associated with the variability of rainfall across basin sub catchments with areas located in the eastern part of the basin upper ruvu receiving more rainfall compared to other areas high rainfall increases the amount of surface runoff which alters the effect of the beta parameter moreover higher slopes in the upper ruvu sub catchment limit the amount of water available for evaporation which might also alter the influence of the lp parameter furthermore the difference in sensitivity for these parameters can be attributed to variations in soil type across sub catchments fig 1c the mkondoa and wami sub catchments are predominated by chromic luvisols umbric nitisols and ferralic cambiso which are well drained as opposed to umbric acrisols and rhodic ferrasols which predominates the upper ruvu sub catchment moroke et al 2009 also the results revealed that the sensitivity of k0 k1 k2 and maxbas parameters varies spatially in the basin in the hbv model structure these parameters are part of the response routine which controls the overland flow surface runoff and groundwater contribution bergström 1992 therefore they are also affected by land use cover and soil characteristics which explains their spatial variability in addition these parameters were revealed to be more sensitive with respect to nse r2 and kge but they were not sensitive with respect to the pbias objective function which implies that they control the shape of outflow hydrographs but have less impact on overall volume conversely the k0 parameter was found to be not sensitive in all sub catchments in the hbv model structure the k0 parameter only influences the streamflow when the limit for the upper groundwater reservoir fast interflow component uzl is exceeded fig 3 hence low sensitivity of k0 implies that all infiltrated water percolates to the deeper layer of the soil to form groundwater furthermore the results revealed that fc and perc parameters are relatively sensitive across all sub catchments however it was also found that their degree of sensitivity varies across sub catchments and depends on the objective function in the hbv model structure the perc parameter controls the amount of water that escapes from the upper to a deep groundwater reservoir the fc is the maximum soil moisture storage which also determines the amount of water moving to the upper groundwater reservoir seibert 2005 therefore both fc and perc are directly linked to topography and soil properties high porous soils have higher hydraulic conductivity hence large values of the perc parameter tarawally et al 2004 whereas ground slope alters the amount of water available for percolation alam et al 2017 mu et al 2015 this explains the high sensitivity of perc in mkondoa and upper ruvu which have relatively high slopes compared to the wami sub catchment fig 1b the fc parameter highly depends on the water holding capacity of the soil hence differences in its sensitivity across sub catchments can also be associated with variation in soil types fig 1b on the other hand the high sensitivity of perc to nse r2 and kge imply that it influences the outflow hydrograph whereas low sensitivity to pbias suggests that it has no impact on overall volume in contrast the sensitivity of the fc parameter to all objective functions implies that it affects both the outflow hydrograph and the overall volume 5 2 parameter interdependency the results revealed that there is interaction for some sensitive parameters as shown in fig 5 in general the lp and beta parameters showed more influence on model performance when they are simultaneously varied with other sensitive parameters in other words their influence on model output cannot be counterbalanced by any other parameters in addition the lp and beta pair yielded the maximum model performance these results are not astonishing considering these parameters directly affect the generation of surface runoff in wami ruvu basin sub catchments hence they have more influence compared to response routine parameters k0 k1 k2 and maxbas remarkably the lp and beta couple showed some interdependency but lp exhibited more influence in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments figs 5b and 5c the strong influence of lp suggests that the hydrology of these sub catchments is highly sensitive to the amount of water lost by evapotranspiration these findings are not surprising considering the predominance of land use cover grassland bushland and cultivated land that favors evapotranspiration in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments on the other hand the beta parameter exhibited more influence in the upper ruvu sub catchment fig 5a theoretically more influence of the beta parameter is an indication that the surface runoff is significantly greater than the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration therefore the influence of beta in upper ruvu can be related to the presence of natural forests and woodland which potentially reduce the amount of water lost by evapotranspiration in contrast the k2 and maxbas consistently indicated less influence across all sub catchments when they varied simultaneously with other parameters as opposed to combinations of beta and lp parameters this is partly because the generation of basin streamflow is more dependent on surface runoff and evapotranspiration than on baseflow which is determined by these parameters 5 3 parameter identifiability and model calibration fig 6 presents the results of the parameters identifiability analysis carried out by using mcs in this step the parameters were sampled simultaneously whereby 23 641 and 76 359 in upper ruvu 32 803 and 67 197 in wami and 12 182 and 87 818 in mkondoa sub catchments were classified as behavioral and non behavioral runs respectively the ranges of model parameters used during mcs are presented in table 2 in general the results revealed that the identifiability of model parameters varies across catchments however it was found that lp and beta parameters are precisely identifiable in all sub catchments these findings are not surprising given that the lp and beta parameters are directly related to the generation of surface runoff and hence have a considerable effect on the streamflow hydrograph particularly the peak flows also the results revealed that the k2 parameter is well identifiable in all sub catchments in the hbv model the k2 parameter controls the deep groundwater reservoir and hence has a direct influence on the outflow hydrograph the higher value of k2 is an indication that the percolated water does not reach the stream because it remains in the deep aquifer abebe et al 2010 in contrast perc fc uzl k0 and k1 parameters were less identifiable across all sub catchments in the hbv model structure the uzl and k0 control the third groundwater reservoir which was not filled in all catchments hence they do not influence model output at all on the other hand less identifiability of perc and fc parameters can be associated with the low contribution of baseflow on basin sub catchments also the less identifiability of these parameters can be attributed to the use of nse as an objective function the nse emphasizes better simulation of peak flows which are largely influenced by surface runoff mccuen et al 2006 the identifiability of the maxbas parameter was found to vary spatially in the basin it showed to be well identifiable in the upper ruvu and mkondoa and less identifiable in the wami sub catchment in the hbv model the maxbas parameter is the routing parameter that determines the shape of the hydrograph by delaying the computed outflow hence the difference in its identifiability can be related to the variation of topography across catchments the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments have relatively higher ground slopes compared to the wami sub catchment fig 1b which causes faster movement of streamflow towards the sub catchment outlets consequently the streamflow delay has more impact on the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments resulting in higher influence and identifiability of the maxbas parameter in general it was found that highly sensitive parameters tend to be more identifiable as compared to less sensitive parameters these results are consistent with nonki et al 2021 who also found that sensitive parameters are more identifiable compared to less sensitive parameters this highlights the need of fixing the less sensitive parameters during the model calibration process in order to reduce uncertainties in the model predictions abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 ouyang et al 2014 5 4 implications of parameters uncertainty in model simulations fig 7 presents the uncertainty bounds of model simulations computed by running the model against each of the behavioral parameter sets the results indicate that most of the simulated streamflow lies within the 95 uncertainty range but some of the observed peak flows were outside of the range during model calibration and validation this might be associated with the climate and basin characteristics the basin usually experiences extreme climatic events which are normally associated with the el niño southern oscillation enso and the indian ocean dipole iod tma 2020 on the other hand surface runoff plays a significant role in the generation of streamflow due to basin topography thus the occurrence of heavy rainfall events results in distinct peak floods that are not well matched by the model however underestimation of peak flows has also been reported in several studies bizuneh et al 2021 goshime et al 2021 koutsouris et al 2017 nonki et al 2021 shagega et al 2019 hence it might also be associated with the model structure 5 5 model calibration results and performance evaluation table 2 presents the calibrated model parameters in the wrb sub catchments in general the optimal parameters vary across sub catchments the soil moisture parameters fc beta and lp showed significant differences in each sub catchment especially in upper ruvu these parameters depend on the land use cover and soil type which differ significantly in upper ruvu the response parameters also indicated some differences especially perc k1 and maxbas the higher value of the perc parameter in the wami sub catchment is an indication that the amount of rainfall contributing to groundwater is relatively higher compared to the upper ruvu and mkondoa sub catchments this can be attributed to basin topography particularly the lower ground slopes in the wami sub catchment that potentially allow more water to infiltrate in addition the k2 parameter showed consistency in the upper ruvu and wami sub catchments but a significant difference was indicated in the mkondoa sub catchment different values of k2 might also be associated with variations in land use soil type and topography fig 1 which alter groundwater contribution in these sub catchments on the other hand the uzl and k0 were not sensitive in all sub catchments hence any value could not have changed model performance performance evaluation by using the statistical criteria table 3 indicates that the model was able to simulate the basin streamflow adequately the calibration results yielded the nse range of 0 67 0 73 the kge range of 0 71 0 83 the r2 range of 0 69 0 73 and the pbias of 1 11 in all sub catchments on the other hand the nse range of 0 6 0 83 the kge range of 0 57 0 58 the r2 range of 0 72 0 91 and the pbias range of 8 26 were obtained during validation according to moriasi et al 2007 the nse range of 0 65 0 75 and more than 0 75 are interpreted as good and very good respectively whereas the pbias range of 25 50 and less than 25 are interpreted as good and very good respectively additionally the hydrographs of observed and best simulated streamflow fig 8 showed that the hbv model was able to simulate well the overall pattern and timing of low and high flows however the magnitude of peak flows was not matched well in all sub catchments in general the statistical ratings and hydrographs of observed and simulated streamflow revealed that the model performed with an acceptable degree of accuracy during both calibration and validation periods in all sub catchments the flow duration curves fdcs help to assess the model performance in the quantile domain hence the flow ranges for which the model performs best can be accurately determined saez et al 2018 fig 9 presents the fdcs for observed and simulated streamflow during calibration and validation for effective analysis of fdcs the streamflow was classified into five segments namely very high flow more than q5 high flow q5 q20 medium flow q20 q70 low flow q70 q95 and very low flow less than q95 whereby qj is the discharge q with the probability of exceedance j these segments were selected because they are widely used by planners in designing and managing water resources in catchments saez et al 2018 as shown in fig 9a the observed streamflow in the upper ruvu sub catchment lies within the uncertainty range except for low flows q20 which were above the uncertainty range also the best simulated matched well with observed streamflow in the calibration period however the high flows q20 and low flows q70 were slightly underestimated during validation in upper ruvu in contrast the low and moderate streamflow q10 were within the uncertainty range in the wami sub catchment but the observed high flows q10 were above of uncertainty range fig 9b also the best simulated did not match well with the observed streamflow in wami sub catchment for all ranges except q10 and q90 during calibration and q20 and q70 during validation on the other hand the observed moderate streamflows q25 q60 were within the uncertainty range in the mkondoa sub catchment fig 9c but very high q5 and low flows q60 were below the uncertainty range notably the validation results revealed that all flow segments except for q90 were not accurately simulated in the mkondoa sub catchment these results are not surprising because of the temporal variation of streamflow in wrb as explained in section 5 4 there are distinct peak flows caused by heavy rainfall events in the basin sub catchments hence the model tries to counterbalance these peaks with the rest of the streamflow range to yield optimal performance 6 summary and conclusion sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are among the essential components for the calibration and application of hydrological models the predictions of hydrological models are usually less reliable when associated uncertainties are unknown rafiei emam et al 2018 this work focused on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis as well as performance evaluation of the hbv model in three sub catchments of the wami ruvu basin in tanzania the individual parameter sensitivity and parameter interdependency analysis was done by using local sensitivity methods varying one and two parameters at a time respectively whereas the model calibration and uncertainty analysis were done by monte carlo simulation mcs performance evaluation was done by using multi objective functions nse kge r2 and pbias hydrographs and flow duration curves fdcs the results revealed that the lp and beta parameters are more sensitive with reference to nse r2 kge and pbias measures for all catchments the k1 k2 and maxbas parameters were also sensitive with respect to nse kge and r2 measures but their influence was less significant as compared to the lp and beta parameters in addition the perc k1 k2 and maxbas parameters were less sensitive with respect to pbias on the other hand the fc parameter was relatively sensitive in all catchments with respect to all objective functions but it has less influence compared to the perc lp beta k2 and maxbas parameters with respect to the nse r2 and kge measures on the contrary the uzl and k0 parameters were not sensitive in all catchments with respect to all objective functions the parameter interdependency analysis revealed that the lp and beta parameters are the least dependent hence their influence cannot be counterbalanced by other parameters also the combination of these parameters yields maximum performance this highlighted the significance of surface runoff and evapotranspiration processes in the basin furthermore the monte carlo simulation revealed that the identifiability of the model parameters varies from one catchment to another however it was found that lp beta and k2 parameters are more identifiable whereas perc fc uzl k0 and k1 parameters are least identifiable in all catchments in general less sensitive and least identifiable parameters can be kept constant during hbv model calibration this will essentially reduce uncertainties in the model predictions and save time as well as computation resources that are consumed during the calibration process abebe et al 2010 nonki et al 2021 the sensitivity results also highlighted the importance of employing multi objective functions toward reducing uncertainties in hbv model predictions furthermore the results revealed that parameter uncertainties have significant implications on model output in general it was found that the observed flows were within the uncertainty range but the peak flows were mostly outside of the uncertainty range moreover the hydrographs of observed and simulated streamflow indicated that the overall streamflow pattern and timing of low and high flows were well matched the statistical criteria also showed that the model performed well in wrb however the extent of performance was found to vary across basin sub catchments during calibration the best simulated streamflow had the nse of 0 71 0 67 and 0 73 the kge of 0 71 0 76 and 0 83 the r2 of 0 72 0 69 and 0 73 and the pbias of 3 11 and 1 in upper ruvu wami and mkondoa sub catchments respectively during the model validation the nse of 0 60 0 81 and 0 73 the kge of 0 57 0 78 and 0 73 the r2 of 0 75 0 72 and 0 91 and pbias of 26 8 and 14 were obtained at upper ruvu wami and mkondoa sub catchments respectively on the other hand the flow duration curves revealed that the model performed well in all flow segments at upper ruvu during calibration however the low and peak flows were underestimated during model validation furthermore the results indicated that moderate and low flows were not adequately simulated during validation in the wami and mkondoa sub catchments in summary the results revealed that sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of hbv model parameters is important for efficient calibration and streamflow prediction the performance evaluation revealed that the model simulates well the daily streamflow of wrb hence it can be applied in all of its sub catchments this study gave insight into the performance sensitivity and uncertainties associated with hbv model parameters and predictions in wrb also it will be a starting point for the application of the model in other watersheds found in the humid tropical region moreover these findings will assist water resource planners researchers and decision makers in addressing the current and future challenges facing water resources in the region credit authorship contribution statement nickson tibangayuka conceptualization investigation data curation methodology formal analysis

by the flood on july 1 1970 and then validated against the flood on october 25 2019 simulated flood extent and temporal changes of water depths agreed well with the observations from social media data suggesting that the hydraulic model could reproduce floods in the study area comparison of the two flood events indicated that the areal extent of flood increased by a factor of 5 5 over the 50 year period caused by the changes of land use land covers topographies and input river water levels new hydrological insights for the region intensive rainfall induced fluvial floods have caused catastrophic repercussions in urban areas one of the major challenges in urban flood simulations is lack of field observations to evaluate the performance of numerical models our study highlights the possibility of employing hydraulic model and social media data to reduce the uncertainty in flood simulation and the necessity of considering the temporal changes of land use land covers topographies

hirabayashi et al 2013 the increasing floods would cause millions of fatalities merz et al 2021 especially in cities where urbanization has led to the population increase tellman et al 2021 and to the land use land cover lulc changes hong et al 2021 reproducing actual flood events and investigating contributing factors which lead to flood changes could help us assess the flood hazard including flood extent depth and volume kron 2005 both the data driven and physical model approaches can be employed to assess the flood hazards machine learning techniques were employed to investigate the spatial distribution of flooded areas in the cities in iran darabi et al 2019 rafiei sardooi et al 2021 taromideh et al 2022 choubin et al 2022 their results demonstrated that the data driven method could map the flood risks and guide the decision making especially in the areas with limited hydraulic and hydrological data a simple physical model approach is the bathtub method kulp and strauss 2019 didier et al 2019 which estimates the areal extent of the flood by the water level and the areal topography however bathtub method simplified the physical processes too much and reduced the credibility of flood hazard assessment didier et al 2019 this contribution tries to apply the physical constraints to the data for advancing the flood research in both spatial and temporal scales measuring the flood extent and depth during an actual event is dangerous and difficult hossain anni et al 2020 therefore implementing the information provided by social media might enhance the better reproduction of flood occurrence cui et al 2019 hiltz et al 2020 advocated to build a communication bridge between the social media and emergency responders to realize the full potential of social media data to reproduce the flood associated with hurricane harvey in huston texas united states scotti et al 2020 integrated the satellite images hydraulic models and social media data to reduce the uncertainties of inundation areas arthur et al 2018 employed the data from a social media platform twitter to detect and locate flood events in the united kingdom results of which proved that the social media data were useful in flood research feeds from twitter were also collected and sorted by an advanced natural language processing nlp platform to detect the flood outbreak in japan on october 19 2019 caused by typhoon hagibis shoyama et al 2021 results showed that the social media data could be used for flood detection however the credibility of the information should be further verified through monitoring and modeling numerical models are frequently used to simulate urban floods which are sensitive to many factors including but not limited to lulc aich et al 2016 krysanova et al 2015 topography usually represented by digital elevation model dem ouyang et al 2021b kulp and strauss 2019 and input river water level pappenberger et al 2008 hossain anni et al 2020 demonstrated that the infiltration into soil played an important role in flood hazard assessment i e fully permeable and impermeable settings resulted in underestimated and overestimated inundation areas respectively hosseini et al 2021 examined the factors affecting the flood vulnerability by the analytical network process and fuzzy theory they showed that lulc contributed to around 20 of the flood vulnerability in kashkan watershed west of iran the influence of lulc in rainfall runoff models was accounted for by the coefficient in estimating the runoff from precipitation on different lulc types r c s p where r is the runoff generated from different lulc types c s is the coefficient and p is the precipitation through linear c s is a constant value zhou et al 2019 zope et al 2016 or nonlinear c s is a function of soil moisture hu et al 2021 relationships their results suggested that considering the detailed lulc in rainfall runoff models was crucial to reproduce the total runoff and peak flows flood assessment from field survey suggested that lulc based flood wave propagation and soil infiltration were needed to be considered to reproduce the actual scenery sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 effects of dem and input river water level on flood hazards were intensively explored kulp and strauss 2019 ouyang et al 2021b pappenberger et al 2008 hossain anni et al 2020 kulp and strauss 2019 employed the elevation data from cosataldem using neural networks to reduce errors to map the coastal flood which resulted in three times larger global vulnerability than that estimated from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data based on two dems before and after tohoku earthquake ouyang et al 2021b reported that the earthquake induced land surface elevation change caused around 10 change of flood extent in a coastal basin the uncertainty of input discharge magnitude on the maximum water level hydrographs and travel time was examined by pappenberger et al 2008 results of which suggested that the input discharge magnitude was a dominant factor controlling the model output in this paper we aim to apply a numerical model and introduce social media data for unraveling the inundation impacts of lulc dem and input river water level changes on the spatio temporal changes of the flood extents and depths in an urban city specifically we applied the hydraulic model consisting of both surface flow and soil infiltration to simulate the floods in mobara city chiba prefecture japan fig 1 a the hydraulic model was calibrated by the flood event occurred on july 1 1970 and then validated by the flood on october 25 2019 both the flood extent and temporal changes of water depth estimated from the social media data were employed in the validation process to increase the model credibility subsequently lulc dem and input river water level in 1970 and 2019 were disentangled to examine their impacts on flood extent and volume the flood hazard change caused by the lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient and permeability change was further investigated with respect to detailed hydrological processes 2 methodology the concept of the hydraulic model is illustrated in fig 2 fluvial flood in the urban cities were usually caused by the extraordinary high magnitude of river water level induced by intensive rainfall surface flow from river to the land was modeled by shallow water equation inundated water infiltration to subsurface soils in unsaturated zone was simulated by richards equation in this study 2 1 surface flow model the 2 d shallow water equation neglecting the convective acceleration term can be simplified as bates et al 2010 1 h t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t g h h z x g n 2 q x q x h 7 3 0 3 q y t g h h z y g n 2 q y q y h 7 3 0 where h l is the water depth t t is the time x l is the longitude coordinate y l is the latitude coordinate q x l 2 t 1 is the discharge per unit width in longitude direction q y l 2 t 1 is the discharge per unit width in latitude direction z l is the bed elevation g l t 2 is the gravity acceleration and n t l 1 3 is the manning s roughness coefficient the first second and third parts of left hand side in eqs 2 3 correspond to local acceleration pressure plus bed gradient and friction terms respectively according to the courant freidrichs levy rule the non dimensional courant number max v δ t δ x v δ t δ y needs to be less than 1 for stability then a suitable model time step was proposed by bates et al 2010 as 4 δ t max min α δ x g h max α δ y g h max where v l t 1 is the characteristic velocity equals to g h δ t t is the model time step δ x l δ y l is the cell size in the longitude and latitude directions respectively δ t max t is the maximum time step h max l is the maximum depth within the computational domain α is a coefficient in the range between 0 2 and 0 7 to produce a stable simulation here we used the value of 0 7 because it can reach a fast and stable solution bates et al 2010 used a semi implicit solution for the momentum equations eqs 2 3 however stability problems were reported when the manning s roughness coefficient was low yamazaki et al 2013 de almeida et al 2012 suggested a q centered numerical scheme through adjusting the degree of diffusivity the discharge at the time step t δ t can be calculated as follows 5 q i 1 2 r 1 θ q i 1 2 r 1 θ 2 q i 3 2 r q i 1 2 r g h f δ t δ x y i r y i 1 r 1 g δ t n 2 q i 1 2 r h f 7 3 where y l h z is the water surface elevation h f l represents the depth through which water can flow between two cells and is defined as the difference between the highest water surface elevation in the two cells and the highest bed elevation i e max y i y i 1 max z i z i 1 hunter et al 2005 and θ is the weighting factor subscripts i and r denote space and time indices respectively if θ 0 then the lax friedrichs approximation is obtained while θ 1 restores the semi implicit formulation in this study a stable solution was obtained when θ was set to 0 9 thus we used this value for the flood simulations based on the calculated discharge the water depth at the time step t δ t can be obtained as 6 h i j r 1 h i j r q i 1 2 j r q i 1 2 j r q i j 1 2 r q i j 1 2 r δ t δ x δ y where subscripts i and j denote the space indices in longitude and latitude directions respectively 2 2 soil infiltration model integrating soil infiltration into flood simulation is necessary to reproduce the actual floods saxena and singh 2021 saksena et al 2020 richards equation in one dimensional form is used to model the surface water infiltration through an unsaturated porous medium freeze and cherry 1979 7 d k ψ ψ d 1 c ψ ψ t where d l is the thickness of unsaturated layer ψ l is the pressure head k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity and c l 1 is the specific moisture capacity which is defined as the slope of soil water characteristic curve water content w against pressure head ψ l 8 c d w d ψ based on the previous studies on flood modeling in the study area ouyang et al 2021b van genuchten 1980 equation can reproduce the soil infiltration into subsurface which was then employed here and was given as 9 s e 1 1 β ψ c m where β l 1 c m are fitting parameters and s e is the effective saturation defined as 10 s e w w r w s w r where w s and w r are the saturated and residual water contents the hydraulic conductivity for the unsaturated soils was determined based on the relationship from mualem 1976 11 k ψ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is the fitting parameter l 0 2 was recommended by mualem 1976 and was used in this study 2 3 data the required data for the hydraulic model are a lulc the lulc data were constructed from the landsat 5 tm images chen et al 2015 with eight classes building cropland forest grassland paddy road sands and urban to confirm the details of building and road changes in between 1970 and 2019 the building and road distribution maps with 25 cm resolution in these two years were collected geospatial information authority of japan 2019a and combined with the lulc data as presented in fig 3 a for 1970 and fig 3 b for 2019 b digital elevation model dem 10 m resolution lidar dem in 1970 fig 3 c and 1 m resolution lidar dem in 2019 fig 3 d were used here dem in 2019 was upscaled to 10 m resolution to keep consistent with the resolution in 1970 c river water level the measured river water levels in hayano station along ichinomiya river fig 1 b during july 1 2 1970 chiba disaster prevention center 1971 and october 25 26 2019 ministry of land infrastructure and transportation 2020 were regarded as the forcing data for the flood events fig 3 e the measurement intervals of the river water levels were 60 min in 1970 and 10 min in 2019 which were linearly interpolated based on the time step in surface flow model d soil distribution map the soil profiles were obtained from the national land agency in chiba prefecture with resolution of 50 m aonuma et al 1974 nakamura et al 1978 based on the classification of cultivated soils in japan hirai and hamazaki 2004 the soils in the study area consist of coarse gley soil fine gley soils gray lowland soils and brown lowland soils fig 3 f shows the soils distributions with downscaled resolution of 10 m in both 1970 and 2019 assuming that the soil profiles would not change in around 50 years to validate the performance of the hydraulic model on flood simulation the social media data containing the flooded locations time stamps and inundation depths were collected e social media data we collected and verified the flood related data from twitter feeds shoyama et al 2021 local and national news blogs and forums the spatial distribution of social media data is shown in fig 1 b by circles smd a b c d e table 1 lists the source of the social media data water depths of social media data were estimated from digital surface model dsm dem and image processing refer to appendix for the details 2 4 experimental procedure the procedures of experiments in this study are i prepare necessary data mentioned in section 2 3 including the lulc dem input river water level soil and social media data ii conduct the flood simulation by the hydraulic model consisting of surface flow and soil infiltration specifically the depth of surface water in the study domain was set to be zero as the initial condition then input river water level fig 3 e was applied to the river cells figs 3 c d when the input river water level exceeded the embankment height river water would flow over the embankment to the land flood water propagation on the surface was calculated by surface flow model with lulc data figs 3 a b infiltration of inundated water to subsurface was computed by soil infiltration model with soil data fig 3 f the north south west and east boundaries were set as no flow conditions the water infiltrated into subsurface was not considered for the subsequent surface flow simulation iii the experiment was stopped when the simulated inundation depths reached constant and steady state 2 5 focused variables among the model output we focused on the areal extents of floods which was defined as the maximum inundation areas in the flood events ouyang et al 2021b we also examined the simulated time series of inundation depths at locations where the measured data were collected e g mco a b and sma a b c d e flood volume was calculated based on cell sizes inundation depths and time steps infiltration amount into subsurface was also of interest to investigate the flood impacts of lulc change 2 6 simulation scenarios and settings a summary of the simulation scenarios and settings is shown in table 2 the flood event occurred on july 1 1970 was simulated by the hydraulic model hm1970 to calibrate the model parameters including the manning s roughness coefficient n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and van genuchten fitting parameters β c m based on the estimated flood extent from official report chiba prefecture 1971 the calibrated hydraulic model was then validated by a flood event on october 25 2019 hm2019 the flood extents estimated from geospatial information authority of japan 2019b and reported by mobara city office mobara city office 2019 and maximum inundation depths and temporal changes of water depths estimated from social media data were employed to evaluate the model results the flood responses change could be responsible for the change of lulcs dems and the river water levels therefore parametric studies were conducted by changing only one factor while keeping the others unchanged based on the case hm2019 and were named as n70p70 n70 p70 d70 and l70 where hm means hydraulic model n means lulc based manning s roughness coefficient p means lulc based permeability d means dem and l means input river water level 70 represents the year 1970 e g d70 means dem in the year 1970 was applied in the experiment while lulc and input river water level were from the year 2019 table 2 n70 and p70 were performed to disentangle the effect of lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient change and permeability change on flood extent and volume 3 results 3 1 model calibration fig 4 a shows the aerial photograph of the study area taken in the year 1970 the inundation depths which are the maximum water depths in the cells during the simulation periods obtained from the hydraulic model on july 1 1970 are presented in fig 4 b through the calibration hydraulic model hm1970 could reproduce the reported inundation areas chiba prefecture 1971 around 1 0 10 5 m 2 the friction term in shallow water equation eqs 2 3 and soil infiltration model eqs 9 11 contain fitting parameters which were calibrated by hm1970 with the reference data from ouyang et al 2021b the calibrated manning s roughness coefficients in friction term for each type of lulc are shown in table 3 regarding the soil infiltration model the thickness of unsaturated zone d was set to be 2 0 m based on the field measurement of average groundwater level ouyang et al 2021a b the initial water content was assumed to be 0 3 and distributed uniformly in this study table 4 lists the calibrated parameters for calculating the surface water infiltration into soils 3 2 model validation based on the calibrated parameters we conducted the flood simulation on october 25 2019 the performance of the flood simulation was validated with respect to the flood extent maximum inundation depth and temporal change of water depth flood extent the aerial photo taken in the year 2019 and inundation areas obtained from hydraulic model are shown in fig 5 comparison between fig 5 a and fig 4 a revealed dramatical lulc changes from 1970 to 2019 a summary of the inundation areas surveyed by mobara city office mobara city office 2019 gsi geospatial information authority of japan 2019b and simulated by hydraulic model hm2019 is shown in table 5 the flood extent reported by mobara city office was deduced from the field investigations which contains the largest surveyed flood extent gsi estimated the inundation area based on the images taken from airplane after the flood events which only consists of the severely inundated locations fig 5 b showed that the simulated flood extent hm2019 agreed with the flood extent reported by mobara city office i e only 2 difference table 5 though 143 of inundation areas were overestimated when comparing with the survey from gsi table 5 the severely inundated locations from gsi can be totally represented by the simulated flood extents fig 5 b thus we gained the confidence that the calibrated hydraulic model could provide a complete picture on the flood extent maximum inundation depth based on the reported hazard map from mobara city office the maximum inundation depths at mco a and mco b fig 5 b during the flood on october 25 2019 were around 1 90 m and 1 00 m respectively mobara city office 2019 the calculated maximum inundation depths from hydraulic model at these two locations were compared with the reported depths as shown in fig 6 results noted that the hydraulic model could reproduce the maximum inundation depth reported by mobara city office in both locations mobara city office 2019 which provided a solid foundation for subsequent analysis on flood extents temporal inundation depth the comparison between the simulated water depths and those estimated from the social media at the same time and locations smd a smd b smd c smd d and smd e is shown in fig 7 where the dashed lines are the simulated inundation depths and the open circles with error bars are the estimated inundation depths from social media observations of fig 7 revealed that both the timing and depths of actual flood can be reproduced which demonstrated that the hydraulic model was satisfactory for the quantification of inundation timing and depth in urban areas the only discrepancy was found in the recession phase at smd b orange dashed line and circles in fig 7 limitation of the hydraulic model i e delay of recession was probably caused by two assumptions 1 no stormwater infrastructure hossain anni et al 2020 and 2 no flow boundaries in the experiments these assumptions have negligible influences on the analysis of this study because parametric studies were conducted under the same conditions and inundation extent and depth were mainly dependent on the maximum inundation depth 3 3 comparison of floods in between 1970 and 2019 comparison of the reported flood extent on july 1 1970 and that on october 25 2019 by mobara city office table 5 revealed that the flood extents increased drastically in around 50 years from 1 0 105 m 2 to 5 5 105 m 2 three factors might affect the flood extents the changes of lulc dem and input river water level the differences of lulcs and dems in between 1970 and 2019 are shown in fig 8 observation of fig 8 a revealed that around 47 of the study area showed lulc changes in between 1970 and 2019 the detailed lulc distributions and net changes fig 8 c demonstrated that urbanization caused an increase in the buildings and roads while a decrease in the cropland paddy and bare sands fig 8 b noted that around 96 of the study area suffered from land subsidence ouyang et al 2020 the histogram of dem differences in fig 8 d suggested an average of 0 62 m land subsidence occurred during 50 years the difference of maximum input river water levels was around 1 2 m in between 1970 and 2019 fig 3 e a series of parametric studies were conducted to examine these factors on flood hazard table 2 table 6 summarizes the flood extents maximum flood volumes and infiltrations obtained from these parametric experiments fig 9 shows a summary of the influence of factors on the normalized differences in flood extents and volumes results noted that soil infiltration was significantly influenced by the lulc changes especially the lulc based permeability changes table 6 flood extents were greatly affected by the lulc and input river water level changes input river water level played a dominant role in controlling the flood volumes in the study area 3 4 the impacts of lulc the simulated maximum inundation depth of case n70p70 and its difference with case hm2019 are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a demonstrates that calculated flooded area by using the lulc in 1970 underestimated the flooded areas reported by mobara city office especially in the central northern part of the study area fig 10 b the water depth differences in the cells were small near the ichinomiya river comparing to the cells far from the river even though in the real condition lulc change would alter the manning s roughness coefficient and permeability simultaneously to investigate the detailed reason causing the flood extent changes by the lulc changes parametric simulations on flood extents impacts of manning s roughness coefficient change n70 and permeability change p70 were conducted and presented as follows manning s roughness coefficient the simulated maximum inundation depth by only changing the manning s roughness coefficient of 2019 to that of 1970 is shown in fig 11 a the difference between hm2019 and n70 suggested that the flood extents were quite similar fig 11 b which was responsible for the facts that the total flood volume and infiltration table 6 were not much sensitive to the manning s roughness coefficient in this study this demonstrated that even though the calibration on manning s roughness coefficient might have uncertainties which may not change the results much when investigating the effects of dominating factors such as lulc dem and input river water level on flood hazard assessment ouyang et al 2021b permeability the simulated maximum inundation depth by only changing the permeability of 2019 to that of 1970 p70 fig 11 c d indicated similar results with that of n70p70 fig 10 suggesting that the lulc change induced permeability change affected the flood extents through dominating the water infiltration into subsurface table 6 3 5 the impacts of dem fig 12 shows the simulated spatial maximum inundation depth of d70 together with its difference compared with hm2019 due to the land subsidence of the study area in between 1970 and 2019 fig 8 a around 12 of the inundation area was expanded table 6 which is consistent with the previous research that land surface elevation change would exacerbate the flood extents ouyang et al 2021b the water depth differences caused by dem changes were uniformly distributed which possibly because the dem changes in this area were rather spatially uniform fig 8 b flood volume showed around 39 decrease if the dem in 1970 was used or no land subsidence occurred during the 50 years table 6 3 6 the impacts of input river water level the simulated maximum inundation depth of case l70 and its difference with case hm2019 are shown in fig 13 approximately 28 of the calculated inundation area was decreased due to around 1 2 m decrease of the maximum input river water levels fig 3 e the differences of inundation depth in between hm2019 and l70 were also significant and around 58 reduction of flood volume was obtained in the study area table 6 the differences of the flood extent far from the river fig 13 b might be because the flood wave energy was not large enough to transport the water to a long distance 4 discussion nonlinear relation between flood extent and contributing factors through the results of hydraulic models we found that the difference of flooded area in between hm1970 and hm2019 was 4 6 10 5 m 2 due to the combined effects caused by the changes of lulc dem and input river water levels the summation of flood extent differences in the parametric cases n70p70 d70 l70 was 3 5 10 5 m 2 which was not equal to 4 6 10 5 m 2 this is reasonable for the flood research for example we simplify the flood caused by the overtopping flow from river to the land and the maximum river water level in 1970 was below the embankment height in some areas thus no flood happened there on the other hand in 2019 the maximum river water level was increased and the embankment height decreased the latter caused by land subsidence resulted in the differences between the summation of the parametric cases and the actual cases this means that the relationships among flood extent difference and changes of lulc dem and input river water level were nonlinear flood hazards estimation assuming the linear relationship among the parameters may not be realistic more advanced techniques such as combination of machine learning and fuzzy theory hosseini et al 2021 and dynamic matrix decomposition brunton et al 2017 could be employed to better understand the nonlinear relationship between flood extent and contributing factors application of this research the hydraulic model in this research can be used either as a forecasting tool to predict the inundation extent and depth of flood events or to evaluate the damages and losses caused by flood disasters in urban cities our study demonstrated that integrating social media data with hydraulic model could reduce the uncertainty of flood hazard mapping which sheds light on the communication between researchers and citizens to reach a win win situation to enhance the value of social media data data science could be incorporated into the hydraulic model to increase the flood prediction accuracy i e dynamically update the parameters through assimilating the social media data 5 conclusion the impacts of urbanization and land subsidence on hydrological processes especially on the areal extents and flooded water depths were thoroughly explored in this paper social media data were employed to estimate the temporal changes of water depth and to validate the calibrated hydraulic model which reduced the uncertainty for urban flood simulation the simulated flood extents and depths agreed well with the observations which proved the capability of the hydraulic model for flood research in the study area parametric studies indicated that the changes of lulc dem and input river water level caused around 23 12 and 27 changes of flood extents in between the years 1970 and 2019 respectively rather than the lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient change lulc change induced permeability change was the major factor contributing to the change of flood extent due to its influences on soil infiltration around 1 2 m decrease of input river water level reduced around 58 of flood volumes from the flood simulation our research indicated that the flood extent change was not linearly related to the change of lulc dem and input river water level nonlinear decomposition method would be applied to better unravel the influences of contributing parameters on flood responses credit authorship contribution statement mao ouyang

the spatio temporal changes of water depth were estimated from the photos downloaded from social media and taken from field survey these photos were firstly calibrated to eliminate the lens distortion through opencv ouyang and takahashi 2015 bradski 2000 after the calibration the scale of pixels in the photos was estimated through the standard database i e cars signs fences ouyang and takahashi 2022 flood depth was then manually depicted and estimated through the scale of pixels estimated water level from social media data was subsequently obtained by adding the surface elevation to the flood depth our trial test showed that the error of water level estimated from the photos was around 0 1 m 
7844,study region an urban city in the coastal region of east japan study focus this study implemented the hydraulic model to investigate the flood events in mobara city japan the model was calibrated by the flood on july 1 1970 and then validated against the flood on october 25 2019 simulated flood extent and temporal changes of water depths agreed well with the observations from social media data suggesting that the hydraulic model could reproduce floods in the study area comparison of the two flood events indicated that the areal extent of flood increased by a factor of 5 5 over the 50 year period caused by the changes of land use land covers topographies and input river water levels new hydrological insights for the region intensive rainfall induced fluvial floods have caused catastrophic repercussions in urban areas one of the major challenges in urban flood simulations is lack of field observations to evaluate the performance of numerical models our study highlights the possibility of employing hydraulic model and social media data to reduce the uncertainty in flood simulation and the necessity of considering the temporal changes of land use land covers topographies and input river water levels for flood mapping in urban cities keywords social media data hydraulic model land use land cover input river water level urban flood soil infiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floods are anticipated to increase near future due to the changes of precipitation intensities and patterns by climate changes winsemius et al 2015 arnell and gosling 2016 blöschl et al 2020 under the representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 around 42 of the land in the globe showed the increasing trend of the flood occurrence frequency hirabayashi et al 2013 the increasing floods would cause millions of fatalities merz et al 2021 especially in cities where urbanization has led to the population increase tellman et al 2021 and to the land use land cover lulc changes hong et al 2021 reproducing actual flood events and investigating contributing factors which lead to flood changes could help us assess the flood hazard including flood extent depth and volume kron 2005 both the data driven and physical model approaches can be employed to assess the flood hazards machine learning techniques were employed to investigate the spatial distribution of flooded areas in the cities in iran darabi et al 2019 rafiei sardooi et al 2021 taromideh et al 2022 choubin et al 2022 their results demonstrated that the data driven method could map the flood risks and guide the decision making especially in the areas with limited hydraulic and hydrological data a simple physical model approach is the bathtub method kulp and strauss 2019 didier et al 2019 which estimates the areal extent of the flood by the water level and the areal topography however bathtub method simplified the physical processes too much and reduced the credibility of flood hazard assessment didier et al 2019 this contribution tries to apply the physical constraints to the data for advancing the flood research in both spatial and temporal scales measuring the flood extent and depth during an actual event is dangerous and difficult hossain anni et al 2020 therefore implementing the information provided by social media might enhance the better reproduction of flood occurrence cui et al 2019 hiltz et al 2020 advocated to build a communication bridge between the social media and emergency responders to realize the full potential of social media data to reproduce the flood associated with hurricane harvey in huston texas united states scotti et al 2020 integrated the satellite images hydraulic models and social media data to reduce the uncertainties of inundation areas arthur et al 2018 employed the data from a social media platform twitter to detect and locate flood events in the united kingdom results of which proved that the social media data were useful in flood research feeds from twitter were also collected and sorted by an advanced natural language processing nlp platform to detect the flood outbreak in japan on october 19 2019 caused by typhoon hagibis shoyama et al 2021 results showed that the social media data could be used for flood detection however the credibility of the information should be further verified through monitoring and modeling numerical models are frequently used to simulate urban floods which are sensitive to many factors including but not limited to lulc aich et al 2016 krysanova et al 2015 topography usually represented by digital elevation model dem ouyang et al 2021b kulp and strauss 2019 and input river water level pappenberger et al 2008 hossain anni et al 2020 demonstrated that the infiltration into soil played an important role in flood hazard assessment i e fully permeable and impermeable settings resulted in underestimated and overestimated inundation areas respectively hosseini et al 2021 examined the factors affecting the flood vulnerability by the analytical network process and fuzzy theory they showed that lulc contributed to around 20 of the flood vulnerability in kashkan watershed west of iran the influence of lulc in rainfall runoff models was accounted for by the coefficient in estimating the runoff from precipitation on different lulc types r c s p where r is the runoff generated from different lulc types c s is the coefficient and p is the precipitation through linear c s is a constant value zhou et al 2019 zope et al 2016 or nonlinear c s is a function of soil moisture hu et al 2021 relationships their results suggested that considering the detailed lulc in rainfall runoff models was crucial to reproduce the total runoff and peak flows flood assessment from field survey suggested that lulc based flood wave propagation and soil infiltration were needed to be considered to reproduce the actual scenery sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 effects of dem and input river water level on flood hazards were intensively explored kulp and strauss 2019 ouyang et al 2021b pappenberger et al 2008 hossain anni et al 2020 kulp and strauss 2019 employed the elevation data from cosataldem using neural networks to reduce errors to map the coastal flood which resulted in three times larger global vulnerability than that estimated from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data based on two dems before and after tohoku earthquake ouyang et al 2021b reported that the earthquake induced land surface elevation change caused around 10 change of flood extent in a coastal basin the uncertainty of input discharge magnitude on the maximum water level hydrographs and travel time was examined by pappenberger et al 2008 results of which suggested that the input discharge magnitude was a dominant factor controlling the model output in this paper we aim to apply a numerical model and introduce social media data for unraveling the inundation impacts of lulc dem and input river water level changes on the spatio temporal changes of the flood extents and depths in an urban city specifically we applied the hydraulic model consisting of both surface flow and soil infiltration to simulate the floods in mobara city chiba prefecture japan fig 1 a the hydraulic model was calibrated by the flood event occurred on july 1 1970 and then validated by the flood on october 25 2019 both the flood extent and temporal changes of water depth estimated from the social media data were employed in the validation process to increase the model credibility subsequently lulc dem and input river water level in 1970 and 2019 were disentangled to examine their impacts on flood extent and volume the flood hazard change caused by the lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient and permeability change was further investigated with respect to detailed hydrological processes 2 methodology the concept of the hydraulic model is illustrated in fig 2 fluvial flood in the urban cities were usually caused by the extraordinary high magnitude of river water level induced by intensive rainfall surface flow from river to the land was modeled by shallow water equation inundated water infiltration to subsurface soils in unsaturated zone was simulated by richards equation in this study 2 1 surface flow model the 2 d shallow water equation neglecting the convective acceleration term can be simplified as bates et al 2010 1 h t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t g h h z x g n 2 q x q x h 7 3 0 3 q y t g h h z y g n 2 q y q y h 7 3 0 where h l is the water depth t t is the time x l is the longitude coordinate y l is the latitude coordinate q x l 2 t 1 is the discharge per unit width in longitude direction q y l 2 t 1 is the discharge per unit width in latitude direction z l is the bed elevation g l t 2 is the gravity acceleration and n t l 1 3 is the manning s roughness coefficient the first second and third parts of left hand side in eqs 2 3 correspond to local acceleration pressure plus bed gradient and friction terms respectively according to the courant freidrichs levy rule the non dimensional courant number max v δ t δ x v δ t δ y needs to be less than 1 for stability then a suitable model time step was proposed by bates et al 2010 as 4 δ t max min α δ x g h max α δ y g h max where v l t 1 is the characteristic velocity equals to g h δ t t is the model time step δ x l δ y l is the cell size in the longitude and latitude directions respectively δ t max t is the maximum time step h max l is the maximum depth within the computational domain α is a coefficient in the range between 0 2 and 0 7 to produce a stable simulation here we used the value of 0 7 because it can reach a fast and stable solution bates et al 2010 used a semi implicit solution for the momentum equations eqs 2 3 however stability problems were reported when the manning s roughness coefficient was low yamazaki et al 2013 de almeida et al 2012 suggested a q centered numerical scheme through adjusting the degree of diffusivity the discharge at the time step t δ t can be calculated as follows 5 q i 1 2 r 1 θ q i 1 2 r 1 θ 2 q i 3 2 r q i 1 2 r g h f δ t δ x y i r y i 1 r 1 g δ t n 2 q i 1 2 r h f 7 3 where y l h z is the water surface elevation h f l represents the depth through which water can flow between two cells and is defined as the difference between the highest water surface elevation in the two cells and the highest bed elevation i e max y i y i 1 max z i z i 1 hunter et al 2005 and θ is the weighting factor subscripts i and r denote space and time indices respectively if θ 0 then the lax friedrichs approximation is obtained while θ 1 restores the semi implicit formulation in this study a stable solution was obtained when θ was set to 0 9 thus we used this value for the flood simulations based on the calculated discharge the water depth at the time step t δ t can be obtained as 6 h i j r 1 h i j r q i 1 2 j r q i 1 2 j r q i j 1 2 r q i j 1 2 r δ t δ x δ y where subscripts i and j denote the space indices in longitude and latitude directions respectively 2 2 soil infiltration model integrating soil infiltration into flood simulation is necessary to reproduce the actual floods saxena and singh 2021 saksena et al 2020 richards equation in one dimensional form is used to model the surface water infiltration through an unsaturated porous medium freeze and cherry 1979 7 d k ψ ψ d 1 c ψ ψ t where d l is the thickness of unsaturated layer ψ l is the pressure head k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity and c l 1 is the specific moisture capacity which is defined as the slope of soil water characteristic curve water content w against pressure head ψ l 8 c d w d ψ based on the previous studies on flood modeling in the study area ouyang et al 2021b van genuchten 1980 equation can reproduce the soil infiltration into subsurface which was then employed here and was given as 9 s e 1 1 β ψ c m where β l 1 c m are fitting parameters and s e is the effective saturation defined as 10 s e w w r w s w r where w s and w r are the saturated and residual water contents the hydraulic conductivity for the unsaturated soils was determined based on the relationship from mualem 1976 11 k ψ k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is the fitting parameter l 0 2 was recommended by mualem 1976 and was used in this study 2 3 data the required data for the hydraulic model are a lulc the lulc data were constructed from the landsat 5 tm images chen et al 2015 with eight classes building cropland forest grassland paddy road sands and urban to confirm the details of building and road changes in between 1970 and 2019 the building and road distribution maps with 25 cm resolution in these two years were collected geospatial information authority of japan 2019a and combined with the lulc data as presented in fig 3 a for 1970 and fig 3 b for 2019 b digital elevation model dem 10 m resolution lidar dem in 1970 fig 3 c and 1 m resolution lidar dem in 2019 fig 3 d were used here dem in 2019 was upscaled to 10 m resolution to keep consistent with the resolution in 1970 c river water level the measured river water levels in hayano station along ichinomiya river fig 1 b during july 1 2 1970 chiba disaster prevention center 1971 and october 25 26 2019 ministry of land infrastructure and transportation 2020 were regarded as the forcing data for the flood events fig 3 e the measurement intervals of the river water levels were 60 min in 1970 and 10 min in 2019 which were linearly interpolated based on the time step in surface flow model d soil distribution map the soil profiles were obtained from the national land agency in chiba prefecture with resolution of 50 m aonuma et al 1974 nakamura et al 1978 based on the classification of cultivated soils in japan hirai and hamazaki 2004 the soils in the study area consist of coarse gley soil fine gley soils gray lowland soils and brown lowland soils fig 3 f shows the soils distributions with downscaled resolution of 10 m in both 1970 and 2019 assuming that the soil profiles would not change in around 50 years to validate the performance of the hydraulic model on flood simulation the social media data containing the flooded locations time stamps and inundation depths were collected e social media data we collected and verified the flood related data from twitter feeds shoyama et al 2021 local and national news blogs and forums the spatial distribution of social media data is shown in fig 1 b by circles smd a b c d e table 1 lists the source of the social media data water depths of social media data were estimated from digital surface model dsm dem and image processing refer to appendix for the details 2 4 experimental procedure the procedures of experiments in this study are i prepare necessary data mentioned in section 2 3 including the lulc dem input river water level soil and social media data ii conduct the flood simulation by the hydraulic model consisting of surface flow and soil infiltration specifically the depth of surface water in the study domain was set to be zero as the initial condition then input river water level fig 3 e was applied to the river cells figs 3 c d when the input river water level exceeded the embankment height river water would flow over the embankment to the land flood water propagation on the surface was calculated by surface flow model with lulc data figs 3 a b infiltration of inundated water to subsurface was computed by soil infiltration model with soil data fig 3 f the north south west and east boundaries were set as no flow conditions the water infiltrated into subsurface was not considered for the subsequent surface flow simulation iii the experiment was stopped when the simulated inundation depths reached constant and steady state 2 5 focused variables among the model output we focused on the areal extents of floods which was defined as the maximum inundation areas in the flood events ouyang et al 2021b we also examined the simulated time series of inundation depths at locations where the measured data were collected e g mco a b and sma a b c d e flood volume was calculated based on cell sizes inundation depths and time steps infiltration amount into subsurface was also of interest to investigate the flood impacts of lulc change 2 6 simulation scenarios and settings a summary of the simulation scenarios and settings is shown in table 2 the flood event occurred on july 1 1970 was simulated by the hydraulic model hm1970 to calibrate the model parameters including the manning s roughness coefficient n saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and van genuchten fitting parameters β c m based on the estimated flood extent from official report chiba prefecture 1971 the calibrated hydraulic model was then validated by a flood event on october 25 2019 hm2019 the flood extents estimated from geospatial information authority of japan 2019b and reported by mobara city office mobara city office 2019 and maximum inundation depths and temporal changes of water depths estimated from social media data were employed to evaluate the model results the flood responses change could be responsible for the change of lulcs dems and the river water levels therefore parametric studies were conducted by changing only one factor while keeping the others unchanged based on the case hm2019 and were named as n70p70 n70 p70 d70 and l70 where hm means hydraulic model n means lulc based manning s roughness coefficient p means lulc based permeability d means dem and l means input river water level 70 represents the year 1970 e g d70 means dem in the year 1970 was applied in the experiment while lulc and input river water level were from the year 2019 table 2 n70 and p70 were performed to disentangle the effect of lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient change and permeability change on flood extent and volume 3 results 3 1 model calibration fig 4 a shows the aerial photograph of the study area taken in the year 1970 the inundation depths which are the maximum water depths in the cells during the simulation periods obtained from the hydraulic model on july 1 1970 are presented in fig 4 b through the calibration hydraulic model hm1970 could reproduce the reported inundation areas chiba prefecture 1971 around 1 0 10 5 m 2 the friction term in shallow water equation eqs 2 3 and soil infiltration model eqs 9 11 contain fitting parameters which were calibrated by hm1970 with the reference data from ouyang et al 2021b the calibrated manning s roughness coefficients in friction term for each type of lulc are shown in table 3 regarding the soil infiltration model the thickness of unsaturated zone d was set to be 2 0 m based on the field measurement of average groundwater level ouyang et al 2021a b the initial water content was assumed to be 0 3 and distributed uniformly in this study table 4 lists the calibrated parameters for calculating the surface water infiltration into soils 3 2 model validation based on the calibrated parameters we conducted the flood simulation on october 25 2019 the performance of the flood simulation was validated with respect to the flood extent maximum inundation depth and temporal change of water depth flood extent the aerial photo taken in the year 2019 and inundation areas obtained from hydraulic model are shown in fig 5 comparison between fig 5 a and fig 4 a revealed dramatical lulc changes from 1970 to 2019 a summary of the inundation areas surveyed by mobara city office mobara city office 2019 gsi geospatial information authority of japan 2019b and simulated by hydraulic model hm2019 is shown in table 5 the flood extent reported by mobara city office was deduced from the field investigations which contains the largest surveyed flood extent gsi estimated the inundation area based on the images taken from airplane after the flood events which only consists of the severely inundated locations fig 5 b showed that the simulated flood extent hm2019 agreed with the flood extent reported by mobara city office i e only 2 difference table 5 though 143 of inundation areas were overestimated when comparing with the survey from gsi table 5 the severely inundated locations from gsi can be totally represented by the simulated flood extents fig 5 b thus we gained the confidence that the calibrated hydraulic model could provide a complete picture on the flood extent maximum inundation depth based on the reported hazard map from mobara city office the maximum inundation depths at mco a and mco b fig 5 b during the flood on october 25 2019 were around 1 90 m and 1 00 m respectively mobara city office 2019 the calculated maximum inundation depths from hydraulic model at these two locations were compared with the reported depths as shown in fig 6 results noted that the hydraulic model could reproduce the maximum inundation depth reported by mobara city office in both locations mobara city office 2019 which provided a solid foundation for subsequent analysis on flood extents temporal inundation depth the comparison between the simulated water depths and those estimated from the social media at the same time and locations smd a smd b smd c smd d and smd e is shown in fig 7 where the dashed lines are the simulated inundation depths and the open circles with error bars are the estimated inundation depths from social media observations of fig 7 revealed that both the timing and depths of actual flood can be reproduced which demonstrated that the hydraulic model was satisfactory for the quantification of inundation timing and depth in urban areas the only discrepancy was found in the recession phase at smd b orange dashed line and circles in fig 7 limitation of the hydraulic model i e delay of recession was probably caused by two assumptions 1 no stormwater infrastructure hossain anni et al 2020 and 2 no flow boundaries in the experiments these assumptions have negligible influences on the analysis of this study because parametric studies were conducted under the same conditions and inundation extent and depth were mainly dependent on the maximum inundation depth 3 3 comparison of floods in between 1970 and 2019 comparison of the reported flood extent on july 1 1970 and that on october 25 2019 by mobara city office table 5 revealed that the flood extents increased drastically in around 50 years from 1 0 105 m 2 to 5 5 105 m 2 three factors might affect the flood extents the changes of lulc dem and input river water level the differences of lulcs and dems in between 1970 and 2019 are shown in fig 8 observation of fig 8 a revealed that around 47 of the study area showed lulc changes in between 1970 and 2019 the detailed lulc distributions and net changes fig 8 c demonstrated that urbanization caused an increase in the buildings and roads while a decrease in the cropland paddy and bare sands fig 8 b noted that around 96 of the study area suffered from land subsidence ouyang et al 2020 the histogram of dem differences in fig 8 d suggested an average of 0 62 m land subsidence occurred during 50 years the difference of maximum input river water levels was around 1 2 m in between 1970 and 2019 fig 3 e a series of parametric studies were conducted to examine these factors on flood hazard table 2 table 6 summarizes the flood extents maximum flood volumes and infiltrations obtained from these parametric experiments fig 9 shows a summary of the influence of factors on the normalized differences in flood extents and volumes results noted that soil infiltration was significantly influenced by the lulc changes especially the lulc based permeability changes table 6 flood extents were greatly affected by the lulc and input river water level changes input river water level played a dominant role in controlling the flood volumes in the study area 3 4 the impacts of lulc the simulated maximum inundation depth of case n70p70 and its difference with case hm2019 are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a demonstrates that calculated flooded area by using the lulc in 1970 underestimated the flooded areas reported by mobara city office especially in the central northern part of the study area fig 10 b the water depth differences in the cells were small near the ichinomiya river comparing to the cells far from the river even though in the real condition lulc change would alter the manning s roughness coefficient and permeability simultaneously to investigate the detailed reason causing the flood extent changes by the lulc changes parametric simulations on flood extents impacts of manning s roughness coefficient change n70 and permeability change p70 were conducted and presented as follows manning s roughness coefficient the simulated maximum inundation depth by only changing the manning s roughness coefficient of 2019 to that of 1970 is shown in fig 11 a the difference between hm2019 and n70 suggested that the flood extents were quite similar fig 11 b which was responsible for the facts that the total flood volume and infiltration table 6 were not much sensitive to the manning s roughness coefficient in this study this demonstrated that even though the calibration on manning s roughness coefficient might have uncertainties which may not change the results much when investigating the effects of dominating factors such as lulc dem and input river water level on flood hazard assessment ouyang et al 2021b permeability the simulated maximum inundation depth by only changing the permeability of 2019 to that of 1970 p70 fig 11 c d indicated similar results with that of n70p70 fig 10 suggesting that the lulc change induced permeability change affected the flood extents through dominating the water infiltration into subsurface table 6 3 5 the impacts of dem fig 12 shows the simulated spatial maximum inundation depth of d70 together with its difference compared with hm2019 due to the land subsidence of the study area in between 1970 and 2019 fig 8 a around 12 of the inundation area was expanded table 6 which is consistent with the previous research that land surface elevation change would exacerbate the flood extents ouyang et al 2021b the water depth differences caused by dem changes were uniformly distributed which possibly because the dem changes in this area were rather spatially uniform fig 8 b flood volume showed around 39 decrease if the dem in 1970 was used or no land subsidence occurred during the 50 years table 6 3 6 the impacts of input river water level the simulated maximum inundation depth of case l70 and its difference with case hm2019 are shown in fig 13 approximately 28 of the calculated inundation area was decreased due to around 1 2 m decrease of the maximum input river water levels fig 3 e the differences of inundation depth in between hm2019 and l70 were also significant and around 58 reduction of flood volume was obtained in the study area table 6 the differences of the flood extent far from the river fig 13 b might be because the flood wave energy was not large enough to transport the water to a long distance 4 discussion nonlinear relation between flood extent and contributing factors through the results of hydraulic models we found that the difference of flooded area in between hm1970 and hm2019 was 4 6 10 5 m 2 due to the combined effects caused by the changes of lulc dem and input river water levels the summation of flood extent differences in the parametric cases n70p70 d70 l70 was 3 5 10 5 m 2 which was not equal to 4 6 10 5 m 2 this is reasonable for the flood research for example we simplify the flood caused by the overtopping flow from river to the land and the maximum river water level in 1970 was below the embankment height in some areas thus no flood happened there on the other hand in 2019 the maximum river water level was increased and the embankment height decreased the latter caused by land subsidence resulted in the differences between the summation of the parametric cases and the actual cases this means that the relationships among flood extent difference and changes of lulc dem and input river water level were nonlinear flood hazards estimation assuming the linear relationship among the parameters may not be realistic more advanced techniques such as combination of machine learning and fuzzy theory hosseini et al 2021 and dynamic matrix decomposition brunton et al 2017 could be employed to better understand the nonlinear relationship between flood extent and contributing factors application of this research the hydraulic model in this research can be used either as a forecasting tool to predict the inundation extent and depth of flood events or to evaluate the damages and losses caused by flood disasters in urban cities our study demonstrated that integrating social media data with hydraulic model could reduce the uncertainty of flood hazard mapping which sheds light on the communication between researchers and citizens to reach a win win situation to enhance the value of social media data data science could be incorporated into the hydraulic model to increase the flood prediction accuracy i e dynamically update the parameters through assimilating the social media data 5 conclusion the impacts of urbanization and land subsidence on hydrological processes especially on the areal extents and flooded water depths were thoroughly explored in this paper social media data were employed to estimate the temporal changes of water depth and to validate the calibrated hydraulic model which reduced the uncertainty for urban flood simulation the simulated flood extents and depths agreed well with the observations which proved the capability of the hydraulic model for flood research in the study area parametric studies indicated that the changes of lulc dem and input river water level caused around 23 12 and 27 changes of flood extents in between the years 1970 and 2019 respectively rather than the lulc change induced manning s roughness coefficient change lulc change induced permeability change was the major factor contributing to the change of flood extent due to its influences on soil infiltration around 1 2 m decrease of input river water level reduced around 58 of flood volumes from the flood simulation our research indicated that the flood extent change was not linearly related to the change of lulc dem and input river water level nonlinear decomposition method would be applied to better unravel the influences of contributing parameters on flood responses credit authorship contribution statement mao ouyang

the spatio temporal changes of water depth were estimated from the photos downloaded from social media and taken from field survey these photos were firstly calibrated to eliminate the lens distortion through opencv ouyang and takahashi 2015 bradski 2000 after the calibration the scale of pixels in the photos was estimated through the standard database i e cars signs fences ouyang and takahashi

flood depth our trial test showed that the error of water level estimated from the photos was around 0 1 m
