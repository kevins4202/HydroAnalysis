17990,data assimilation in complex water quality modeling is inevitably multivariate because several water quality variables interact and correlate in ensemble kalman filter applications determining which variables to include and the structure of the relationships among these variables is important to achieve accurate forecast results in this study various analysis methods with different combinations of variables and interaction structures were evaluated under two different simulation conditions synthetic and real in the former a synthetic experimental setting was formulated to ensure that issues including incorrect model error assumption problem spurious correlation between variables and observational data inconsistency would not distort the analysis results the latter did not have such considerations therefore this process could demonstrate the undistorted effects of the different analysis methods on the assimilated outputs and how these effects might diminish in real applications under synthetic conditions updating a single active variable was found to improve the accuracy of the other active variables and updating multiple active variables in a multivariate manner mutually enhanced the accuracy of the variables if proper ensemble covariance and observation data consistency were ensured the results of the real case indicated a weakened mutual enhancement effect and the methods in which variable localization were applied yielded the best analysis results however the multivariate analysis methods produced more accurate forecasting results indicating that these methods could be superior therefore it is suggested that multivariate analysis methods be considered first for water quality modeling and the application of variable localization should be considered if significant spurious correlations and data inconsistency are present graphical abstract image 1 keywords multivariate data assimilation ensemble kalman filter variable localization water quality modeling 1 introduction various water quality issues pertaining to regulated river systems can to some extent be controlled by changing the river flow regime for instance discharge from upstream dams can be increased to prevent salt water invasion and retention time can be reduced by lowering the river depth to prevent harmful cyanobacterial blooms thus it is necessary to decide whether these measures should be implemented and if so when in addition it is necessary to predict future events and consider the effects of countermeasures an operational forecast system can often be useful in making such predictions in operational forecast systems data assimilation da may play a significant role in improving the forecast accuracy by utilizing recent observations in addition da provides a robust framework to evaluate and manage the forecast uncertainty because each uncertain component of the modeling including initial and boundary conditions parameters model structures and observations can be evaluated separately unlike in the conventional batch calibration approach in which the entirety of modeling uncertainty is often attributed to parameter uncertainty liu and gupta 2007 liu et al 2012 although some early studies focused on applying da techniques in water quality modeling primarily by employing the extended kalman filter ekf to address water quality model dynamic nonlinearities beck and young 1976 cosby and hornberger 1984 young 1984 beck 1987 pastres et al 2003 it is only relatively recently that ensemble based techniques have been widely applied in this field kim et al 2014a b recently huang et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 a b used the ensemble kalman filter enkf to simulate a fresh water algal bloom kim et al 2014 a b applied the maximum likelihood ensemble filter mlef zupanski 2005 for watershed water quality modeling for accurate water quality modeling water quality simulations should be conducted based on preceding simulations of hydrologic processes such as watershed discharge and river flow dynamics sediment dynamics may also be included in addition various biogeochemical variables must be considered which often have highly complex causal relations for instance high water temperature causes cyanobacterial blooming thus reducing nutrient and light availability for other algal classes with high cellular chlorophyll a content and leading to low total chlorophyll a concentrations thus da in water quality modeling is inevitably multivariate even when the intent is to manipulate only one variable because this variable may interact with the other variables in the forecast or analysis the stage for combining model forecast and observation processes liu et al 2009 consequently a natural issue in multivariate da is determining how the other state variables should be set when one or more state variables are updated this aspect is important at the analysis stage due to the interactions among the state variables and the magnitudes of these interactions are generally proportional to the correlation among the state variables thus these interactions affect the accuracy of subsequent forecasts in ensemble based filtering techniques e g enkf and its variants a common technique to address the aforementioned problem is state augmentation this method simply adds multiple state variables to the model state vector and updates them based on the ensemble covariance among the variables montzka et al 2012 the technique assumes that data regarding all variables included in the error covariance matrix can be useful in updating the variables the results of several attempts to jointly assimilate multiple state variables in various fields of study support the assumption that joint updates produced improved results compared to those obtained by univariate assimilation or the assimilation of multiple variables in a univariate manner durand and margulis 2006 pauwels et al 2007 camporese et al 2009 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 however several other studies have revealed that multivariate assimilation sometimes leads to unexpected erroneous updates for example allen et al 2003 used the enkf method to simulate oceanic algae and nutrients and they noted that the accuracy of chlorophyll a simulation was degraded when both chlorophyll a and nitrate measurements were assimilated compared to that when only chlorophyll a was assimilated liu et al 2009 explicitly investigated how one observational type can be used to update other dynamical variable types that are physically correlated in an atmospheric simulation their results showed that the assimilation of relative humidity in a univariate manner in which the variable is updated considering only its own observed values outperformed the assimilation performed in a fully multivariate manner zhang et al 2016 conducted hydrological modeling using the ensemble transform kalman filter etkf to test various assimilation combinations using a groundwater head variable and soil moisture variables at two different soil depths the authors concluded that assimilating the variables in a univariate manner was superior to multivariate assimilation however they did not address the potential benefits of the multivariate assimilation and the conditions in which such benefits can be realized because their multivariate assimilation failed to provide reasonable results in fact none of the abovementioned studies provided a holistic analysis of the impacts of uni and multivariate assimilations and further study is necessary to understand the contradictory results in the literature therefore in this study we investigated the effect of covariance among variables involved in multivariate assimilation on overall model performance and on the results obtained when updating individual variables in a coupled watershed river water quality model using the enkf various update methods analysis methods consisting of various combinations of all water quality variables involved in an algal bloom simulation were examined to understand the conditions under which multivariate assimilation enhanced or degraded the model performance the same set of analysis methods was tested in both synthetic and real simulations this approach is important because most studies employing the enkf for multivariate assimilation were performed only under synthetic conditions and thus cannot fully explain factors causing unexpected assimilation results in real world applications we employed the method of variable localization introduced by kang et al 2011 as an analog to spatial localization the method simply eliminates by separating or localizing variables the effect of spurious correlations that appear when the variables are not physically correlated but present correlations due to sampling errors i e limited ensemble size finally considering the results of analysis methods in synthetic and real river simulations we propose guidelines for proper analysis methods for use in water quality modeling these suggestions for better da results may also be acceptable in general da contexts 2 material and methods 2 1 ensemble kalman filter for river water quality modeling watershed and river models are often used to sequentially simulate the hydrology and water quality in watersheds and river channels this study focuses on issues inherent in the da of dynamic river bio geochemical state variables described by a two dimensional vertically complete mixing is assumed river hydrodynamic and water quality model the outputs of the watershed simulation were used as the external forcing in the river simulation the enkf evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 employed in this work is a sequential filtering technique in which the ensemble of the model realizations represents the model error and it is sequentially updated by new observations according to the weight kalman gain of the observations the enkf was employed because of its simple structure and easy implementation clark et al 2008 liu et al 2012 if x k i b is the i th ensemble member of the background vector of the river model state variables at current time k a dynamic state space can be expressed as follows 1 x k i b f x k 1 i a u k 1 i θ w k 1 i w k i n 0 σ k 1 m where f is a function expressing the model state transition from time step k 1 to k and x k 1 i a is the analysis vector of the state variables u k 1 i and θ are the external forcing and the model parameters respectively for a linked watershed river model the dominant forcing to the river model is the flow and solute concentration from the watershed which is provided by the watershed model w k 1 i is a vector of the normally distributed random numbers with zero mean and covariance σ k 1 m representing the errors attributed to the model structure and parameters in eq 1 the states at time k 1 are integrated to the current time k via the function f practically the function is the river model itself x k b is the background matrix of the model state variables as follows 2 x k b x k 1 b x k 2 b x k n e n s b where nens is the number of the ensemble members the ensemble of the anomalies is defined as follows 3 x k b x k 1 b x k b x k n b x k b where x k b is the ensemble mean the background error covariance is calculated from the ensemble anomalies as follows 4 p k b 1 n 1 x k b x k b t then the state is updated via a linear correction equation of the standard kalman filter as follows 5 x k i a x k i b k k y k i h k x k i b where k k is the kalman gain and is computed as follows 6 k k p k b h k t h k p k b h k t r k 1 this update step is referred to as the analysis in eq 5 x k i a is the analysis vector of the model state variables after the update y k i is the observation vector h k is the observational operator that converts the state to the observation space and r k is the observation error covariance matrix y k i is generated as follows 7 y k i y k ν k i ν k i n 0 r k in eq 6 p k b h k t and h k p k b h k t are approximated respectively as follows 8 p k b h k t 1 n 1 i 1 n x k i b x k b h k x k i b h k x k b t and 9 h k p k b h k t 1 n 1 i 1 n h k x k i b h k x k b h k x k i b h k x k b t once the state variables are updated the model integration for each ensemble member for the subsequent observation is determined using eq 1 this step is called the forecast step from eqs 6 8 and 9 it is clear that the sign of k k is determined by the covariance of the ensemble between the state variable to be updated and the observational model equivalence which is the numerator in eq 6 in addition the kalman gain acts as a unit conversion factor from the unit of the observational model equivalence to the unit of the state variable to be updated therefore in the standard enkf when one state variable type is updated via the observation of another type the ensemble covariance between the two state variables and the kalman gain control the direction and magnitude of the change of the variable respectively in this regard any actual chemical or physical relations among the state variables should be well reflected in the ensemble allowing updates to be accomplished correctly however if that is not the case one may decide not to use particular state variables to update some others or to remove specific variables from the updating process to improve prediction accuracy this process can be performed by assigning zeros to the corresponding parts of the kalman gain matrix or removing the corresponding parts from the vector of the state variables x there may be several different combinations of such steps performed in multivariate da and these combinations are referred to as analysis methods in this study 2 2 model error quantification model errors were quantified by using a method similar to that outlined in clark et al 2008 however in this study to generate the model ensemble the correlation between the water quality state variables was considered whereas the aforementioned authors only considered the independent space time correlation of each state variable we followed the notation system of clark et al 2008 the perturbation to the calibrated sequence of the water quality variables of the watershed model output at the tributary outlets was calculated as follows 10 c w c w ϕ w in this manner the error variance heteroscedasticity was considered the error variability of a variable tends to be proportional to the variable itself the water quality state variables in the grid based river model were calculated as follows 11 c r c r ϕ r where c w c w c r and c r represent the perturbed and the original variable concentration for the watershed model and the river model respectively the concentration multiplier ϕ w and ϕ r can be defined as follows 12 ϕ w ϕ r 1 ε w 1 ε r 2 u w ε w u r ε r where ε w and ε r are the fractional error parameters that must be determined the correlation between the variables can be considered through the uniform random numbers u w and u r as suggested in evensen 2003 13 u t 1 2 e r f c s t 2 and 14 s t ρ s t 1 1 ρ 2 w t 1 the random field s t represents the time evolution of the model errors which is converted to a uniform distribution using eq 13 the coefficient ρ determines the temporal correlation of each state variable with one time step lag w t 1 determines the correlation between the state variables the spatial correlations between the sub catchments for u w and between the model grids for u r were assumed to be 1 to preserve the ensemble covariance as much as possible because this study primarily focused on the correlation between the state variables at the assimilation points this assumption is realistic within a certain distance as the model dynamics are spatially continuous w t 1 was computed using the cholesky decomposition algorithm the observational error in eq 7 is described by adding the perturbation ν k i to the observation and in this study r k was determined to be 10 of the observed value in the synthetic experiment described in section 2 5 1 the aforementioned watershed model output at the tributary outlet was not perturbed instead the solar radiation was assumed to be the only source of model error and it was perturbed with variances determined to be 20 of the observed values this error of 20 which is a relatively large value was arbitrarily chosen to sufficiently spread the ensemble 2 3 site and data description the yeongsan river in the southwestern part of the republic of korea was considered the entire length of the main flow channel is approximately 135 km and the drainage area is approximately 3469 6 km2 two large weirs called juksan and seungchon were constructed in the middle of the river between 2010 and 2012 fig 1 the land cover in the area consists of forest 42 0 agricultural land 32 5 urban areas 11 8 grassland 5 3 bare land 4 1 water 2 7 and wetland 9 4 a large city is located in the upper part of the watershed and its associated wastewater treatment plants average discharge 6 1 m3 s have a significant impact on the water quality of the river particularly during dry periods the climate of the study area includes four seasons the monthly mean temperatures vary from 3 1 c in january to 22 8 c in august and the mean annual precipitation is 1391 0 mm averaged over the period from 1981 to 2010 approximately 71 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season june to september observed meteorological data flow water level and water quality data were available for the duration of the model calibration and application the hourly meteorological data observed at a weather station within the watershed were provided by the korean meteorological administration the weekly flow rate and water quality data measured at the outlets of 10 tributaries indicated by the id numbers in fig 1 were available from the ministry of environment moe the water quality was also monitored weekly on the main river and the monitoring points are shown in red in fig 1 the water quality variables included dissolved oxygen do water temperature total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus dtp phosphate po4 3 p total nitrogen tn dissolved total nitrogen dtn nitrate no3 n ammonia nh4 n and chlorophyll a chl data collected at major pollution sources such as wastewater treatment and industrial plants including automatically measured continuous flow and water quality data were also provided by the moe for the geospatial input for the watershed model a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 30 m and digital land use and soil maps were employed in addition detailed cross sectional river data from the yeongsan river were provided by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport and they were used to obtain the river geometric input information regarding the hydraulic structures including two large weirs and an estuary dam was also used for the river model configuration 2 4 models and state variables the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf model barnwell 1980 and the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model hamrick 1992 were employed the hspf model simulates rainfall runoff processes in watersheds and water quality in flows the model output variables at the tributary outlets include the flow and the water quality state variables that are used by the efdc model as the boundary inputs the efdc model simulates the hydrodynamics and bio geochemical processes in a river channel including the transport mixing and reactions of the water quality state variables and their interaction with meteorological factors because the bio geochemical processes exhibit a mutual dependency the involved state variables often have strong correlations fig 2 presents schematics of the bio geochemical processes described in the efdc model which describe the relations of the state variables more detailed information regarding the hspf and the efdc models can be found in bicknell et al 1997 and park et al 1995 respectively the domain of the hspf model includes the tributary basins upstream from the juksan monitoring point and their outlets are linked to the efdc model that simulates the main river fig 1 the domain consists of 10 sub watersheds delineated based on the flow gauging or water quality observation station locations the hspf model was calibrated using the observed stream flow and water quality data at the tributary outlet points from a six year period 2008 2013 the main parameters adjusted include decay rates of organic matters and those for algae and nutrient kinetics the calibrated hspf model was run for the first eight months of 2014 and it produced the time series of flow and water quality variables at the tributary outlets the efdc model grid and tributary confluence points water quality measurement points and hydraulic structures in the main river are shown in fig 1 the model domain covers the river section extending from the juksan weir to uchi the domain consists of 390 grids with an average grid size of approximately 284 3 106 4 m this size was selected to reasonably capture the lateral variations in the channel bathymetry and hydraulic structures i e the number of weir gates the model was calibrated using the flow level and water quality data observed during 2014 the main parameters adjusted include those of algae and nutrient kinetics such as algal growth rates and half saturation constants for this calibration the observed flow and water quality data at the tributary outlets were considered rather than the hspf simulation results all the water quality state variables used for watershed and river modeling are listed in table 1 the table also shows the conversion process of the hspf output variables to the efdc input variables the hspf output variables included chl total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc tp dissolved organic phosphorus dop po4 3 p tn dissolved organic nitrogen don nh4 n no3 n and do the flow rate and water temperature were also determined using the hspf model and entered into the efdc model as inputs however we did not include them in the da process and thus they are not listed in the table because this study focused on the effect of variable correlation on da performance and on determining an adequate variable localization strategy for da only the state variables with reciprocal relations not unidirectional interactions were included although the uncertainty of the two variables could affect the water quality among the efdc output variables same as the input variables listed in table 1 the particulate forms of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen that were not provided by the hspf outputs were obtained via a simple conversion of the difference between the total and dissolved forms and their subsequent separation into refractory and labile forms bias correction was conducted for all hspf outputs variables and then they were perturbed according to the error models described in section 2 2 these perturbed variables passed through the prescribed conversion before being used as the efdc model inputs thus the particulate forms of the variables could also be perturbed the nine final forms of the efdc output variables were classified as active and non active variables the term active indicates that the variables are directly correlated with the target variable chl through model dynamics thus changes in the values of these variables via updates are expected to directly affect the other variables the active variables can be selected by considering the model equations however the model parameters can also define variable relationships in a calibrated model thus to determine the active variables we evaluated the relationships between each state variable in the efdc model equations see fig 2 and their correlations with chl within the ensemble produced from the synthetic simulation as explained in section 2 5 1 chl po4 3 p nh4 n and do were determined to be the active variables while observational data could be used for all the active variables among the non active variables only data for no3 n were available the analysis methods described in the following sections were formulated by considering different treatments of the two variable types in the analysis 2 5 application 2 5 1 synthetic simulation experiment several common factors in operational multivariate da may cause erroneous state variable updates the factors include incorrect model error assumptions spurious correlations between variables and observational data inconsistencies the true model errors are never known and model error representations cannot be perfectly accurate this discordance may lead to incorrect updates the spurious correlations caused by limited ensemble size or sampling errors affect the updates as well data inconsistency such as when the sum of the measured sub constituents is erroneously greater than the directly measured total value of a constituent can degrade the filtering results when these factors affect update results proper evaluation of multivariate da performance is not possible to evaluate the various analysis methods without the influence of the factors described the methods were tested under synthetic conditions synthetic twin experiments can simplify or avoid the complexities encountered in operational da and can be a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate filter performance crow and loon 2006 in the experiment a model ensemble was constructed based on a true model error that was assumed to be perfectly known open loop simulation a member of the ensemble was randomly selected and considered to represent the true states and the synthetic true observation was determined based on it this true observation was perturbed to represent the observation error and then used for da in the enkf the ensemble for the enkf was generated based on an assumed model error which was identical to the known model error thus a synthetic condition was generated using the calibrated efdc model among the external forcings only solar radiation was amplified to produce an ensemble with 12 members for each variable that is the solar radiation was assumed to be the only source of model error all other efdc inputs were unperturbed a set of multipliers was randomly generated from a uniform distribution ranging from 0 2 to 0 2 and then multiplied across the entire time series of the measurements indicating amplifications in a range of 20 of the measured values through this process we obtained an ensemble in which the inherent correlations of the state variables were generated from the model dynamics for a particular synthetic condition here the active variables had a near perfect correlation with chl because only the solar radiation affects chl by changing the algal growth rate the other active variables are forced to dependently change via the model dynamics thus the ensemble of the active variables present no or minimal spurious correlations despite the limited ensemble size further because of the equivalence of the assumed model error to the true model error as stated above the factors that cause erroneous updating can be controlled consequently allowing the various methods to be comparably assessed this novel aspect distinguishes our synthetic experiment from most others the generated ensemble correlations between the active variables are either proportional or inversely proportional for example because the algae uptakes po4 3 p for growth and releases it in different forms when it excretes or dies the po4 3 p ensemble is expected to be inversely proportional to that of chl the averaged ensemble correlations of all the variables over the entire temporal observational period are presented in table 2 one of the 12 member simulations was randomly selected and assumed to represent the true values subsequently weekly data on only the selected member at the juksan monitoring point were determined to represent the true observational values thus observation data consistency was maintained between the variables although synthetic observation information could be available for all the variables we assumed that the observational data were available only for the five variables for which observed data were available in the real case to enable a fair comparison of the results table 1 therefore synthetic observations of only doc particulate organic carbon poc ton and top were used an observational error of 10 of the observational value was applied to obtain synthetic observational values adding the observational error is essential to avoid filter divergence because in enkf the covariance of the analyzed ensemble is systematically underestimated if random noise is not added to the observations whitaker and hamill 2002 efdc simulations were performed for the five different analysis methods we aimed to determine which analysis method most accurately predicted the target variable and other active variables to enable analysis and forecasting case i was a univariate analysis of chl which means that only chl was included in the analysis and was updated using its own observed values all other variables were not included in the analysis thus the change in chl did not affect the other variables directly and its influence only appeared in forecast step based on model dynamics for case ii all nine variables were included in the analysis however the variables were still updated only according to chl observations case iii was the same as case ii except that the observed values of chl po4 3 p nh4 n do and no3 n were considered in a multivariate manner that is each of these observations were used to update the corresponding variable as well as the other variables in case iv only the active variables were included in the analysis and observed values for all of them were included in a multivariate manner case iv differed from case iii in that no3 n doc poc ton and top were eliminated from the analysis case v was the same as case iv except that the variables were updated in a univariate manner meaning that each variable was updated only according to its own observed values and no interaction occurred in the analysis variable localization a schematic of the methods examined is shown in fig 3 2 5 2 real world application the ensemble simulations of the efdc model with da were conducted under real yeongsan river conditions from january 1 to august 31 2014 the hspf model outputs were perturbed by the error models described in section 2 2 to generate 12 ensemble members we retained the same ensemble size as in the synthetic simulation experiment for comparison despite its relatively small size because our intention was not to reduce spurious correlations simply by using a large ensemble size the same five analysis methods were applied but the observations consisted of actual weekly measurements regarding the number of observation points used for the da two different cases were separately developed first only the juksan data were used as in the synthetic case and second five different monitoring points were considered including juksan as the farthest downstream point the real conditions differ from the synthetic conditions in that the assumed model error is never identical to the true model error the spurious correlation between variables due to the limited ensemble size can be significant and observational data consistency is often not maintained these are typical problems that are encountered when using a complex forecasting model under operational conditions note that observational data inconsistency may be caused by both incorrect model error assumptions and large observational errors however because we assumed a relatively small observation error 10 of the observational value data inconsistency was assumed to be attributable to incorrect model error assumptions 3 results 3 1 synthetic simulation experiment the average root mean square error rmse values of the entire simulation period for the five analysis methods are shown in fig 4 the rmses of the open loop simulation no da results are also shown for comparison the forecast and analysis rmses were obtained by comparing the ensemble mean of the forecast before the update and analysis after the update to the observations respectively the rmses for chl in case i were considerably reduced compared to those for the open loop however the errors for the other variables were not reduced as they were not included in the analysis the chl update may affect these variables but only through the forecast step via the model dynamics although top and ton were not involved in the analysis their rmses were lower than those of the open loop the amount of organic phosphorus and nitrogen in algae changed proportionally due to the chl update leading to updates more similar to the observations in case ii the chl forecast accuracy was slightly degraded compared to that of case i however it was improved for most of the other active variables although the chl values were the only ones observed for da this suggests that if the ensemble represents an actual correlation among the variables and observational data consistency is maintained updating one state variable can improve the accuracy of the other state variables which is an important feature of the enkf in case ii the direction of the updates of the active variables po4 3 p and nh4 n were exactly opposite to that of chl because their ensemble correlation with chl was negative the do updates were in the same direction as those of chl because of their positive correlation with chl see fig 5 for a presentation of this concept in case iv in case iii the rmse of most variables decreased significantly compared to those in the previous cases as more observational types were involved in the da the chl analysis accuracy significantly improved this is an interesting consequence of the mutual enhancement between the active variables that is when chl and the other active variables are updated together using their own respective observations the updates of the other active variables help the chl update better reflect its observed values than in cases where chl observations alone are used cases i ii because of the strong correlations of the other active variables with chl this mutual enhancement effect can be the key benefit of multivariate da case iv in which the non active variables were excluded from the analysis appears to be offering the most accurate results among the scenarios not only was the target variable error the lowest for both the analysis and forecast the errors for the other active variables were also minimized the marginal improvement of the case iv results over those of case iii is attributable to the exclusion of the non active variables from the analysis case v is the same as case iv except that no interaction occurred between the active variables in the analysis that is the variables were updated using their own observations only the errors of case v were greater than those of case iv because the effect of the mutual enhancement was eliminated recently yu et al 2018 investigated the multivariate updating of physical and biogeochemical ocean variables in synthetic experiments using the enkf and reported similar results multivariate updates improved the simulations of the state variables more than did isolated updates however they did not consider the updating of multiple variables with variable localization as in case v because in their isolated update cases biogeochemical variables were used to update only the biogeochemical variables or physical variables were used to update only the physical variables simultaneous updating of both types of variables was not performed fig 5 shows the time series outputs of case iv for the entire simulation period as a representative case note that the synthetic observations of the variables other than chl are on the same or opposite side as those of chl from the mean of the open loop depending on the sign of the correlation with chl this aspect implies forced data consistency which is attributed to the model error being identical to the true model error the effect of the da appears to last longer during the early part of the simulation than during the later part because the flow velocity is lower during the early part although top and ton were not included in the analysis in case iv their values appeared updated at each observational point as their concentration in the algae biomass was changed by the chl updates even this indirect update increased the simulation accuracy because observational data consistency was maintained for the synthetic top and ton data although they were not used in the da 3 2 real application results the simulation errors of the same five analysis methods for the real application with data observed only at juksan are shown in fig 6 the results were somewhat different from those of the synthetic cases the cases involving univariate updating demonstrated relatively low analysis errors case i involved the least error for the analysis of chl unlike the corresponding synthetic univariate case case ii also demonstrated relatively low error however these cases forecasting performances were poor compared to those of cases iii and iv although the differences between the forecast errors in cases i and ii and cases iii and iv were marginal the analysis errors in cases iii and iv for chl increased compared to those of the previous two cases while the results for the other active variables when their own observations were included improved especially do this implies a trade off between chl accuracy and that of the other active variables this trade off may be considered a drawback of da in common real situations when observational data inconsistency exists in cases iii and iv of the synthetic simulation no such trade off occurred but a mutual enhancement effect between the variables was noted because their observational values were inherently consistent in a real case applying ensemble da this trade off effect is common when variables are assimilated in a multivariate manner zhang et al 2016 an interesting finding for real case ii is that the analysis error for chl was similar to that in case i but was higher for po4 3 p no3 n and poc in the same synthetic simulation case however the accuracy of most active variables was improved by updating the chl this indicates that in the real case the ensemble correlation of these variables with chl was not accurately represented in the ensemble or that their observations were not consistent as in the synthetic case the inaccurate ensemble correlation may be partly attributable to the limited ensemble size or the incorrect representation of the model error the latter is also a possible cause of data inconsistency despite the low accuracy of the chl analysis due to the trade off effect the forecast accuracy of cases iii and iv for chl was higher than that of cases i and ii this indicates that updating the other active variables can improve the accuracy of forecasts of the target variable although the forecast accuracy can vary with lead time here the lead time is seven days and if the variables are not updated forecasting accuracy may be reduced case v demonstrates lower analysis errors for most active variables compared to those of case iv because the variables were updated in a univariate manner that is each active variable was localized as stated above when the variables are updated in a univariate manner a relatively low analysis error can usually be achieved unlike in the synthetic case however this aspect does not always lead to a higher forecast accuracy due to potential over assimilation a phenomenon similar to parameter over fitting which means that the variables are updated too close to their respective observations leading to reduced forecast accuracy although the forecast error for chl in case iv was equal to that of case v as shown in fig 6 it was lower in the simulation case with five observational points as shown in fig 8 addressed below the trade off effect among the active variables can help avoid over assimilation fig 6 the output time series for real case iv are shown in fig 7 as a representative case for comparison with the corresponding synthetic case the ensemble means of the active variables follow the observations much better than those of the open loop except for that of nh4 n the ensemble spread of nh4 n is extremely narrow and thus larger weights were assigned on the model than the observations resulting in only small updates the non active variables were not updated at the observational points however as in the synthetic simulation results top and ton were affected by chl updates leading to significant improvements in accuracy fig 8 shows the results of the five real analysis scenarios using observational data from the five different points with juksan being the most downstream point overall the results resemble those of the real case in fig 6 however case iv produced the most accurate chl forecast results despite the relatively high analysis error whereas the cases employing univariate updating cases i and v demonstrated relatively poor forecast accuracy implying that variable localization needs to be carefully applied 4 discussion many successful examples of multivariate assimilation in the existing literature are the results of synthetic experiments and these successes may be attributed to the mutual enhancement effect camporese et al 2009 li et al 2012 pasetto et al 2012 yu et al 2018 without this effect the performance of multivariate assimilation would be only comparable to or worse than that of univariate assimilation including multiple variable updates with variable localization in real world applications this effect can easily be eliminated due to the occurrence of spurious correlations among state variables and data inconsistency or erroneous assumptions concerning model error the results of liu et al 2009 for a real world global atmospheric simulation showed that the analysis of relative humidity in a univariate manner outperformed an analysis conducted in a fully multivariate manner concerning wind temperature and surface pressure kurtz et al 2014 conducted multivariate assimilation using enkf for groundwater temperature and heads and the model parameters the results of updating only the groundwater head variable outperformed the results generated when jointly updating both the head and temperature although the difference was marginal this result may be attributed to an improper ensemble covariance generated by failing to consider the correlation among the forcing states and parameters zhang et al 2016 extended the analysis configurations for soil moisture and groundwater head assimilation to real world watershed applications however they did not consider a joint multivariate approach in their comparison however even in their synthetic experiment mentioned earlier updating the two variables with variable localization significantly reduced model error compared to that of the joint multivariate approach this finding may be attributed to the presence of unrealistic inter variable and cross variable correlations in the model ensemble which resulted in the failure of the joint multivariate analysis zhang et al 2016 however even if univariate assimilation achieves a relatively lower analysis error than that of the multivariate assimilation due to the trade off effect induced by spurious correlation and data inconsistency it does not always lead to a higher forecast accuracy as it is subject to over assimilation liu et al 2009 found that although a univariate analysis outperformed a multivariate analysis the multivariate approach demonstrated better forecasting performance the authors attributed this result to the more balanced analysis field produced through multivariate updating which is similar to the trade off effect therefore in real world applications the best forecast outputs could potentially be attained by applying an approach between a fully univariate or multivariate analysis balancing the precise updating of individual variables and the consideration of relationships between variables to maximize the benefits of multivariate assimilation ensuring a realistic representation of the ensemble covariance among the variables to be updated minimizing spurious correlations and ensuring data consistency may be necessary 5 conclusions in multivariate da determining the state variables that should be included and how their relationships should be structured in the analysis are critical issues that must be addressed to achieve the best forecast results for the targeted variables we addressed these issues in water quality eutrophication modeling which is essentially multivariate from the results of the synthetic case in which incorrect model error assumptions spurious correlations and observational data inconsistencies could be controlled it was shown that analysis methods in which the active variables were updated in a multivariate manner cases iii and iv produced the most accurate analysis and forecast outputs owing to the mutual enhancement effect under real conditions the same methods produced less accurate analysis outputs compared to those involving a univariate approach due to the trade off effect between the active variables however the multivariate methods produced the most accurate forecast indicating that the trade off effect helps avoid the over assimilation of the active variables therefore when aiming for accurate forecasts we suggest that analysis methods that update active variables in a multivariate manner should be considered first subsequently applying variable localization to some or all the variables may be considered in cases with significant spurious correlations or observational data inconsistencies funding this work was supported by the national institute of environmental research republic of korea research project nier 2015 01 01 034

17990,data assimilation in complex water quality modeling is inevitably multivariate because several water quality variables interact and correlate in ensemble kalman filter applications determining which variables to include and the structure of the relationships among these variables is important to achieve accurate forecast results in this study various analysis methods with different combinations of variables and interaction structures were evaluated under two different simulation conditions synthetic and real in the former a synthetic experimental setting was formulated to ensure that issues including incorrect model error assumption problem spurious correlation between variables and observational data inconsistency would not distort the analysis results the latter did not have such considerations therefore this process could demonstrate the undistorted effects of the different analysis methods on the assimilated outputs and how these effects might diminish in real applications under synthetic conditions updating a single active variable was found to improve the accuracy of the other active variables and updating multiple active variables in a multivariate manner mutually enhanced the accuracy of the variables if proper ensemble covariance and observation data consistency were ensured the results of the real case indicated a weakened mutual enhancement effect and the methods in which variable localization were applied yielded the best analysis results however the multivariate analysis methods produced more accurate forecasting results indicating that these methods could be superior therefore it is suggested that multivariate analysis methods be considered first for water quality modeling and the application of variable localization should be considered if significant spurious correlations and data inconsistency are present graphical abstract image 1 keywords multivariate data assimilation ensemble kalman filter variable localization water quality modeling 1 introduction various water quality issues pertaining to regulated river systems can to some extent be controlled by changing the river flow regime for instance discharge from upstream dams can be increased to prevent salt water invasion and retention time can be reduced by lowering the river depth to prevent harmful cyanobacterial blooms thus it is necessary to decide whether these measures should be implemented and if so when in addition it is necessary to predict future events and consider the effects of countermeasures an operational forecast system can often be useful in making such predictions in operational forecast systems data assimilation da may play a significant role in improving the forecast accuracy by utilizing recent observations in addition da provides a robust framework to evaluate and manage the forecast uncertainty because each uncertain component of the modeling including initial and boundary conditions parameters model structures and observations can be evaluated separately unlike in the conventional batch calibration approach in which the entirety of modeling uncertainty is often attributed to parameter uncertainty liu and gupta 2007 liu et al 2012 although some early studies focused on applying da techniques in water quality modeling primarily by employing the extended kalman filter ekf to address water quality model dynamic nonlinearities beck and young 1976 cosby and hornberger 1984 young 1984 beck 1987 pastres et al 2003 it is only relatively recently that ensemble based techniques have been widely applied in this field kim et al 2014a b recently huang et al 2013 and kim et al 2014 a b used the ensemble kalman filter enkf to simulate a fresh water algal bloom kim et al 2014 a b applied the maximum likelihood ensemble filter mlef zupanski 2005 for watershed water quality modeling for accurate water quality modeling water quality simulations should be conducted based on preceding simulations of hydrologic processes such as watershed discharge and river flow dynamics sediment dynamics may also be included in addition various biogeochemical variables must be considered which often have highly complex causal relations for instance high water temperature causes cyanobacterial blooming thus reducing nutrient and light availability for other algal classes with high cellular chlorophyll a content and leading to low total chlorophyll a concentrations thus da in water quality modeling is inevitably multivariate even when the intent is to manipulate only one variable because this variable may interact with the other variables in the forecast or analysis the stage for combining model forecast and observation processes liu et al 2009 consequently a natural issue in multivariate da is determining how the other state variables should be set when one or more state variables are updated this aspect is important at the analysis stage due to the interactions among the state variables and the magnitudes of these interactions are generally proportional to the correlation among the state variables thus these interactions affect the accuracy of subsequent forecasts in ensemble based filtering techniques e g enkf and its variants a common technique to address the aforementioned problem is state augmentation this method simply adds multiple state variables to the model state vector and updates them based on the ensemble covariance among the variables montzka et al 2012 the technique assumes that data regarding all variables included in the error covariance matrix can be useful in updating the variables the results of several attempts to jointly assimilate multiple state variables in various fields of study support the assumption that joint updates produced improved results compared to those obtained by univariate assimilation or the assimilation of multiple variables in a univariate manner durand and margulis 2006 pauwels et al 2007 camporese et al 2009 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 however several other studies have revealed that multivariate assimilation sometimes leads to unexpected erroneous updates for example allen et al 2003 used the enkf method to simulate oceanic algae and nutrients and they noted that the accuracy of chlorophyll a simulation was degraded when both chlorophyll a and nitrate measurements were assimilated compared to that when only chlorophyll a was assimilated liu et al 2009 explicitly investigated how one observational type can be used to update other dynamical variable types that are physically correlated in an atmospheric simulation their results showed that the assimilation of relative humidity in a univariate manner in which the variable is updated considering only its own observed values outperformed the assimilation performed in a fully multivariate manner zhang et al 2016 conducted hydrological modeling using the ensemble transform kalman filter etkf to test various assimilation combinations using a groundwater head variable and soil moisture variables at two different soil depths the authors concluded that assimilating the variables in a univariate manner was superior to multivariate assimilation however they did not address the potential benefits of the multivariate assimilation and the conditions in which such benefits can be realized because their multivariate assimilation failed to provide reasonable results in fact none of the abovementioned studies provided a holistic analysis of the impacts of uni and multivariate assimilations and further study is necessary to understand the contradictory results in the literature therefore in this study we investigated the effect of covariance among variables involved in multivariate assimilation on overall model performance and on the results obtained when updating individual variables in a coupled watershed river water quality model using the enkf various update methods analysis methods consisting of various combinations of all water quality variables involved in an algal bloom simulation were examined to understand the conditions under which multivariate assimilation enhanced or degraded the model performance the same set of analysis methods was tested in both synthetic and real simulations this approach is important because most studies employing the enkf for multivariate assimilation were performed only under synthetic conditions and thus cannot fully explain factors causing unexpected assimilation results in real world applications we employed the method of variable localization introduced by kang et al 2011 as an analog to spatial localization the method simply eliminates by separating or localizing variables the effect of spurious correlations that appear when the variables are not physically correlated but present correlations due to sampling errors i e limited ensemble size finally considering the results of analysis methods in synthetic and real river simulations we propose guidelines for proper analysis methods for use in water quality modeling these suggestions for better da results may also be acceptable in general da contexts 2 material and methods 2 1 ensemble kalman filter for river water quality modeling watershed and river models are often used to sequentially simulate the hydrology and water quality in watersheds and river channels this study focuses on issues inherent in the da of dynamic river bio geochemical state variables described by a two dimensional vertically complete mixing is assumed river hydrodynamic and water quality model the outputs of the watershed simulation were used as the external forcing in the river simulation the enkf evensen 1994 burgers et al 1998 employed in this work is a sequential filtering technique in which the ensemble of the model realizations represents the model error and it is sequentially updated by new observations according to the weight kalman gain of the observations the enkf was employed because of its simple structure and easy implementation clark et al 2008 liu et al 2012 if x k i b is the i th ensemble member of the background vector of the river model state variables at current time k a dynamic state space can be expressed as follows 1 x k i b f x k 1 i a u k 1 i θ w k 1 i w k i n 0 σ k 1 m where f is a function expressing the model state transition from time step k 1 to k and x k 1 i a is the analysis vector of the state variables u k 1 i and θ are the external forcing and the model parameters respectively for a linked watershed river model the dominant forcing to the river model is the flow and solute concentration from the watershed which is provided by the watershed model w k 1 i is a vector of the normally distributed random numbers with zero mean and covariance σ k 1 m representing the errors attributed to the model structure and parameters in eq 1 the states at time k 1 are integrated to the current time k via the function f practically the function is the river model itself x k b is the background matrix of the model state variables as follows 2 x k b x k 1 b x k 2 b x k n e n s b where nens is the number of the ensemble members the ensemble of the anomalies is defined as follows 3 x k b x k 1 b x k b x k n b x k b where x k b is the ensemble mean the background error covariance is calculated from the ensemble anomalies as follows 4 p k b 1 n 1 x k b x k b t then the state is updated via a linear correction equation of the standard kalman filter as follows 5 x k i a x k i b k k y k i h k x k i b where k k is the kalman gain and is computed as follows 6 k k p k b h k t h k p k b h k t r k 1 this update step is referred to as the analysis in eq 5 x k i a is the analysis vector of the model state variables after the update y k i is the observation vector h k is the observational operator that converts the state to the observation space and r k is the observation error covariance matrix y k i is generated as follows 7 y k i y k ν k i ν k i n 0 r k in eq 6 p k b h k t and h k p k b h k t are approximated respectively as follows 8 p k b h k t 1 n 1 i 1 n x k i b x k b h k x k i b h k x k b t and 9 h k p k b h k t 1 n 1 i 1 n h k x k i b h k x k b h k x k i b h k x k b t once the state variables are updated the model integration for each ensemble member for the subsequent observation is determined using eq 1 this step is called the forecast step from eqs 6 8 and 9 it is clear that the sign of k k is determined by the covariance of the ensemble between the state variable to be updated and the observational model equivalence which is the numerator in eq 6 in addition the kalman gain acts as a unit conversion factor from the unit of the observational model equivalence to the unit of the state variable to be updated therefore in the standard enkf when one state variable type is updated via the observation of another type the ensemble covariance between the two state variables and the kalman gain control the direction and magnitude of the change of the variable respectively in this regard any actual chemical or physical relations among the state variables should be well reflected in the ensemble allowing updates to be accomplished correctly however if that is not the case one may decide not to use particular state variables to update some others or to remove specific variables from the updating process to improve prediction accuracy this process can be performed by assigning zeros to the corresponding parts of the kalman gain matrix or removing the corresponding parts from the vector of the state variables x there may be several different combinations of such steps performed in multivariate da and these combinations are referred to as analysis methods in this study 2 2 model error quantification model errors were quantified by using a method similar to that outlined in clark et al 2008 however in this study to generate the model ensemble the correlation between the water quality state variables was considered whereas the aforementioned authors only considered the independent space time correlation of each state variable we followed the notation system of clark et al 2008 the perturbation to the calibrated sequence of the water quality variables of the watershed model output at the tributary outlets was calculated as follows 10 c w c w ϕ w in this manner the error variance heteroscedasticity was considered the error variability of a variable tends to be proportional to the variable itself the water quality state variables in the grid based river model were calculated as follows 11 c r c r ϕ r where c w c w c r and c r represent the perturbed and the original variable concentration for the watershed model and the river model respectively the concentration multiplier ϕ w and ϕ r can be defined as follows 12 ϕ w ϕ r 1 ε w 1 ε r 2 u w ε w u r ε r where ε w and ε r are the fractional error parameters that must be determined the correlation between the variables can be considered through the uniform random numbers u w and u r as suggested in evensen 2003 13 u t 1 2 e r f c s t 2 and 14 s t ρ s t 1 1 ρ 2 w t 1 the random field s t represents the time evolution of the model errors which is converted to a uniform distribution using eq 13 the coefficient ρ determines the temporal correlation of each state variable with one time step lag w t 1 determines the correlation between the state variables the spatial correlations between the sub catchments for u w and between the model grids for u r were assumed to be 1 to preserve the ensemble covariance as much as possible because this study primarily focused on the correlation between the state variables at the assimilation points this assumption is realistic within a certain distance as the model dynamics are spatially continuous w t 1 was computed using the cholesky decomposition algorithm the observational error in eq 7 is described by adding the perturbation ν k i to the observation and in this study r k was determined to be 10 of the observed value in the synthetic experiment described in section 2 5 1 the aforementioned watershed model output at the tributary outlet was not perturbed instead the solar radiation was assumed to be the only source of model error and it was perturbed with variances determined to be 20 of the observed values this error of 20 which is a relatively large value was arbitrarily chosen to sufficiently spread the ensemble 2 3 site and data description the yeongsan river in the southwestern part of the republic of korea was considered the entire length of the main flow channel is approximately 135 km and the drainage area is approximately 3469 6 km2 two large weirs called juksan and seungchon were constructed in the middle of the river between 2010 and 2012 fig 1 the land cover in the area consists of forest 42 0 agricultural land 32 5 urban areas 11 8 grassland 5 3 bare land 4 1 water 2 7 and wetland 9 4 a large city is located in the upper part of the watershed and its associated wastewater treatment plants average discharge 6 1 m3 s have a significant impact on the water quality of the river particularly during dry periods the climate of the study area includes four seasons the monthly mean temperatures vary from 3 1 c in january to 22 8 c in august and the mean annual precipitation is 1391 0 mm averaged over the period from 1981 to 2010 approximately 71 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season june to september observed meteorological data flow water level and water quality data were available for the duration of the model calibration and application the hourly meteorological data observed at a weather station within the watershed were provided by the korean meteorological administration the weekly flow rate and water quality data measured at the outlets of 10 tributaries indicated by the id numbers in fig 1 were available from the ministry of environment moe the water quality was also monitored weekly on the main river and the monitoring points are shown in red in fig 1 the water quality variables included dissolved oxygen do water temperature total phosphorus tp dissolved total phosphorus dtp phosphate po4 3 p total nitrogen tn dissolved total nitrogen dtn nitrate no3 n ammonia nh4 n and chlorophyll a chl data collected at major pollution sources such as wastewater treatment and industrial plants including automatically measured continuous flow and water quality data were also provided by the moe for the geospatial input for the watershed model a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 30 m and digital land use and soil maps were employed in addition detailed cross sectional river data from the yeongsan river were provided by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport and they were used to obtain the river geometric input information regarding the hydraulic structures including two large weirs and an estuary dam was also used for the river model configuration 2 4 models and state variables the hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf model barnwell 1980 and the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model hamrick 1992 were employed the hspf model simulates rainfall runoff processes in watersheds and water quality in flows the model output variables at the tributary outlets include the flow and the water quality state variables that are used by the efdc model as the boundary inputs the efdc model simulates the hydrodynamics and bio geochemical processes in a river channel including the transport mixing and reactions of the water quality state variables and their interaction with meteorological factors because the bio geochemical processes exhibit a mutual dependency the involved state variables often have strong correlations fig 2 presents schematics of the bio geochemical processes described in the efdc model which describe the relations of the state variables more detailed information regarding the hspf and the efdc models can be found in bicknell et al 1997 and park et al 1995 respectively the domain of the hspf model includes the tributary basins upstream from the juksan monitoring point and their outlets are linked to the efdc model that simulates the main river fig 1 the domain consists of 10 sub watersheds delineated based on the flow gauging or water quality observation station locations the hspf model was calibrated using the observed stream flow and water quality data at the tributary outlet points from a six year period 2008 2013 the main parameters adjusted include decay rates of organic matters and those for algae and nutrient kinetics the calibrated hspf model was run for the first eight months of 2014 and it produced the time series of flow and water quality variables at the tributary outlets the efdc model grid and tributary confluence points water quality measurement points and hydraulic structures in the main river are shown in fig 1 the model domain covers the river section extending from the juksan weir to uchi the domain consists of 390 grids with an average grid size of approximately 284 3 106 4 m this size was selected to reasonably capture the lateral variations in the channel bathymetry and hydraulic structures i e the number of weir gates the model was calibrated using the flow level and water quality data observed during 2014 the main parameters adjusted include those of algae and nutrient kinetics such as algal growth rates and half saturation constants for this calibration the observed flow and water quality data at the tributary outlets were considered rather than the hspf simulation results all the water quality state variables used for watershed and river modeling are listed in table 1 the table also shows the conversion process of the hspf output variables to the efdc input variables the hspf output variables included chl total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc tp dissolved organic phosphorus dop po4 3 p tn dissolved organic nitrogen don nh4 n no3 n and do the flow rate and water temperature were also determined using the hspf model and entered into the efdc model as inputs however we did not include them in the da process and thus they are not listed in the table because this study focused on the effect of variable correlation on da performance and on determining an adequate variable localization strategy for da only the state variables with reciprocal relations not unidirectional interactions were included although the uncertainty of the two variables could affect the water quality among the efdc output variables same as the input variables listed in table 1 the particulate forms of carbon phosphorus and nitrogen that were not provided by the hspf outputs were obtained via a simple conversion of the difference between the total and dissolved forms and their subsequent separation into refractory and labile forms bias correction was conducted for all hspf outputs variables and then they were perturbed according to the error models described in section 2 2 these perturbed variables passed through the prescribed conversion before being used as the efdc model inputs thus the particulate forms of the variables could also be perturbed the nine final forms of the efdc output variables were classified as active and non active variables the term active indicates that the variables are directly correlated with the target variable chl through model dynamics thus changes in the values of these variables via updates are expected to directly affect the other variables the active variables can be selected by considering the model equations however the model parameters can also define variable relationships in a calibrated model thus to determine the active variables we evaluated the relationships between each state variable in the efdc model equations see fig 2 and their correlations with chl within the ensemble produced from the synthetic simulation as explained in section 2 5 1 chl po4 3 p nh4 n and do were determined to be the active variables while observational data could be used for all the active variables among the non active variables only data for no3 n were available the analysis methods described in the following sections were formulated by considering different treatments of the two variable types in the analysis 2 5 application 2 5 1 synthetic simulation experiment several common factors in operational multivariate da may cause erroneous state variable updates the factors include incorrect model error assumptions spurious correlations between variables and observational data inconsistencies the true model errors are never known and model error representations cannot be perfectly accurate this discordance may lead to incorrect updates the spurious correlations caused by limited ensemble size or sampling errors affect the updates as well data inconsistency such as when the sum of the measured sub constituents is erroneously greater than the directly measured total value of a constituent can degrade the filtering results when these factors affect update results proper evaluation of multivariate da performance is not possible to evaluate the various analysis methods without the influence of the factors described the methods were tested under synthetic conditions synthetic twin experiments can simplify or avoid the complexities encountered in operational da and can be a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate filter performance crow and loon 2006 in the experiment a model ensemble was constructed based on a true model error that was assumed to be perfectly known open loop simulation a member of the ensemble was randomly selected and considered to represent the true states and the synthetic true observation was determined based on it this true observation was perturbed to represent the observation error and then used for da in the enkf the ensemble for the enkf was generated based on an assumed model error which was identical to the known model error thus a synthetic condition was generated using the calibrated efdc model among the external forcings only solar radiation was amplified to produce an ensemble with 12 members for each variable that is the solar radiation was assumed to be the only source of model error all other efdc inputs were unperturbed a set of multipliers was randomly generated from a uniform distribution ranging from 0 2 to 0 2 and then multiplied across the entire time series of the measurements indicating amplifications in a range of 20 of the measured values through this process we obtained an ensemble in which the inherent correlations of the state variables were generated from the model dynamics for a particular synthetic condition here the active variables had a near perfect correlation with chl because only the solar radiation affects chl by changing the algal growth rate the other active variables are forced to dependently change via the model dynamics thus the ensemble of the active variables present no or minimal spurious correlations despite the limited ensemble size further because of the equivalence of the assumed model error to the true model error as stated above the factors that cause erroneous updating can be controlled consequently allowing the various methods to be comparably assessed this novel aspect distinguishes our synthetic experiment from most others the generated ensemble correlations between the active variables are either proportional or inversely proportional for example because the algae uptakes po4 3 p for growth and releases it in different forms when it excretes or dies the po4 3 p ensemble is expected to be inversely proportional to that of chl the averaged ensemble correlations of all the variables over the entire temporal observational period are presented in table 2 one of the 12 member simulations was randomly selected and assumed to represent the true values subsequently weekly data on only the selected member at the juksan monitoring point were determined to represent the true observational values thus observation data consistency was maintained between the variables although synthetic observation information could be available for all the variables we assumed that the observational data were available only for the five variables for which observed data were available in the real case to enable a fair comparison of the results table 1 therefore synthetic observations of only doc particulate organic carbon poc ton and top were used an observational error of 10 of the observational value was applied to obtain synthetic observational values adding the observational error is essential to avoid filter divergence because in enkf the covariance of the analyzed ensemble is systematically underestimated if random noise is not added to the observations whitaker and hamill 2002 efdc simulations were performed for the five different analysis methods we aimed to determine which analysis method most accurately predicted the target variable and other active variables to enable analysis and forecasting case i was a univariate analysis of chl which means that only chl was included in the analysis and was updated using its own observed values all other variables were not included in the analysis thus the change in chl did not affect the other variables directly and its influence only appeared in forecast step based on model dynamics for case ii all nine variables were included in the analysis however the variables were still updated only according to chl observations case iii was the same as case ii except that the observed values of chl po4 3 p nh4 n do and no3 n were considered in a multivariate manner that is each of these observations were used to update the corresponding variable as well as the other variables in case iv only the active variables were included in the analysis and observed values for all of them were included in a multivariate manner case iv differed from case iii in that no3 n doc poc ton and top were eliminated from the analysis case v was the same as case iv except that the variables were updated in a univariate manner meaning that each variable was updated only according to its own observed values and no interaction occurred in the analysis variable localization a schematic of the methods examined is shown in fig 3 2 5 2 real world application the ensemble simulations of the efdc model with da were conducted under real yeongsan river conditions from january 1 to august 31 2014 the hspf model outputs were perturbed by the error models described in section 2 2 to generate 12 ensemble members we retained the same ensemble size as in the synthetic simulation experiment for comparison despite its relatively small size because our intention was not to reduce spurious correlations simply by using a large ensemble size the same five analysis methods were applied but the observations consisted of actual weekly measurements regarding the number of observation points used for the da two different cases were separately developed first only the juksan data were used as in the synthetic case and second five different monitoring points were considered including juksan as the farthest downstream point the real conditions differ from the synthetic conditions in that the assumed model error is never identical to the true model error the spurious correlation between variables due to the limited ensemble size can be significant and observational data consistency is often not maintained these are typical problems that are encountered when using a complex forecasting model under operational conditions note that observational data inconsistency may be caused by both incorrect model error assumptions and large observational errors however because we assumed a relatively small observation error 10 of the observational value data inconsistency was assumed to be attributable to incorrect model error assumptions 3 results 3 1 synthetic simulation experiment the average root mean square error rmse values of the entire simulation period for the five analysis methods are shown in fig 4 the rmses of the open loop simulation no da results are also shown for comparison the forecast and analysis rmses were obtained by comparing the ensemble mean of the forecast before the update and analysis after the update to the observations respectively the rmses for chl in case i were considerably reduced compared to those for the open loop however the errors for the other variables were not reduced as they were not included in the analysis the chl update may affect these variables but only through the forecast step via the model dynamics although top and ton were not involved in the analysis their rmses were lower than those of the open loop the amount of organic phosphorus and nitrogen in algae changed proportionally due to the chl update leading to updates more similar to the observations in case ii the chl forecast accuracy was slightly degraded compared to that of case i however it was improved for most of the other active variables although the chl values were the only ones observed for da this suggests that if the ensemble represents an actual correlation among the variables and observational data consistency is maintained updating one state variable can improve the accuracy of the other state variables which is an important feature of the enkf in case ii the direction of the updates of the active variables po4 3 p and nh4 n were exactly opposite to that of chl because their ensemble correlation with chl was negative the do updates were in the same direction as those of chl because of their positive correlation with chl see fig 5 for a presentation of this concept in case iv in case iii the rmse of most variables decreased significantly compared to those in the previous cases as more observational types were involved in the da the chl analysis accuracy significantly improved this is an interesting consequence of the mutual enhancement between the active variables that is when chl and the other active variables are updated together using their own respective observations the updates of the other active variables help the chl update better reflect its observed values than in cases where chl observations alone are used cases i ii because of the strong correlations of the other active variables with chl this mutual enhancement effect can be the key benefit of multivariate da case iv in which the non active variables were excluded from the analysis appears to be offering the most accurate results among the scenarios not only was the target variable error the lowest for both the analysis and forecast the errors for the other active variables were also minimized the marginal improvement of the case iv results over those of case iii is attributable to the exclusion of the non active variables from the analysis case v is the same as case iv except that no interaction occurred between the active variables in the analysis that is the variables were updated using their own observations only the errors of case v were greater than those of case iv because the effect of the mutual enhancement was eliminated recently yu et al 2018 investigated the multivariate updating of physical and biogeochemical ocean variables in synthetic experiments using the enkf and reported similar results multivariate updates improved the simulations of the state variables more than did isolated updates however they did not consider the updating of multiple variables with variable localization as in case v because in their isolated update cases biogeochemical variables were used to update only the biogeochemical variables or physical variables were used to update only the physical variables simultaneous updating of both types of variables was not performed fig 5 shows the time series outputs of case iv for the entire simulation period as a representative case note that the synthetic observations of the variables other than chl are on the same or opposite side as those of chl from the mean of the open loop depending on the sign of the correlation with chl this aspect implies forced data consistency which is attributed to the model error being identical to the true model error the effect of the da appears to last longer during the early part of the simulation than during the later part because the flow velocity is lower during the early part although top and ton were not included in the analysis in case iv their values appeared updated at each observational point as their concentration in the algae biomass was changed by the chl updates even this indirect update increased the simulation accuracy because observational data consistency was maintained for the synthetic top and ton data although they were not used in the da 3 2 real application results the simulation errors of the same five analysis methods for the real application with data observed only at juksan are shown in fig 6 the results were somewhat different from those of the synthetic cases the cases involving univariate updating demonstrated relatively low analysis errors case i involved the least error for the analysis of chl unlike the corresponding synthetic univariate case case ii also demonstrated relatively low error however these cases forecasting performances were poor compared to those of cases iii and iv although the differences between the forecast errors in cases i and ii and cases iii and iv were marginal the analysis errors in cases iii and iv for chl increased compared to those of the previous two cases while the results for the other active variables when their own observations were included improved especially do this implies a trade off between chl accuracy and that of the other active variables this trade off may be considered a drawback of da in common real situations when observational data inconsistency exists in cases iii and iv of the synthetic simulation no such trade off occurred but a mutual enhancement effect between the variables was noted because their observational values were inherently consistent in a real case applying ensemble da this trade off effect is common when variables are assimilated in a multivariate manner zhang et al 2016 an interesting finding for real case ii is that the analysis error for chl was similar to that in case i but was higher for po4 3 p no3 n and poc in the same synthetic simulation case however the accuracy of most active variables was improved by updating the chl this indicates that in the real case the ensemble correlation of these variables with chl was not accurately represented in the ensemble or that their observations were not consistent as in the synthetic case the inaccurate ensemble correlation may be partly attributable to the limited ensemble size or the incorrect representation of the model error the latter is also a possible cause of data inconsistency despite the low accuracy of the chl analysis due to the trade off effect the forecast accuracy of cases iii and iv for chl was higher than that of cases i and ii this indicates that updating the other active variables can improve the accuracy of forecasts of the target variable although the forecast accuracy can vary with lead time here the lead time is seven days and if the variables are not updated forecasting accuracy may be reduced case v demonstrates lower analysis errors for most active variables compared to those of case iv because the variables were updated in a univariate manner that is each active variable was localized as stated above when the variables are updated in a univariate manner a relatively low analysis error can usually be achieved unlike in the synthetic case however this aspect does not always lead to a higher forecast accuracy due to potential over assimilation a phenomenon similar to parameter over fitting which means that the variables are updated too close to their respective observations leading to reduced forecast accuracy although the forecast error for chl in case iv was equal to that of case v as shown in fig 6 it was lower in the simulation case with five observational points as shown in fig 8 addressed below the trade off effect among the active variables can help avoid over assimilation fig 6 the output time series for real case iv are shown in fig 7 as a representative case for comparison with the corresponding synthetic case the ensemble means of the active variables follow the observations much better than those of the open loop except for that of nh4 n the ensemble spread of nh4 n is extremely narrow and thus larger weights were assigned on the model than the observations resulting in only small updates the non active variables were not updated at the observational points however as in the synthetic simulation results top and ton were affected by chl updates leading to significant improvements in accuracy fig 8 shows the results of the five real analysis scenarios using observational data from the five different points with juksan being the most downstream point overall the results resemble those of the real case in fig 6 however case iv produced the most accurate chl forecast results despite the relatively high analysis error whereas the cases employing univariate updating cases i and v demonstrated relatively poor forecast accuracy implying that variable localization needs to be carefully applied 4 discussion many successful examples of multivariate assimilation in the existing literature are the results of synthetic experiments and these successes may be attributed to the mutual enhancement effect camporese et al 2009 li et al 2012 pasetto et al 2012 yu et al 2018 without this effect the performance of multivariate assimilation would be only comparable to or worse than that of univariate assimilation including multiple variable updates with variable localization in real world applications this effect can easily be eliminated due to the occurrence of spurious correlations among state variables and data inconsistency or erroneous assumptions concerning model error the results of liu et al 2009 for a real world global atmospheric simulation showed that the analysis of relative humidity in a univariate manner outperformed an analysis conducted in a fully multivariate manner concerning wind temperature and surface pressure kurtz et al 2014 conducted multivariate assimilation using enkf for groundwater temperature and heads and the model parameters the results of updating only the groundwater head variable outperformed the results generated when jointly updating both the head and temperature although the difference was marginal this result may be attributed to an improper ensemble covariance generated by failing to consider the correlation among the forcing states and parameters zhang et al 2016 extended the analysis configurations for soil moisture and groundwater head assimilation to real world watershed applications however they did not consider a joint multivariate approach in their comparison however even in their synthetic experiment mentioned earlier updating the two variables with variable localization significantly reduced model error compared to that of the joint multivariate approach this finding may be attributed to the presence of unrealistic inter variable and cross variable correlations in the model ensemble which resulted in the failure of the joint multivariate analysis zhang et al 2016 however even if univariate assimilation achieves a relatively lower analysis error than that of the multivariate assimilation due to the trade off effect induced by spurious correlation and data inconsistency it does not always lead to a higher forecast accuracy as it is subject to over assimilation liu et al 2009 found that although a univariate analysis outperformed a multivariate analysis the multivariate approach demonstrated better forecasting performance the authors attributed this result to the more balanced analysis field produced through multivariate updating which is similar to the trade off effect therefore in real world applications the best forecast outputs could potentially be attained by applying an approach between a fully univariate or multivariate analysis balancing the precise updating of individual variables and the consideration of relationships between variables to maximize the benefits of multivariate assimilation ensuring a realistic representation of the ensemble covariance among the variables to be updated minimizing spurious correlations and ensuring data consistency may be necessary 5 conclusions in multivariate da determining the state variables that should be included and how their relationships should be structured in the analysis are critical issues that must be addressed to achieve the best forecast results for the targeted variables we addressed these issues in water quality eutrophication modeling which is essentially multivariate from the results of the synthetic case in which incorrect model error assumptions spurious correlations and observational data inconsistencies could be controlled it was shown that analysis methods in which the active variables were updated in a multivariate manner cases iii and iv produced the most accurate analysis and forecast outputs owing to the mutual enhancement effect under real conditions the same methods produced less accurate analysis outputs compared to those involving a univariate approach due to the trade off effect between the active variables however the multivariate methods produced the most accurate forecast indicating that the trade off effect helps avoid the over assimilation of the active variables therefore when aiming for accurate forecasts we suggest that analysis methods that update active variables in a multivariate manner should be considered first subsequently applying variable localization to some or all the variables may be considered in cases with significant spurious correlations or observational data inconsistencies funding this work was supported by the national institute of environmental research republic of korea research project nier 2015 01 01 034

17991,tropical conditions favour the auto decomposition of monochloramine mca leading to disinfectant decay and free ammonia in drinking water distribution systems dwds thus they promote the growth of nitrifiers and the development of biofilms on the inner pipe surface biofilms can adversely impact the provision of safe and biologically stable water moreover there is a general lack of understanding of the role of microbial communities in dwds in regions with warm temperatures and no distinct seasons here we report a survey on biofilms from full scale monochloraminated dwds in a highly urbanised metropolis using next generation sequencing tools the monitoring campaign consisted of sampling biofilms and bulk waters from 21 in service pipes we characterized the microbial community with emphasis on nitrifying bacteria and archaea using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and potential nitrification activity samples grouped into two clusters characterized by their low cluster ld and high cluster hd α diversity both clusters harbour microorganisms related to nitrification i nitrosomonas 24 9 68 8 an ammonia oxidising bacterium aob that dominated cluster ld and ii a co aggregation of genus nitrospira 9 8 32 5 a nitrite oxidising bacterium nob and thaumarchaeota 1 4 10 9 chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidising aoa archaea that were among the most abundant otus in cluster hd activity tests performed with fresh biofilm samples confirmed that these two clusters represent distinctive biofilm niches performing different stages of the nitrification process cluster ld correlated with a high concentration of mca which caused dysbiosis and resulted in high unevenness of the cluster in cluster hd with more biomass chemical reactions involving nitrite increased the mca demand releasing ammonia and allowing more nitrifiers to grow like aoa and nob from this study we conclude that an mca residual gradient along the dwds drives and shapes the microbial community assembly and should be considered when designing effective disinfection strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilms drinking water distribution systems nitrifiers thaumarchaeota monochloramine metabarcoding 1 introduction monochloramine mca has become the agent of choice in many water treatment facilities in the world to prevent microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems dwds and to guarantee the water quality from source to tap chloramination is preferred to chlorination because a free disinfectant residual is easier to maintain and the formation of regulated disinfection by products like trihalomethanes is reduced vikesland et al 2001 moreover mca is better at penetrating and effectively disinfecting biofilms lee et al 2011 because it does not experience diffusion limitation lechevallier et al 1990 although its efficiency will depend on the composition of the extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilms xue et al 2014 conversely mca has also been shown to promote nitrification nitrification can take place within a chloraminated dwds due to the presence of ammonia baribeau and regan 2013 which is added to react with free chlorine and form the monochloramine nh2cl disinfectant residual zhang et al 2009 hence ammonia is available as energy source for ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and archaea aoa by oxidation to nitrite nitrite can react with chloramine reinforcing its decay and or be oxidised to nitrate by nitrite oxidising bacteria nob promoting the development of biofilms and affecting water quality in the pipeline network the microbial composition of biofilms developed on the inner surface of dwds pipes is poorly studied because of limited access to actual pipes sampling and analysis costs and logistical issues hence most available information about microbial communities in drinking water systems derives from studies of the water phase bautista de los santos et al 2016 el chakhtoura et al 2015 perrin et al 2019 pinto et al 2012 shaw et al 2015 biological activated carbon and rapid sand filters gülay et al 2016 kasuga et al 2010 and pipe biofilms developed in laboratory and pilot scale reactors douterelo et al 2016 wang et al 2014 the presence and role of microorganisms in full scale systems is much less understood several studies have reported the occurrence of biofilms in dwds and the major variables that affect their formation appear to be pipe material ren et al 2015 water age and water quality fish et al 2016 kooij and wielen 2014 liu et al 2016 prest et al 2016 most of the available information has been obtained from using model systems pilot or bench scale and removable coupons to simulate the development of biofilms in dwds douterelo et al 2014 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2016 henne et al 2012 mi et al 2015 revetta et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2014 and proxies such as water meters ling et al 2016 lührig et al 2015 with a short operation time however informative such systems do not necessarily reflect actual conditions in distribution pipes replicating real world distribution systems at the laboratory scale represents a considerable challenge due to differences in the surface area to volume ratio pipe material flow rate and experimental duration generally short term few in situ studies have been published using next generation sequencing ngs to characterize the microbial community of pipe biofilms gomez smith et al 2015 hwang et al 2012 kelly et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lührig et al 2015 ren et al 2015 and all of them were performed in countries with a temperate climate seasonal changes and disinfectant free or chlorinated chloraminated networks only one previous study on dwds has been performed in a tropical city namely in cali colombia montoya pachongo et al 2018 but it used chlorine instead of mca as a residual disinfectant chloramines are used as secondary disinfectant in many countries around the world including the united states australia canada singapore and european countries like spain finland sweden and great britain if employed in a tropical climate with high uniform temperature and no distinct seasons the prevailing environmental conditions may expedite the decay of monochloramine by auto decomposition producing free ammonia vikesland et al 2001 and potentially trigger nitrification more episodes of nitrification have been reported during summer or when the temperature was higher than 15 c baribeau and regan 2013 moreover no aob were detected when temperatures were lower than 18 c wolfe et al 1990 the optimal temperature for nitrification in dwds ranges from 25 to 30 c zhang et al 2009 this study surveyed biofilms from a full scale dwds in a highly urbanised tropical metropolis in south east asia using 16s rrna based metabarcoding for microbial community sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis to understand the implications for the provision of biologically stable water biofilms were collected from pipes with long term exposure to disinfectants having been in service between six and 60 years and with a range of diameters and materials the multi parametric approach involved cultivation independent molecular methods and biological activity tests to characterize the microbial communities in biofilms as well as characterization of bulk water samples collected close to the biofilm sampling point our objectives were to i understand the nitrification potential and determine the distributions of nitrifying aob aoa and nob in dwds biofilms and ii establish the relationship between nitrifying communities microbial diversity and water quality and pipe characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and water treatment characteristics the water utility relies on reservoir water which receives inputs in the form of surface water from local catchment areas imported treated water highly purified reclaimed water and desalinated water briefly the reservoir water is pumped to the waterworks and passed through self cleaning screens to remove particles greater than 1 m subsequent steps include chemical treatment filtration and disinfection coagulation and flocculation is achieved using aluminium sulphate as the main coagulant depending on need hydrated lime is also added to adjust the ph of the raw water for best flocculation results polyelectrolyte is used as a coagulant aid filtration occurs by rapid gravity filters and chlorine is applied for disinfection granular activated carbon filters remove any remaining natural organic matter and bad odour ammonia is added to the treated water containing free chlorine to form a stable monochloramine residual sodium silicofluoride is added to the water on its way from the filter to the clear water tank and the water is distributed to communities from service reservoirs in service pipe segments were obtained during replacement and or expansion works in the dwds biofilms were sampled from the interior of the water mains immediately after pipe cutting using a sterilised metal spatula and scraping at least 20 50 cm from the cut end to minimize the risk of contamination see details of sampling protocol in si annex three replicates for molecular analysis were snap frozen in a dry shipper containing liquid n2 and another three samples used for activity analysis were then placed in a cooler and preserved at 4 c after collection each sample was immediately transported for laboratory processing all frozen samples were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction concurrently immediately before cutting water samples from the nearest accessible hydrant located upstream were collected for water quality characterization following standardized methods apha 2012 table s1 a total of 21 samples were analysed from several locations across the metropolis table 1 due to the very low biomass present on the pipe walls samples for biological activity tests were not collected during five collection exercises since priority was given to the molecular analysis relevant information regarding pipe characteristics such as location pipe age pipe material and pipe diameter was assembled table 1 2 2 genomic dna gdna extraction drinking water biofilm samples have a very low amount of biomass therefore after optimization the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals was selected to extract genomic dna from the biofilm samples briefly about 0 5 g of sample biofilm scraping was placed in a lysing matrix tube immersed in cls tc buffer mp biomedicals and beat beating for 40 s at 6 m s in a fastprep 24 instrument mp biomedicals the final elution volume was reduced to 50 μl the dna concentration were determined with a qubit 2 0 fluorometer using the dsdna high sensitivity kit invitrogen california extracted and purified gdna was stored at 20 c until amplicon library preparation 2 3 16s rrna amplicon sequencing amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was performed with two amplification steps initially 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr targeting the v4 v5 hypervariable region 515f forward primer 5 id gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 926r reverse primer 5 id ccgycaattymtttragttt 3 this primer set was modified specifically to decrease bias towards archaea parada et al 2016 negative controls were also run with every batch of pcr pcr reactions were performed with 6 ng of template gdna 12 5 μl of kapa hifi hotstart readymix kapa biosystems 0 5 μm of reverse and forward primers and nuclease free water to complete 25 μl reaction volume the pcr reaction conditions were as follows 95 c for 3 min 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 40 s and 72 c for 30 s and a final extension step of 72 c for 5 min the triplicate pcr products were pooled and purified using magnetic beads agencourt ampure xp pcr purification beckman coulter purified pcr products were then quality and size checked using the agilent 2200 tapestation platform pcr amplicons were subjected to a second round of pcr to implement the illumina dual barcodes after library quantification multiplexed samples were sequenced using the miseq sequencer platform illumina inc san diego ca at the singapore centre for environmental life sciences engineering scelse the miseq reagent kit v3 was used to produce pair end reads of 300 bp length and 15 phix was spiked into the library the raw reads were quality trimmed threshold q20 and adapters primers were removed using cutadapt 1 9 1 martin 2011 and paired end read merger pear 0 9 8 zhang et al 2014 was used to merge reads the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime 1 9 1 pipeline caporaso et al 2010 was followed using uchime for chimera removal and de novo operational taxonomic unit otu clustering with uclust edgar 2010 at a 3 sequence divergence threshold for grouping the silva rrna gene database quast et al 2013 was applied for taxonomy assignment reads aligned to phi x chloroplast and mitochondria were removed as well as singletons and doubletons a total of 3 949 606 high quality merged paired end sequences with an average length of 380 bp were retrieved after trimming quality filtering and merging the range of sequences per sample was 57 340 448 754 in order to compare samples at the same sequencing depth the microbial community analysis was performed with a randomised normalization to 50 000 sequences per sample very close to the lowest number of reads 57 340 obtained in sample pb14 2 4 nitrification activity test the occurrence of ammonia oxidising microorganisms aom including bacteria and archaea and nob was studied using the most probable number mpn statistical analysis after growing nitrifying bacteria in microtiter plates the activity test was performed using a slurry preparation of the biofilm samples collected at 4 c briefly 5 g of biofilm sample was placed into 100 ml of 1 sterilised surfactant and detergent solution tween 80 carefully swirled and sonicated for 10 min in a water bath sonicator elmasonic s120h to obtain a homogenized suspension the mixture was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in aom or nob growth medium as shown below the cell suspension was used to inoculate microtiter plates containing mineral media for aom with nh4 2so4 as n source and nob with nano2 as suggested by deboer et al 1995 and laanbroek and pfennig 1981 respectively after lipponen et al 2002 some modifications were made to adapt the assay to tropical conditions i the incubation temperature used was 30 c and ii the incubation period was four weeks or eight weeks when no activity was observed in the fourth week we chose this incubation time because longer periods were not representative the growth of aom was evaluated by determining the presence of nitrite or nitrate in the medium the determination was performed by adding 40 μl of 0 2 diphenylamine in h2so4 to the wells and then reading the od at 630 nm in a plate reader where blue wells were scored as positive the presence of nitrite in nob media was determined by adding 40 μl of griess illosvay reagent to the wells after 5 min the od was measured at 540 nm and a red colour in wells was scored as negative for nob activity because the presence of nitrite indicates lack of nitrate formation lipponen et al 2002 2 5 statistical and multivariate analysis of community structures and diversity to assess similarity between microbial communities we employed ordination methods and clustering analysis using primer7 v7 software clarke and gorley 2015 for this purpose the rarified otu biom table was square root transformed and then a resemblance bray curtis similarity matrix was constructed furthermore for comparison purposes a weighted unifrac distance matrix was also calculated using phyloseq in r mcmurdie and holmes 2013 tests of the multivariate null hypotheses of no differences among defined groups were examined using analysis of similarities anosim clarke 1993 with 999 permutations implemented in primer7 correlation tests were performed with r package cor test using spearman correlation coefficient since data were not normally distributed according to shapiro test and the sample size was smaller than 30 unconstrained nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination nmds was used to display similarities in microbial community structures among all samples combined with cluster and simprof analysis to study the true structure within the data phyloseq was used to calculate diversity indexes chao1 shannon and 1 λ simpson s index for evenness 3 results 3 1 survey sampling a total of 21 samples were collected from pipes during replacement across multiple locations the distance to reservoir source varied from 1 0 pb08 to 18 3 km pb18 with a median value of 10 0 km table 1 pipes sampled had diverse sizes and ages of service the range of diameters was from 100 to 700 mm with a median of 150 mm while the pipe age range was from six pb03 to 60 pb10 years of service the pipes were made of four types of material ductile iron cement lined dicl cast iron cement lined cicl asbestos cement asc and stainless steel cement lined sscl table 1 most of the samples were collected from the stretch sector of the pipelines only sample pb10 corresponded to a dead end pipeline and sample pb08 was collected closest to the source of water supply 3 2 water quality the water quality measurements during each sampling collection table 2 and table si1 complied with the 2011 world health organization guidelines the average concentration of nitrate was 0 56 0 25 mg no3 n l the highest concentration of nitrate 1 0 mg no3 n l was determined in sample pb09 which is below the guideline value set by legislation no3 as n 10 mg l the disinfectant residual concentrations varied from 1 0 to 2 0 mg l table 2 the water phase quality according to who standards of e coli and hpc within the distribution system was relatively biologically stable irrespective of sampling location and type of source water the microbial water quality in terms of e coli and total coliforms was satisfactory with counts below the limit of detection lod of 1 cfu 100 ml for the total set of samples 3 3 drinking water pipe microbiome 3 3 1 α diversity measures the microbial community structure for 20 biofilm samples was determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing one sample pb19 did not yield enough pcr product for sequencing the rarefaction curves from normalized profiles of the 20 samples denoted that the depth and sequencing coverage was sufficient for the diversity encountered in the biofilm community from the drinking water pipes fig s2 most of the otus 600 were present in at least two or three samples figure s3a while only eight otus with an abundance greater than 0 1 were present in all 20 samples analysed figure s3b the richness was determined by calculating the number of otus observed and the chao 1 index there was a high variability in the number of species present in samples ranging from 392 pb12 to 1529 otus pb13 table 3 the inverse simpson diversity index 1 λ is more sensitive to changes in abundances of common otus therefore sample pb18 showed the highest α diversity followed by samples pb01 and pb10 the 1 λ diversity index varied from 2 2 to 55 5 indicating the presence of dominant otus in pb05 and pb12 lower values compared to samples with more microbial community evenness such as pb18 and pb01 higher values table 3 3 3 2 microbial community composition in pipe biofilms biofilms in pipes were diverse with an average of 20 phyla per sample at a relative abundance 0 1 taxonomic classification revealed that three phyla dominated the community and accounted for 84 6 of the total 63 9 17 3 of otus were associated with the phylum proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria 11 3 12 3 and nitrospira 9 4 10 2 in the full set of samples studied fig 1 there was high variability in composition across samples at the phylum level the most abundant phylum proteobacteria varied from 35 pb17 to 90 in samples pb06 and pb11 the abundance of the domain archaea was very low for the whole set of samples 2 however its abundance fluctuated within a range of 0 0 10 8 pb21 and it showed a strong positive association with the phylum nitrospira ρ 0 93 p 0 01 the classes within the phylum proteobacteria fluctuated in an inverse fashion fig 1 the two most abundant classes were alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria with an inverse association ρ 0 80 p 0 05 in each sample interestingly the phylum nitrospira showed a positive correlation with class alphaproteobacteria ρ 0 80 p 0 01 and a negative one with class betaproteobacteria ρ 0 90 p 0 01 3 3 3 community structure low and high diversity clusters both the unifrac weighted distance metric and the bray curtis pairwise comparison of the similarity of individual communities at the otu level revealed a very distinct community structure among samples when illustrated as ordination plots fig s5 ordination analysis of the microbial community by means of a hierarchical cluster plot showed that the majority of the samples grouped into two clusters fig 1 the simprof analysis examined three pairs of samples in each cluster where observed similarity non significant difference is larger than expected by chance red branches fig 1 this suggests the presence of a true structure within the data sample pb 17 is an outlier and is not part of any of the two clusters found statistically significant differences in α diversity indexes 1 λ p 0 0005 and shannon p 0 0002 were found between these two groups based on this finding the two clusters shown in fig 1 are distinguished as having i a low α diversity upper branches henceforth termed low diversity ld cluster and ii a high α diversity bottom branches termed high diversity hd cluster at the genus level cluster ld was dominated by nitrosomonas with the greatest proportion of sequences ranging from 24 9 to 68 8 meanwhile in cluster hd the genera nitrospira 9 8 32 5 parvularcula 2 4 15 2 phylum thaumarchaeota 1 4 10 9 bradyrizhobium 0 5 11 5 and family rhodospirillacea 0 6 12 4 were the most abundant otus the genus nitrospira was dominated by the co occurrence of two species otus from sublineage ii sample pb17 is an outlier characterized by the high abundance of three uncultured genera belonging to the families nitrospiraceae 16 2 rhodocyclaceae 15 7 and order ignavibacteriales 14 5 3 3 4 microbial community drivers the most important taxa related to nitrification and responsible for the significant differences observed between the microbial community structures in the two clusters were selected by simper analysis table 4 the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between all pairs of sites from ld and hd clusters was 69 9 represented as the sum of the avdiss in the table the contribution of nitrosomonas to the total 69 9 was 12 30 nitrospira sublinage ii accounted for 7 86 and thaumarchaeota for 4 40 all named lineages together amounting to 25 of the total difference nitrospira and thaumarchaeota showed the highest diss sd ratio 2 75 and 2 13 respectively and were the most important discriminating species 3 3 5 influence of water quality on microbial community assemblages monochloramine resistant organisms distlm dbrda analysis was used to further assess if water quality drives the microbial community structure table s2 monochloramine concentration emerged as one of the best predictors among water quality parameters to explain the variability in total microbial community assemblage in the dwds fig 2 and table s2 cluster ld correlated with a high concentration of monochloramine 1 7 0 2 mg l p 0 0175 the disinfectant stress selected for the most resistant and tolerant microorganisms thereby causing the high unevenness of this cluster which was dominated by nitrosomonas moreover the cluster ld also harboured high relative abundances of other reported monochloramine resistant organisms such as hyphomicrobium 0 1 37 6 methylobacterium 0 2 15 8 and sphingomonas 0 2 8 3 on the other hand the biplot also revealed that total phosphorous tp nitrate and total trihalomethanes tthms correlated with cluster hd and there was an inverse association with ph fig 2 high nitrate concentrations and lower ph are consequences of nitrification taking place the concentration of aoc in cluster ld was 53 6 13 8 as ppb acetate c and in cluster hd it was 58 0 26 2 as ppb acetate c the toc was 1 12 0 22 mg l and 1 10 0 24 mg l for hd and ld respectively means were not statistically different for this type of water with a high concentration of organic carbon phosphorous is considered the limiting substrate within dwds with high levels of aoc and when present is positively correlated with biofilm growth lehtola et al 2002 this was supported by the higher amount of biomass extracted from samples of cluster hd x 15 9 ng μl compared to cluster ld x 0 25 ng μl fig s6 the high concentrations of tthms suggested a reaction of chloramine with the organic matter of the eps matrix all these factors demonstrate that nitrification is the prevalent process occurring in cluster hd which also explains its higher diversity and the risk of the onset of a biocorrosion process due to lower ph level monochloramine correlated negatively with nitrite r 0 599 p 0 001 nitrite increased the monochloramine demand releasing ammonia and allowing other bacteria and or archaea to grow like aoa and nob other heterotrophic nitrate reducers such as bradyrizobium and parvularcula were also able to survive likely thanks to the soluble microbial products synthesized by organisms present in cluster hd 3 4 microbial community assemblages and relationship with pipe characteristics to compare similarities between groups the statistical test anosim was used to assess the relationship between pipe characteristics and the microbial community assembly table 5 pipe material and years of service are two related characteristics because since the 1980s most of the pipes installed are made of dicl thirty five years of pipe service was chosen as cut off for the age groups statistically significant differences between the two age groups were found samples related to cluster ld came from the younger pipes 35 years meanwhile samples from cluster hd were all older than 40 years with the exception of sample pb03 which was the youngest at six years of service the test also determined significant differences between the pipe diameters 100 and 300 mm r 0 786 p 0 028 samples from cluster hd had a smaller diameter small pipe diameters mean large surface areas for biofilm formation or in other words larger surface area to volume ratios than in the bigger pipes regardless of material all the pipes were cement lined meaning the surface where biofilm adhesion and growth happened was cement in all cases we surmise that only the surface material the cement lining could have reacted with the disinfectant or be subjected to microbial colonization furthermore statistical analysis anosim with pipe material as factor showed differences were barely significant between dicl and cicl p value 0 044 and not at all for the other materials table s3 3 5 nitrifier niches in biofilms 3 5 1 nitrifying microbial community the characterization of the dw pipe biofilms by high throughput 16s rrna targeted sequencing revealed that bacterial and archaeal taxa associated with nitrification comprised 34 52 of the total microbial community fig 3 the two clusters harboured microorganisms related to nitrification table s4 evidence that n related processes occur in the studied drinking water networks biofilms among aob taxa nitrosomonas arose in all samples of cluster ld from 0 08 pb08 to 68 85 pb05 in cluster hd nitrosococcus was present in samples pb03 4 46 and pb21 0 54 and nitrosospira in six out of eight samples with an average of 0 06 the aoa 16s rrna gene sequences were classified as a single taxon associated to a thaumarchaeotal lineage within cluster marine group i and were present in all samples from cluster hd ranging from 1 44 to 10 98 in sample pb21 in cluster ld aoa were present at very low abundance in samples pb08 0 34 pb02 0 19 and pb13 0 10 among the nob nitrospira were more abundant in cluster hd comprising 8 71 pb18 to 32 50 pb21 compared to cluster ld where pb02 had the highest proportion 6 52 leptospirillum showed low abundance 0 01 in six out of 20 samples one otu assigned as uncultured genus of family nitrospiraceae represented 18 78 and 4 12 of relative abundance in samples pb17 and pb08 respectively most of the nitrifier genera detected are chemolithoautotrophic slow growing and have high energy costs to fix inorganic carbon for growth all known members of phylum thaumarchaeota are chemolithotrophic aoa 3 5 2 potential nitrification activity tests ammonia oxidation aom activity occurred in 15 samples tested fig 4 and was above 103 mpn g meanwhile nitrite oxidation took place mostly in samples from cluster hd 102 mpn g and it was completely absent in samples from cluster ld an exception was sample pb16 with very low cell concentrations 10 mpn g after eight weeks of incubation 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and nitrification activity tests showed good agreement fig 4b most of the ld samples containing only aom showed only ammonia oxidation activity nitritation meanwhile samples with aob aoa and nob sequences from cluster hd exhibited complete nitrification using the potential activity mpn assay sample pb03 had the highest abundance of nitrospira 29 and also the highest nob activity 105 mpn g thus the correlation between nitrite oxidation activity and the relative abundance of nob was confirmed spearman s ρ 0 78 p value 9 43 10 4 16s rrna amplicon sequencing of samples pb17 revealed very low abundance almost nil of known aoa aob and high relative abundance of nob however high ammonia oxidising potential activity was observed similarly samples pb01 pb07 and pb10 showed low abundance of aoa 5 but high ammonia oxidation activity 4 discussion the microbial communities identified in this study were similar to those found in other biofilms or bulk water from dwds with proteobacteria as the dominant phylum suggesting it is well suited to surviving under potable water conditions liu et al 2016 our results also showed a high correlation of α diversity with mca dose similarly mi et al 2015 found that mca stimulated the dominance of proteobacteria decreasing microbial diversity in chloraminated drinking water biofilm from pilot scale reactors in samples exposed to 1 41 mg cl2 l nh2cl proteobacteria alone accounted for 96 of reads and the shannon index increased from 1 87 to 3 34 at a low dose of mca 0 42 mg cl2 l our study focused on nitrifying bacteria and archaea members of the nitrosomonas oligotropha cluster appear to be the dominant aob in full scale chloraminated dwds baribeau and regan 2013 in oxygen limited environments and at low ammonia ammonium concentration park et al 2002 n oligotropha has high affinity for oxygen and ammonia and its k m values range from 30 to 75 μm total ammonia stehr et al 1995 lee et al 2011 monitored the penetration of disinfectants and dissolved oxygen into a nitrifying biofilm in a bench scale pipe section reactor as predicted from theory their experiments showed a decrease in do concentration compared to the bulk phase in the boundary layer above the biofilm phase under these conditions survival strategies like attachment to surfaces or to other bacteria could be physiological adaptations involving high expression of oxygen metabolizing enzymes e g ammonia monooxygenase under low do conditions park and noguera 2007 the importance of aoa in drinking water engineered systems is still unclear appears to vary from site to site and depends on doc concentrations van der wielen et al 2009 a meta analysis of the microbial communities in full scale dwds found that archaeal sequences were more frequent in sampling locations without disinfectant residual free systems 89 than in chlorinated or chloraminated systems 9 5 and 19 5 respectively bautista de los santos et al 2016 similarly in this work we found that thaumarchaeota the only archaeal group that performs oxidation of ammonia to nitrite stieglmeier et al 2014 was more abundant in samples exposed to low mca concentration and absent in cluster ld moreover there was a strong positive correlation between the nitrospira sublineage ii and the phylum thaumarchaeota r 0 93 and a negative association between nitrospira and nitrosomonas r 0 61 recently complete nitrification was reported involving archaeal ammonium oxidation coupled with bacterial nitrite oxidation in a simulated drinking water premise plumbing system where aob were not found santillana et al 2016 aoa were stable over nine months in a dwds scott et al 2015 and also found to outcompete aob in granular activated carbon biofilters kasuga et al 2010 the nob are a highly diverse functional group comprising seven genera in four bacterial phyla nitrospirae nitrospinae proteobacteria and chloroflexi daims et al 2016 the initial conversion of ammonia to nitrite nitritation is considered more critical in dwds due to its role in the decrease in the disinfectant residual this is because the chloramine demand increases due to the reaction with nitrite besides nob activity actually contributes to nitrite loss and hence lowers the increased chloramine demand complete ammonia oxidization to nitrate via nitrite comammox can also be carried out by a single bacterium belonging to the genus nitrospira sublineage ii daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 first reported metagenomic evidence of commamox nitrospira like bacteria in dwds recently metagenomics analysis identified canonical nitrifiers and comammox in tap water samples from singapore and hong kong wang et al 2017 but without providing evidence of physiological activity in our study we observed samples where the ammonia oxidation activity was not fully explained by the aob and or aoa present and nob abundance surpassed that of ammonia oxidisers therefore it is possible that comammox nitrospira were present 4 1 conceptual model of nitrification in dwds biofilms under tropical conditions there is a mutualistic symbiosis between nob which depend on nitrite and aob which produce nitrite and simultaneously benefit from nitrite detoxification by nob daims et al 2016 however in this tropical dwds an inverse relationship was observed and the question beckons why nob did not coexist with aob as expected the two diversity clusters exhibit two distinct biofilm niches performing nitritation nh4 no2 in cluster ld and complete nitrification nh4 no2 no3 in cluster hd fig 5 these processes were confirmed by activity tests performed on fresh biofilm samples we hypothesize that lower diversity biofilms were present in those sections where the disinfectant concentration was higher thus more mca tolerant bacteria like nitrosomonas dominated in one scenario since aob seem to be more tolerant to monochloramine they will initially oxidise ammonia and release nitrite to the medium water next nitrite can be oxidised chemically by mca increasing its demand and from that reaction nitrate and ammonia are formed moreover nitrite is not available for nob consumption which could explain the lack of aggregation between aob and nob or absence of nob in cluster ld very low ammonium levels allow aoa to grow due to their lower substrate threshold and half saturation constant km for ammonium uptake martens habbena et al 2009 ammonia is then oxidised into nitrite which is used as substrate by nob also the activity of nob helps to reduce nitrite inhibition in aoa since in biofilms with higher biomass the mca penetration is lower and there is no reaction between mca and nitrite these reactions could also be happening in network sections with higher residual disinfectant decay such as dead ends pb10 that were classified under the hd cluster in mature drinking water biofilms aoa like thaumarchaeota may well play a key role in nitrogen cycling in dwds under tropical conditions with nitrosomonas being relegated to sites with reduced biofilm formation 5 conclusions samples fell into two distinct clusters with high cluster hd and low cluster ld microbial α diversity nitrifiers were found in all samples with potential nitritation cluster ld and complete nitrification cluster hd activities the cluster ld represents an uneven community exposed to the stressor mca and the cluster hd indicates a resilient microbial community with a functionally and structurally stable assembly resulting from decreased selective pressure lower disinfectant concentration the dwds studied did not harbour redundant functionality in terms of ammonia oxidation since ammonia oxidising bacteria and nitritation activity were observed only in cluster ld and a co aggregation of thaumarchaeota ammonia oxidizer and nitrospira nitrite oxidizer and complete nitrification occurred in cluster hd this finding requires further analysis and understanding the nitrification process in this dwds would help to improve nitrification control strategies among operational parameters pipe diameter and years of service age were pipe characteristics that positively correlated with the microbial community structure and significant differences in the microbial composition were found this is relevant when selecting efficient disinfection strategies since older pipes in the cluster hd harboured mature biofilms where k strategists thaumarchaeota and nitrospira could counteract the potential colonization of r strategists opportunistic pathogens minimising infection risks among water characteristics mca a stressor and inorganic nitrogen source also shaped biofilm formation bacterial community assembly and diversity and hence managing residual levels of mca is critical to safeguard water quality in dwds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17991,tropical conditions favour the auto decomposition of monochloramine mca leading to disinfectant decay and free ammonia in drinking water distribution systems dwds thus they promote the growth of nitrifiers and the development of biofilms on the inner pipe surface biofilms can adversely impact the provision of safe and biologically stable water moreover there is a general lack of understanding of the role of microbial communities in dwds in regions with warm temperatures and no distinct seasons here we report a survey on biofilms from full scale monochloraminated dwds in a highly urbanised metropolis using next generation sequencing tools the monitoring campaign consisted of sampling biofilms and bulk waters from 21 in service pipes we characterized the microbial community with emphasis on nitrifying bacteria and archaea using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and potential nitrification activity samples grouped into two clusters characterized by their low cluster ld and high cluster hd α diversity both clusters harbour microorganisms related to nitrification i nitrosomonas 24 9 68 8 an ammonia oxidising bacterium aob that dominated cluster ld and ii a co aggregation of genus nitrospira 9 8 32 5 a nitrite oxidising bacterium nob and thaumarchaeota 1 4 10 9 chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidising aoa archaea that were among the most abundant otus in cluster hd activity tests performed with fresh biofilm samples confirmed that these two clusters represent distinctive biofilm niches performing different stages of the nitrification process cluster ld correlated with a high concentration of mca which caused dysbiosis and resulted in high unevenness of the cluster in cluster hd with more biomass chemical reactions involving nitrite increased the mca demand releasing ammonia and allowing more nitrifiers to grow like aoa and nob from this study we conclude that an mca residual gradient along the dwds drives and shapes the microbial community assembly and should be considered when designing effective disinfection strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofilms drinking water distribution systems nitrifiers thaumarchaeota monochloramine metabarcoding 1 introduction monochloramine mca has become the agent of choice in many water treatment facilities in the world to prevent microbial growth in drinking water distribution systems dwds and to guarantee the water quality from source to tap chloramination is preferred to chlorination because a free disinfectant residual is easier to maintain and the formation of regulated disinfection by products like trihalomethanes is reduced vikesland et al 2001 moreover mca is better at penetrating and effectively disinfecting biofilms lee et al 2011 because it does not experience diffusion limitation lechevallier et al 1990 although its efficiency will depend on the composition of the extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilms xue et al 2014 conversely mca has also been shown to promote nitrification nitrification can take place within a chloraminated dwds due to the presence of ammonia baribeau and regan 2013 which is added to react with free chlorine and form the monochloramine nh2cl disinfectant residual zhang et al 2009 hence ammonia is available as energy source for ammonia oxidising bacteria aob and archaea aoa by oxidation to nitrite nitrite can react with chloramine reinforcing its decay and or be oxidised to nitrate by nitrite oxidising bacteria nob promoting the development of biofilms and affecting water quality in the pipeline network the microbial composition of biofilms developed on the inner surface of dwds pipes is poorly studied because of limited access to actual pipes sampling and analysis costs and logistical issues hence most available information about microbial communities in drinking water systems derives from studies of the water phase bautista de los santos et al 2016 el chakhtoura et al 2015 perrin et al 2019 pinto et al 2012 shaw et al 2015 biological activated carbon and rapid sand filters gülay et al 2016 kasuga et al 2010 and pipe biofilms developed in laboratory and pilot scale reactors douterelo et al 2016 wang et al 2014 the presence and role of microorganisms in full scale systems is much less understood several studies have reported the occurrence of biofilms in dwds and the major variables that affect their formation appear to be pipe material ren et al 2015 water age and water quality fish et al 2016 kooij and wielen 2014 liu et al 2016 prest et al 2016 most of the available information has been obtained from using model systems pilot or bench scale and removable coupons to simulate the development of biofilms in dwds douterelo et al 2014 2016 gomez alvarez et al 2016 henne et al 2012 mi et al 2015 revetta et al 2013 2016 wang et al 2014 and proxies such as water meters ling et al 2016 lührig et al 2015 with a short operation time however informative such systems do not necessarily reflect actual conditions in distribution pipes replicating real world distribution systems at the laboratory scale represents a considerable challenge due to differences in the surface area to volume ratio pipe material flow rate and experimental duration generally short term few in situ studies have been published using next generation sequencing ngs to characterize the microbial community of pipe biofilms gomez smith et al 2015 hwang et al 2012 kelly et al 2014 liu et al 2017 lührig et al 2015 ren et al 2015 and all of them were performed in countries with a temperate climate seasonal changes and disinfectant free or chlorinated chloraminated networks only one previous study on dwds has been performed in a tropical city namely in cali colombia montoya pachongo et al 2018 but it used chlorine instead of mca as a residual disinfectant chloramines are used as secondary disinfectant in many countries around the world including the united states australia canada singapore and european countries like spain finland sweden and great britain if employed in a tropical climate with high uniform temperature and no distinct seasons the prevailing environmental conditions may expedite the decay of monochloramine by auto decomposition producing free ammonia vikesland et al 2001 and potentially trigger nitrification more episodes of nitrification have been reported during summer or when the temperature was higher than 15 c baribeau and regan 2013 moreover no aob were detected when temperatures were lower than 18 c wolfe et al 1990 the optimal temperature for nitrification in dwds ranges from 25 to 30 c zhang et al 2009 this study surveyed biofilms from a full scale dwds in a highly urbanised tropical metropolis in south east asia using 16s rrna based metabarcoding for microbial community sequencing and multivariate statistical analysis to understand the implications for the provision of biologically stable water biofilms were collected from pipes with long term exposure to disinfectants having been in service between six and 60 years and with a range of diameters and materials the multi parametric approach involved cultivation independent molecular methods and biological activity tests to characterize the microbial communities in biofilms as well as characterization of bulk water samples collected close to the biofilm sampling point our objectives were to i understand the nitrification potential and determine the distributions of nitrifying aob aoa and nob in dwds biofilms and ii establish the relationship between nitrifying communities microbial diversity and water quality and pipe characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and water treatment characteristics the water utility relies on reservoir water which receives inputs in the form of surface water from local catchment areas imported treated water highly purified reclaimed water and desalinated water briefly the reservoir water is pumped to the waterworks and passed through self cleaning screens to remove particles greater than 1 m subsequent steps include chemical treatment filtration and disinfection coagulation and flocculation is achieved using aluminium sulphate as the main coagulant depending on need hydrated lime is also added to adjust the ph of the raw water for best flocculation results polyelectrolyte is used as a coagulant aid filtration occurs by rapid gravity filters and chlorine is applied for disinfection granular activated carbon filters remove any remaining natural organic matter and bad odour ammonia is added to the treated water containing free chlorine to form a stable monochloramine residual sodium silicofluoride is added to the water on its way from the filter to the clear water tank and the water is distributed to communities from service reservoirs in service pipe segments were obtained during replacement and or expansion works in the dwds biofilms were sampled from the interior of the water mains immediately after pipe cutting using a sterilised metal spatula and scraping at least 20 50 cm from the cut end to minimize the risk of contamination see details of sampling protocol in si annex three replicates for molecular analysis were snap frozen in a dry shipper containing liquid n2 and another three samples used for activity analysis were then placed in a cooler and preserved at 4 c after collection each sample was immediately transported for laboratory processing all frozen samples were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction concurrently immediately before cutting water samples from the nearest accessible hydrant located upstream were collected for water quality characterization following standardized methods apha 2012 table s1 a total of 21 samples were analysed from several locations across the metropolis table 1 due to the very low biomass present on the pipe walls samples for biological activity tests were not collected during five collection exercises since priority was given to the molecular analysis relevant information regarding pipe characteristics such as location pipe age pipe material and pipe diameter was assembled table 1 2 2 genomic dna gdna extraction drinking water biofilm samples have a very low amount of biomass therefore after optimization the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals was selected to extract genomic dna from the biofilm samples briefly about 0 5 g of sample biofilm scraping was placed in a lysing matrix tube immersed in cls tc buffer mp biomedicals and beat beating for 40 s at 6 m s in a fastprep 24 instrument mp biomedicals the final elution volume was reduced to 50 μl the dna concentration were determined with a qubit 2 0 fluorometer using the dsdna high sensitivity kit invitrogen california extracted and purified gdna was stored at 20 c until amplicon library preparation 2 3 16s rrna amplicon sequencing amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was performed with two amplification steps initially 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr targeting the v4 v5 hypervariable region 515f forward primer 5 id gtgycagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 926r reverse primer 5 id ccgycaattymtttragttt 3 this primer set was modified specifically to decrease bias towards archaea parada et al 2016 negative controls were also run with every batch of pcr pcr reactions were performed with 6 ng of template gdna 12 5 μl of kapa hifi hotstart readymix kapa biosystems 0 5 μm of reverse and forward primers and nuclease free water to complete 25 μl reaction volume the pcr reaction conditions were as follows 95 c for 3 min 30 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 55 c for 40 s and 72 c for 30 s and a final extension step of 72 c for 5 min the triplicate pcr products were pooled and purified using magnetic beads agencourt ampure xp pcr purification beckman coulter purified pcr products were then quality and size checked using the agilent 2200 tapestation platform pcr amplicons were subjected to a second round of pcr to implement the illumina dual barcodes after library quantification multiplexed samples were sequenced using the miseq sequencer platform illumina inc san diego ca at the singapore centre for environmental life sciences engineering scelse the miseq reagent kit v3 was used to produce pair end reads of 300 bp length and 15 phix was spiked into the library the raw reads were quality trimmed threshold q20 and adapters primers were removed using cutadapt 1 9 1 martin 2011 and paired end read merger pear 0 9 8 zhang et al 2014 was used to merge reads the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime 1 9 1 pipeline caporaso et al 2010 was followed using uchime for chimera removal and de novo operational taxonomic unit otu clustering with uclust edgar 2010 at a 3 sequence divergence threshold for grouping the silva rrna gene database quast et al 2013 was applied for taxonomy assignment reads aligned to phi x chloroplast and mitochondria were removed as well as singletons and doubletons a total of 3 949 606 high quality merged paired end sequences with an average length of 380 bp were retrieved after trimming quality filtering and merging the range of sequences per sample was 57 340 448 754 in order to compare samples at the same sequencing depth the microbial community analysis was performed with a randomised normalization to 50 000 sequences per sample very close to the lowest number of reads 57 340 obtained in sample pb14 2 4 nitrification activity test the occurrence of ammonia oxidising microorganisms aom including bacteria and archaea and nob was studied using the most probable number mpn statistical analysis after growing nitrifying bacteria in microtiter plates the activity test was performed using a slurry preparation of the biofilm samples collected at 4 c briefly 5 g of biofilm sample was placed into 100 ml of 1 sterilised surfactant and detergent solution tween 80 carefully swirled and sonicated for 10 min in a water bath sonicator elmasonic s120h to obtain a homogenized suspension the mixture was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in aom or nob growth medium as shown below the cell suspension was used to inoculate microtiter plates containing mineral media for aom with nh4 2so4 as n source and nob with nano2 as suggested by deboer et al 1995 and laanbroek and pfennig 1981 respectively after lipponen et al 2002 some modifications were made to adapt the assay to tropical conditions i the incubation temperature used was 30 c and ii the incubation period was four weeks or eight weeks when no activity was observed in the fourth week we chose this incubation time because longer periods were not representative the growth of aom was evaluated by determining the presence of nitrite or nitrate in the medium the determination was performed by adding 40 μl of 0 2 diphenylamine in h2so4 to the wells and then reading the od at 630 nm in a plate reader where blue wells were scored as positive the presence of nitrite in nob media was determined by adding 40 μl of griess illosvay reagent to the wells after 5 min the od was measured at 540 nm and a red colour in wells was scored as negative for nob activity because the presence of nitrite indicates lack of nitrate formation lipponen et al 2002 2 5 statistical and multivariate analysis of community structures and diversity to assess similarity between microbial communities we employed ordination methods and clustering analysis using primer7 v7 software clarke and gorley 2015 for this purpose the rarified otu biom table was square root transformed and then a resemblance bray curtis similarity matrix was constructed furthermore for comparison purposes a weighted unifrac distance matrix was also calculated using phyloseq in r mcmurdie and holmes 2013 tests of the multivariate null hypotheses of no differences among defined groups were examined using analysis of similarities anosim clarke 1993 with 999 permutations implemented in primer7 correlation tests were performed with r package cor test using spearman correlation coefficient since data were not normally distributed according to shapiro test and the sample size was smaller than 30 unconstrained nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination nmds was used to display similarities in microbial community structures among all samples combined with cluster and simprof analysis to study the true structure within the data phyloseq was used to calculate diversity indexes chao1 shannon and 1 λ simpson s index for evenness 3 results 3 1 survey sampling a total of 21 samples were collected from pipes during replacement across multiple locations the distance to reservoir source varied from 1 0 pb08 to 18 3 km pb18 with a median value of 10 0 km table 1 pipes sampled had diverse sizes and ages of service the range of diameters was from 100 to 700 mm with a median of 150 mm while the pipe age range was from six pb03 to 60 pb10 years of service the pipes were made of four types of material ductile iron cement lined dicl cast iron cement lined cicl asbestos cement asc and stainless steel cement lined sscl table 1 most of the samples were collected from the stretch sector of the pipelines only sample pb10 corresponded to a dead end pipeline and sample pb08 was collected closest to the source of water supply 3 2 water quality the water quality measurements during each sampling collection table 2 and table si1 complied with the 2011 world health organization guidelines the average concentration of nitrate was 0 56 0 25 mg no3 n l the highest concentration of nitrate 1 0 mg no3 n l was determined in sample pb09 which is below the guideline value set by legislation no3 as n 10 mg l the disinfectant residual concentrations varied from 1 0 to 2 0 mg l table 2 the water phase quality according to who standards of e coli and hpc within the distribution system was relatively biologically stable irrespective of sampling location and type of source water the microbial water quality in terms of e coli and total coliforms was satisfactory with counts below the limit of detection lod of 1 cfu 100 ml for the total set of samples 3 3 drinking water pipe microbiome 3 3 1 α diversity measures the microbial community structure for 20 biofilm samples was determined by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing one sample pb19 did not yield enough pcr product for sequencing the rarefaction curves from normalized profiles of the 20 samples denoted that the depth and sequencing coverage was sufficient for the diversity encountered in the biofilm community from the drinking water pipes fig s2 most of the otus 600 were present in at least two or three samples figure s3a while only eight otus with an abundance greater than 0 1 were present in all 20 samples analysed figure s3b the richness was determined by calculating the number of otus observed and the chao 1 index there was a high variability in the number of species present in samples ranging from 392 pb12 to 1529 otus pb13 table 3 the inverse simpson diversity index 1 λ is more sensitive to changes in abundances of common otus therefore sample pb18 showed the highest α diversity followed by samples pb01 and pb10 the 1 λ diversity index varied from 2 2 to 55 5 indicating the presence of dominant otus in pb05 and pb12 lower values compared to samples with more microbial community evenness such as pb18 and pb01 higher values table 3 3 3 2 microbial community composition in pipe biofilms biofilms in pipes were diverse with an average of 20 phyla per sample at a relative abundance 0 1 taxonomic classification revealed that three phyla dominated the community and accounted for 84 6 of the total 63 9 17 3 of otus were associated with the phylum proteobacteria followed by actinobacteria 11 3 12 3 and nitrospira 9 4 10 2 in the full set of samples studied fig 1 there was high variability in composition across samples at the phylum level the most abundant phylum proteobacteria varied from 35 pb17 to 90 in samples pb06 and pb11 the abundance of the domain archaea was very low for the whole set of samples 2 however its abundance fluctuated within a range of 0 0 10 8 pb21 and it showed a strong positive association with the phylum nitrospira ρ 0 93 p 0 01 the classes within the phylum proteobacteria fluctuated in an inverse fashion fig 1 the two most abundant classes were alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria with an inverse association ρ 0 80 p 0 05 in each sample interestingly the phylum nitrospira showed a positive correlation with class alphaproteobacteria ρ 0 80 p 0 01 and a negative one with class betaproteobacteria ρ 0 90 p 0 01 3 3 3 community structure low and high diversity clusters both the unifrac weighted distance metric and the bray curtis pairwise comparison of the similarity of individual communities at the otu level revealed a very distinct community structure among samples when illustrated as ordination plots fig s5 ordination analysis of the microbial community by means of a hierarchical cluster plot showed that the majority of the samples grouped into two clusters fig 1 the simprof analysis examined three pairs of samples in each cluster where observed similarity non significant difference is larger than expected by chance red branches fig 1 this suggests the presence of a true structure within the data sample pb 17 is an outlier and is not part of any of the two clusters found statistically significant differences in α diversity indexes 1 λ p 0 0005 and shannon p 0 0002 were found between these two groups based on this finding the two clusters shown in fig 1 are distinguished as having i a low α diversity upper branches henceforth termed low diversity ld cluster and ii a high α diversity bottom branches termed high diversity hd cluster at the genus level cluster ld was dominated by nitrosomonas with the greatest proportion of sequences ranging from 24 9 to 68 8 meanwhile in cluster hd the genera nitrospira 9 8 32 5 parvularcula 2 4 15 2 phylum thaumarchaeota 1 4 10 9 bradyrizhobium 0 5 11 5 and family rhodospirillacea 0 6 12 4 were the most abundant otus the genus nitrospira was dominated by the co occurrence of two species otus from sublineage ii sample pb17 is an outlier characterized by the high abundance of three uncultured genera belonging to the families nitrospiraceae 16 2 rhodocyclaceae 15 7 and order ignavibacteriales 14 5 3 3 4 microbial community drivers the most important taxa related to nitrification and responsible for the significant differences observed between the microbial community structures in the two clusters were selected by simper analysis table 4 the average of the bray curtis dissimilarities between all pairs of sites from ld and hd clusters was 69 9 represented as the sum of the avdiss in the table the contribution of nitrosomonas to the total 69 9 was 12 30 nitrospira sublinage ii accounted for 7 86 and thaumarchaeota for 4 40 all named lineages together amounting to 25 of the total difference nitrospira and thaumarchaeota showed the highest diss sd ratio 2 75 and 2 13 respectively and were the most important discriminating species 3 3 5 influence of water quality on microbial community assemblages monochloramine resistant organisms distlm dbrda analysis was used to further assess if water quality drives the microbial community structure table s2 monochloramine concentration emerged as one of the best predictors among water quality parameters to explain the variability in total microbial community assemblage in the dwds fig 2 and table s2 cluster ld correlated with a high concentration of monochloramine 1 7 0 2 mg l p 0 0175 the disinfectant stress selected for the most resistant and tolerant microorganisms thereby causing the high unevenness of this cluster which was dominated by nitrosomonas moreover the cluster ld also harboured high relative abundances of other reported monochloramine resistant organisms such as hyphomicrobium 0 1 37 6 methylobacterium 0 2 15 8 and sphingomonas 0 2 8 3 on the other hand the biplot also revealed that total phosphorous tp nitrate and total trihalomethanes tthms correlated with cluster hd and there was an inverse association with ph fig 2 high nitrate concentrations and lower ph are consequences of nitrification taking place the concentration of aoc in cluster ld was 53 6 13 8 as ppb acetate c and in cluster hd it was 58 0 26 2 as ppb acetate c the toc was 1 12 0 22 mg l and 1 10 0 24 mg l for hd and ld respectively means were not statistically different for this type of water with a high concentration of organic carbon phosphorous is considered the limiting substrate within dwds with high levels of aoc and when present is positively correlated with biofilm growth lehtola et al 2002 this was supported by the higher amount of biomass extracted from samples of cluster hd x 15 9 ng μl compared to cluster ld x 0 25 ng μl fig s6 the high concentrations of tthms suggested a reaction of chloramine with the organic matter of the eps matrix all these factors demonstrate that nitrification is the prevalent process occurring in cluster hd which also explains its higher diversity and the risk of the onset of a biocorrosion process due to lower ph level monochloramine correlated negatively with nitrite r 0 599 p 0 001 nitrite increased the monochloramine demand releasing ammonia and allowing other bacteria and or archaea to grow like aoa and nob other heterotrophic nitrate reducers such as bradyrizobium and parvularcula were also able to survive likely thanks to the soluble microbial products synthesized by organisms present in cluster hd 3 4 microbial community assemblages and relationship with pipe characteristics to compare similarities between groups the statistical test anosim was used to assess the relationship between pipe characteristics and the microbial community assembly table 5 pipe material and years of service are two related characteristics because since the 1980s most of the pipes installed are made of dicl thirty five years of pipe service was chosen as cut off for the age groups statistically significant differences between the two age groups were found samples related to cluster ld came from the younger pipes 35 years meanwhile samples from cluster hd were all older than 40 years with the exception of sample pb03 which was the youngest at six years of service the test also determined significant differences between the pipe diameters 100 and 300 mm r 0 786 p 0 028 samples from cluster hd had a smaller diameter small pipe diameters mean large surface areas for biofilm formation or in other words larger surface area to volume ratios than in the bigger pipes regardless of material all the pipes were cement lined meaning the surface where biofilm adhesion and growth happened was cement in all cases we surmise that only the surface material the cement lining could have reacted with the disinfectant or be subjected to microbial colonization furthermore statistical analysis anosim with pipe material as factor showed differences were barely significant between dicl and cicl p value 0 044 and not at all for the other materials table s3 3 5 nitrifier niches in biofilms 3 5 1 nitrifying microbial community the characterization of the dw pipe biofilms by high throughput 16s rrna targeted sequencing revealed that bacterial and archaeal taxa associated with nitrification comprised 34 52 of the total microbial community fig 3 the two clusters harboured microorganisms related to nitrification table s4 evidence that n related processes occur in the studied drinking water networks biofilms among aob taxa nitrosomonas arose in all samples of cluster ld from 0 08 pb08 to 68 85 pb05 in cluster hd nitrosococcus was present in samples pb03 4 46 and pb21 0 54 and nitrosospira in six out of eight samples with an average of 0 06 the aoa 16s rrna gene sequences were classified as a single taxon associated to a thaumarchaeotal lineage within cluster marine group i and were present in all samples from cluster hd ranging from 1 44 to 10 98 in sample pb21 in cluster ld aoa were present at very low abundance in samples pb08 0 34 pb02 0 19 and pb13 0 10 among the nob nitrospira were more abundant in cluster hd comprising 8 71 pb18 to 32 50 pb21 compared to cluster ld where pb02 had the highest proportion 6 52 leptospirillum showed low abundance 0 01 in six out of 20 samples one otu assigned as uncultured genus of family nitrospiraceae represented 18 78 and 4 12 of relative abundance in samples pb17 and pb08 respectively most of the nitrifier genera detected are chemolithoautotrophic slow growing and have high energy costs to fix inorganic carbon for growth all known members of phylum thaumarchaeota are chemolithotrophic aoa 3 5 2 potential nitrification activity tests ammonia oxidation aom activity occurred in 15 samples tested fig 4 and was above 103 mpn g meanwhile nitrite oxidation took place mostly in samples from cluster hd 102 mpn g and it was completely absent in samples from cluster ld an exception was sample pb16 with very low cell concentrations 10 mpn g after eight weeks of incubation 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and nitrification activity tests showed good agreement fig 4b most of the ld samples containing only aom showed only ammonia oxidation activity nitritation meanwhile samples with aob aoa and nob sequences from cluster hd exhibited complete nitrification using the potential activity mpn assay sample pb03 had the highest abundance of nitrospira 29 and also the highest nob activity 105 mpn g thus the correlation between nitrite oxidation activity and the relative abundance of nob was confirmed spearman s ρ 0 78 p value 9 43 10 4 16s rrna amplicon sequencing of samples pb17 revealed very low abundance almost nil of known aoa aob and high relative abundance of nob however high ammonia oxidising potential activity was observed similarly samples pb01 pb07 and pb10 showed low abundance of aoa 5 but high ammonia oxidation activity 4 discussion the microbial communities identified in this study were similar to those found in other biofilms or bulk water from dwds with proteobacteria as the dominant phylum suggesting it is well suited to surviving under potable water conditions liu et al 2016 our results also showed a high correlation of α diversity with mca dose similarly mi et al 2015 found that mca stimulated the dominance of proteobacteria decreasing microbial diversity in chloraminated drinking water biofilm from pilot scale reactors in samples exposed to 1 41 mg cl2 l nh2cl proteobacteria alone accounted for 96 of reads and the shannon index increased from 1 87 to 3 34 at a low dose of mca 0 42 mg cl2 l our study focused on nitrifying bacteria and archaea members of the nitrosomonas oligotropha cluster appear to be the dominant aob in full scale chloraminated dwds baribeau and regan 2013 in oxygen limited environments and at low ammonia ammonium concentration park et al 2002 n oligotropha has high affinity for oxygen and ammonia and its k m values range from 30 to 75 μm total ammonia stehr et al 1995 lee et al 2011 monitored the penetration of disinfectants and dissolved oxygen into a nitrifying biofilm in a bench scale pipe section reactor as predicted from theory their experiments showed a decrease in do concentration compared to the bulk phase in the boundary layer above the biofilm phase under these conditions survival strategies like attachment to surfaces or to other bacteria could be physiological adaptations involving high expression of oxygen metabolizing enzymes e g ammonia monooxygenase under low do conditions park and noguera 2007 the importance of aoa in drinking water engineered systems is still unclear appears to vary from site to site and depends on doc concentrations van der wielen et al 2009 a meta analysis of the microbial communities in full scale dwds found that archaeal sequences were more frequent in sampling locations without disinfectant residual free systems 89 than in chlorinated or chloraminated systems 9 5 and 19 5 respectively bautista de los santos et al 2016 similarly in this work we found that thaumarchaeota the only archaeal group that performs oxidation of ammonia to nitrite stieglmeier et al 2014 was more abundant in samples exposed to low mca concentration and absent in cluster ld moreover there was a strong positive correlation between the nitrospira sublineage ii and the phylum thaumarchaeota r 0 93 and a negative association between nitrospira and nitrosomonas r 0 61 recently complete nitrification was reported involving archaeal ammonium oxidation coupled with bacterial nitrite oxidation in a simulated drinking water premise plumbing system where aob were not found santillana et al 2016 aoa were stable over nine months in a dwds scott et al 2015 and also found to outcompete aob in granular activated carbon biofilters kasuga et al 2010 the nob are a highly diverse functional group comprising seven genera in four bacterial phyla nitrospirae nitrospinae proteobacteria and chloroflexi daims et al 2016 the initial conversion of ammonia to nitrite nitritation is considered more critical in dwds due to its role in the decrease in the disinfectant residual this is because the chloramine demand increases due to the reaction with nitrite besides nob activity actually contributes to nitrite loss and hence lowers the increased chloramine demand complete ammonia oxidization to nitrate via nitrite comammox can also be carried out by a single bacterium belonging to the genus nitrospira sublineage ii daims et al 2015 pinto et al 2016 first reported metagenomic evidence of commamox nitrospira like bacteria in dwds recently metagenomics analysis identified canonical nitrifiers and comammox in tap water samples from singapore and hong kong wang et al 2017 but without providing evidence of physiological activity in our study we observed samples where the ammonia oxidation activity was not fully explained by the aob and or aoa present and nob abundance surpassed that of ammonia oxidisers therefore it is possible that comammox nitrospira were present 4 1 conceptual model of nitrification in dwds biofilms under tropical conditions there is a mutualistic symbiosis between nob which depend on nitrite and aob which produce nitrite and simultaneously benefit from nitrite detoxification by nob daims et al 2016 however in this tropical dwds an inverse relationship was observed and the question beckons why nob did not coexist with aob as expected the two diversity clusters exhibit two distinct biofilm niches performing nitritation nh4 no2 in cluster ld and complete nitrification nh4 no2 no3 in cluster hd fig 5 these processes were confirmed by activity tests performed on fresh biofilm samples we hypothesize that lower diversity biofilms were present in those sections where the disinfectant concentration was higher thus more mca tolerant bacteria like nitrosomonas dominated in one scenario since aob seem to be more tolerant to monochloramine they will initially oxidise ammonia and release nitrite to the medium water next nitrite can be oxidised chemically by mca increasing its demand and from that reaction nitrate and ammonia are formed moreover nitrite is not available for nob consumption which could explain the lack of aggregation between aob and nob or absence of nob in cluster ld very low ammonium levels allow aoa to grow due to their lower substrate threshold and half saturation constant km for ammonium uptake martens habbena et al 2009 ammonia is then oxidised into nitrite which is used as substrate by nob also the activity of nob helps to reduce nitrite inhibition in aoa since in biofilms with higher biomass the mca penetration is lower and there is no reaction between mca and nitrite these reactions could also be happening in network sections with higher residual disinfectant decay such as dead ends pb10 that were classified under the hd cluster in mature drinking water biofilms aoa like thaumarchaeota may well play a key role in nitrogen cycling in dwds under tropical conditions with nitrosomonas being relegated to sites with reduced biofilm formation 5 conclusions samples fell into two distinct clusters with high cluster hd and low cluster ld microbial α diversity nitrifiers were found in all samples with potential nitritation cluster ld and complete nitrification cluster hd activities the cluster ld represents an uneven community exposed to the stressor mca and the cluster hd indicates a resilient microbial community with a functionally and structurally stable assembly resulting from decreased selective pressure lower disinfectant concentration the dwds studied did not harbour redundant functionality in terms of ammonia oxidation since ammonia oxidising bacteria and nitritation activity were observed only in cluster ld and a co aggregation of thaumarchaeota ammonia oxidizer and nitrospira nitrite oxidizer and complete nitrification occurred in cluster hd this finding requires further analysis and understanding the nitrification process in this dwds would help to improve nitrification control strategies among operational parameters pipe diameter and years of service age were pipe characteristics that positively correlated with the microbial community structure and significant differences in the microbial composition were found this is relevant when selecting efficient disinfection strategies since older pipes in the cluster hd harboured mature biofilms where k strategists thaumarchaeota and nitrospira could counteract the potential colonization of r strategists opportunistic pathogens minimising infection risks among water characteristics mca a stressor and inorganic nitrogen source also shaped biofilm formation bacterial community assembly and diversity and hence managing residual levels of mca is critical to safeguard water quality in dwds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17992,in anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr treating organic solid waste acetate is one of the most important precursors to ch4 however the identity and diversity of anaerobic acetate degraders are largely unknown possibly due to their slow growth rates and low abundances here we identified acetate degrading microorganisms in the anmbr sludges by high sensitivity stable isotope probing degradation of the amended 13c acetate coincided with production of 13ch4 and 13co2 during the sludge incubation high throughput sequencing of rna density fractions indicated that the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e methanosaeta sp acetate dissimilator and methanolinea sp acetate assimilator incorporated 13c acetate significantly remarkably 22 bacterial species incorporating 13c acetate were identified whereas their majority was distantly related to the cultured representatives only two of them were the class deltaproteobacteria affiliated lineages with syntrophic volatile fatty acid oxidation activities phylogenetic tree analysis and population dynamics tracing revealed that novel species of the hydrolyzing and or fermenting taxa such as the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and lentisphaerae exhibited low relative abundances comparable to that of methanolinea sp 0 00011 during the anmbr operation suggesting that these bacteria were involved in anaerobic acetate assimilation meanwhile novel species of the phyla firmicutes synergistetes and caldiserica the candidate phyla aminicenantes and atribacteria and the candidate division gouta4 related clade as well as the known deltaproteobacteria members existed at relatively high abundances 0 00031 0 31121 in the reactor suggesting that these bacterial species participated in anaerobic dissimilation of

solid waste graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic acetate degradation high sensitivity stable isotope probing anaerobic membrane bioreactor organic solid waste 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr a combined system of the anaerobic digestion and membrane separation technologies has been developed for the treatment of wastewater and organic solid waste it has many advantages that include the low energy consumption small footprint high effluent quality and production of renewable energy i e methane ch4 a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the anmbr systems for treating various kinds of wastewaters dereli et al 2012 jensen et al 2015 shoener et al 2016 yu et al 2016 however apart from the applicability to the wastewater treatment findings on anmbrs treating organic solid wastes have been limited because of the difficulty in the highly concentrated solid separation from liquid and the degradation of recalcitrant substances including proteins and fats that are converted to the methanogenesis inhibiting ammonia and fatty acids chen et al 2008 cuetos et al 2008 we have recently reported the successful start up and long term stable operation of an anmbr system to effectively treat a model slurry of the high strength organic solid waste inaba et al 2020 this study has provided information on the microbial community dynamics during the stabilization and deterioration of the anmbr performances yet the identity of the sludge microorganisms involved in the efficient organics decomposition has not been clarified anaerobic digestion processes in anmbr are comprised mainly of three metabolic steps hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis speece 1983 hori et al 2007 the methanogenic conversion of organic compounds is catalyzed by anaerobic microbial consortia including the hydrolyzing and fermentative microbes alcohol and volatile fatty acid vfa oxidizing syntrophs and methanogens acetate is the major but energetically unfavorable metabolic intermediate in the methanogenic processes schink 1997 hattori 2008 the growth rates and abundances of the anaerobic acetate degrading microorganisms

dissimilator ferry 2010 in addition it has been reported that several bacterial lineages can oxidize i e dissimilate acetate syntrophically with hydrogenotrophic methanogens balk et al 2002 hattori 2008 westerholm et al 2010 hori et al 2011 however the diversity of the anaerobic acetate degraders is still largely unknown possibly due to their slow growth rates and low abundances anmbrs can prevent the washout of the slow and non growers pack the dense microbial communities and stimulate the juxtaposition based interspecies hydrogen and or electron transfer vital for syntrophic acetate oxidation stable isotope probing of rrna rrna sip is a powerful technique for directly linking the identity and function of hitherto uncultured microorganisms manefield et al 2002 hori et al 2007 2010 although sip has been so far applied to characterize the acetate metabolizing microbial communities in anaerobic digesters hao et al 2015 ito et al 2011 the slow incorporation of 13c acetate into nucleic acids may have rendered the anaerobic acetate degraders inaccessible we have improved the detection sensitivity of rrna sip by high throughput sequencing of isopycnic centrifugation gradients aoyagi et al 2015a and implemented this method to identify the elusive contaminant degraders in a wastewater treatment system aoyagi et al 2018 detecting a small amount of heavily 13c enriched rrnas allows access to the ecophysiology of the slowly growing microorganisms such as anaerobic acetate degraders in anmbrs to facilitate the efficient degradation of organic solid wastes in anmbrs understanding ecophysiological features of the sludge microorganisms in charge of catalyzing the rate limiting step i e anaerobic acetate degradation is vital there are a wide diversity of yet to be characterized microorganisms in the methanogenic sludge juottonen et al 2005 nelson et al 2011 rinke et al 2013 which suggests the presence of the phylogenetically novel acetate degraders the aim of this study was to identify actively acetate degrading microorganisms in the anmbr system treating a model slurry of high strength organic solid waste by high sensitivity stable isotope probing of rrna in addition we investigated high resolution population dynamics of the identified 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms in the actual anmbr run to tackle their ecophysiological characteristics under changing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic incubation of anmbr sludge with 13c labeled acetate a sludge was collected from the 293 day operation of a lab scale mesophilic

unlabeled treatments and the statistical significance of their difference was calculated using the student s t test the otus exhibiting the higher abundances in heavy fractions of the 13c treatments than those of the unlabeled treatments were analyzed with the blast program in the ncbi nucleotide sequence database http www ncbi nlm nih gov furthermore phylogenetic trees of the 16s rrna transcript sequences from the significantly 13c incorporating otus and nearly full length reference sequences were constructed using an arb software package http www arb home de ludwig et al 2004 as described previously hori et al 2010 narihiro et al 2018 briefly phylogenetic core trees were constructed from the reference 16s rrna gene sequences 1000 nucleotides using neighbor joining maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood algorithms these different algorithms did not have a significant effect on the tree topology 16s rrna transcript sequences approximately 250 bp of the 13c enriched otus were aligned against the silva v123 databases using sina 1 2 11 pruesse et al 2012 and added to the core trees using the arb parsimony tool all of the 16s rrna transcript and gene raw sequences obtained from high

relative abundance data of the identified otus were extracted from the sequence libraries to trace their population dynamics 3 results 3 1 biochemical activities of anmbr sludge microorganisms amended with 13c acetate in the liquid phases of the 13c and unlabeled treatments concentrations of acetate were initially 0 850 0 927 mmol l 1 fig 1 a and were undetectable 0 005 mmol l 1 at days 1 and 2 despite its periodic addition the formate concentrations decreased to 0 18 0 75 mmol l 1 at day 1 then increased to 1 46 1 21 mmol l 1 at day 2 fig s1a other vfas i e lactate butyrate and propionate were not detected during the 2 day incubation i e 0 01 mmol l 1 data not shown acetate was accumulated at concentrations of around 2 368 mmol l 1 at day 2 in the autoclaved control indicating that acetate was degraded by metabolic activities of the sludge microorganisms in the gaseous phases of the 13c and unlabeled treatments the initial concentrations of ch4 and co2 were 2 563 2 998 mmol l 1 and 21 346 24 191 mmol l 1 respectively fig 1b and c ch4 and co2 were produced from the beginning of the incubation concentrations of ch4 and co2 increased by 33 755 34 076 mmol l 1 and 13 605 14 202 mmol l 1 respectively until day 2 the increases in ch4 and co2 in the no acetate addition treatment were 28 693 mmol l 1 and 12 572 mmol l 1 respectively which were less than those in the 13c and unlabeled treatments suggesting that the organic matter originally containing in the sludge was degraded to ch4 and co2 h2 was not detectable 0 01 mmol l 1 in both of the 13c and unlabeled treatments data not shown the fate of the 13c acetate degraded was traced by the 13c atom percentages of the gaseous products ch4 and co2 over the incubation time fig 1d and e in the 13c treatment 13ch4 and 13co2 were produced immediately after the start of the incubation and increased to 2 527 and 1 024 mmol l 1 respectively at day 2 in the unlabeled and no acetate addition treatments these remained constant at low levels i e 13ch4 0 385 mmol l 1 13co2 0 421 mmol l 1 aside from these liquid and gaseous parameters concentrations of the toc and cod in the 13c unlabeled and no acetate addition treatments slightly decreased form 182 190 and 827 893 mg l 1 at day 0 to 149 159 and 628 707 mg l 1 at day 2 respectively figs s1b and s1c ic kept at constant levels of 210 249 mg l 1 during the incubation fig s1d the ammonium concentrations slightly increased from 23 to 26 mmol l 1 at day 0 to 31 39 mmol l 1 at day 2 fig s1e which were not at the methanogenesis inhibiting levels the ph value kept at stable values of 6 7 7 1 during the incubation concentrations of the nitrate and sulfate were under the detection limits i e 0 01 mmol l 1 during the incubation data not shown 3 2 high sensitivity identification of the 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms from heavy fractions of rrna to recover and characterize 13c labeled microbial rrnas the sludge samples incubated for 2 days in the 13c and unlabeled treatments were subjected in triplicate to a series of molecular experiments of high sensitivity sip i e rna extraction isopycnic centrifugation fractionation density determination 16s rrna based rt pcr and high throughput illumina sequencing the heaviest 1h second heaviest 2h third heaviest 3h and light l fractions of rnas from both the treatments table s2 were phylogenetically characterized total number of 16s rrna transcript sequences obtained from the 24 density fractions was around 8 9 hundred thousand corresponding to an average of 37 141 sequences per library in the density gradients of rna 45 57 of the bacterial 16s rrna sequences were not classified even at the phylum and class level fig 2 a suggesting that there are still many hitherto unknown bacterial taxa that are metabolically active in the anmbr sludge the phylum and class level phylogenetic analyses indicated no significant differences between both the treatments based on the tukey kramer test result nevertheless implementing the high resolution operational taxonomic unit otu level survey of heavy fractions of the 13c treatment a total of 24 microbial otus were identified as exhibiting 1 3 fold increases in relative abundances with the statistical significances p 0 05 and significance trend levels p 0 1 compared with those of the unlabeled treatment fig 2b c and 2d as to the euryarchaeota species the relative abundances of the otus 3409 and 3553 were 0 118 and 0 144 of the 13c treatment 2 0 and 1 6 fold higher than those of the unlabeled treatment respectively the otu 3409 was closely related to the well known aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta concillii accession no kx261417 96 9 sequence identity justo et al 2016 the otu 3553 was the h2 co2 and formate utilizing methanogen methanolinea tarda nr028163 97 6 that meanwhile requires a slight amount of acetate for own growth via assimilative metabolism imachi et al 2008 remarkably in the domain bacteria

firmicutes the otus 4258 3969 5762 and 5257 exhibiting the 2 6 2 4 2 5 and 1 6 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment than those in the unlabeled treatment fig 2b and d had low sequence identities to the cultured moorella humiferrea nr108634 86 9 salinithrix halophila nr134171 85 9 alkalibacter saccharofermentans nr042834 87 0 and clostridium sporogene mf623797 91 7 the former three otus formed a cluster together with uncultured bacteria while the latter was located separately in the phylogenetic tree fig 3a in the class deltaproteobacteria the relative abundances of otus 3993 and 4863 were 2 2 and 1 8 fold higher in the 13c treatment fig 2c the otus 3993 and 4863 were assigned into desulfovirga adipica nr036764 95 7 and syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans nr041306 100 respectively whilst the otu 3993 was related rather closely to syntrophobacter wolinii x70905 in the phylogenic tree fig 3 a the recent rrna sip study indicated the involvement of the family syntrophobacteraceae in acetate degradation coupled with sulfate reduction in paddy soil liu et al 2018 the phylum bacteroidetes otus 4980 2322 and 1719 showed the 6 3 2 1 and 1 8 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2b and c and were somewhat related to lentimicrobium saccharophilum nr149795 92 9 alkaliflexus imshenetskii nr117198 92 9 and saccharicrinis fermentans mg264242 89 8 respectively the otu 2592 was 4 1 fold higher in the abundance in the 13c treatment fig 2c its closest relative was the phylum chloroflexi species leptolinea tardivitalis nr040971 89 3 as implied by the blast search and yet the phylogenetic tree analysis clearly indicated this otu was affiliated in the bacteroidetes and formed the wchb1 69 cluster with the otu 4980 and uncultured bacteria e g

and d the otu 4085 was related to some extent to the anaerobic victivallis vadensis nr118352 91 3 while the otu 4685 belonged to aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus nr113331 98 4 the otu 5866 had a rather low 16s rrna sequence identity i e 74 7 to caldisericum exile ap012051 that was nonetheless the closest relative in the phylogenetic tree other than the known anaerobic microorganisms in the phylum

actinobacterial cluster fig 3b while the otu 4575 was related to obligately aerobic haematospirillum jordaniae nr145528 92 5 apart from the known phylum and class with the cultured representatives the otus in the candidate phylum proposed only with the genomic sequences were successfully identified as significantly 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms the otus 5500 3444 and 2173 exhibited 5 2 4 0 and 1 4 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2b and c and had quite low sequence identities to the cultured thermodesulfobium narugense nr074466 83 3 carboxydothermus ferrireducens lt547827 85 0 desulfofundulus kuznetsovii nr115129 82 1 in the phylogenetic tree the otu 5500 was located in the neighbor branch of the candidate division gouta4 fig 3a the otu 3444 was phylogenetically assigned in the candidate phylum atribacteria lineage i e formerly called op9 fig 3a the otu 2173 was the member of the candidate phylum aminicenantes i e formerly called op8 fig 3c 3 3 presence and dynamics of the identified acetate degraders in the anmbr systems with the sip results providing the identities of acetate degraders in the anmbr sludges their presence and dynamics were evaluated by high throughput illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes sequencing of the genes from the anmbr sludge at day 0 of the sip incubation produced 6 libraries with a total of 2 2 hundred thousand sequences corresponding to an average of 36 845 sequences per library table s3 as a result of extracting the data of the 24 13c incorporating otus from the sequence libraries the relative abundances of the acetate degrader otus ranged from 0 002 to 4 539 fig 2b c and 2d furthermore the dynamics of the identified otus were traced in the actual run for approximately 260 days of another anmbr system inaba et al 2020 the averaged relative abundance data of the identified otus at 30 time points of the operation were retrieved from the duplicate sequence libraries i e a total of 60 libraries in which an average of 123 266 sequences per library were included inaba et al 2020 consequently it was possible to detect and monitor 19 of the 24 otus during the operation period fig 4 these 19 otus continued to exist in the reactor at the averaged relative abundances of 0 00006 5 36341 fig 4 and table s4 indicating their general involvement in acetate degradation in the anmbr on the other hand the other 5 otus 5189 3969 3409 2592 and 4085 were undetectable i e existed below the detection limits 0 00003 of the total throughout the operation suggesting that these 5 otus were not the universal members that participated in acetate degradation in the anmbr system fig 4 and table s4 4 discussion we herein investigated the identity and diversity of the sludge microorganisms involved in the degradation of acetate one of the most important precursors to ch4 during anaerobic decomposition of the model organic solid waste slurry in the anmbr systems repeatedly dosing an environmentally relevant concentration 1 mm per day 2 mm in total table s1 of 13c acetate and employing a short incubation time 2 days allowed the sludge microorganisms to incorporate 13c acetate under quasi natural conditions thereby minimizing the negative effect of cross feeding gc c irms in parallel with chemical analyses provided the information about the fate of 13c acetate during the sip incubation based on the phylogenetic tree constructed we revealed that the acetate degrading bacteria were taxonomically diverse and formed phylogenetic clusters with uncultured bacteria of the phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi lentisphaerae synergistetes caldiserica and the class deltaproteobacteria and the candidate phyla atribacteria and aminicenantes and the candidate division gouta4 related clade furthermore the population abundance and dynamics data in addition to the phylogenetic positions of the identified acetate degraders in the actual anmbr run suggested their ecophysiological features i e which assimilative or dissimilative acetate metabolism they employed under changing conditions for the sip experiment the methyl and carboxyl groups of acetate were labeled with 13c and the fully 13c labeled acetate i e acetate 13c2 was used as substrate during the sip incubation 1 854 mmol l 1 2 0 927 mmol l 1 of the supplemented 13c acetate was degraded until day 2 fig 1a thus the total concentration of 13c from the acetate added was 3 709 mmol l 1 the concentrations of gaseous products 13ch4 and 13co2 were 2 199 and 0 651 mmol l 1 respectively fig 1d and e dissolved 13co2 components as bicarbonate were calculated to be 0 542 mmol l 1 using the gaseous 13co2 and liquid ic concentrations fig s1d in ph 6 8 at 35 c of the sludge water the carbon recovery in the 13c treatment was 91 48 the remainder of the carbon was possibly incorporated by the sludge microorganisms whose rrna was then 13c labeled technically without the assimilation it is not possible to detect the 13c labeling in any microorganisms the 13c labeling of aceticlastic methanogens would indicate the operation of the dissimilatory aceticlastic cleavage pathway another dissimilatory pathway of acetate in the anmbr is anaerobic acetate oxidation for both the methanogens and acetate oxidizers it is very likely that the dissimilation and assimilation processes occur almost concurrently in a same population meanwhile the direct assimilation of acetate via the formation of acetyl coa into biomass of methanogens cannot be ruled out it is also noted that some of bacterial species would be involved in the direct acetate assimilation the retrieved buoyant densities bds of the heavy rna fractions i e 1h 2h and 3h fractions corresponded to those of the 13c labeled rrna accumulated fractions in our previous study table s2 aoyagi et al 2015a high throughput sequencing of the heavy fractions indicated that 24 microbial otus incorporated the 13c acetate fig 2b d significantly p 0 05 or at significance trend levels p 0 1 among them the otu 3969 was found to be heavily enriched with 13c by the independent assays of both the 1h and 3h fractions and the 13c incorporating otu 3409 was closely related to the well known aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta concillii fig 2b affirming the validity of our criteria of high sensitivity sip in this context it is noted that methanosaeta spp have been known to operate the direct interspecies electron transfer with the bacterial species such as geobacter spp rotaru et al 2014 which is not evident in the anmbr and thus warrants the future study under methanogenic conditions acetate can be utilized via both of dissimilatory and assimilatory metabolisms hattori 2008 the heavily 13c enriched archaeal otu 3553 was identified as the well known hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanolinea tarda sequence identity 97 6 fig 2c that requires acetate for its growth through assimilative metabolism imachi et al 2008 although the otu 3553 may have catalyzed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coupled with syntrophic acetate oxidation this methanogen was most likely labeled by 13c acetate assimilation rather than the reduction of 13co2 a product of acetate oxidation due to the high co2 bicarbonate pool in the anmbr sludge and the short incubation time with small dosages of 13c acetate this otu served as a reference of the anaerobic acetate assimilator comparative analyses of the abundance levels and dynamics of this otu would be useful for determining the other possible acetate assimilators in the anmbr system the population dynamics tracing in the actual anmbr system indicated that the averaged relative abundance of this otu was 0 00011 fig 4 and table s4 strongly suggesting that rather low abundances were tightly associated with the anaerobic acetate assimilation on the other hand the known syntrophic bacteria related otus 3993 and 4863 potentially involved in the anaerobic acetate dissimilation exhibited relatively high averaged relative abundances of 0 00031 0 00189 during the operation it is intriguing to point out the fact that the abundance levels in addition to the phylogenetic positions of the identified acetate degraders would be an indicator for specifying the mode of anaerobic acetate metabolism i e assimilation or dissimilation in the anmbr by means of high sensitivity sip 22 bacterial otus were identified as the active acetate degraders most of which had considerably low sequence identities to the closest cultured relatives fig 2b d and fig 3 as compared with the averaged relative abundance of the acetate assimilator otu 3553 methanolinea sp in the anmbr operation those of the otus 2322 1719 and 3002 were not significantly high table s4 fig 4d implying that these otus exhibited the comparable abundance levels of the otu 3553 in addition the bacterial otus 5189 3969 2592 and 4085 were undetectable indicating their relative abundances were below the detection limit during the operation based on the results from phylogenetic tree analyses fig 3 these low abundance members were affiliated mainly within the phyla bacteroidetes otus 2592 2322 and 1719 and chloroflexi otus 5189 and 3002 the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are the most commonly found phyla as including the hydrolyzers and acidogens in anaerobic digesters nelson et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it has been also reported that certain members of the chloroflexi actively assimilated acetate in anaerobic environments lee et al 2014 in addition the lentisphaerae otu 4085 was related to the anaerobically sugar utilizing victivallis vadensis zoetendal et al 2003 suggesting the fermentative metabolism of this otu taken together in parallel with the hydrolysis and or fermentative metabolisms the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and lentisphaerae otus could assimilate acetate anaerobically in the anmbr on the other hand the other 15 otus i e 3993 4863 4258 5762 5257 3444 2173 4685 5500 5866 4980 311 3004 2371 and 4575 displayed high relative abundances with statistical significances p 0 05 and significance trend levels p 0 1 compared to that of the acetate assimilator otu 3553 during the anmbr operation fig 4a c and table s4 among them the otus 4980 and 311 were assigned to the phyla bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig 3a and b with the acetate assimilators predicted above the alphaproteobacterial otu 4575 and the actinobacterial otus 2371 and 3004 were putatively aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms respectively as is common with these phyla affiliated members in the anmbr sludge slight amount of oxygen could be contaminated possibly through supplying the organic solid waste as influent and consumed rapidly via aerobic acetate oxidation by these otus that might possess the high affinity to oxygen thus there is possibility that the remaining 10 otus served as the anaerobic acetate dissimilators in the anmbr during the sip incubation the probable inorganic electron acceptors other than co2 i e o2 sulfate and nitrate were not detected while formate known as an electron shuttle for syntrophic oxidation of acetate hattori et al 2000 continued to be present fig s1a in this situation the anaerobic dissimilation of acetate was most likely syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the potential syntroph otus 3993 and 4863 that were closely related to the deltaproteobacterial syntrophobacter wolinii and syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans fig 3a could catalyze this syntrophic reaction although the relatives have been reported not to use acetate syntrophically for their growth liu et al 1999 qiu et al 2008 the firmicutes otus 4258 5762 and 5257 as well as the low abundance member otu 3969 formed a novel phylogenetic clade without any cultured microorganisms fig 3a several species of the syntrophic acetate oxidizers such as thermoacetogenium phaeum and thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum have been identified in this phylum orphan et al 2000 maus et al 2016 furthermore the 13c enriched otu 4685 was affiliated within the synergistetes fig 3c including the potential syntrophic acetate oxidizers e g synergistes group 4 ito et al 2011 mosbaek et al 2016 yi et al 2020 the otu 5866 was classified into the caldiserica that has limited isolates fig 3c the candidate division gouta4 related clade otu 5500 has no neighbor cultured representative fig 3a however these otu affiliated cluster contained the uncultured clones from the anaerobic digester environments i e qedq2dh12 cu923103 for otu 5866 qedt2db08 cu920146 for otu 5500 the candidate phyla aminicenantes otu 2173 and atribacteria otu 3444 were heavily labeled with acetate 13c genomes of these candidate phyla have been sequenced in recent studies of anaerobic bioreactors and oxygen limited marine sediments rinke et al 2013 gies et al 2014 which suggested that the possible metabolic functions of the aminicenantes were the fermentation and syntrophic vfa degradation robbins et al 2016 xu et al 2018 while that of atribacteria was the anaerobic acetate dissimilation in particular syntrophic acetate oxidation webster et al 2011 gies et al 2014 lee et al 2018 consequently it is suggested that the newly identified otus of the phyla firmicutes synergistetes and caldiserica the candidate phyla aminicenantes and atribacteria and the candidate division gouta4 related clade as well as the known syntrophic deltaproteobacteria otus participated in syntrophic acetate oxidation in the anmbr 5 conclusion in the anmbr system treating organic solid waste the anaerobic oxidation of acetate is rate limiting but energetically unfavorable during anaerobic organics decomposition which makes the identification and characterization of the anaerobic acetate degraders difficult high sensitivity rrna sip demonstrated that the phylogenetically diverse and novel microorganisms including the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were directly involved in acetate degradation in the anmbr the subsequent phylogenetic tree analysis and population dynamics tracing of the identified otus suggested the acetate assimilators and dissimilators under changing conditions out of the 22 bacterial species identified as the active 13c acetate degraders 3 otus would be the aerobic acetate oxidizers utilizing small amounts of the contaminated oxygen 8 otus in the uncultured clades of the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and lentisphaerae capable of hydrolyzing and or fermenting high molecular substances were most likely the anaerobic acetate assimilators and further the phylogenetically novel 9 otus of the phyla firmicutes synergistetes and caldiserica the candidate phyla aminicenantes and atribacteria and the candidate division gouta4 related clade as well as the known syntroph related 2 otus of the class deltaproteobacteria were responsible for the anaerobic dissimilation of acetate e g syntrophic acetate oxidation the dense microbial communities inside the anmbr would make it easy to transfer hydrogen and or electron vital for the syntrophic reaction the results of this study unveiled for the first time the unexpected diversity and ecophysiological features of the hitherto unaddressed elusive acetate degraders in the anmbr treating organic solid waste high sensitivity sip combined with metatranscriptomics should be applied to provide more detailed evidence on the anaerobic acetate metabolisms e g differentiation of the acetate dissimilation and

17992,in anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr treating organic solid waste acetate is one of the most important precursors to ch4 however the identity and diversity of anaerobic acetate degraders are largely unknown possibly due to their slow growth rates and low abundances here we identified acetate degrading microorganisms in the anmbr sludges by high sensitivity stable isotope probing degradation of the amended 13c acetate coincided with production of 13ch4 and 13co2 during the sludge incubation high throughput sequencing of rna density fractions indicated that the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens i e methanosaeta sp acetate dissimilator and methanolinea sp acetate assimilator incorporated 13c acetate significantly remarkably 22 bacterial species incorporating 13c acetate were identified whereas their majority was distantly related to the cultured representatives only two of them were the class deltaproteobacteria affiliated lineages with syntrophic volatile

chloroflexi and lentisphaerae exhibited low relative abundances comparable to that of methanolinea sp 0 00011 during the anmbr operation suggesting that these bacteria were involved in anaerobic

solid waste graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic acetate degradation high sensitivity stable isotope probing anaerobic membrane bioreactor organic solid waste 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr a combined system of the anaerobic digestion and membrane separation technologies has been developed for the treatment of wastewater and organic solid waste it has many advantages that include the low energy consumption small footprint high effluent quality and production of renewable energy i e methane ch4 a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the anmbr systems for treating various kinds of wastewaters dereli et al 2012 jensen et al 2015 shoener et al 2016 yu et al 2016 however apart from the applicability to the wastewater treatment findings on anmbrs treating organic solid wastes have been limited because of the difficulty in the highly concentrated solid separation from liquid and the degradation of recalcitrant substances including proteins and fats that are converted to the methanogenesis inhibiting ammonia and fatty acids chen et al 2008 cuetos et al 2008 we have recently reported the successful start up and long term stable operation of an anmbr system to effectively treat a model slurry of the high strength organic solid waste inaba et al 2020 this study has provided information on the microbial community dynamics during the stabilization and deterioration of the anmbr performances yet the identity of the sludge microorganisms involved in the efficient organics decomposition has not been clarified anaerobic digestion processes in anmbr are comprised mainly of three metabolic steps hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis speece 1983 hori et al 2007 the methanogenic conversion of organic compounds is catalyzed by anaerobic microbial consortia including the hydrolyzing and fermentative microbes alcohol and volatile fatty acid vfa oxidizing syntrophs and methanogens acetate is

dissimilator ferry 2010 in addition it has been reported that several bacterial lineages can oxidize i e dissimilate acetate syntrophically with hydrogenotrophic methanogens balk et al 2002 hattori 2008 westerholm et al 2010 hori et al 2011 however the diversity of the anaerobic acetate degraders is still largely unknown possibly due to their slow growth rates and low abundances anmbrs can prevent the washout of the slow and non growers pack the dense microbial communities and stimulate the juxtaposition based interspecies hydrogen and or electron transfer vital for syntrophic acetate oxidation stable isotope probing of rrna rrna sip is a powerful technique for directly linking the identity and function of hitherto uncultured microorganisms manefield et al 2002 hori et al 2007 2010 although sip has been so far applied to characterize the acetate metabolizing microbial communities in anaerobic digesters hao et al 2015 ito et al 2011 the slow incorporation of 13c acetate into nucleic acids may have rendered the anaerobic acetate degraders inaccessible we have improved the detection sensitivity of rrna sip by high throughput sequencing of isopycnic centrifugation gradients aoyagi et al 2015a and implemented this method to identify the elusive contaminant degraders in a wastewater treatment system aoyagi et al 2018 detecting a small amount of heavily 13c enriched rrnas allows access to the ecophysiology of the slowly growing microorganisms such as anaerobic acetate degraders in anmbrs to facilitate the efficient degradation of organic solid wastes in anmbrs understanding ecophysiological features of the sludge microorganisms in charge of catalyzing the rate limiting step i e anaerobic acetate degradation is vital there are a wide diversity of yet to be characterized microorganisms in the methanogenic sludge juottonen et al 2005 nelson et al 2011 rinke et al 2013 which suggests the presence of the phylogenetically novel acetate degraders the aim of this study was to identify actively acetate degrading microorganisms in the anmbr system treating a model slurry of high strength organic solid waste by high sensitivity stable isotope probing of rrna in addition we investigated high resolution population dynamics of the identified 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms in the actual anmbr run to tackle their ecophysiological characteristics under changing conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 anaerobic incubation of anmbr sludge with 13c labeled acetate a sludge was collected from the 293 day operation of a lab scale mesophilic

microbial community in response to the olr changes was analyzed by the 16s rrna gene sequencing with miseq platform illumina and the obtained data has been already reported in inaba et al 2020 the relative abundance data of the identified otus were extracted from the sequence libraries to trace their population dynamics 3 results 3 1 biochemical activities of anmbr sludge microorganisms amended with 13c acetate in the liquid phases of the 13c and unlabeled treatments concentrations of acetate were initially 0 850 0 927 mmol l 1 fig 1 a and were undetectable 0 005 mmol l 1 at days 1 and 2 despite its periodic addition the formate concentrations decreased to 0 18 0 75 mmol l 1 at day 1 then increased to 1 46 1 21 mmol l 1 at day 2 fig s1a other vfas i e lactate butyrate and propionate were not detected during the 2 day incubation i e 0 01 mmol l 1 data not shown acetate was accumulated at concentrations of around 2 368 mmol l 1 at day 2 in the autoclaved control indicating that acetate was degraded by metabolic activities of the sludge microorganisms in the gaseous phases of the 13c and unlabeled treatments the initial concentrations of ch4 and co2 were 2 563 2 998 mmol l 1 and 21 346 24 191 mmol l 1 respectively fig 1b and c ch4 and co2 were produced from the beginning of the incubation concentrations of ch4 and co2 increased by 33 755 34 076 mmol l 1 and 13 605 14 202 mmol l 1 respectively until day 2 the increases in ch4 and co2 in the no acetate addition treatment were 28 693 mmol l 1 and 12 572 mmol l 1 respectively which were less than those in the 13c and unlabeled treatments suggesting that the organic matter originally containing in the sludge was degraded to ch4 and co2 h2 was not detectable 0 01 mmol l 1 in both of the 13c and unlabeled treatments data not shown the fate of the 13c acetate degraded was traced by the 13c atom percentages of the gaseous products ch4 and co2 over the incubation time fig 1d and e in the 13c treatment 13ch4 and

constant at low levels i e 13ch4 0 385 mmol l 1 13co2 0 421 mmol l 1 aside from these liquid and gaseous parameters concentrations of the toc and cod in the 13c unlabeled and no acetate addition treatments slightly decreased form 182 190 and 827 893 mg l 1 at day 0 to 149 159 and 628 707 mg l 1 at day 2 respectively figs s1b and s1c ic kept at constant levels of 210 249 mg l 1 during the

kept at stable values of 6 7 7 1 during the incubation concentrations of the nitrate and sulfate were under the detection limits i e 0 01 mmol l 1 during the incubation data not shown 3 2 high sensitivity identification of the 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms from heavy fractions of rrna to recover and characterize 13c labeled microbial rrnas the sludge samples incubated for 2 days in the 13c and unlabeled treatments were subjected in triplicate to a series of molecular experiments of high sensitivity sip i e rna extraction isopycnic centrifugation fractionation density

phylogenetically characterized total number of 16s rrna transcript sequences obtained from the 24 density fractions was around 8 9 hundred thousand corresponding to an average of 37 141 sequences per library in the density gradients of rna 45 57 of the bacterial 16s rrna sequences were not classified even at the phylum and class level fig 2 a suggesting that there are still many hitherto unknown bacterial taxa that are metabolically active in the anmbr sludge the phylum and class level phylogenetic analyses indicated no significant differences between both the treatments based on the tukey kramer test result nevertheless implementing the high resolution operational taxonomic unit otu level survey of heavy fractions of the 13c treatment a total of 24 microbial otus were identified as exhibiting 1 3 fold increases in relative abundances with the statistical significances p 0 05 and significance trend levels p 0 1 compared with those of the unlabeled treatment fig 2b c and 2d as to the euryarchaeota species the relative abundances of the otus 3409 and 3553 were 0 118 and 0 144 of the 13c treatment 2 0 and 1 6 fold higher than those of the unlabeled treatment respectively the otu 3409 was closely related to the well known aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta concillii accession no kx261417 96 9 sequence identity justo et al 2016 the otu 3553 was the h2 co2 and formate utilizing methanogen methanolinea tarda nr028163 97 6 that meanwhile requires a slight amount of acetate for own growth via assimilative metabolism imachi et al 2008 remarkably in the domain bacteria 22 significantly 13c acetate incorporating otus were identified most of which were phylogenetically novel and widely distributed in the phylogenetic tree fig s2 and fig 3 with respect to the phylum firmicutes the otus 4258 3969 5762 and 5257 exhibiting the 2 6 2 4 2 5 and 1 6 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment than those in the unlabeled treatment fig 2b and d had low sequence identities to the cultured moorella humiferrea nr108634 86 9 salinithrix halophila nr134171 85 9 alkalibacter saccharofermentans nr042834 87 0 and clostridium sporogene mf623797 91 7 the former three otus formed a cluster together with uncultured bacteria while the latter was located separately in the phylogenetic tree fig 3a in the class deltaproteobacteria the relative abundances of otus 3993 and 4863 were 2 2 and 1 8 fold higher in the 13c treatment fig 2c the otus 3993 and 4863 were assigned into desulfovirga adipica nr036764 95 7 and syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans nr041306 100 respectively whilst the otu 3993 was related rather closely to syntrophobacter wolinii x70905 in the phylogenic tree fig 3 a the recent rrna sip study indicated the involvement of the family syntrophobacteraceae in acetate degradation coupled with sulfate reduction in paddy soil liu et al 2018 the phylum bacteroidetes otus 4980 2322 and 1719 showed the 6 3 2 1 and 1 8 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2b and c and were somewhat related to lentimicrobium saccharophilum nr149795 92 9 alkaliflexus imshenetskii nr117198 92 9 and saccharicrinis fermentans mg264242 89 8 respectively the otu 2592 was 4 1 fold higher in the abundance in the 13c treatment fig 2c its closest relative was the phylum chloroflexi species leptolinea tardivitalis nr040971 89 3 as implied by the blast search and yet the phylogenetic tree analysis clearly indicated this otu was affiliated in the bacteroidetes and formed the wchb1 69 cluster with the otu 4980 and uncultured bacteria e g qedr2ce02 cu922878 fig 3b in the phylum chloroflexi the otus 5189 3002 and 311 showing the 1 5 2 1 and 3 4 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2b and c were related to longilinea arvoryzae nr041355 86 6 ornatilinea apprima nr109544 91 3 and thermomarinilinea lacunifontana nr132293 90 9 the otus 3002 and 311 formed a phylogenetic cluster together with t lacunifontana and uncultured bacteria e g qedq3bd02 cu923106 fig 3c in the phyla lentisphaerae synergistetes and caldiserica the abundances of the otus 4085 4685 and 5866 were 1 5 1 3 and 1 4 fold high in the 13c treatment fig 2c and d the otu 4085 was related to some extent to the anaerobic victivallis vadensis nr118352 91 3 while the otu 4685 belonged to aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus nr113331 98 4 the otu 5866 had a rather low 16s rrna sequence identity i e 74 7 to caldisericum exile ap012051 that was nonetheless the closest relative in the phylogenetic tree other than the known anaerobic microorganisms in the phylum actinobacteria and the class alphaproteobacteria the otus 3004 2371 and 4575 showed 1 3 2 3 and 3 1 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2c and d the otus 3004 and 2371 formed an actinobacterial cluster fig 3b while the otu 4575 was related to obligately aerobic haematospirillum jordaniae nr145528 92 5 apart from the known phylum and class with the cultured representatives the otus in the candidate phylum proposed only with the genomic sequences were successfully identified as significantly 13c acetate incorporating microorganisms the otus 5500 3444 and 2173 exhibited 5 2 4 0 and 1 4 fold higher abundances in the 13c treatment fig 2b and c and had quite low sequence identities to the cultured thermodesulfobium narugense nr074466 83 3 carboxydothermus ferrireducens lt547827 85 0 desulfofundulus kuznetsovii nr115129 82 1 in the phylogenetic tree the otu 5500 was located in the neighbor branch of the candidate division gouta4 fig 3a the otu 3444 was phylogenetically assigned in the candidate phylum atribacteria lineage i e formerly called op9 fig 3a the otu 2173 was the member of the candidate phylum aminicenantes i e formerly called op8 fig 3c 3 3 presence and dynamics of the identified acetate degraders in the anmbr systems with the sip results providing the identities of acetate degraders in the anmbr sludges their presence and dynamics were evaluated by high throughput illumina sequencing of 16s rrna genes sequencing of the genes from the anmbr sludge at day 0 of the sip incubation produced 6 libraries with a total of 2 2 hundred thousand sequences corresponding to an average of 36 845 sequences per library table s3 as a result of extracting the data of the 24 13c incorporating otus from the sequence libraries the relative abundances of the acetate degrader otus ranged from 0 002 to 4 539 fig 2b c and 2d furthermore the dynamics of the identified otus were traced in the actual run for approximately 260 days of another anmbr system inaba et al 2020 the averaged relative abundance data of the identified otus at 30 time points of the operation were retrieved from the duplicate sequence libraries i e a total of 60 libraries in which an average of 123 266 sequences per library were included inaba et al 2020 consequently it was possible to detect and monitor 19 of the 24 otus during the operation period fig 4 these 19 otus continued to exist in the reactor at the averaged relative abundances of 0 00006 5 36341 fig 4 and table s4 indicating their general involvement in acetate degradation in the anmbr on the other hand the other 5 otus 5189 3969 3409 2592 and 4085 were undetectable i e existed below the detection limits 0 00003 of the total throughout the operation suggesting that these 5 otus were not the universal members that participated in acetate degradation in the anmbr system fig 4 and table s4 4 discussion we herein investigated the identity and diversity of the sludge microorganisms involved in the degradation of acetate one of the most important precursors to ch4 during anaerobic decomposition of the model organic solid waste slurry in the anmbr systems repeatedly dosing an environmentally relevant concentration 1 mm per day 2 mm in total table s1 of 13c acetate and employing a short incubation time 2 days allowed the sludge microorganisms to incorporate 13c acetate under quasi natural conditions thereby minimizing the negative effect of cross feeding gc c irms in parallel with chemical analyses provided the information about the fate of 13c acetate during the sip incubation based on the phylogenetic tree constructed we revealed that the acetate degrading bacteria were taxonomically diverse and formed phylogenetic clusters with uncultured bacteria of the phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes chloroflexi lentisphaerae synergistetes caldiserica and the class deltaproteobacteria and the candidate phyla atribacteria and aminicenantes and the candidate division gouta4 related clade furthermore the population abundance and dynamics data in addition to the phylogenetic positions of the identified acetate degraders in the actual anmbr run suggested their ecophysiological features i e which assimilative or dissimilative acetate metabolism they employed under changing conditions for the sip experiment the methyl and carboxyl groups of acetate were labeled with 13c and the fully 13c labeled acetate i e acetate 13c2 was used as substrate during the sip incubation 1 854 mmol l 1 2 0 927 mmol l 1 of the supplemented 13c acetate was degraded until day 2 fig 1a thus the total concentration of 13c from the acetate added was 3 709 mmol l 1 the concentrations of gaseous products 13ch4 and 13co2 were 2 199 and 0 651 mmol l 1 respectively fig 1d and e dissolved 13co2 components as bicarbonate were calculated to be 0 542 mmol l 1 using the gaseous 13co2 and liquid ic concentrations fig s1d in ph 6 8 at 35 c of the sludge water the carbon recovery in the 13c treatment was 91 48 the remainder of the carbon was possibly incorporated by the sludge microorganisms whose rrna was then 13c labeled technically without the assimilation it is not possible to detect the 13c labeling in any microorganisms the 13c labeling of aceticlastic methanogens would indicate the operation of the dissimilatory aceticlastic cleavage pathway another dissimilatory pathway of acetate in the anmbr is anaerobic acetate oxidation for both the methanogens and acetate oxidizers it is very likely that the dissimilation and assimilation processes occur almost concurrently in a same population meanwhile the direct assimilation of acetate via the formation of acetyl coa into biomass of methanogens cannot be ruled out it is also noted that some of bacterial species would be involved in the direct acetate assimilation the retrieved buoyant densities bds of the heavy rna fractions i e 1h 2h and 3h fractions corresponded to those of the 13c labeled rrna accumulated fractions in our previous study table s2 aoyagi et al 2015a high throughput sequencing of the heavy fractions indicated that 24 microbial otus incorporated the 13c acetate fig 2b d significantly p 0 05 or at significance trend levels p 0 1 among them the otu 3969 was found to be heavily enriched with 13c by the independent assays of both the 1h and 3h fractions and the 13c incorporating otu 3409 was closely related to the well known aceticlastic methanogen methanosaeta concillii fig 2b affirming the validity of our criteria of high sensitivity sip in this context it is noted that methanosaeta spp have been known to operate the direct interspecies electron transfer with the bacterial species such as geobacter spp rotaru et al 2014 which is not evident in the anmbr and thus warrants the future study under methanogenic conditions acetate can be utilized via both of dissimilatory and assimilatory metabolisms hattori 2008 the heavily 13c enriched archaeal otu 3553 was identified as the well known hydrogenotrophic methanogen methanolinea tarda sequence identity 97 6 fig 2c that requires acetate for its growth through assimilative metabolism imachi et al 2008 although the otu 3553 may have catalyzed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coupled with syntrophic acetate oxidation this methanogen was most likely labeled by 13c acetate assimilation rather than the reduction of 13co2 a product of acetate oxidation due to the high co2 bicarbonate pool in the anmbr sludge and the short incubation time with small dosages of 13c acetate this otu served as a reference of the anaerobic acetate assimilator comparative analyses of the abundance levels and dynamics of this otu would be useful for determining the other possible acetate assimilators in the anmbr system the population dynamics tracing in the actual anmbr system indicated that the averaged relative abundance of this otu was 0 00011 fig 4 and table s4 strongly suggesting that rather low abundances were tightly associated with the anaerobic acetate assimilation on the other hand the known syntrophic bacteria related otus 3993 and 4863 potentially involved in the anaerobic acetate dissimilation exhibited relatively high averaged relative abundances of 0 00031 0 00189 during the operation it is intriguing to point out the fact that the abundance levels in addition to the phylogenetic positions of the identified acetate degraders would be an indicator for specifying the mode of anaerobic acetate metabolism i e assimilation or dissimilation in the anmbr by means of high sensitivity sip 22 bacterial otus were identified as the active acetate degraders most of which had considerably low sequence identities to the closest cultured relatives fig 2b d and fig 3 as compared with the averaged relative abundance of the acetate assimilator otu 3553 methanolinea sp in the anmbr operation those of the otus 2322 1719 and 3002 were not significantly high table s4 fig 4d implying that these otus exhibited the comparable abundance levels of the otu 3553 in addition the bacterial otus 5189 3969 2592 and 4085 were undetectable indicating their relative abundances were below the detection limit during the operation based on the results from phylogenetic tree analyses fig 3 these low abundance members were affiliated mainly within the phyla bacteroidetes otus 2592 2322 and 1719 and chloroflexi otus 5189 and 3002 the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are the most commonly found phyla as including the hydrolyzers and acidogens in anaerobic digesters nelson et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it has been also reported that certain members of the chloroflexi actively assimilated acetate in anaerobic environments lee et al 2014 in addition the lentisphaerae otu 4085 was related to the anaerobically sugar utilizing victivallis vadensis zoetendal et al 2003 suggesting the fermentative metabolism of this otu taken together in parallel with the hydrolysis and or fermentative metabolisms the bacteroidetes chloroflexi and lentisphaerae otus could assimilate acetate anaerobically in the anmbr on the other hand the other 15 otus i e 3993 4863 4258 5762 5257 3444 2173 4685 5500 5866 4980 311 3004 2371 and 4575 displayed high relative abundances with statistical significances p 0 05 and significance trend levels p 0 1 compared to that of the acetate assimilator otu 3553 during the anmbr operation fig 4a c and table s4 among them the otus 4980 and 311 were assigned to the phyla bacteroidetes and chloroflexi fig 3a and b with the acetate assimilators predicted above the alphaproteobacterial otu 4575 and the actinobacterial otus 2371 and 3004 were putatively aerobic and facultative anaerobic microorganisms respectively as is common with these phyla affiliated members in the anmbr sludge slight amount of oxygen could be contaminated possibly through supplying the organic solid waste as influent and consumed rapidly via aerobic acetate oxidation by these otus that might possess the high affinity to oxygen thus there is possibility that the remaining 10 otus served as the anaerobic acetate dissimilators in the anmbr during the sip incubation the probable inorganic electron acceptors other than co2 i e o2 sulfate and nitrate were not detected while formate known as an electron shuttle for syntrophic oxidation of acetate hattori et al 2000 continued to be present fig s1a in this situation the anaerobic dissimilation of acetate was most likely syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the potential syntroph otus 3993 and 4863 that were closely related to the deltaproteobacterial syntrophobacter wolinii and syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans fig 3a could catalyze this syntrophic reaction although the relatives have been reported not to use acetate syntrophically for their growth liu et al 1999 qiu et al 2008 the firmicutes otus 4258 5762 and 5257 as well as the low abundance member otu 3969 formed a novel phylogenetic clade without any cultured microorganisms fig 3a several species of the syntrophic acetate oxidizers such as thermoacetogenium phaeum and thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum have been identified in this phylum orphan et al 2000 maus et al 2016 furthermore the 13c enriched otu 4685 was affiliated within the synergistetes fig 3c including the potential syntrophic acetate oxidizers e g synergistes group 4 ito et al 2011 mosbaek et al 2016 yi et al 2020 the otu 5866 was classified into the caldiserica that has limited isolates fig 3c the candidate division gouta4 related clade otu 5500 has no neighbor cultured representative fig 3a however these otu affiliated cluster contained the uncultured clones from the anaerobic digester environments i e qedq2dh12 cu923103 for otu 5866 qedt2db08 cu920146 for otu 5500 the candidate phyla aminicenantes otu 2173 and atribacteria otu 3444 were heavily labeled with acetate 13c genomes of these candidate phyla have been sequenced in recent studies of anaerobic bioreactors and oxygen limited marine sediments rinke et al 2013 gies et al 2014 which suggested that the possible metabolic functions of the aminicenantes were the fermentation and syntrophic vfa degradation robbins et al 2016 xu et al 2018 while that of atribacteria was the anaerobic acetate dissimilation in particular syntrophic acetate oxidation webster et al 2011 gies et al 2014 lee et al 2018 consequently it is suggested that the newly identified otus of the phyla firmicutes synergistetes and caldiserica the candidate phyla aminicenantes and atribacteria and the candidate division gouta4 related clade as well as the known syntrophic deltaproteobacteria otus participated in syntrophic acetate oxidation in the anmbr 5 conclusion in the anmbr system treating organic solid waste the anaerobic oxidation of acetate is rate limiting but energetically unfavorable during anaerobic organics decomposition which makes the identification and characterization of the anaerobic acetate degraders difficult high sensitivity rrna sip demonstrated that the phylogenetically diverse and novel microorganisms including the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were directly involved in acetate degradation in the anmbr the subsequent phylogenetic tree analysis and population dynamics tracing of the identified otus suggested the acetate assimilators and dissimilators under changing conditions out of the 22 bacterial species identified as the active 13c acetate degraders 3 otus would be the aerobic acetate oxidizers utilizing small amounts of the contaminated oxygen 8 otus in the uncultured clades of the phyla bacteroidetes chloroflexi and lentisphaerae capable of hydrolyzing and or fermenting high molecular substances were most likely the anaerobic acetate assimilators and further the phylogenetically novel 9 otus of the phyla firmicutes synergistetes and caldiserica the candidate phyla aminicenantes and atribacteria and the candidate division gouta4 related clade as well as the known syntroph related 2 otus of the class deltaproteobacteria were responsible for the anaerobic dissimilation of acetate e g syntrophic acetate oxidation the dense microbial communities inside the anmbr would make it easy to transfer hydrogen and or electron vital for the syntrophic reaction the results of this study unveiled for the first time the unexpected diversity and ecophysiological features of the hitherto unaddressed elusive acetate degraders in the anmbr treating organic solid waste high sensitivity sip combined with metatranscriptomics should be applied to provide more detailed evidence on the anaerobic acetate metabolisms e g differentiation of the acetate dissimilation and

17993,kitchen wastes kw have been widely investigated for bio ethanol production while no study utilizes kw as ethanol source to stimulate the methanogenic communities to perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet since the excess acidity contained after the biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp can seriously inhibit the diet based syntrophic metabolism in this study a strategy that utilized waste activated sludge was as co substrate to relieve the excess acidity after befp during anaerobic co digestion acod was proposed the results showed that under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 kw was volume ratio both methane production and organic compound removal evidently increased compared with that treating the sole was conversely under the other mixed ratios sole kw 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 no methane but the evident hydrogen production was detected and syntrophic metabolism of organic acids and alcohols was prevented three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis showed that the protein like organic compounds contained in both kw and was were effectively degraded furthermore the maximum methane production potential from was during acod 260 5 4 1 and 264 3 2 7 ml g cod was higher than that treating sole was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod microbial community analysis showed that some genera capable of metabolizing the complex organic compounds with the reduction of the elemental sulfur or equipped with the electrically conductive pili were specially enriched during acod under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 they might proceed diet with methanogens such as methanosarcina and methanospirillum species to maintain the syntrophic metabolism effective and stable since the abundance of both methanosarcina and methanospirillum species evidently increased graphical abstract image 1 keywords kitchen wastes kw waste activated sludge was anaerobic co digestion acod biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp direct interspecies electron transfer diet 1 introduction effective disposal of kitchen wastes kw is an increasingly prominent issue which has some direct environmental economic and social impacts in an attempt to achieve the global food security and environmental governance li et al 2019 anaerobic digestion ad as an economic and eco friendly method has been widely applied in the disposal of kw due to its ability of converting organic substrates to methane de clercq et al 2016 li et al 2019 however the application of ad in the disposal of kw is still limited around the world for example in france based on the design parameters in a pilot project 200 t d kw capacity and 150 nm3 biogas t kw treated the expected biogas output in the pilot project should reach approximately 30000 nm3 d while the actual biogas production rate was quite low at merely 1000 nm3 d de clercq et al 2016 the primary technical bottleneck limiting the efficiency of methanogenesis is that the organic acids largely contained in kw inhibit the metabolic activities of methanogens result in the rise of hydrogen partial pressure and further prevent the syntrophic metabolism via interspecies hydrogen transfer iht therefore enhancing the syntrophic metabolism is expected to promote the more effective methanogenesis from kw establishing direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been confirmed as an effective method to promote the better syntrophic metabolism up to now two strategies have been successfully applied in the establishment of the diet based syntrophic metabolism in the methanogenic digesters one is referred to as electron transfer process control that utilizes the conductive materials as electron conduits to achieve the long range electron and energy transport between the precursors of diet equipped with the electrically conductive pili e lili or outer surface c type cytochrome omcs and methanogens although conductive materials such as granular active carbon gac biochar carbon cloth and magnetite can accelerate both the rate and efficiency of diet in the defined co cultures of geobacter with methanothrix or methanosarcina species liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014a b as well as in some mixed cultures cruz et al 2014 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 2016a b zhang and lu 2016 zhao et al 2016a b in which geobacter species are abundant with some simple organic acids and alcohols the direct use of conductive materials to enhance ad of complex organic wastes such as kw dang et al 2016 and waste activated sludge was yang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 is still limited the primary reason should be ascribed to the following two aspects 1 the precursors of diet such as geobacter species are usually rare in the conventional digesters treating the complex organic wastes dang et al 2016 peng et al 2018 2 the confirmed precursors of diet such as g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens cannot utilize the complex organic substrates with methanogens in the defined co cultures wang et al 2016 however with fe iii oxides as electron acceptors the available substrates for geobacter species are varied such as glucose glycerol and benzene lovley et al 2011 one possible reason is that with carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor the precursors of diet cannot obtain the sufficient energy during metabolizing the complex organic wastes to proceed the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 8h 8e co 2 ch 4 2h 2 o δg 0 92 7 kj mol to occur in thermodynamics another is to initially feed the methanogenic digesters with ethanol electron transfer source control zhao et al 2016a b analysis of the communities in the digesters treating propionate and butyrate found that some novel species equipped with e pili such as g bemidjiensis and g lovleyi were specially enriched zhao et al 2016a b analysis of the communities in the digesters treating the fermentative intermediates found that sphaerochaeta species were abundant metabolically active and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin zhao et al 2020a b suggesting that they held a potential of proceeding diet with methanogens to metabolize the complex organic substrates rather than the simple organic acids and alcohols unfortunately the mechanisms involved in the enrichment of these novel precursors of diet to rapidly establish the electrically connected communities are still not yet confirmed in the defined co cultures however analysis of the gene abundance found that the oxidation of ethanol motivated the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane of these precursors of diet to yield more energy zhao et al 2020a b which hereby promoted them to produce the biological electron transfer components of e pili and to proceed the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane smoothly fermenting the saccharide contained organic wastes to produce ethanol via the biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp can be used to permanently establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism the proof of concept studies were consecutively conducted in the digesters treating some complex organic wastes such as dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 2020a b bagasse wastes zhao and zhang 2019 and corn straw zhu et al 2019 actually kw can be also served as bio ethanol source the studies hafid et al 2017 karimi and karimi 2018 on the feasibility of utilizing the kw as substrates for bio ethanol production have been conducted by several researchers however there is no investigation utilizing kw as bio ethanol source to stimulate the methanogenic communities to perform diet an important reason is that the excess acidity contained in kw after befp seriously inhibits the microbial activity and has a strong impact on the establishment of the diet based syntrophic metabolism a potential strategy for relieving the excess acidity contained in kw after befp can be conducted during anaerobic co digestion acod with a co substrate that contains the high alkalinity such as was if so it will not only establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism permanently and steadily in response to the excess acidity but potentially enhance the conversion of both kw and was to methane based on these considerations the study presented here evaluated the performances of acod of kw after befp and was the different mixture ratios of kw after befp with was were compared with the aim of clarifying the feasibility and stability of this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge kitchen wastes and waste activated sludge seed sludge was collected from an

ethanol type fermentation the hydraulic retention time hrt and operating temperature of the acidogenic digester was 9 6 h and 37 0 c respectively after the 120 day experiments the concentration of tss and vss of the ethanol type fermentation inoculum was 11400 170 mg l mg l and 8400 323 mg l respectively ethanol type fermentation inoculum was offwhite and cotton shaped primarily comprised of tightly packed spindle and rod shaped microorganisms figs s1a and s1b see supporting information analysis of the communities fig s1c showed that the ethanol butyrate type fermentation genus megasphaera was the dominant bacteria accounting for about 20 of the communities the well known ethanol type fermentation genus ethanoligenens accounted for 10 7 of the communities they were primarily responsible for the significant production of ethanol ren et al 2007 befp was conducted in four parallel batch flow completely mixed anaerobic digesters for the 4 day experiments each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml internal diameter of 70 mm and height of 300 mm at the top of each digester a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with electric motor was placed into the sludge at the beginning of befp each digester received a 700 ml of kw and a 100 ml of ethanol type fermentation inoculum the ph and operating temperature of befp was kept at 4 0 4 5 and 30 0 c respectively the change of short chain fatty acids scfas and ethanol in the digesters during the 4 day befp is shown in fig s2 see supporting information in the initial kw the concentration of ethanol was 2078 5 156 9 mgcod l accounting for about 35 of the total scfas and ethanol after the 4 day befp the concentration of ethanol in kw increased to 14553 8 309 1 mgcod l accounting for about 70 of the total scfas and ethanol the main characteristics of kw after befp are displayed in table s2 see supporting information 2 3 anaerobic co digestion batch flow experiments of acod were conducted in twenty one parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 800 ml internal diameter of 65 mm and height of 300 mm for the 35 day experiments each digester was equipped with a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port placed in a shaker at a speed of 40 50 rpm and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c at the beginning of acod each digester received a 200 ml of seed sludge and 600 ml feedstocks the volume ratio of kw after befp and was in the feedstocks was as follows sole kw 5 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 5 and sole was the main characteristics of the seed sludge mixed with feedstocks are displayed in table 1 2 4 analytical methods tss and vss were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater cod was measured by hach s method 8000

voltammetry cv was used to evaluate the electrochemical response of the sludge after the 35 day experiments the electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation zhenhua chi1030c china yin et al 2018 the glassy carbon gc pt sheet and ag agcl was utilized as working electrode counter electrode and reference electrode respectively before electrochemical measurements the

production accumulative methane production after the 35 day experiments in the digesters treating the sole was was 187 5 15 4 ml g vss fig 1 a under the mixed ratio of 1 5 volume ratio kw was though an evident lag of methanogenesis was observed fig 1a and b due to the excess acidity in kw after befp table 1 the accumulative methane production reached 275 2 25 4 ml g vss fig 1a which was about 1 47 fold higher than that treating the sole was with the increase of the mixed ratio to 1 2 the lag of methanogenesis was more significant p 0 05 fig 1a and b but the accumulative methane production reached 314 9 23 0 ml g vss fig 1a which increased about 68 compared with treating the sole was further increase of the mixed ratio destroyed the balance of syntrophic metabolism table 1 since no methane fig 1a but an evident hydrogen fig 1c was detected in these digesters specially the accumulative hydrogen production in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 2 1 5 1 and sole kw reached 10 1 0 5 5 0 0 6 8 3 0 3 and 7 6 0 4 ml g vss respectively fig 1c and the maximum hydrogen production rate was close to 550 ml d under the mixed ratio of 5 1 fig 1b furthermore the maximum methane production rate was close to 1200 ml d under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 1b significantly higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 p 0 05 823 4 49 2 ml d as well as in the digesters treating sole was p 0 05 759 7 33 6 ml d was with the high alkalinity values might play an important role in relieving the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and keeping the methanogenic systems stable since it proceeded the conversion of h to h2 fig 1c and d and accelerated the recovery of phs fig 1e apart from the digesters under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and 1 2 the phs in the digesters with the high content kw were only recovered to 5 5 6 0 it should be pointed out that the high concentration hydrogen accumulation can easily inhibit the syntrophic metabolism via iht and then further prevent the conversion of organic acids and alcohols to methane stams and plugge 2009 however in this study the high concentration hydrogen accumulation had almost no influence on methanogenesis under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 1a and the accumulative hydrogen production even reached 13 8 0 7 ml g vss which was higher than that under the other mixed ratios fig 1b suggesting that the syntrophic metabolism was proceeded by an effective working mode of interspecies electron transfer rather than iht 3 2 organic compound removal as expected from the methane data the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 were about 6 and 18 higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and treating the sole was respectively while the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw and was under the other mixed ratios as well as treating sole kw were lower than 40 fig 2 a meanwhile the cod removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 were about 4 and 20 higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and treating the sole was respectively while the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw and was under the other mixed ratios as well as treating sole kw were all lower than 17 fig 2b after the 35 day experiments in the digesters treating the sole was the total volume of methane was 7322 8 3 4 ml 7322 8 3 4 ml 187 5 15 4 ml g vss the accumulative methane production see fig 1a 48828 1 276 3 mg l the concentration of vss see table 1 800 ml the volume of digester and the amount of cod removal was 29 2 0 1 g 29 2 g 96300 0 399 mg l the influent concentration of tcod see table 1 800 ml 59825 213 mg l the effluent concentration of tcod see fig 2b 800 ml therefore the methane production potential in these digesters treating sole was was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod 250 8 0 1 ml g cod 7322 8 3 4 ml 29 2 0 1 g it was assumed that the kw contained in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 were completely consumed to produce methane the theoretical volume maximum of methane produced from kw should be 7914 4 311 5 ml 7914 4 311 5 ml 100 ml the volume of kw 226125 8900 mg l the cod concentration of kw after befp table s2 see supporting information 350 ml g cod the theoretical maximum methane production per g cod after the 35 day experiments the actual volume of methane was 12968 5 7 3 ml 12968 5 7 3 ml 275 2 25 4 ml g vss the accumulative methane production see fig 1a 58823 5 358 9 mg l the concentration of vss see table 1 800 ml the volume of digester in the digesters treating kw and was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 therefore the theoretical volume minimum of methane produced from was was 5054 1 304 2 ml 5054 1 ml 12968 5 7 3 ml 7914 4 311 5 ml the actual amount of cod removal in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 was 42 0 0 6 g 42 0 g 98800 426 mg l the influent concentration of tcod see table 1 800 ml 46275 333 mg l the effluent concentration of tcod see fig 2b 800 ml the theoretical amount of cod removal from was was 19 4 1 5 g 19 4 1 5 g 42 0 0 6 g 100 ml 226125 0 8900 2 mg l the cod concentration of kw after befp table s2 see supporting information therefore the maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 was 260 5 4 1 ml g cod 260 5 4 1 ml g cod 5054 1 304 2 ml 19 4 1 5 g which was higher than that treating the sole was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod based on the same calculations the maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 was 264 3 2 7 ml g cod which was also higher than that treating sole was it should be pointed out that the kw contained in the digesters treating kw with was were impossibly consumed to produce methane completely since a fraction of organic compounds might be degraded to yield energy to support the growth of cells and converted to biomass or to reduce some compounds with an oxidation state such as nitrate and sulphate therefore the actual maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 should be higher than the theoretical values these results demonstrated that the conversion of was to methane during acod was enhanced in consistent with this based on the mass balance fig 2c the methane conversion efficiency in the digesters treating kw after befp and was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 reached 88 9 and 79 6 which was higher than that treating sole was about 24 and 15 respectively 3 3 change of scfas and alcohols ethanol and acetate were the dominant scfas and alcohols detected in the digesters treating sole kw during the 35 day experiments fig 3 a and b at the end of experiments the effluent concentration of ethanol and acetate in the digesters treating sole kw reached 15700 291 mgcod l fig 3a and 25543 2011 mgcod l fig 3b respectively especially in these digesters the effluent concentration of ethanol after the 35 day experiments was nearly same with the initial concentration of ethanol contained in kw after befp table 1 suggesting that the fermentation of alcohols into scfas was seriously inhibited conversely with the decline of the mixed ratio the effluent concentration of ethanol gradually decreased fig 3a but the effluent concentration of acetate gradually increased fig 3b at the end of experiments the effluent concentration of acetate in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 reached 20000 25000 mgcod l unlike the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 propionate fig 3c and butyrate fig 3d were evidently detected in the digesters treating kw and was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 and 1 1 specially after the 35 day experiments the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 had the highest effluent concentration of propionate 11781 780 mgcod l fig 3c and the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 had the highest effluent concentration of butyrate 33238 1826 mgcod l fig 3d suggesting that the syntrophic metabolism of propionate and butyrate was seriously limited in these digesters commonly the evident propionate accumulation is usually observed at a ph of higher than 6 0 and the evident butyrate production is usually occurred at a ph of 5 5 5 0 zhao et al 2017 consistent with this study the was contained the high alkalinity values relieved the excess acidity contained in kw which resulted that the effluent phs in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 were close to 6 0 and the effluent phs in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 were close to 5 5 fig 1e however under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 the scfas and ethanol in the digesters were rapidly consumed fig 3 and the phs gradually increased to more than 7 0 fig 1e at the end of experiments neither ethanol fig 3a nor acetate fig 3b was detected and both effluent concentration of propionate fig 3c and butyrate fig 3d was lower than 500 mgcod l in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 3 4 residual organic composition to compared the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was the residual organic composition in the digesters after the 35 day experiments was analyzed by 3d eem fig 4 an evident peak of fluorescence in the digesters treating sole kw fig 4a kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 fig 4b 2 1 fig 4c 1 1 fig 4d and sole was fig 4g was observed in the protein like region ex em 280 300 350 nm muller et al 2011 he et al 2013 commonly the peak of fluorescence approaching to ex em 280 350 nm belongs to the protein like organic compounds primarily contained in the meat such as bovine serum albumin bsa muller et al 2011 he et al 2013 while the peak of fluorescence approaching to ex em 280 300 belongs to the protein like organic compounds primarily contained in the biomass such as escherichia coli muller et al 2011 with the decline of the mixed ratio from 5 1 to 1 1 it was observed that the fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 350 nm gradually reduced from 1230 to 530 a u while the fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 300 gradually increased from 570 to 1150 a u fig 4b 4c and 4d the sludge in the digesters treating sole kw had the highest fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 350 nm of more than 1300 a u fig 4a and the sludge in the digesters treating sole was had the highest fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 300 of more than 1200 a u fig 4g the tendency of the fluorescence intensity at the different locations was consistent with the change of content of kw or was in the digesters since the meat like proteins were primarily contained in kw and the biomass like proteins were primarily contained in was however it should be pointed out that a peak of fluorescence at ex em 280 300 350 nm with an intensity ranging from 200 to 400 a u was detected in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 4e and 1 5 fig 4f suggesting that the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was was enhanced during acod 3 5 ets activity cyclic voltammetry and sludge conductance to further clarify that the interspecies electron transfer was promoted in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 ets activity cv and sludge conductance were analyzed respectively fig 5 ets activity has been recently demonstrated as an effective indicator of interspecies electron exchange in the microbial respiration yin et al 2018 in this study the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 were lower than 10 μg ml min fig 5a the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating sole was slightly increased to 13 4 1 8 μg ml min fig 5a however the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 were about 2 2 and 1 6 fold higher than that treating sole was these results suggested that the capacity of interspecies electron transfer in the sludge treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 was higher than that under the other mixed ratios activity of interspecies electron transfer was further evaluated by cv analysis fig 5b previous studies lee et al 2016 yin et al 2018 observed that the redox peaks from the cv measurements belonged to the sludge stimulated with gac or magnetite in this study an evident oxidation peak with a potential of 0 65 v that might belong to the oxidation peak of cyc2 was only observed in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 cyc2 an outer membrane cytochrome c type protein is usually served as an electron carrier to participate in microbial fe iii fe ii transformation bird et al 2011 furthermore a slight reduction peak with a potential of 0 21 v that might belong to the reduction peak of omcs was only observed in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and 1 2 omcs is an important biological electron transfer components involved in extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides electrodes as well as methanogens summers et al 2010 these results suggested that the sludge in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 were more metabolically active in interspecies electron transfer than that under the other mixed ratios further study was to clarify that the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism was established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 via conductance measurements fig 5c the aggregates with a high electrically conductance have been considered as an important evidence in recent studies morita et al 2011 zhao et al 2016a b 2017 to indicate the diet based microbial communities study summers et al 2010 in the defined co cultures of two geobacter species demonstrated that the mechanism involved in the electrical aggregates was that geobacter species facilitated diet via their e pili to form the electrical networks in this study the high conductance sludge was only observed in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 15 7 2 2 us cm and 1 5 11 4 0 8 us cm while the conductivity of the sludge in the other digesters was lower than 5 0 us cm these results suggested that the precursors of diet equipped with e pili might be specially enriched to proceed the diet based syntrophic metabolism in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 3 6 microbial community structure the primary genera detected in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 belonged to the typical fermentative bacteria such as rhodococcus lactobacillus clostridium haloimpatiens and romboutsia species table 2 which accounted for about 50 90 of the bacterial communities with the decline of the mixed ratio to 1 1 the abundance of rhodococcus species gradually decreased from 70 9 to 9 3 in the digesters table 2 the trend was quite consistent with the gradually reduced concentration of ethanol in these digesters at the end of experiments fig 3a suggesting that rhodococcus species played an important role in the fermentation of complex organic compounds to ethanol unlike rhodococcus species with the decline of the mixed ratio to 1 1 the abundance of clostridium and romboutsia species gradually increased from 0 4 to 12 7 and 2 5 36 5 in the digesters respectively table 2 the trend was quite consistent with the gradually increased concentration of butyrate in these digesters at the end of experiments fig 3d suggesting that clostridium and romboutsia species played an important role in the fermentation of complex organic compounds to butyrate accompanied by the release of hydrogen fig 1b lactobacillus species were only detected in the digesters treating sole kw with a relative abundance of 19 8 while haloimpatiens species were only detected in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 and 1 1 table 2 it should be pointed out that the effluent phs in the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 were nearly same close to 5 5 fig 1e indicating that the effluent phs were not the primary factor influencing the bacterial communities in these digesters therefore lactobacillus species might primarily participate in the conversion of ethanol into acetate and haloimpatiens species were primarily responsible for propionate and butyrate fermentation the abundance of rhodococcus lactobacillus clostridium haloimpatiens and romboutsia species in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 evidently declined which only accounted for lower than 10 of the bacterial communities table 2 suggesting that they were not responsible for the effective metabolism of scfas and ethanol conversely some genera were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 specially petrimonas species a mesophilic fermentative genus capable of converting complex substrates to acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor grabowski et al 2005 accounted for 24 8 and 5 9 of the bacterial communities respectively table 2 study zhao and zhang 2019 in a diet based engineering scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester treating bagasse wastes also observed that petrimonas species were dominant in the communities bacillus species a facultatively anaerobic sugar degrader with thiosulfate or the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor müller et al 2015 accounted for 11 7 of the communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 table 2 the isolation of the closely related species bacillus jeotgali found that they could grow with glucose in the presence of syntrophic methanogenic partners such as methanospirillum species sporanaerobacter species a moderately thermophilic genus capable of participating in glucose metabolism in the presence of the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor hernandez eugenio et al 2002 accounted for 3 6 of the communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 table 2 study dang et al 2016 in a methanogenic digester supplemented with the conductive carbon cloth demonstrated that conductive carbon cloth could enhance the growth of sporanaerobacter species via diet with methanosarcina species remarkably the abundance of these sulfur reducing genera in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 was higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 which might be ascribed to the higher concentration of initial ethanol contained in kw after befp table 1 apart from these sulfur reducing genera some other genera that might proceed diet with methanogens were also only detected in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 sphaerochaeta species capable of reducing the soluble fe iii oxides to fe ii with the complex organic compounds as electron donors accounted for 11 1 and 8 2 of the bacterial communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 respectively ritalahti et al 2012 metagenomic analysis in a methanogenic digester treating the ethanol type fermentation substrates revealed that sphaerochaeta species were abundant metabolically active and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin zhao et al 2020a b pseudomonas species were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 table 2 study lin et al 2017 with graphene as an electron conduit demonstrated that they might be capable of proceeding diet with methanobacterium and methanospirillum species additional evidence to demonstrate that the diet based syntrophic metabolism might be established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 was the finding that methanosarcina species comprised a higher abundance of methanogenic communities table 3 methanosarcina species the second confirmed methanogens capable of accepting electrons via diet in defined co cultures rotaru et al 2014 furthermore the abundance of methanospirillum species also evidently increased in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 3 it should be pointed out that methanospirillum hungatei the closest relative of methanospirillum species were capable of producing the e pili and expressing the functional genes involved in proceeding the extracellular electron transfer walker et al 2019 4 discussion some genera capable of reducing the elemental sulfur such as petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 although their ability of electron transfer to methanogens or the carbon based conductive materials has not yet been evaluated the capability of reducing the elemental sulfur is very commonly linked to the ability of electron transfer to the fe iii oxides or electrodes lovley et al 2004 it should be pointed out that the biological electron transfer components involved in the extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides or electrodes also depend on e pili and c type cytochrome omcs lovley et al 2011 therefore it was reasonably suggested that the special enrichments petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species participated in the diet based syntrophic metabolism furthermore both sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species were abundant table 2 and also detected in our previous study zhao et al 2020a b treating the ethanol type fermentative products in that case the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species suggesting that the special enrichments equipped with e pili could proceed the interspecies electron and energy exchange via diet additional evidence to support this was that the sludge in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 exhibited a higher conductivity than that in the other digesters fig 5c which should be linked to the presence of e pili methanosarcina and methanospirillum species might directly accept the electrons via diet from the special enrichments since their abundance significantly increased table 3 they might benefit from accepting the electrons via diet because the conversion of acetate to methane yields little energy and methanosarcina species typically grow slowly on acetate de vrieze et al 2012 apart from the microbial communities both ets activity fig 5a and electrochemical response based on cv fig 5b evidently increased in the sludge of the digesters treating kw after befp with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 therefore it was reasonably suggested that ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities to enrich the precursors of diet equipped with e pili or c type cytochrome omcs and some sulfur reducing genera that proceeded syntrophic metabolism with methanogens via diet however the diet based syntrophic metabolism was not established in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw as well as kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 even if in the presence of a high concentration of ethanol after befp table 1 as a result the syntrophic oxidation of organic acids and alcohols was prevented in these digesters fig 3 this might be ascribed to the following two aspects 1 the excess acidity contained in kw after befp table 1 resulted in the initial acidic ph conditions that inhibited the metabolic activity of methanogens to directly accept electrons via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 2 commonly ethanol oxidation depends on ethanol dehydrogenase that proceeds the nadh dehydrogenase complex to cause the transmembrane gradient of na h and drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in the mitochondrial inner membrane zhao et al 2020a b the initial acidic ph conditions inhibited the activity of ethanol dehydrogenase and result in little energy yield that was insufficient to proceed diet however in the presence of moderate was it could buffer the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and maintain the methanogenic systems stable via proceeding the conversion of h to h2 fig 1c and d once the diet based syntrophic metabolism was established the methanogenic systems could effectively resist the high hydrogen partial pressure fig 1b and acidic impacts fig 1e accelerate the syntrophic oxidation of organic acids and alcohols fig 3 as well as improve the methane production fig 1a considered that was is characterized by the high buffer capacity due to its high concentration ammonia nitrogen contained a large number of studies edwards et al 2017 nghiem et al 2017 have focused on the direct acod of kw with was however this simple process improvement is insufficient to solve the major problem involved in the slow syntrophic metabolism between fermentative scfas oxidizing microorganisms and methanogens via iht as the increase of organic solids the balance of the iht based syntrophic metabolism may be easily destroyed which further limits methanogenesis dang et al 2016 although the comparative experiments on the direct acod of kw with was were not conducted in this study previous studies respectively utilizing the corn straw zhu et al 2019 and dairy wastes zhao et al 2020a b as ethanol source to enhance methanogenesis from was demonstrated that the performances in terms of methane production and sludge reduction during acod after befp were higher than that during the direct acod therefore the potential advantages of acod of kw after befp with was should include the following two aspects on the one hand kw served as ethanol source could establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism when the diet based syntrophic metabolism was established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 both methane production rate fig 1a and b methane conversion efficiency fig 2c as well as syntrophic oxidation of scfas and alcohols fig 3 were evidently increased on the other hand the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was was also enhanced to our best knowledge although acod has been widely applied in the disposal of different types of organic solids with a straightforward aim of achieving the optimum c n ratio and producing more methane siddique and wahid 2018 solé bundó et al 2019 very few study demonstrated that the degradation of the co substrates was simultaneously enhanced in this study this was primarily presented by the following two phenomenons 1 based on 3d eem the fluorescence intensity of the peak belonging to the protein like organic compounds contained in both kw and was evidently declined fig 4 2 based on the theoretical calculation the maximum methane production potential from was during acod was higher than that during sole ad considered that the special enrichments equipped with e pili sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species and some sulfur reducing genera petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species capable of directly utilizing the saccharide or protein like organic compounds it was reasonably suggested that their most likely role was to proceed the diet based syntrophic metabolism with directly utilizing the complex organic compounds contained in kw and was as electron donors 5 conclusions the study presented here proposed an effective strategy for high efficiency methanogenesis during acod of kw and was via utilizing kw as bio ethanol source to establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism the moderate was could relieve the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and keep the diet based syntrophic metabolism effective and stable meanwhile the diet based syntrophic metabolism proceeded by some special enrichments involved in some sulfur fe iii reducing genera enhanced the degradation of complex organic compounds both contained in kw and was author contributions experiments were conceived and designed by yang li zhiqiang

17993,kitchen wastes kw have been widely investigated for bio ethanol production while no study utilizes kw as ethanol source to stimulate the methanogenic communities to perform direct interspecies electron transfer diet since the excess acidity contained after the biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp can seriously inhibit the diet based syntrophic metabolism in this study a strategy that utilized waste activated sludge was as co substrate to relieve the excess acidity after befp during anaerobic co digestion acod was proposed the results showed that under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 kw was volume ratio both methane production and organic compound removal evidently increased compared with that treating the sole was conversely under the other mixed ratios sole kw 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 no methane but the evident hydrogen production was detected and syntrophic metabolism of organic acids and alcohols was prevented three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis showed that the protein like organic compounds contained in both kw and was were effectively degraded furthermore the maximum methane production potential from was during acod 260 5 4 1 and 264 3 2 7 ml g cod was higher than that treating sole was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod microbial community analysis showed that some genera capable of metabolizing the complex organic compounds with the reduction of the elemental sulfur or equipped with the electrically conductive pili were specially enriched during acod under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 they might proceed diet with methanogens such as methanosarcina and methanospirillum species to maintain the syntrophic metabolism effective and stable since the abundance of both methanosarcina and methanospirillum species evidently increased graphical abstract image 1 keywords kitchen wastes kw waste activated sludge was anaerobic co digestion acod biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp direct interspecies electron transfer diet 1 introduction effective disposal of kitchen wastes kw is an increasingly prominent issue which has some direct environmental economic and social impacts in an attempt to achieve the global food security and environmental governance li et al 2019 anaerobic digestion ad as an economic and eco friendly method has been widely applied in the disposal of kw due to its ability of converting organic substrates to methane de clercq et al 2016 li et al 2019 however the application of ad in the disposal of kw is still limited around the world for example in france based on the design parameters in a pilot project 200 t d kw capacity and 150 nm3 biogas t kw treated the expected biogas output in the pilot project should reach approximately 30000 nm3 d while the actual biogas production rate was quite low at merely 1000 nm3 d de clercq et al 2016 the primary technical bottleneck limiting the efficiency of methanogenesis is that the organic acids largely contained in kw inhibit the metabolic activities of methanogens result in the rise of hydrogen partial pressure and further prevent the syntrophic metabolism via interspecies hydrogen transfer iht therefore enhancing the syntrophic metabolism is expected to promote the more effective methanogenesis from kw establishing direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been confirmed as an effective method to promote the better syntrophic metabolism up to now two strategies have been successfully applied in the establishment of the diet based syntrophic metabolism in the methanogenic digesters one is referred to as electron transfer process control that utilizes the conductive materials as electron conduits to achieve the long range electron and energy transport between the precursors of diet equipped with the electrically conductive pili e lili or outer surface c type cytochrome omcs and methanogens although conductive materials such as granular active carbon gac biochar carbon cloth and magnetite can accelerate both the rate and efficiency of diet in the defined co cultures of geobacter with methanothrix or methanosarcina species liu et al 2012 chen et al 2014a b as well as in some mixed cultures cruz et al 2014 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 2016a b zhang and lu 2016 zhao et al 2016a b in which geobacter species are abundant with some simple organic acids and alcohols the direct use of conductive materials to enhance ad of complex organic wastes such as kw dang et al 2016 and waste activated sludge was yang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 is still limited the primary reason should be ascribed to the following two aspects 1 the precursors of diet such as geobacter species are usually rare in the conventional digesters treating the complex organic wastes dang et al 2016 peng et al 2018 2 the confirmed precursors of diet such as g metallireducens and g sulfurreducens cannot utilize the complex organic substrates with methanogens in the defined co cultures wang et al 2016 however with fe iii oxides as electron acceptors the available substrates for geobacter species are varied such as glucose glycerol and benzene lovley et al 2011 one possible reason is that with carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor the precursors of diet cannot obtain the sufficient energy during metabolizing the complex organic wastes to proceed the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 8h 8e co 2 ch 4 2h 2 o δg 0 92 7 kj mol to occur in thermodynamics another is to initially feed the methanogenic digesters with ethanol electron transfer source control zhao et al 2016a b analysis of the communities in the digesters treating propionate and butyrate found that some novel species equipped with e pili such as g bemidjiensis and g lovleyi were specially enriched zhao et al 2016a b analysis of the communities in the digesters treating the fermentative intermediates found that sphaerochaeta species were abundant metabolically active and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin zhao et al 2020a b suggesting that they held a potential of proceeding diet with methanogens to metabolize the complex organic substrates rather than the simple organic acids and alcohols unfortunately the mechanisms involved in the enrichment of these novel precursors of diet to rapidly establish the electrically connected communities are still not yet confirmed in the defined co cultures however analysis of the gene abundance found that the oxidation of ethanol motivated the succinate dehydrogenase fumarate reductase complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane of these precursors of diet to yield more energy zhao et al 2020a b which hereby promoted them to produce the biological electron transfer components of e pili and to proceed the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane smoothly fermenting the saccharide contained organic wastes to produce ethanol via the biological ethanol type fermentation pretreatment befp can be used to permanently establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism the proof of concept studies were consecutively conducted in the digesters treating some complex organic wastes such as dairy wastes zhao et al 2017 2020a b bagasse wastes zhao and zhang 2019 and corn straw zhu et al 2019 actually kw can be also served as bio ethanol source the studies hafid et al 2017 karimi and karimi 2018 on the feasibility of utilizing the kw as substrates for bio ethanol production have been conducted by several researchers however there is no investigation utilizing kw as bio ethanol source to stimulate the methanogenic communities to perform diet an important reason is that the excess acidity contained in kw after befp seriously inhibits the microbial activity and has a strong impact on the establishment of the diet based syntrophic metabolism a potential strategy for relieving the excess acidity contained in kw after befp can be conducted during anaerobic co digestion acod with a co substrate that contains the high alkalinity such as was if so it will not only establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism permanently and steadily in response to the excess acidity but potentially enhance the conversion of both kw and was to methane based on these considerations the study presented here evaluated the performances of acod of kw after befp and was the different mixture ratios of kw after befp with was were compared with the aim of clarifying the feasibility and stability of this strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 seed sludge kitchen wastes and waste activated sludge seed sludge was collected from an

tightly packed spindle and rod shaped microorganisms figs s1a and s1b see supporting information analysis of the communities fig s1c showed that the ethanol butyrate type fermentation genus megasphaera was the dominant bacteria accounting for about 20 of the communities the well known ethanol type fermentation genus ethanoligenens accounted for 10 7 of the communities they were primarily responsible for the significant production of ethanol ren et al 2007 befp was conducted in four parallel batch flow completely mixed anaerobic digesters for the 4 day experiments each of which had a working volume of 1000 ml internal diameter of 70 mm and height of 300 mm at the top of each digester a stirring rod at a speed of 30 40 rpm connected with electric motor was placed into the sludge at the beginning of befp each digester received a 700 ml of kw and a 100 ml of ethanol type fermentation inoculum the ph and operating temperature of befp was kept at 4 0 4 5 and 30 0 c respectively the change of short chain fatty acids scfas and ethanol in the digesters during the 4 day befp is shown in fig s2 see supporting information in the initial kw the concentration of ethanol was 2078 5 156 9

ethanol the main characteristics of kw after befp are displayed in table s2 see supporting information 2 3 anaerobic co digestion batch flow experiments of acod were conducted in twenty one parallel completely mixed anaerobic digesters each of which had a working volume of 800 ml internal diameter of 65 mm and height of 300 mm for the 35 day experiments each digester was equipped with a gas sampling bag and a sludge sampling port placed in a shaker at a speed of 40 50 rpm and operated at a temperature of 37 0 c at the beginning of acod each digester received a 200 ml of seed sludge and 600 ml feedstocks the volume ratio of kw after befp and was in the feedstocks was as follows sole kw 5 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 5 and sole was the main characteristics of the seed sludge mixed with feedstocks

production accumulative methane production after the 35 day experiments in the digesters treating the sole was was 187 5 15 4 ml g vss fig 1 a under the mixed ratio of 1 5 volume ratio kw was though an evident lag of methanogenesis was observed fig 1a and b due to the excess acidity in kw after befp table 1 the accumulative methane production reached 275 2 25 4 ml g vss fig 1a which was about 1 47 fold higher than that treating the sole was with the increase of the mixed ratio to 1 2 the lag of methanogenesis was more significant p 0 05 fig 1a and b but the accumulative methane production reached 314 9 23 0 ml g vss fig 1a which increased about 68 compared with treating the sole was further increase of the mixed ratio destroyed the balance of syntrophic metabolism table 1 since no methane fig 1a but an evident hydrogen fig 1c was detected in these digesters specially the accumulative hydrogen production in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 2 1 5 1 and sole kw reached 10 1 0 5 5 0 0 6 8 3 0 3 and 7 6 0 4 ml g vss respectively fig 1c and the maximum hydrogen production rate was close to 550 ml d under the mixed ratio of 5 1 fig 1b furthermore the maximum methane production rate was close to 1200 ml d under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 1b significantly higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 p 0 05 823 4 49 2 ml d as well as in the digesters treating sole was p 0 05 759 7 33 6 ml d was with the high alkalinity values might play an important role in relieving the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and keeping the methanogenic systems stable since it proceeded the conversion of h to h2 fig 1c and d and accelerated the recovery of phs fig 1e apart from the digesters under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and 1 2 the phs in the digesters with the high content kw were only recovered to 5 5 6 0 it should be pointed out that the high concentration hydrogen accumulation can easily inhibit the syntrophic metabolism via iht and then further prevent the conversion of organic acids and alcohols to methane stams and plugge 2009 however in this study the high concentration hydrogen accumulation had almost no influence on methanogenesis under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 1a and the accumulative hydrogen production even reached 13 8 0 7 ml g vss which was higher than that under the other mixed ratios fig 1b suggesting that the syntrophic metabolism was proceeded by an effective working mode of interspecies electron transfer rather than iht 3 2 organic compound removal as expected from the methane data the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 were about 6 and 18 higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and treating the sole was respectively while the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw and was under the other mixed ratios as well as treating sole kw were lower than 40 fig 2 a meanwhile the cod removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 were about 4 and 20 higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and treating the sole was respectively while the vss removal efficiencies in the digesters treating kw and was under the other mixed ratios as well as treating sole kw were all lower than 17 fig 2b after the 35 day experiments in the digesters treating the sole was the total volume of methane was 7322 8 3 4 ml 7322 8 3 4 ml 187 5 15 4 ml g vss the accumulative methane production see fig 1a 48828 1 276 3 mg l the concentration of vss see table 1 800 ml the volume of digester and the amount of cod removal was 29 2 0 1 g 29 2 g 96300 0 399 mg l the influent concentration of tcod see table 1 800 ml 59825 213 mg l the effluent concentration of tcod see fig 2b 800 ml therefore the methane production potential in these digesters treating sole was was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod 250 8 0 1 ml g cod 7322 8 3 4 ml 29 2 0 1 g it was assumed that the kw contained in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 were completely consumed to produce methane the theoretical volume maximum of methane produced from kw should be 7914 4 311 5 ml 7914 4 311 5 ml 100 ml the volume of kw 226125 8900 mg l the cod concentration of kw after befp table s2 see supporting information 350 ml g cod the theoretical maximum methane production per g cod after the 35 day experiments the actual volume of methane was 12968 5 7 3 ml 12968 5 7 3 ml 275 2 25 4 ml g vss the accumulative methane production see fig 1a 58823 5 358 9 mg l the concentration of vss see table 1 800 ml the volume of digester in the digesters treating kw and was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 therefore the theoretical volume minimum of methane produced from was was 5054 1 304 2 ml 5054 1 ml 12968 5 7 3 ml 7914 4 311 5 ml the actual amount of cod removal in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 was 42 0 0 6 g 42 0 g 98800 426 mg l the influent concentration of tcod see table 1 800 ml 46275 333 mg l the effluent concentration of tcod see fig 2b 800 ml the theoretical amount of cod removal from was was 19 4 1 5 g 19 4 1 5 g 42 0 0 6 g 100 ml 226125 0 8900 2 mg l the cod concentration of kw after befp table s2 see supporting information therefore the maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 was 260 5 4 1 ml g cod 260 5 4 1 ml g cod 5054 1 304 2 ml 19 4 1 5 g which was higher than that treating the sole was 250 8 0 1 ml g cod based on the same calculations the maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 was 264 3 2 7 ml g cod which was also higher than that treating sole was it should be pointed out that the kw contained in the digesters treating kw with was were impossibly consumed to produce methane completely since a fraction of organic compounds might be degraded to yield energy to support the growth of cells and converted to biomass or to reduce some compounds with an oxidation state such as nitrate and sulphate therefore the actual maximum methane production potential from was in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 should be higher than the theoretical values these results demonstrated that the conversion of was to methane during acod was enhanced in consistent with this based on the mass balance fig 2c the methane conversion efficiency in the digesters treating kw after befp and was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 reached 88 9 and 79 6 which was higher than that treating sole was about 24 and 15 respectively 3 3 change of scfas and alcohols ethanol and acetate were the dominant scfas and alcohols detected in the digesters treating sole kw during the 35 day experiments fig 3 a and b at the end of experiments the effluent concentration of ethanol and acetate in the digesters treating sole kw reached 15700 291 mgcod l fig 3a and 25543 2011 mgcod l fig 3b respectively especially in these digesters the effluent concentration of ethanol after the 35 day experiments was nearly same with the initial concentration of ethanol contained in kw after befp table 1 suggesting that the fermentation of alcohols into scfas was seriously inhibited conversely with the decline of the mixed ratio the effluent concentration of ethanol gradually decreased fig 3a but the effluent concentration of acetate gradually increased fig 3b at the end of experiments the effluent concentration of acetate in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 reached 20000 25000 mgcod l unlike the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 propionate fig 3c and butyrate fig 3d were evidently detected in the digesters treating kw and was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 and 1 1 specially after the 35 day experiments the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 had the highest effluent concentration of propionate 11781 780 mgcod l fig 3c and the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 had the highest effluent concentration of butyrate 33238 1826 mgcod l fig 3d suggesting that the syntrophic metabolism of propionate and butyrate was seriously limited in these digesters commonly the evident propionate accumulation is usually observed at a ph of higher than 6 0 and the evident butyrate production is usually occurred at a ph of 5 5 5 0 zhao et al 2017 consistent with this study the was contained the high alkalinity values relieved the excess acidity contained in kw which resulted that the effluent phs in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 were close to 6 0 and the effluent phs in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 1 were close to 5 5 fig 1e however under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 the scfas and ethanol in the digesters were rapidly consumed fig 3 and the phs gradually increased to more than 7 0 fig 1e at the end of experiments neither ethanol fig 3a nor acetate fig 3b was detected and both effluent concentration of propionate fig 3c and butyrate fig 3d was lower than 500 mgcod l in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 3 4 residual organic composition to compared the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was the residual organic composition in the digesters after the 35 day experiments was analyzed by 3d eem fig 4 an evident peak of fluorescence in the digesters treating sole kw fig 4a kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 fig 4b 2 1 fig 4c 1 1 fig 4d and sole was fig 4g was observed in the protein like region ex em 280 300 350 nm muller et al 2011 he et al 2013 commonly the peak of fluorescence approaching to ex em 280 350 nm belongs to the protein like organic compounds primarily contained in the meat such as bovine serum albumin bsa muller et al 2011 he et al 2013 while the peak of fluorescence approaching to ex em 280 300 belongs to the protein like organic compounds primarily contained in the biomass such as escherichia coli muller et al 2011 with the decline of the mixed ratio from 5 1 to 1 1 it was observed that the fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 350 nm gradually reduced from 1230 to 530 a u while the fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 300 gradually increased from 570 to 1150 a u fig 4b 4c and 4d the sludge in the digesters treating sole kw had the highest fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 350 nm of more than 1300 a u fig 4a and the sludge in the digesters treating sole was had the highest fluorescence intensity at ex em 280 300 of more than 1200 a u fig 4g the tendency of the fluorescence intensity at the different locations was consistent with the change of content of kw or was in the digesters since the meat like proteins were primarily contained in kw and the biomass like proteins were primarily contained in was however it should be pointed out that a peak of fluorescence at ex em 280 300 350 nm with an intensity ranging from 200 to 400 a u was detected in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 fig 4e and 1 5 fig 4f suggesting that the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was was enhanced during acod 3 5 ets activity cyclic voltammetry and sludge conductance to further clarify that the interspecies electron transfer was promoted in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 ets activity cv and sludge conductance were analyzed respectively fig 5 ets activity has been recently demonstrated as an effective indicator of interspecies electron exchange in the microbial respiration yin et al 2018 in this study the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 were lower than 10 μg ml min fig 5a the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating sole was slightly increased to 13 4 1 8 μg ml min fig 5a however the maximum ets values in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 were about 2 2 and 1 6 fold higher than that treating sole was these results suggested that the capacity of interspecies electron transfer in the sludge treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 was higher than that under the other mixed ratios activity of interspecies electron transfer was further evaluated by cv analysis fig 5b previous studies lee et al 2016 yin et al 2018 observed that the redox peaks from the cv measurements belonged to the sludge stimulated with gac or magnetite in this study an evident oxidation peak with a potential of 0 65 v that might belong to the oxidation peak of cyc2 was only observed in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 cyc2 an outer membrane cytochrome c type protein is usually served as an electron carrier to participate in microbial fe iii fe ii transformation bird et al 2011 furthermore a slight reduction peak with a potential of 0 21 v that might belong to the reduction peak of omcs was only observed in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 and 1 2 omcs is an important biological electron transfer components involved in extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides electrodes as well as methanogens summers et al 2010 these results suggested that the sludge in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 were more metabolically active in interspecies electron transfer than that under the other mixed ratios further study was to clarify that the potential diet based syntrophic metabolism was established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 via conductance measurements fig 5c the aggregates with a high electrically conductance have been considered as an important evidence in recent studies morita et al 2011 zhao et al 2016a b 2017 to indicate the diet based microbial communities study summers et al 2010 in the defined co cultures of two geobacter species demonstrated that the mechanism involved in the electrical aggregates was that geobacter species facilitated diet via their e pili to form the electrical networks in this study the high conductance sludge was only observed in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 15 7 2 2 us cm and 1 5 11 4 0 8 us cm while the conductivity of the sludge in the other digesters was lower than 5 0 us cm these results suggested that the precursors of diet equipped with e pili might be specially enriched to proceed the diet based syntrophic metabolism in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 3 6 microbial community structure the primary genera detected in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 belonged to the typical fermentative bacteria such as rhodococcus lactobacillus clostridium haloimpatiens and romboutsia species table 2 which accounted for about 50 90 of the bacterial communities with the decline of the mixed ratio to 1 1 the abundance of rhodococcus species gradually decreased from 70 9 to 9 3 in the digesters table 2 the trend was quite consistent with the gradually reduced concentration of ethanol in these digesters at the end of experiments fig 3a suggesting that rhodococcus species played an important role in the fermentation of complex organic compounds to ethanol unlike rhodococcus species with the decline of the mixed ratio to 1 1 the abundance of clostridium and romboutsia species gradually increased from 0 4 to 12 7 and 2 5 36 5 in the digesters respectively table 2 the trend was quite consistent with the gradually increased concentration of butyrate in these digesters at the end of experiments fig 3d suggesting that clostridium and romboutsia species played an important role in the fermentation of complex organic compounds to butyrate accompanied by the release of hydrogen fig 1b lactobacillus species were only detected in the digesters treating sole kw with a relative abundance of 19 8 while haloimpatiens species were only detected in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 2 1 and 1 1 table 2 it should be pointed out that the effluent phs in the digesters treating sole kw and kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 were nearly same close to 5 5 fig 1e indicating that the effluent phs were not the primary factor influencing the bacterial communities in these digesters therefore lactobacillus species might primarily participate in the conversion of ethanol into acetate and haloimpatiens species were primarily responsible for propionate and butyrate fermentation the abundance of rhodococcus lactobacillus clostridium haloimpatiens and romboutsia species in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 evidently declined which only accounted for lower than 10 of the bacterial communities table 2 suggesting that they were not responsible for the effective metabolism of scfas and ethanol conversely some genera were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 specially petrimonas species a mesophilic fermentative genus capable of converting complex substrates to acetate hydrogen and carbon dioxide with the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor grabowski et al 2005 accounted for 24 8 and 5 9 of the bacterial communities respectively table 2 study zhao and zhang 2019 in a diet based engineering scale up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester treating bagasse wastes also observed that petrimonas species were dominant in the communities bacillus species a facultatively anaerobic sugar degrader with thiosulfate or the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor müller et al 2015 accounted for 11 7 of the communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 table 2 the isolation of the closely related species bacillus jeotgali found that they could grow with glucose in the presence of syntrophic methanogenic partners such as methanospirillum species sporanaerobacter species a moderately thermophilic genus capable of participating in glucose metabolism in the presence of the elemental sulfur as an electron acceptor hernandez eugenio et al 2002 accounted for 3 6 of the communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 table 2 study dang et al 2016 in a methanogenic digester supplemented with the conductive carbon cloth demonstrated that conductive carbon cloth could enhance the growth of sporanaerobacter species via diet with methanosarcina species remarkably the abundance of these sulfur reducing genera in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 was higher than that under the mixed ratio of 1 5 which might be ascribed to the higher concentration of initial ethanol contained in kw after befp table 1 apart from these sulfur reducing genera some other genera that might proceed diet with methanogens were also only detected in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 sphaerochaeta species capable of reducing the soluble fe iii oxides to fe ii with the complex organic compounds as electron donors accounted for 11 1 and 8 2 of the bacterial communities in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 respectively ritalahti et al 2012 metagenomic analysis in a methanogenic digester treating the ethanol type fermentation substrates revealed that sphaerochaeta species were abundant metabolically active and most importantly transcribed genes coding for e pilin zhao et al 2020a b pseudomonas species were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 5 table 2 study lin et al 2017 with graphene as an electron conduit demonstrated that they might be capable of proceeding diet with methanobacterium and methanospirillum species additional evidence to demonstrate that the diet based syntrophic metabolism might be established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 was the finding that methanosarcina species comprised a higher abundance of methanogenic communities table 3 methanosarcina species the second confirmed methanogens capable of accepting electrons via diet in defined co cultures rotaru et al 2014 furthermore the abundance of methanospirillum species also evidently increased in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 3 it should be pointed out that methanospirillum hungatei the closest relative of methanospirillum species were capable of producing the e pili and expressing the functional genes involved in proceeding the extracellular electron transfer walker et al 2019 4 discussion some genera capable of reducing the elemental sulfur such as petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species were specially enriched in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 table 2 although their ability of electron transfer to methanogens or the carbon based conductive materials has not yet been evaluated the capability of reducing the elemental sulfur is very commonly linked to the ability of electron transfer to the fe iii oxides or electrodes lovley et al 2004 it should be pointed out that the biological electron transfer components involved in the extracellular electron transfer to fe iii oxides or electrodes also depend on e pili and c type cytochrome omcs lovley et al 2011 therefore it was reasonably suggested that the special enrichments petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species participated in the diet based syntrophic metabolism furthermore both sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species were abundant table 2 and also detected in our previous study zhao et al 2020a b treating the ethanol type fermentative products in that case the gene for plia was primarily derived from sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species suggesting that the special enrichments equipped with e pili could proceed the interspecies electron and energy exchange via diet additional evidence to support this was that the sludge in the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 exhibited a higher conductivity than that in the other digesters fig 5c which should be linked to the presence of e pili methanosarcina and methanospirillum species might directly accept the electrons via diet from the special enrichments since their abundance significantly increased table 3 they might benefit from accepting the electrons via diet because the conversion of acetate to methane yields little energy and methanosarcina species typically grow slowly on acetate de vrieze et al 2012 apart from the microbial communities both ets activity fig 5a and electrochemical response based on cv fig 5b evidently increased in the sludge of the digesters treating kw after befp with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 therefore it was reasonably suggested that ethanol stimulated the methanogenic communities to enrich the precursors of diet equipped with e pili or c type cytochrome omcs and some sulfur reducing genera that proceeded syntrophic metabolism with methanogens via diet however the diet based syntrophic metabolism was not established in the sludge of the digesters treating sole kw as well as kw with was under the mixed ratio of 5 1 2 1 and 1 1 even if in the presence of a high concentration of ethanol after befp table 1 as a result the syntrophic oxidation of organic acids and alcohols was prevented in these digesters fig 3 this might be ascribed to the following two aspects 1 the excess acidity contained in kw after befp table 1 resulted in the initial acidic ph conditions that inhibited the metabolic activity of methanogens to directly accept electrons via diet for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane 2 commonly ethanol oxidation depends on ethanol dehydrogenase that proceeds the nadh dehydrogenase complex to cause the transmembrane gradient of na h and drives the atpase to catalyze the conversion of adp to atp in the mitochondrial inner membrane zhao et al 2020a b the initial acidic ph conditions inhibited the activity of ethanol dehydrogenase and result in little energy yield that was insufficient to proceed diet however in the presence of moderate was it could buffer the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and maintain the methanogenic systems stable via proceeding the conversion of h to h2 fig 1c and d once the diet based syntrophic metabolism was established the methanogenic systems could effectively resist the high hydrogen partial pressure fig 1b and acidic impacts fig 1e accelerate the syntrophic oxidation of organic acids and alcohols fig 3 as well as improve the methane production fig 1a considered that was is characterized by the high buffer capacity due to its high concentration ammonia nitrogen contained a large number of studies edwards et al 2017 nghiem et al 2017 have focused on the direct acod of kw with was however this simple process improvement is insufficient to solve the major problem involved in the slow syntrophic metabolism between fermentative scfas oxidizing microorganisms and methanogens via iht as the increase of organic solids the balance of the iht based syntrophic metabolism may be easily destroyed which further limits methanogenesis dang et al 2016 although the comparative experiments on the direct acod of kw with was were not conducted in this study previous studies respectively utilizing the corn straw zhu et al 2019 and dairy wastes zhao et al 2020a b as ethanol source to enhance methanogenesis from was demonstrated that the performances in terms of methane production and sludge reduction during acod after befp were higher than that during the direct acod therefore the potential advantages of acod of kw after befp with was should include the following two aspects on the one hand kw served as ethanol source could establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism when the diet based syntrophic metabolism was established in the sludge of the digesters treating kw with was under the mixed ratio of 1 2 and 1 5 both methane production rate fig 1a and b methane conversion efficiency fig 2c as well as syntrophic oxidation of scfas and alcohols fig 3 were evidently increased on the other hand the degradation of complex organic compounds contained in both kw and was was also enhanced to our best knowledge although acod has been widely applied in the disposal of different types of organic solids with a straightforward aim of achieving the optimum c n ratio and producing more methane siddique and wahid 2018 solé bundó et al 2019 very few study demonstrated that the degradation of the co substrates was simultaneously enhanced in this study this was primarily presented by the following two phenomenons 1 based on 3d eem the fluorescence intensity of the peak belonging to the protein like organic compounds contained in both kw and was evidently declined fig 4 2 based on the theoretical calculation the maximum methane production potential from was during acod was higher than that during sole ad considered that the special enrichments equipped with e pili sphaerochaeta and pseudomonas species and some sulfur reducing genera petrimonas bacillus and sporanaerobacter species capable of directly utilizing the saccharide or protein like organic compounds it was reasonably suggested that their most likely role was to proceed the diet based syntrophic metabolism with directly utilizing the complex organic compounds contained in kw and was as electron donors 5 conclusions the study presented here proposed an effective strategy for high efficiency methanogenesis during acod of kw and was via utilizing kw as bio ethanol source to establish the diet based syntrophic metabolism the moderate was could relieve the excess acidity contained in kw after befp and keep the diet based syntrophic metabolism effective and stable meanwhile the diet based syntrophic metabolism proceeded by some special enrichments involved in some sulfur fe iii reducing genera enhanced the degradation of complex organic compounds both contained in kw and was author contributions experiments were conceived and designed by yang li zhiqiang

17994,hydroxyl radical ho in natural waters plays a critical role in contaminant transformation and ecosystem health in this study the photogeneration and steady state concentration of ho in different aquatic environments e g river and lake along the middle lower yangtze region china were evaluated the results showed that compared to lake samples the river waters were characterized by lower ho photoformation rate r ho 5 10 11 69 10 11 vs 1 10 1 82 10 10 m s 1 and steady state ho concentration ho 1 76 3 11 10 17 vs 2 50 10 33 10 17 m the contribution of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters was generally higher than that in lake waters and photolysis of nitrite exhibited contributions 1 2 times higher than those of nitrate 0 25 vs 0 9 irrespective of sample types as a result the photosensitization by chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contributed more than 70 of the total r ho for all samples except for river ganjiang ho among all samples was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and the doc normalized ho was further related to the physicochemical properties of cdom samples e g aromaticity humification and molecular weight the humic like aromatic substances with low molecular weight were the controlling factors influencing ho in the studied surface waters the results contributed to a deeper understanding of behaviors and fate of aquatic doms in terms of ho formation and contaminant attenuation graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroxyl radical river and lake waters dissolved organic matter photoformation rate state steady concentration 1 introduction surface water pollution especially for the organic contaminants has received continuing attention due to the potential risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health meffe and de bustamante 2014 abundance of organic contaminants in some industry and agriculture affected surface waters usually ranged from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter yan et al 2015 kim et al 2018 attenuation of organic contaminants in waters may occur via biotic and or abiotic processes including microbial degradation adsorption volatilisation and photolysis wang et al 2017 there are two mechanisms responsible for the photolysis of organic contaminants in waters direct and indirect photolysis direct photolysis represents the degradation of organic compounds via photon absorption while indirect photolysis refers to degradation of compounds through reaction with the photochemically formed transient species such as hydroxyl radical ho singlet oxygen triplet state dissolved organic matter and hydrogen peroxide dong and rosario ortiz 2012 wang et al 2017 among these intermediates ho receives the utmost attention due to its high efficiency and non selective reactivity toward the contaminants ho in waters derives mainly from photochemical processes such as photolysis of inorganic compounds e g nitrate and nitrite and photosensitization of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom although oxygenation of anoxic waters can also produce ho lee et al 2013 tong et al 2016 the precise formation rate of ho in natural waters is highly dependent on the meteorological conditions e g irradiation intensity and time and chemical compositions of water samples for this reason the formation rates of ho were previously found to span a large range from 10 12 10 11 m s 1 for surface waters and rainwater albinet et al 2010 timko et al 2014 to 10 11 10 10 m s 1 for wastewater effluents and groundwater vione et al 2006 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 it was also reported that when the ratio of no3 dom was lower than 3 3 10 5 molno3 mgc photosensitization of cdom would be the prevailing ho source vione et al 2006 however this value was highly dependent on sample types dong and rosario ortiz 2012 the photochemically formed ho can be trapped by the naturally occurring scavengers including carbonate bicarbonate and dom vione et al 2006 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 the combined reactions of photogeneration and scavenging resulted in a steady state ho concentration ho which was in the range of 10 18 10 15 m in natural waters minero et al 2007 timko et al 2014 although effects of various scavengers on ho reactions had been widely studied dom should be the main factor responsible for the variations in ho for a given ecosystem due to its sensitivity and variability in natural waters zhou et al 2016 xu et al 2018a despite the evident contribution information on the relationship between ho and the inherent properties of dom is still to be conclusively assessed dom in waters is composed of a variety of organic components e g humic substances proteins lignins and carbohydrates and characterized by continuous molecular weight distribution properties e g 1 kdã0 45 μm kellerman et al 2014 xu and guo 2017 previous studies showed that ho decreased along the estuarine salinity gradient with the decline of fluorescent and chromophoric dom timko et al 2014 and the low molecular weight cdom can exhibit a high lee et al 2013 or low zhu et al 2017 photochemical potential as compared to the high molecular weight counterparts this inconsistency would be due to the fact that these results were obtained in just one kind of ecosystems lacking a general conclusion for some contrasting sample types therefore studies on the correlation between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom among various samples in different ecosystems are of vital importance to aid in understanding the source and ecological role of both dom and ho in aquatic ecosystems to solve this a total of eleven surface water samples including river and lake waters were collected along the middle lower yangtze region china this region was characterized by sufficient sunlight but high abundance of organic contaminants was recently detected in surface waters due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization processes pan and you 2010 the objectives of this study were thus to 1 compare the photogeneration rate and ho in different aquatic ecosystems i e river and lake waters along the middle lower yangtze region china 2 quantify the contribution of various chemical components e g nitrate nitrite and cdom to ho formation from different waters 3 reveal the correlation between ho and inherent cdom properties among all samples given the fact that river waters are usually poured into lakes detailed information is needed on the variability in source and abundance of ho and their impacts on the removal of organic contaminants in the surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of eleven water samples including six river samples middle yangtze river lower yangtze river qinghuai river wangyu river jiuli river ganjiang river and five lake samples lake chaohu lake xuanwu meiliang bay of lake taihu east taihu lake changdang along the middle lower yangtze region in china were collected during the period from september 2018 to january 2019 fig 1 for each sampling site the surface water samples were collected using the pre cleaned hdpe bottles kept in ice inside a cooler and transported to the lab as soon as possible the collected samples were then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane cellulose esters shanghai xinya purification equipment co td to remove the particles followed by the ph determination sartorius germany 2 2 photochemical irradiation of surface waters the photogeneration experiments of ho in the river and lake waters were conducted in a xpa photoreaction apparatus nanjing xujiang machine electronic plant equipped with a 500 w xenon lamp to simulate the sunlight spectrum du et al 2014 the concentration of ho was quantified based on the formation of phenol via reaction between ho and benzene despite the health hazards as well as volatility benzene was widely used in ho quantification due to its evident advantages such as the rapid reaction rate with ho non absorption of lamp radiation and non disturbance of solution ph takeda et al 2004 the water samples were spiked with different concentrations of benzene and irradiated at room temperature with lamp emission power of 1 5 w m2 in the wavelength interval of 290 400 nm and a total irradiation time of 24 h the total volume and optical path of the irradiated solutions were 50 ml and 2 6 cm respectively during the incubation time series samples were collected at 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h to calculate the rho dark experiments with the probes added were wrapped with aluminum foil and placed inside the photoreaction apparatus and no obvious biotic transformation was observed 2 3 calculation of the formation rate and steady state concentration of ho in this study the calculation of r ho and ho was proceeded based on the previously reported method that was used for natural water samples vione et al 2006 the photoformed ho was quantified via the transformation reaction of benzene into phenol 1 benzene ho phenol here d phenol dt 0 70 k b benzene ho k b is the second order rate constant for the reaction between benzene and ho 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 0 70 is the yield of phenol for the transformation reaction carena et al 2017 the ho is the results of photogeneration and scavengering under the steady state conditions 2 d ho dt 0 r ho i k si ho s i k b ho

characterized by rate constant k si for reaction with ho in this study the highest concentration of benzene e g 2 mm was at least two orders of magnitude higher than those of the naturally present scavengers dong and rosario ortiz 2012 which meant that i k si s i k b benzene therefore the r ho and ho for the studied samples can be obtained as follows 5 r h o 1 0 70 d phenol dt 6 ho 1 0 70 k b

the parameter slope275 295 which is inversely related to the molecular weight of dom was obtained via the linear fitting of the natural log absorption spectra within 275 295 nm helms et al 2008

500 nm the increments of em and ex wavelengths were 2 nm and 10 nm respectively fluorescence parameters including fluorescence index fix the ratio of fluorescence intensities between em 450 and 500 nm at ex 370 nm and humification index hix the area under the em 435 480 nm divided by the peak area under the em 300 345 435 480 nm at ex 254 nm were obtained accordingly devilbiss et al 2016 the concentrations of inorganic ions such as nitrates and nitrites were obtained following the standard spectrophotometric method apha 1998 while those of carbonates and bicarbonates were not determined though they may also affect the photochemistry process the significance of data differences between different sample sets was tested using one way anova tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 the water quality and physicochemical properties of collected samples the quality parameters for the collected river and lake samples are presented in table 1 all the studied samples were characterized by a low to medium abundance of organic matter with the doc range within 2 03 0 12 7 67 0 31 mg l nitrate in these waters exhibited a large variation in abundance and its concentration in river waters 58 8 0 1 109 5 1 6 μm was significantly p 0 01 higher than that in lake samples 3 3 0 2 51 3 0 3 μm high nitrate concentration in the rivers would be due to the accumulation of point or non point source runoff combined with the weak denitrification wankel et al 2006 nitrite in these samples ranging from 0 03 0 01 to 3 41 0 02 μm was two orders of magnitude lower than nitrate which is consistent with other surface water samples takeda et al 2004 the fluorescent spectroscopy results showed that regardless of water types all collected samples contained evident humic and fulvic like substances fig 2 chen et al 2003 devilbiss et al 2016 low fix 1 26 1 53 but high hix 0 79 0 89 suggested that dom in these samples was characterized by terrestrial origin and had a high degree of humification as for the absorption spectra the intensities of all samples decreased quasi exponentially along the wavelength range the values of suva254 ranged from 2 59 7 23 l mg c m showing aromatic properties for these samples that were obviously different from the wastewater effluent e g 2 2 l mg c m dong and rosario ortiz 2012 further analysis showed that the river waters had generally lower hix 0 79 0 86 vs 0 85 0 89 and suva254 2 59 4 63 vs 4 00 7 23 than lake samples the results indicated richness of photodegraded components and or absence of in situ produced aromatic dom within river waters which disagrees with previous data showing high aromaticity for river samples xu and guo 2017 the likely reason for the discrepancy could be due to the fact that samples in this study were collected during the drought period november to january which meant a negligible influence of surface runoff and leaching and thus a high photobleaching efficiency for river waters in addition the values of slope275 295 were in the range of 0 0083 0 0184 demonstrating a wide molecular weight distribution among these water samples 3 2 the formation rate of ho from natural waters upon irradiation fig 3 depicts as an example the time dependent formation of phenol upon irradiation of the samples from lake chaohu fig 3a and river ganjiang fig 3c spiked with different concentrations of benzene the phenol formation for other samples can be seen in the supporting information si the concentration of photochemically formed phenol increased with increasing benzene concentration and irradiation time the initial formation rate of phenol at each benzene concentration can be obtained via the calculation of the slope of the time dependent fitting lines fig 3b and d shows the initial formation rate of phenol at various benzene concentrations the curve can be fitted via the following equation d phenol dt a c benzene b c benzene the horizontal line shows the formation rate of phenol at elevated benzene which was used to calculate r ho vione et al 2006 in this study the r oh for all samples ranged from 5 10 10 11 to 1 82 10 10 m s 1 which were comparable to those of other surface waters such as ohta river in japan 0 56 2 64 10 11 m s 1 takeda et al 2004 and some lakes in italy 0 69 5 9 10 11 m s 1 with low nitrate 100 μm vione et al 2006 however they were obviously lower compared to the groundwater 4 62 6 25 10 10 m s 1 vione et al 2006 and wastewater effluents 2 3 3 8 10 10 m s 1 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 that contained high nitrate level e g 450 681 μm for groundwater and 290 710 μm for wastewater respectively further analysis showed that although river waters contained higher nitrate abundance the values of r ho 5 10 11 69 10 11 m s 1 were evidently lower than those of lake samples 1 10 1 82 10 10 m s 1 the heterogeneity may indicate that the photoactivity of cdom in river waters was lower than those in lake waters or that the inorganic nitrate in surface waters was not the main source for ho generation moreover the lamp output applied in this study was 1 5 w m2 which was one to two orders of magnitude lower than those used in previous studies e g 22 w m2 for lee et al 2013 to obtain the irradiation intensity independent formation rates the overall r ho values were normalized by the lamp output the resulting r ho values calculated herein were thus comparable to the wastewater and groundwater but slightly higher compared to other surface waters vione et al 2006 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 3 contribution of the chemical components of water samples to the photogeneration of ho 3 3 1 ho formation from photolysis of inorganic nitrates and nitrites as known the photogeneration of ho in waters originates mainly from nitrate nitrite and cdom de laurentiis et al 2013 lee et al 2013 in order to quantify the contribution of inorganic nitrates to ho formation solutions containing different concentrations of nitrate 5 120 μm in ultrapure water were additionally irradiated at elevated benzene concentration i e 2 mm with the results depicted in fig 4 the formation rate of ho increased with increasing nitrate concentration showing an evident role of nitrate in ho generation the normalized r ho was calculated as 5 15 10 8 m s 1 mno3 1 which was slightly lower than previously reported values e g 1 7 10 7 m s 1 mno3 1 for minero et al 2007 partially due to the low irradiation intensity applied in this study according to the nitrate concentrations detected in waters table 1 it was possible to quantify the contribution of nitrate to ho generation η no3 i e η no3 no3 slope r ho vs no3 r ho in this study nitrate induced r ho for all samples ranged from 0 28 10 12 m s 1 to 5 45 10 12 m s 1 the contribution of nitrate induced r ho to the overall r ho ranged from negligible 1 to about 9 table 1 indicating that nitrate was not the prevailing source of ho in the studied samples vione et al 2006 further analysis showed that the nitrate induced contribution in river waters was generally higher compared to lake samples 2 79 8 75 vs 0 12 1 93 the difference should be attributed to the high nitrate abundance in river waters table 1 the contribution of nitrite to ho photogeneration was obtained using the same irradiation conditions but with variable nitrite concentrations 0 02 3 μm the normalized r ho derived from nitrite photolysis was 5 08 10 6 m s 1 mno2 1 which was 99 times higher as compared to nitrate photolysis therefore although nitrite in surface waters is usually characterized by extremely low concentration table 1 a 1 1 m basis nitrite was about 102 times more effective than nitrate at producing ho based on the nitrite concentration of water samples the r ho values derived from nitrite photolysis in all samples were 0 15 17 20 10 12 m s 1 which accounted for 0 65 24 84 and 0 14 5 19 of the total rho in the river and lake samples respectively overall the contributions of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters were generally higher than in lake waters and the photolysis of nitrite exhibited contribution 1 2 times higher than that of nitrate irrespective of sample types 3 3 2 ho formation from sensitization of organic matter the contribution of cdom photosensitization to r ho was obtained by subtracting those of nitrate and nitrite photolysis from the overall r ho it was shown that except for river ganjiang that had low doc but high nitrate and nitrite the photosensitization process accounted for more than 70 of the total r ho table 1 indicating that cdom was a prevailing ho source the results agreed with previously reported surface waters such as seawater takeda et al 2004 and lake waters minero et al 2007 as for the sample dependent differences contribution of the photosensitization process in river waters was generally lower compared to lake samples 66 41 96 56 vs 92 88 99 71 the low photosensitization contribution in river water samples was due to the higher molar ratio of no3 no2 to dom in which case inorganic nitrogen compounds played a non negligible role as ho sources vione et al 2006 3 4 the steady state ho concentration in various surface waters based on the fitting curve of benzene dependent profiles of r ho fig 3b and d the slope of the blue line represents lim benzene 0 d phenol dt benzene 1 which was used to calculated the oh vione et al 2006 among all samples the ho ranged from 1 74 10 17 m for waters low in doc with high nitrate such as rivers qinghuai and jiuli to 1 03 10 16 m for waters high in doc with low nitrate such as lake chaohu the river waters were generally characterized by lower ho than the lake samples the values of ho obtained herein were one to two orders of magnitude lower than for other surface waters 7 9 34 0 10 17 m vione et al 2006 which were ascribed to the relatively low irradiation and ratios of doc to nitrate for the samples collected to eliminate the influence of different organic carbon concentrations the ho obtained was normalized by doc the resulting normalized ho were thus in the range of 6 61 13 46 10 18 m mg c l which were comparable to other surface waters such as rivers harney and taylor america 1 8 10 18 m mg c l timko et al 2014 in addition the φ values for all river and lake samples ranged from 3 63 to 18 30 10 4 indicating the efficiency of these samples in the photochemical formation of ho which were comparable to those from effluent organic matters dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 5 correlation between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom samples as depicted above the prevailing contribution to ho formation originated from the photosensitization of cdom in the samples to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing ho in natural waters the correlations between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom samples were explored with the results shown in fig 5 the ho was positively correlated with doc concentration for all water samples testifying that cdom was the main source for ho photogeneration further analysis showed that besides the total abundance the physicochemical properties of cdom samples also exhibited obvious effects on ho to eliminate the influence of different organic carbon abundance the cdom derived ho obtained herein was normalized by doc concentration to assure that the correlation was derived merely from the inherent properties of cdom samples following this the doc normalized ho was positively correlated with the suva254 r 2 0 85 and hix r 2 0 65 indicating that aromaticity and humification of cdom samples contributed significantly to ho in natural waters meanwhile the doc normalized ho was also found to positively correlate with slope275 295 r 2 0 64 since the parameter slope275 295 was inversely related to molecular weight the results suggest that the molecular weights of cdom samples were negatively correlated with ho in natural waters lee and co workers also found that the lower molecular weight fraction within effluent organic matters had a greater yield of ho lee et al 2013 our previous studies showed that the low molecular weight lmw fraction within the dom pool in natural waters contained high abundance of humic and fulvic like substances whereas the high molecular weight hmw counterpart consisted mainly of soluble microbial products such as proteins and polysaccharides xu and guo 2017 presence of humic fulvic like substances was responsible for the high ho due to its intrinsic chromophoric properties lee et al 2013 in addition compared to the lmw moieties the hmw counterparts undergo usually charge transfer interactions which can quench the excited states and thus decrease the photoactivity dalrymple et al 2010 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 6 significance of this study ho in natural waters plays a critical role in the biogeochemical cycle of dom and the ecological health of the aquatic environment previous studies on ho were focused mainly on the source e g light irradiation or sunlight independent and concentration in a specific ecosystem page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 in this study a direct comparison of cdom nitrate and nitrite derived r ho and ho was carried out in different ecosystems river and lake along the middle lower yangtze region china more importantly the correlation between ho level and the inherent physicochemical properties of cdom was evaluated to our knowledge this is the first study simultaneously probing into the source abundance and influencing factors of ho in different surface waters results obtained can provide a deeper understanding of the behavior and fate of contaminants and dom in natural waters as widely reported presence of ho has evident influence on degradation of organic contaminants matzek and carter 2016 hou et al 2017 to better understand the meaning of the calculated ho levels in contaminant degradation the half life of the herbicide acetochlor due to reaction with ho was calculated via the equation t 1 2 ln2 k a ho ho where k a ho 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant for reaction of acetochlor with ho brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 this model contaminant was widely used in previous studies due to its reasonably elevated rate constant with ho brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 vione et al 2006 although the direct photolysis usually accounted for a considerable contribution to the overall degradation zeng and arnold 2013 remucal 2014 according to the ho obtained the t 1 2 ranged from 6 26 days for lake waters to 21 37 days for river samples table 1 showing enhanced degradation efficiency and decreased half life of recalcitrant compounds for lake waters it is known that the rivers waters containing organic contaminants are usually poured into the lakes the results obtained herein therefore suggested that the organic contaminants contained in rivers discharging into lake waters should receive more attention due to the lower ho of river samples although the precise molecular weight and functional groups within the dom pool were not measured this study definitely showed that the humic and fulvic like substances with low molecular weight play a very important role in controlling the ho level in natural waters some direct procedure for molecular weight fractionation such as cross flow ultrafiltration guo and santschi 2007 xu et al 2018b should be used to testify this correlation in future studies in addition since ho in water samples significantly influences the photochemical degradation process and potential this study is also expected to aid in the understanding of how the composition properties of dom samples affect the removal of organic contaminants from surface waters 4 conclusions compared to the lake waters the river samples were characterized by comparable doc abundance higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations but lower r ho and ho the contributions of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters were generally higher than those in lake waters and photolysis of nitrite exhibited a 1 2 times higher contribution compared to nitrate regardless of sample types except for river ganjiang the photosensitization of cdom accounted for more than 70 of the total r ho with the percentage in river waters that was generally lower than in lake samples among all samples there was a positive correlation between ho and doc and the doc normalized ho values were positively correlated with the aromaticity and humification but negatively related to the molecular weight of cdom samples therefore the river and lake samples along middle lower yangtze region china showed obvious variabilities in terms of r ho and ho but a consistent correlation with the quantity and quality of cdom samples the results allow for a deeper understanding of the behavior and fate of dom and its influence on contaminant attenuation in aquatic environments declaration of

17994,hydroxyl radical ho in natural waters plays a critical role in contaminant transformation and ecosystem health in this study the photogeneration and steady state concentration of ho in different aquatic environments e g river and lake along the middle lower yangtze region china were evaluated the results showed that compared to lake samples the river waters were characterized by lower ho photoformation rate r ho 5 10 11 69 10 11 vs 1 10 1 82 10 10 m s 1 and steady state ho concentration ho 1 76 3 11 10 17 vs 2 50 10 33 10 17 m the contribution of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters was generally higher than that in lake waters and photolysis of nitrite exhibited contributions 1 2 times higher than those of nitrate 0 25 vs 0 9 irrespective of sample types as a result the photosensitization by chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom contributed more than 70 of the total r ho for all samples except for river ganjiang ho among all samples was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and the doc normalized ho was further related to the physicochemical properties of cdom samples e g aromaticity humification and molecular weight the humic like aromatic substances with low molecular weight were the controlling factors influencing ho in the studied surface waters the results contributed to a deeper understanding of behaviors and fate of aquatic doms in terms of ho formation and contaminant attenuation graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydroxyl radical river and lake waters dissolved organic matter photoformation rate state steady concentration 1 introduction surface water pollution especially for the organic contaminants has received continuing attention due to the potential risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health meffe and de bustamante 2014 abundance of organic contaminants in some industry and agriculture affected surface waters usually ranged from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter yan et al 2015 kim et al 2018 attenuation of organic contaminants in waters may occur via biotic and or abiotic processes including microbial degradation adsorption volatilisation and photolysis wang et al 2017 there are two mechanisms responsible for the photolysis of organic contaminants in waters direct and indirect photolysis direct photolysis represents the degradation of organic compounds via photon absorption while indirect photolysis refers to degradation of compounds through reaction with the photochemically formed transient species such as hydroxyl radical ho singlet oxygen triplet state dissolved organic matter and hydrogen peroxide dong and rosario ortiz 2012 wang et al 2017 among these intermediates ho receives the utmost attention due to its high efficiency and non selective reactivity toward the contaminants ho in waters derives mainly from photochemical processes such as photolysis of inorganic compounds e g nitrate and nitrite and photosensitization of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom although oxygenation of anoxic waters can also produce ho lee et al 2013 tong et al 2016 the precise formation rate of ho in natural waters is highly dependent on the meteorological conditions e g irradiation intensity and time and chemical compositions of water samples for this reason the formation rates of ho were previously found to span a large range from 10 12 10 11 m s 1 for surface waters and rainwater albinet et al 2010 timko et al 2014 to 10 11 10 10 m s 1 for wastewater effluents and groundwater vione et al 2006 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 it was also reported that when the ratio of no3 dom was lower than 3 3 10 5 molno3 mgc photosensitization of cdom would be the prevailing ho source vione et al 2006 however this value was highly dependent on sample types dong and rosario ortiz 2012 the photochemically formed ho can be trapped by the naturally occurring scavengers including carbonate bicarbonate and dom vione et al 2006 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 the combined reactions of photogeneration and scavenging resulted in a steady state ho concentration ho which was in the range of 10 18 10 15 m in natural waters minero et al 2007 timko et al 2014 although effects of various scavengers on ho reactions had been widely studied dom should be the main factor responsible for the variations in ho for a given ecosystem due to its sensitivity and variability in natural waters zhou et al 2016 xu et al 2018a despite the evident contribution information on the relationship between ho and the inherent properties of dom is still to be conclusively assessed dom in waters is composed of a variety of organic components e g humic substances proteins lignins and carbohydrates and characterized by continuous molecular weight distribution properties e g 1 kdã0 45 μm kellerman et al 2014 xu and guo 2017 previous studies showed that ho decreased along the estuarine salinity gradient with the decline of fluorescent and chromophoric dom timko et al 2014 and the low molecular weight cdom can exhibit a high lee et al 2013 or low zhu et al 2017 photochemical potential as compared to the high molecular weight counterparts this inconsistency would be due to the fact that these results were obtained in just one kind of ecosystems lacking a general conclusion for some contrasting sample types therefore studies on the correlation between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom among various samples in different ecosystems are of vital importance to aid in understanding the source and ecological role of both dom and ho in aquatic ecosystems to solve this a total of eleven surface water samples including river and lake waters were collected along the middle lower yangtze region china this region was characterized by sufficient sunlight but high abundance of organic contaminants was recently detected in surface waters due to the rapid urbanization and industrialization processes pan and you 2010 the objectives of this study were thus to 1 compare the photogeneration rate and ho in different aquatic ecosystems i e river and lake waters along the middle lower yangtze region china 2 quantify the contribution of various chemical components e g nitrate nitrite and cdom to ho formation from different waters 3 reveal the correlation between ho and inherent cdom properties among all samples given the fact that river waters are usually poured into lakes detailed information is needed on the variability in source and abundance of ho and their impacts on the removal of organic contaminants in the surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of eleven water samples including six river samples middle yangtze river lower yangtze river qinghuai river wangyu river jiuli river ganjiang river and five lake samples lake chaohu lake xuanwu meiliang bay of lake taihu east taihu lake changdang along the middle lower yangtze region in china were collected during the period from september 2018 to january 2019 fig 1 for each sampling site the surface water samples were collected using the pre cleaned hdpe bottles kept in ice inside a cooler and transported to the lab as soon as possible the collected samples were then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane cellulose esters shanghai xinya purification equipment co td to remove the particles followed by the ph determination sartorius germany 2 2 photochemical irradiation of surface waters the photogeneration experiments of ho in the river and lake waters were conducted in a xpa photoreaction apparatus nanjing xujiang machine electronic plant equipped with a 500 w xenon lamp to simulate the sunlight spectrum du et al 2014 the concentration of ho was quantified based on the formation of phenol via reaction between ho and benzene despite the health hazards as well as volatility benzene was widely used in ho quantification due to its evident advantages such as the rapid reaction rate with ho non absorption of lamp radiation and non disturbance of solution ph takeda et al 2004 the water samples were spiked with different concentrations of benzene and irradiated at room temperature with lamp emission power of 1 5 w m2 in the wavelength interval of 290 400 nm and a total irradiation time of 24 h the total volume and optical path of the irradiated solutions were 50 ml and 2 6 cm respectively during the incubation time series samples were collected at 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h to calculate the rho dark experiments with the probes added were wrapped with aluminum foil and placed inside the photoreaction apparatus and no obvious biotic transformation was observed 2 3 calculation of the formation rate and steady state concentration of ho in this study the calculation of r ho and ho was proceeded based on the previously reported method that was used for natural water samples vione et al 2006 the photoformed ho was quantified via the transformation reaction of benzene into phenol 1 benzene ho phenol here d phenol dt 0 70 k b benzene ho k b is the second order rate constant for the reaction between benzene and ho 7 8 109 m 1 s 1 and 0 70 is the yield of phenol for the transformation reaction carena et al 2017 the ho is the results of photogeneration and scavengering under the steady state conditions 2 d ho dt 0 r ho i k si ho s i k b ho

characterized by rate constant k si for reaction with ho in this study the highest concentration of benzene e g 2 mm was at least two orders of magnitude higher than those of the naturally present scavengers dong and rosario ortiz 2012 which meant that i k si s i k b benzene therefore the r ho and ho for the studied samples can be obtained as follows 5 r h o 1 0 70 d phenol dt 6 ho 1 0 70 k b lim benzene 0 d phenol dt 1 benzene the apparent quantum yield of ho φ ho defined as the ratio the amount of ho formation and fraction of light absorbed is calculated as φ ho r ho pa 1 pa units of ein l 1 s 1 is the photon flux absorbed by the cdom samples which can be expressed as follows marchisio et al 2015 carena et al 2017 7 pa λ p o λ 1 10 a 1 λ b d λ where p0 ein l 1 s 1 nm 1 is the photon flux density of the lamp a1 λ cm 1 is the absorbance of the samples over an optical path length of 1 cm and b 2 6 cm is the optical path length of the solution 2 4 other analytical methods the concentration of phenol was determined with an agilent 1200 hplc system with a reverse phase c18 column 4 6 mm i d 150 mm long 5 μm particle size the mobile phase consisted of 0 05 m kh2po4 ph 3 0 and methanol with a volume ratio of 35 65 and a total flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations of samples were quantified in duplicate by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc l uv vis absorption spectra were measured by a spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu with the wavelength in the range of 200 800 nm and increments of 1 nm absorption coefficients a λ m 1 were obtained as a λ 2 303 a λ l where a λ is the absorbance at the wavelength λ nm and l is the path length of the cuvettes m specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was calculated by dividing a254 with doc concentration the parameter slope275 295 which is inversely related to the molecular weight of dom was obtained via the linear fitting of the natural log absorption spectra within 275 295 nm helms et al 2008 fluorescence emission excitation matrix eem spectra were gathered using a hitachi f 7000 spectrofluorometer tokyo japan with emission em wavelength of 250 550 nm and excitation ex wavelength of 200 500 nm the increments of em and ex wavelengths were 2 nm and 10 nm respectively fluorescence parameters including fluorescence index fix the ratio of fluorescence intensities between em 450 and 500 nm at ex 370 nm and humification index hix the area under the em 435 480 nm divided by the peak area under the em 300 345 435 480 nm at ex 254 nm were obtained accordingly devilbiss et al 2016 the concentrations of inorganic ions such as nitrates and nitrites were obtained following the standard spectrophotometric method apha 1998 while those of carbonates and bicarbonates were not determined though they may also affect the photochemistry process the significance of data differences between different sample sets was tested using one way anova tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 the water quality and physicochemical properties of collected samples the quality parameters for the collected river and lake samples are presented in table 1 all the studied samples were characterized by a low to medium abundance of organic matter with the doc range within 2 03 0 12 7 67 0 31 mg l nitrate in these waters exhibited a large variation in abundance and its concentration in river waters 58 8 0 1 109 5 1 6 μm was significantly p 0 01 higher than that in lake samples 3 3 0 2 51 3 0 3 μm high nitrate concentration in the rivers would be due to the accumulation of point or non point source runoff combined with the weak denitrification wankel et al 2006 nitrite in these samples ranging from 0 03 0 01 to 3 41 0 02 μm was two orders of magnitude lower than nitrate which is consistent with other surface water samples takeda et al 2004 the fluorescent spectroscopy results showed that regardless of water types all collected samples contained evident humic and fulvic like substances fig 2 chen et al 2003 devilbiss et al 2016 low fix 1 26 1 53 but high hix 0 79 0 89 suggested that dom in these samples was characterized by terrestrial origin and had a high degree of humification as for the absorption spectra the intensities of all samples decreased quasi exponentially along the wavelength range the values of suva254 ranged from 2 59 7 23 l mg c m showing aromatic properties for these samples that were obviously different from the wastewater effluent e g 2 2 l mg c m dong and rosario ortiz 2012 further analysis showed that the river waters had generally lower hix 0 79 0 86 vs 0 85 0 89 and suva254 2 59 4 63 vs 4 00 7 23 than lake samples the results indicated richness of photodegraded components and or absence of in situ produced aromatic dom within river waters which disagrees with previous data showing high aromaticity for river samples xu and guo 2017 the likely reason for the discrepancy could be due to the fact that samples in this study were collected during the drought period november to january which meant a negligible influence of surface runoff and leaching and thus a high photobleaching efficiency for river waters in addition the values of slope275 295 were in the range of 0 0083 0 0184 demonstrating a wide molecular weight distribution among these water samples 3 2 the formation rate of ho from natural waters upon irradiation fig 3 depicts as an example the time dependent formation of phenol upon irradiation of the samples from lake chaohu fig 3a and river ganjiang fig 3c spiked with different concentrations of benzene the phenol formation for other samples can be seen in the supporting information si the concentration of photochemically formed phenol increased with increasing benzene concentration and irradiation time the initial formation rate of phenol at each benzene concentration can be obtained via the calculation of the slope of the time dependent fitting lines fig 3b and d shows the initial formation rate of phenol at various benzene concentrations the curve can be fitted via the following equation d phenol dt a c benzene b c benzene the horizontal line shows the formation rate of phenol at elevated benzene which was used to calculate r ho vione et al 2006 in this study the r oh for all samples ranged from 5 10 10 11 to 1 82 10 10 m s 1 which were comparable to those of other surface waters such as ohta river in japan 0 56 2 64 10 11 m s 1 takeda et al 2004 and some lakes in italy 0 69 5 9 10 11 m s 1 with low nitrate 100 μm vione et al 2006 however they were obviously lower compared to the groundwater 4 62 6 25 10 10 m s 1 vione et al 2006 and wastewater effluents 2 3 3 8 10 10 m s 1 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 that contained high nitrate level e g 450 681 μm for groundwater and 290 710 μm for wastewater respectively further analysis showed that although river waters contained higher nitrate abundance the values of r ho 5 10 11 69 10 11 m s 1 were evidently lower than those of lake samples 1 10 1 82 10 10 m s 1 the heterogeneity may indicate that the photoactivity of cdom in river waters was lower than those in lake waters or that the inorganic nitrate in surface waters was not the main source for ho generation moreover the lamp output applied in this study was 1 5 w m2 which was one to two orders of magnitude lower than those used in previous studies e g 22 w m2 for lee et al 2013 to obtain the irradiation intensity independent formation rates the overall r ho values were normalized by the lamp output the resulting r ho values calculated herein were thus comparable to the wastewater and groundwater but slightly higher compared to other surface waters vione et al 2006 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 3 contribution of the chemical components of water samples to the photogeneration of ho 3 3 1 ho formation from photolysis of inorganic nitrates and nitrites as known the photogeneration of ho in waters originates mainly from nitrate nitrite and cdom de laurentiis et al 2013 lee et al 2013 in order to quantify the contribution of inorganic nitrates to ho formation solutions containing different concentrations of nitrate 5 120 μm in ultrapure water were additionally irradiated at elevated benzene concentration i e 2 mm with the results depicted in fig 4 the formation rate of ho increased with increasing nitrate concentration showing an evident role of nitrate in ho generation the normalized r ho was calculated as 5 15 10 8 m s 1 mno3 1 which was slightly lower than previously reported values e g 1 7 10 7 m s 1 mno3 1 for minero et al 2007 partially due to the low irradiation intensity applied in this study according to the nitrate concentrations detected in waters table 1 it was possible to quantify the contribution of nitrate to ho generation η no3 i e η no3 no3 slope r ho vs no3 r ho in this study nitrate induced r ho for all samples ranged from 0 28 10 12 m s 1 to 5 45 10 12 m s 1 the contribution of nitrate induced r ho to the overall r ho ranged from negligible 1 to about 9 table 1 indicating that nitrate was not the prevailing source of ho in the studied samples vione et al 2006 further analysis showed that the nitrate induced contribution in river waters was generally higher compared to lake samples 2 79 8 75 vs 0 12 1 93 the difference should be attributed to the high nitrate abundance in river waters table 1 the contribution of nitrite to ho photogeneration was obtained using the same irradiation conditions but with variable nitrite concentrations 0 02 3 μm the normalized r ho derived from nitrite photolysis was 5 08 10 6 m s 1 mno2 1 which was 99 times higher as compared to nitrate photolysis therefore although nitrite in surface waters is usually characterized by extremely low concentration table 1 a 1 1 m basis nitrite was about 102 times more effective than nitrate at producing ho based on the nitrite concentration of water samples the r ho values derived from nitrite photolysis in all samples were 0 15 17 20 10 12 m s 1 which accounted for 0 65 24 84 and 0 14 5 19 of the total rho in the river and lake samples respectively overall the contributions of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters were generally higher than in lake waters and the photolysis of nitrite exhibited contribution 1 2 times higher than that of nitrate irrespective of sample types 3 3 2 ho formation from sensitization of organic matter the contribution of cdom photosensitization to r ho was obtained by subtracting those of nitrate and nitrite photolysis from the overall r ho it was shown that except for river ganjiang that had low doc but high nitrate and nitrite the photosensitization process accounted for more than 70 of the total r ho table 1 indicating that cdom was a prevailing ho source the results agreed with previously reported surface waters such as seawater takeda et al 2004 and lake waters minero et al 2007 as for the sample dependent differences contribution of the photosensitization process in river waters was generally lower compared to lake samples 66 41 96 56 vs 92 88 99 71 the low photosensitization contribution in river water samples was due to the higher molar ratio of no3 no2 to dom in which case inorganic nitrogen compounds played a non negligible role as ho sources vione et al 2006 3 4 the steady state ho concentration in various surface waters based on the fitting curve of benzene dependent profiles of r ho fig 3b and d the slope of the blue line represents lim benzene 0 d phenol dt benzene 1 which was used to calculated the oh vione et al 2006 among all samples the ho ranged from 1 74 10 17 m for waters low in doc with high nitrate such as rivers qinghuai and jiuli to 1 03 10 16 m for waters high in doc with low nitrate such as lake chaohu the river waters were generally characterized by lower ho than the lake samples the values of ho obtained herein were one to two orders of magnitude lower than for other surface waters 7 9 34 0 10 17 m vione et al 2006 which were ascribed to the relatively low irradiation and ratios of doc to nitrate for the samples collected to eliminate the influence of different organic carbon concentrations the ho obtained was normalized by doc the resulting normalized ho were thus in the range of 6 61 13 46 10 18 m mg c l which were comparable to other surface waters such as rivers harney and taylor america 1 8 10 18 m mg c l timko et al 2014 in addition the φ values for all river and lake samples ranged from 3 63 to 18 30 10 4 indicating the efficiency of these samples in the photochemical formation of ho which were comparable to those from effluent organic matters dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 5 correlation between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom samples as depicted above the prevailing contribution to ho formation originated from the photosensitization of cdom in the samples to gain deeper insights into the factors influencing ho in natural waters the correlations between ho and the physicochemical properties of cdom samples were explored with the results shown in fig 5 the ho was positively correlated with doc concentration for all water samples testifying that cdom was the main source for ho photogeneration further analysis showed that besides the total abundance the physicochemical properties of cdom samples also exhibited obvious effects on ho to eliminate the influence of different organic carbon abundance the cdom derived ho obtained herein was normalized by doc concentration to assure that the correlation was derived merely from the inherent properties of cdom samples following this the doc normalized ho was positively correlated with the suva254 r 2 0 85 and hix r 2 0 65 indicating that aromaticity and humification of cdom samples contributed significantly to ho in natural waters meanwhile the doc normalized ho was also found to positively correlate with slope275 295 r 2 0 64 since the parameter slope275 295 was inversely related to molecular weight the results suggest that the molecular weights of cdom samples were negatively correlated with ho in natural waters lee and co workers also found that the lower molecular weight fraction within effluent organic matters had a greater yield of ho lee et al 2013 our previous studies showed that the low molecular weight lmw fraction within the dom pool in natural waters contained high abundance of humic and fulvic like substances whereas the high molecular weight hmw counterpart consisted mainly of soluble microbial products such as proteins and polysaccharides xu and guo 2017 presence of humic fulvic like substances was responsible for the high ho due to its intrinsic chromophoric properties lee et al 2013 in addition compared to the lmw moieties the hmw counterparts undergo usually charge transfer interactions which can quench the excited states and thus decrease the photoactivity dalrymple et al 2010 dong and rosario ortiz 2012 3 6 significance of this study ho in natural waters plays a critical role in the biogeochemical cycle of dom and the ecological health of the aquatic environment previous studies on ho were focused mainly on the source e g light irradiation or sunlight independent and concentration in a specific ecosystem page et al 2013 tong et al 2016 in this study a direct comparison of cdom nitrate and nitrite derived r ho and ho was carried out in different ecosystems river and lake along the middle lower yangtze region china more importantly the correlation between ho level and the inherent physicochemical properties of cdom was evaluated to our knowledge this is the first study simultaneously probing into the source abundance and influencing factors of ho in different surface waters results obtained can provide a deeper understanding of the behavior and fate of contaminants and dom in natural waters as widely reported presence of ho has evident influence on degradation of organic contaminants matzek and carter 2016 hou et al 2017 to better understand the meaning of the calculated ho levels in contaminant degradation the half life of the herbicide acetochlor due to reaction with ho was calculated via the equation t 1 2 ln2 k a ho ho where k a ho 7 5 109 m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant for reaction of acetochlor with ho brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 this model contaminant was widely used in previous studies due to its reasonably elevated rate constant with ho brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 vione et al 2006 although the direct photolysis usually accounted for a considerable contribution to the overall degradation zeng and arnold 2013 remucal 2014 according to the ho obtained the t 1 2 ranged from 6 26 days for lake waters to 21 37 days for river samples table 1 showing enhanced degradation efficiency and decreased half life of recalcitrant compounds for lake waters it is known that the rivers waters containing organic contaminants are usually poured into the lakes the results obtained herein therefore suggested that the organic contaminants contained in rivers discharging into lake waters should receive more attention due to the lower ho of river samples although the precise molecular weight and functional groups within the dom pool were not measured this study definitely showed that the humic and fulvic like substances with low molecular weight play a very important role in controlling the ho level in natural waters some direct procedure for molecular weight fractionation such as cross flow ultrafiltration guo and santschi 2007 xu et al 2018b should be used to testify this correlation in future studies in addition since ho in water samples significantly influences the photochemical degradation process and potential this study is also expected to aid in the understanding of how the composition properties of dom samples affect the removal of organic contaminants from surface waters 4 conclusions compared to the lake waters the river samples were characterized by comparable doc abundance higher nitrate and nitrite concentrations but lower r ho and ho the contributions of nitrate and nitrite to the total r ho in river waters were generally higher than those in lake waters and photolysis of nitrite exhibited a 1 2 times higher contribution compared to nitrate regardless of sample types except for river ganjiang the photosensitization of cdom accounted for more than 70 of the total r ho with the percentage in river waters that was generally lower than in lake samples among all samples there was a positive correlation between ho and doc and the doc normalized ho values were positively correlated with the aromaticity and humification but negatively related to the molecular weight of cdom samples therefore the river and lake samples along middle lower yangtze region china showed obvious variabilities in terms of r ho and ho but a consistent correlation with the quantity and quality of cdom samples the results allow for a deeper understanding of the behavior and fate of dom and its influence on contaminant attenuation in aquatic environments declaration of
