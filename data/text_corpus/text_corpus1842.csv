agricultural university beijing 100083 china variable rate irrigation vri technology matching appropriate irrigation applications to specific areas could contribute to water savings compared to uniform rate irrigation uri within at the field scale a three year field study 2019 2021 was carried out at an experimental station of china agricultural university in zhuozhou hebei province china to compare vri with uri in sudangrass sorghum sudanense and alfalfa medicago sativa l the field was divided into three management zones mzs in accordance with the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca and each mz was further subdivided into two subzones to apply vri and uri the feasibility of considering the eca as an mz delineation approach was supported by the fact that significant differences in yields existed among mzs in each cutting and annual of sudangrass sudangrass obtained higher coefficients of variation cvs than alfalfa in terms of the yields crop water use eta water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue with values ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 and from 1 13 to 7 63 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively no significant differences existed between the vri and uri with regards to the yield wue or iwue in the three years of study compared to uri vri had a better water conservation performance especially in the rainy season with average reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively these findings demonstrated vri s advantage in saving water and increasing water productivity in two forages and that vri could be applied in regions with limited water supplies such as the north china plain keywords variable rate irrigation sudangrass alfalfa water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a growing number of forage plant areas in china are irrigated with center pivot systems because of the advantages of these systems in irrigation efficiency automation and labor costs additionally center pivot systems are popular with forage production because of its undoubtedly flexible cooperation with other machines during frequent forage harvests for example it was estimated that over 100 thousand hectares of irrigated alfalfa fields in northern china including in the inner mongolia autonomous region hebei province henan province and gansu province were equipped with center pivot systems usually center pivot systems can cover large irrigated areas and thus result in complex topography and variable soil textures that can easily generate runoff and deep percolation increasing pressure on water resource shortages urges us to manage our water more precisely especially under the condition that the majority of forage production areas are concentrated in the arid and semiarid regions of china variable rate irrigation vri technology is capable of matching the desired amount of water to specific locations in an irrigated area making it possible for farmers to address temporal and spatial variabilities arising from physical in soil texture and topography difference within a field commercial vri systems have been reliable in providing uniform water application and accurate applied depth in management zones mzs theoretically specific irrigation to each mz using vri within a field could lead to water savings compared to uniformly irrigating the entire field hedley et al 2009 evans et al 2013 however only a limited number of studies have proved the advantage in water saving of these systems for crops including winter wheat maize soybean and cotton li et al 2019 vories et al 2017 sui et al 2020 although many pasture farms have been equipped with center pivot systems across large irrigated land areas seldom reports on vri application in forage crops have been published o shaughnessy et al 2019 reviewed the updated vri literature and concluded that one of the main drawbacks is the lack of evidence regarding water savings by supplementing the application of vri in forage crops it should be possible to better understand vri and its impact on crop productivity mz delineation is the fundamental work for assessing vri and is critical for controlling accuracy investment costs and economic benefits in recent decades scientific reports on mz delineation mainly have focused on plants remote sensing based et and soil condition developing dynamic prescription maps derived from canopy temperature and its related parameters has been effective in addressing field scale spatial and temporal variations but the work has been limited by the temporal frequency of available data and cloudy days o shaughnessy et al 2015 remote sensing based et is feasible for use only when sufficient cloud free satellite images can be provided barker et al 2018 hence soil property related parameters have become the most stable and reliable way to make irrigation decisions zhao et al 2017 bhatti et al 2020 the apparent soil electrical conductivity eca has been confirmed to have a close relationship with the crop yield potential corwin et al 2003 and can be used for vri johnson et al 2003 haghverdi et al 2015 additionally commercial devices for mapping soil eca e g the veris 3100 instrument have been widely accepted and adopted to quickly and accurately evaluate the soil spatial variability of field sudduth et al 2017 however little information is available about the effects of spatial eca variabilities on irrigation yield and water productivity hence the objectives of this study were i to compare the soil water crop yield and water productivity differences among all zones ii to evaluate the performance of vri in forage crops by comparing vri with uniform rate irrigation uri and iii to assess the feasibility of delineating mzs based on the eca 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this research was conducted from 2019 to 2021 at the china agricultural university experimental station 39 37 n 115 51 e in zhuozhou hebei province china fig 1a the climate is a typical temperate continental semihumid monsoon climate with a summertime precipitation pattern annual precipitation in the area ranges from 550 to 650 mm 50 75 of which falls from july to august 2 2 variable rate irrigation system in the experiments we used a three span center pivot irrigation system modern agricultural equipment co ltd beijing china the center pivot was 140 m long of which the first span second span third span and overhang lengths were 37 38 50 and 15 m respectively on the center pivot system relevant equipment such as solenoid valves valve controllers beidou rtk receivers and software were added to achieve vri control at the connection between each drop hose and the lateral pipe a solenoid valve pgv hunter industries corp usa was attached and each of the four solenoid valves shared a valve controller intelirri technology co ltd beijing china each sprinkler could be operated separately by turning the solenoid on or off the on off cycle including the cycle time and duty cycle of each solenoid valve could be independently controlled by a small wechat program on a smartphone thereby regulating the flows and pulse rates through various sprinklers the desired application depths in specific control zones could be realized by changing the center pivot s travel speed and the duty cycle of the sprinklers by turning the electric solenoid valves on or off at the same time the beidou rtk receiver determined the position of the center pivot in the field for the real time identification of control zones field tests showed that this center pivot vri system with r3000 sprinklers had a heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of 85 3 with constant rate application and of 84 4 with variable rate application more details about the vri system and field tests are provided in hui et al 2022 2 3 management zones delineation the mz delineation of fields was created based on the eca many studies have reported that eca was highly related to the soil texture and can be used for site specific management corwin and scudiero 2020 hedley et al 2004 sui and yan 2017 sudduth et al 2005 the veris 3100 soil ec mapping device ec 3100 veris usa can measure field soil depths of 0 30 cm ecash and 0 90 cm ecadp at the same time ec 3100 veris usa our previous study proved that the spatial distribution of ecash changed obviously after tillage in addition ecadp showed stronger linear relationships than ecash with the soil particle composition displaying correlation coefficients of 0 83 0 90 and 0 86 for the sand silt and clay contents respectively compared to ecash ecadp was also less affected by external factors such as tillage and rainfall and can more accurately reflect the spatial variabilities caused by the soil itself more information can be found in li et al 2020 due to space limits therefore ecadp and its spatial distribution were used to delineate the vri mzs in this study on 19 march 2019 the soil eca of the field was measured by a veris 3100 soil ec mapping system and values ranging from 0 10 to 7 10 ms m 1 were obtained the field was categorized into three categories labeled as mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 according to the ecadp spatial distribution fig 1 mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 had ecadp values ranging from 0 to 2 1 from 2 1 to 3 1 and from 3 1 to 7 1 ms m 1 respectively table 1 showed the main physicochemical properties of each mz the shallow layers from 0 to 40 cm had a larger field capacity fc than the deeper layers from 40 to 80 cm the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the mzs rose by orders of 1 2 and 3 despite the fact that the field capacities of the three mzs were similar the saturated hydraulic conductivities of mz 2 and mz 3 were clearly higher than that of mz 1 particularly at depths of 40 80 cm 2 4 experimental design to execute the vri and uri treatments each mz was divided into two subzones each subzone was divided into three plots each of which was 7 m 7 m in size both the vri and uri treatments were irrigated on the same day to ensure constant operating efficiencies energy consumption and costs as was common in irrigation management studies when the average soil moisture at the main root depth of the mzs under uri dropped to 60 of the fc all mzs were irrigated the main root depth was 40 cm for both sudangrass and alfalfa in this study for the vri the irrigation amount in a specific mz was equivalent to the average water depth that could supplement each plot s current soil moisture to 90 fc for the uri all mzs were irrigated at the same irrigation depth that could supplement the soil moisture from 60 fc to 90 fc in our study we created buffer zones in the circumferential direction to avoid interference among plots of neighboring subzones due to the covid 19 outbreak uniform water application was applied throughout the field during the first cutting from march to june of alfalfa in 2020 no irrigation was carried out during the third or fourth cuttings in 2021 because of extreme and unusual rainfall 2 5 cultural practices and harvest procedures sudangrass sorghum sudanense an annual forage of cultivar sudangrass no 1 was seeded with a grain drill on 6 may 2019 in rows with a row spacing of 0 3 m and a seed rate of 75 kg hm 2 all subzones were applied uniformly with 225 kg hm 2 potassium sulfate k₂so₄ as base fertilizer the remaining nitrogen was applied on 8 and 31 may 2019 and 6 mm of water was simultaneously applied by center pivot fertigation system sudangrass was harvested at the heading stage the first and second cuttings were harvested on 1 july and 6 august 2019 respectively then on 11 september 2019 the alfalfa medicago sativa l cultivar wl363hq was seeded with a grain drill in rows with a spacing of 0 3 m and a seed rate of 22 5 kg hm 2 in 2020 the alfalfa spring green up began on 25 march while it began on 27 march in 2021 alfalfa was harvested in the early flowering stage when 10 of the alfalfa had bloomed the four harvests in 2020 occurred sequentially on 2 june 1 july 6 august and 21 september the four harvests in 2021 occurred sequentially on 30 may 29 june 5 august and 5 september the sudangrass and alfalfa yields were measured using the same procedures three squares 1 m 1 m of fresh grass were collected and weighed along the diagonals of each plot to estimate the crop yield the final hay yield per unit area was determined after oven drying the samples at 105 c for 1 h and then at 65 c for 72 h residual no sampling areas at the field site were immediately removed with the bulk forage harvester to prepare the site for normal grass regrowth in 2020 a hard freeze occurred after spring green up and lasted for three weeks this freeze was harmful to alfalfa production additionally the fourth cutting in 2021 was harvested approximately 2 weeks earlier than usual since alfalfa dropped and experienced mildew due to frequent heavy rainfall 2 6 measurement and calculated parameters 2 6 1 weather data weather data including precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity data were collected from a portable weather station u30 hobo usa installed in the study field 2 6 2 soil physicochemical properties three locations in each mz and a total of 18 locations across the experimental field were chosen to investigate the soil physicochemical characteristics under vri and uri from four soil depths 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm at each location soil samples and two intact soil cores were collected using aluminum boxes and 100 cm3 rings respectively based on the particle fractions measured by a granulometer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern u k the soil texture was categorized using the soil texture triangle recommended by the usda shirazi and boersma 1984 the fc of the samples were determined according to the wilcox method wilcox 1962 the bulk density was measured by the volumetric cylinder method as described by iso iso 2017 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by a laboratory test at a constant head of 56 cm klute 1965 soil organic matter was determined by dry combustion at 900 c using an elemental analyzer vario el iii elementar germany soil water was monitored at 9 am by a tdr trime tube system trime t3 tdr imko germany every day except on irrigation rainfall or harvest days throughout the growth period a pvc tube was installed in each plot as shown in fig 1b to track changes in the soil moisture of each mz considering the root distribution soil depth of 60 and 80 cm were measured in 20 cm increments for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively 2 6 3 deep percolation the deep percolation dp was measured using automatic weighing devices beijing sinton technology co ltd china with an accuracy of 0 02 mm in each mz the automatic weighing equipment was a stainless steel cylinder with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 80 cm the cylinder was filled with undisturbed soil and grass of the same size the soil filled cylinder was kept on an electronic balance any water that percolated through the bottom of the cylinder was immediately pumped into an automatically weighed storage jar the data were recorded at 10 min intervals in total six automatic weighing devices were installed across the entire study field with one device in each subzone dp value of each mz was calculated as the mean of two subzones 2 6 4 crop water use the actual crop water use eta in the different growing seasons was estimated using the water balance method james 1988 kresović et al 2016 1 e t a δ s w i p o g w d p r where eta is the actual crop water use mm δsw is the change in soil water storage mm in the 0 60 cm sudangrass or 0 80 cm alfalfa soil layers between the initial and terminal stages i is the actual amount of irrigation mm po is the effective rainfall mm calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the reduction coefficient the coefficient are 0 0 8 and 0 7 when the total rainfall is less than 5 mm between 5 mm and 50 mm and more than 50 mm respectively gw is the ground water contribution to water use which was ignored in this study because its deep depth exceeded 30 m dp is the deep percolation from the root zone which was measured by an automatic weighing device and r is the runoff caused by irrigation mm which was also ignored herein due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low irrigation rate for each event 2 6 5 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue was calculated by dividing the grass hay yield by eta 2 6 5 1 irrigation water use efficiency the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing the grass hay yield by the irrigated water 2 7 data analysis data from each irrigation treatment in each year were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova in which the treatments were separated using fisher s protected lsd at the 5 significance level spss 20 0 3 results 3 1 climate rainfall and irrigation the field region has a typical summer precipitation pattern with the majority of annual precipitation occurring in the second cutting of sudangrass and the last two cuttings of alfalfa from june to july 2019 the total rainfall during growing days of sudangrass was173 mm from april to september the total rainfall amounts during growing days of alfalfa were 414 mm in 2020 and 536 mm in 2021 in 2021 however all rainfall fell in the third and fourth cutting periods which lasted from late june to early september indicating an extreme rainfall pattern the precipitation in july and august varied dramatically among the three years of study with total amounts of 128 324 and 467 mm throughout in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the rainfall in august 2020 and in july 2021 were three times and twice that of the corresponding long term averages respectively table 2 among the three years of study no obvious differences in temperature or solar radiation were observed relatively high relative humidity and low solar radiation were observed in july 2021 compared to the previous two years due to frequent rainfall in 2019 the uri plots received 171 mm of seasonal irrigation water while the mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 under vri received 169 145 and 140 mm of water respectively in 2020 the seasonal irrigation amounts for the uri vri 1 vri 2 and vri 3 treatments were 374 382 359 and 359 mm respectively in 2021 the uri vri 1 vri 2 and vri 3 treatments received 304 294 293 and 300 mm of seasonal irrigation respectively when averaging the annual values of the subzones vri saved 11 5 and 2 of irrigation water during sudangrass and alfalfa growing seasons respectively table 3 in the rainy season the second cutting for sudangrass and last two cuttings for alfalfa vri saved more water than uri with average reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively excessive rainfall from july to august 2021 resulted in the absence of irrigation during the third and fourth cuttings generally the seasonal irrigation amount in mz 1 undergoing vri was close to that in the uri plots in three study years 3 2 soil water variation and deep percolation the variation trends in the 0 80 cm soil layer were nearly the same from 2019 to 2021 fig 3 before the rainy season the soil water content beneath a depth of 40 cm was steady for all treatments later it continued to rise and decrease as a result of rainfall and depletion these findings revealed that the movement of irrigation water mainly occurred at depths of 0 40 cm the results also supported our hypothesis that sudangrass and alfalfa roots were mainly distributed within the top 40 cm of soils the deep soil gravels in the field inhibited alfalfa root growth that was the reason why the relatively shallow soil wetting layer 40 cm was designed for the deep rooted alfalfa some differences in soil water were also observed between different soil layers the soil water profiles of the 0 20 cm depth were essentially similar among all treatments during the three years of study throughout all growing days the soil water of mz 3 was below that of the other managements at the 20 40 cm depth although the same water conditions were obtained under the uri treatments similarly the mz 1 soil water was clearly superior to the conditions measured in the other management plots at depths of 40 80 cm the dp results obtained for different mzs were displayed in fig 2 in total eleven dp values were measured during the growing days from 2019 to 2021 ranging from 3 to 68 mm specifically dp ranged from 3 to 56 mm 5 64 mm and 7 68 mm for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively all of the dp values were caused by heavy rainfall with the greater dp trending greater alongside lower fc in the 2019 season only one dp was observed after a 71 mm rainfall event with values of 37 43 and 57 mm for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 received totals of 119 148 and 176 mm in 2020 respectively and totals of 129 160 and 213 mm in 2021 respectively the average cumulative dp values were 95 117 and 149 mm per year for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively it was worth noting that relatively large differences in dp existed when the rainfall amounts were similar for example averaging three mzs dp of approximately 23 mm was detected with 42 4 mm rainfall on 17july 2021 while only 11 mm of dp was measured after 41 2 mm rainfall event on 5 september 2020 this might be because the dp was determined using both the rainfall intensity and soil water content 3 3 yields and crop water use significant differences existed among the mzs in each cutting and annual harvests of sudangrass whereas significant differences in alfalfa harvests among the mzs existed only in the second cutting regardless of whether sudangrass or alfalfa was considered mz 3 produced a higher yield than the other treatments in the rainy season for example during the second cutting of sudangrass mz 2 and mz 3 obtained approximately 13 and 63 higher yields than mz 1 respectively and this difference was pronounced when using vri fig 4 similarly mz 3 obtained a greater alfalfa yield than the other two zones in the third cutting with heavy rainfall the frequent and strong rains supplied the soil water and maintained at a high level mz 3 had a much higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than mz 1 and mz 2 thus providing optimal growth conditions for sudangrass and alfalfa during the rainy season no significant differences were found between vri and uri in the three years when the data analysis was performed by grouping by different mzs to compare vri and uri however vri widened the yield gaps among mzs and increased the yields of both sudangrass and alfalfa figs 5 and 7 to some extent significant differences between vri and uri were buffered out by the high standard deviation sd among the three mzs with sds ranging from 333 to 1574 kg hm 2 and from 201 to 981 kg hm 2 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively the contributions of the sudangrass yields between cuttings to the annual harvests were similar with the first and second cuttings providing average proportions of the annual harvests of 46 and 54 respectively in contrast the alfalfa yields declined by successive harvests fig 6 the yield distributions in each cutting were typical patterns with proportions of 39 30 18 and 12 of the annual harvests as reported by li et al 2018 and zhao et al 2016 since a serious yield reduction was caused in the first cutting due to the delayed irrigation during the regrowth and hard freezing events in the branching stage the average annual yields in 2020 were approximately 3000 kg hm 2 lower than those in 2021 in total the alfalfa annual yields were better than the regional normal yield of 11855 kg hm 2 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 for the same cultivar table 4 showed the seasonal eta trends of sudangrass and alfalfa under various irrigation methods and mzs using the soil water balance approach similarly no significant differences were found between two irrigation methods although significant differences existed among the three mzs different soil water storage capacities resulted in significant differences among the three zones sudangrass had a far lower eta than alfalfa due to its short growth period of approximately three months the average seasonal eta of alfalfa in 2021 was 146 mm higher than that in 2020 due to adequate irrigation in the first cutting period and heavy rainfall in the third cutting period 3 4 wue and iwue significant differences were observed in wue and iwue among the mzs for both sudangrass and alfalfa no significant differences were observed in wue or iwue between uri and vri from 2019 to 2021 across all data under the two irrigation methods table 5 when further comparing the two irrigation methods in the same mzs vri was founded to improve the wue and iwue in all mzs the wue of alfalfa was 2 28 kg m 3 on average much higher than the local value of 1 78 kg m 3 reported by pan et al 2011 due to decreased water application vri slightly increased the wue and iwue although the yields were essentially equal this situation was more pronounced for zones with loamy sand soils especially in the rainy season for example in the second cutting period of 2019 the iwue under vri increased by approximately 48 and 63 for mz 2 and mz 3 respectively no irrigation was applied in the third or fourth cuttings of 2021 due to frequent rainfall consequently the iwue could not be calculated 3 5 spatial variability the spatial variabilities in the irrigation amount yields eta wue and iwue values between uri and vri were analyzed in this study to investigate the necessity of vri and the feasibility of mzs delineating based on the eca table 6 the degree of variation in eca in the test field was moderate with a coefficient of variation cv of 49 58 according to the soil variation classification lei et al 1985 the growth of sudangrass had a stronger response to soil spatial variabilities with the yields eta wue and iwue cvs ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 in contrast the spatial variabilities in these variables for alfalfa were relatively low ranging from only 1 13 6 12 for sudangrass the greatest variability as defined by the cvs was observed in the iwue followed by in the wue and annual yields for alfalfa the greatest variability was observed in the eta followed by in the annual yields overall regardless of whether uri or vri was applied the annual yields obtained relatively high cvs vri strengthened the variability in annual yields especially in the alfalfa seasons of 2020 and 2021 additionally vri helped increase the crop yields compared to uri all of these results indicated that vri could increase productivity under the given soil conditions in terms of the wue and iwue higher values and lower spatial variabilities demonstrated that vri conserved water by matching specific water requirements to different mzs the higher cvs of the wue and iwue results for vri in the sudangrass season were caused by the large differences in the second cutting yields 4 discussions in this paper we evaluated the application of vri in two typical forages on north china plain ncp despite the single year of data sudangrass growth was found to be more sensitive to soil spatial variabilities and vri management than alfalfa growth significant differences prevailed among the mzs in each cutting and annual harvests of sudangrass while only in the second cutting were observed significant differences in the alfalfa yield among mzs furthermore the cvs of the alfalfa yields were lower than those of the sudangrass yields the extensive roots of alfalfa might weaken the effects of variabilities in the soil conditions and irrigation amounts on alfalfa growth this could also be proven by the lower cvs of the alfalfa yields in 2021 the third established year meanwhile the adequate soil water storage generated by winter irrigation and rainfall through the previous year resulted in small alfalfa yield differences in the first cutting period when the rainy season arrived high temperatures and soil moisture increased the risks of pests and disease outbreaks mo et al 2011 and even caused alfalfa to enter dormancy consequently the alfalfa yield in the third and fourth cuttings showed little differences however sudangrass had a better tolerance for high temperatures and wet soil conditions than alfalfa allowing it to obtain higher yields and water productivity this is also the result of sudangrass being a c4 plant with a higher rate of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate than alfalfa which is a c3 plant leakey et al 2019 in total the significant differences and higher cvs of water management related parameters among the mzs illustrated two facts the feasibility of delineating mzs based on the eca and the greater importance of vri in sudangrass than in alfalfa irrigation managers are particularly concerned about soil moisture and dp in this study the substantial differences observed in dp among the three mzs were mainly attributed to soil hydraulic properties the hydraulic properties of the relatively coarse soil indicate a greater depth of wetting per unit quantity of infiltration water moves more quickly through the large pores in sandy soils than through the small pores in clayey soils the higher soil saturation water conductivity and lower fc of the mz 3 plots induced water to move into deep soils restricting the water from use by planta and thereby increasing the opportunity for dp to occur the dp values measured in this study were much higher than the results reported by li et al 2021 at the same experimental site which could be due to synthetic factors such as the amount and pattern of rainfall plant water uptake soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture bethune 2004 during the same period from june to september rainfall was relatively greater and intense in our study period reaching nearly twice that reported by li et al 2021 especially in 2021 sudangrass and alfalfa have lower transpiration than summer maize which reduces their water uptake rates from the soil profile fouli et al 2012 in addition there were obvious variations in soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture between these two studies although no significant differences were observed in the yield wue or iwue between uri and vri both for either sudangrass or alfalfa vri widened the yield gaps among mzs and increased the average yields the yield differences among mzs revealed that soil conditions played an important role in determining the yield vri irrigates using different water amounts according to the differences in the soil water holding capacity of the mzs thus allocating limited irrigation water to mzs with a high production potential this is why vri could save water and improve the wue and iwue conditions the advantages of saving water and increasing crop water productivity are more obvious in the rainy season than in other seasons continuous and severe rainfall result in variations in soil water between among mzs and thus require the application of vri to match different irrigation amounts for example vri increased sudangrass yield by approximately 500 kg hm 2 compared to that obtained under uri during the rainy season second cutting vri also conserved 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 of the water amount for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively during the rainy season we did not discover any environmental benefits resulting from vri in our study such as preventing deep percolation or runoff daccache et al 2015 perea et al 2018 this was because the irrigation schedule was based on the primary plant root depth 40 cm for both sudangrass and alfalfa whereas the deep percolation monitoring depth comprised the entire root soil layer 60 and 80 cm for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively furthermore due to extremely weak topographic variations and strong soil water conductivity performance in the experimental field no runoff was recorded overall this paper confirmed the vri advantages in terms of water conservation and improving water productivity for sudangrass and alfalfa on the ncp especially during the rainy seasons unlike many previous studies lamm et al 2012 clément et al 2022 alfalfa roots in our experimental field were certainly quite shallow and were primarily concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer as was reported in our previous studies meng et al 2020 the root growth of alfalfa in this study was mainly restricted by the sand soils containing large amounts of sand gravels below the 60 cm soil layer alfalfa roots were seldom observed at depths of 60 80 cm consequently it was logical to gauge deep percolation from alfalfa using a device with an 80 cm depth additionally it is a typical practice on the ncp to plant alfalfa in areas with poor soils as alfalfa can improve soil fertility inevitably the shallow root zone in our study area limited the storage of available water and water uptake in the soils and thereby affecting the growth and water use of alfalfa therefore further research on the use of vri in deep root alfalfa is necessary 5 conclusions a three year field experiment was carried out on the ncp during the summertime precipitation pattern the research field was divided into three mzs based on the eca and each mz was divided into two subzones to execute the vri and uri treatments the application depths of each subzone under the vri treatment were set as the corresponding differences between the current soil moisture and upper irrigation limits all of subzones received the same irrigation amounts the different mzs and irrigation treatments were compared in terms of the irrigation amount soil water variations crop yields eta wue and iwue although no significant differences existed between vri and uri in terms of the crop yields wue or iwue vri increased the crop yields wue and iwue values in both sudangrass and alfalfa significant differences existed among the mzs in each cutting and annual sudangrass harvest whereas significant differences in the alfalfa yield were observed among mzs only in the second cutting period compared to uri vri strengthened the variations in the annual yields eta wue and iwue sudangrass had a stronger response than alfalfa to spatial soil variabilities with the yields eta wue and iwue results providing cvs of ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 and from 1 13 to 7 63 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively these findings support the feasibility of considering eca when delineating mzs vri saved 11 5 and 2 of irrigation water than uri when the results of the three mzs were averaged for the sudangrass and alfalfa seasons vri saved more water in the rainy season with averages reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 obtained for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively overall our research confirmed the advantages of vri with regards to conserving water and saving and increasing water productivity in two forages vri exhibited a better performance in sudangrass than in alfalfa although only one year data was obtained sudangrass declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

agricultural university beijing 100083 china variable rate irrigation vri technology matching appropriate irrigation applications to specific areas could contribute to water savings compared to uniform rate irrigation uri within at the field scale a three year field study 2019 2021 was carried out at an experimental station of china agricultural university in zhuozhou hebei province china to compare vri with uri in sudangrass sorghum sudanense and alfalfa medicago sativa l the field was divided into three management zones mzs in accordance with the soil apparent electrical conductivity eca and each mz was further subdivided into two subzones to apply vri and uri the feasibility of considering the eca as an mz delineation approach was supported by the fact that significant differences in yields existed among mzs in each cutting and annual of sudangrass sudangrass obtained higher coefficients of variation cvs than alfalfa in terms of the yields crop water use eta water use efficiency wue and irrigation water use efficiency iwue with values ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 and from 1 13 to 7 63 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively no significant differences existed between the vri and uri with regards to the yield wue or iwue in the three years of study compared to uri vri had a better water conservation performance especially in the rainy season with average reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively these findings demonstrated vri s advantage in saving water and increasing water productivity in two forages and that vri could be applied in regions with limited water supplies such as the north china plain keywords variable rate irrigation sudangrass alfalfa water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a growing number of forage plant areas in china are irrigated with center pivot systems because of the advantages of these systems in irrigation efficiency automation and labor costs additionally center pivot systems are popular with forage production because of its undoubtedly flexible cooperation with other machines during frequent forage harvests for example it was estimated that over 100 thousand hectares of irrigated alfalfa fields in northern china including in the inner mongolia autonomous region hebei province henan province and gansu province were equipped with center pivot systems usually center pivot systems can cover large irrigated areas and thus result in complex topography and variable soil textures that can easily generate runoff and deep percolation increasing pressure on water resource shortages urges us to manage our water more precisely especially under the condition that the majority of forage production areas are concentrated in the arid and semiarid regions of china variable rate irrigation vri technology is capable of matching the desired amount of water to specific locations in an irrigated area making it possible for farmers to address temporal and spatial variabilities arising from physical in soil texture and topography difference within a field commercial vri systems have been reliable in providing uniform water application and accurate applied depth in management zones mzs theoretically specific irrigation to each mz using vri within a field could lead to water savings compared to uniformly irrigating the entire field hedley et al 2009 evans et al 2013 however only a limited number of studies have proved the advantage in water saving of these systems for crops including winter wheat maize soybean and cotton li et al 2019 vories et al 2017 sui et al 2020 although many pasture farms have been equipped with center pivot systems across large irrigated land areas seldom reports on vri application in forage crops have been published o shaughnessy et al 2019 reviewed the updated vri literature and concluded that one of the main drawbacks is the lack of evidence regarding water savings by supplementing the application of vri in forage crops it should be possible to better understand vri and its impact on crop productivity mz delineation is the fundamental work for assessing vri and is critical for controlling accuracy investment costs and economic benefits in recent decades scientific reports on mz delineation mainly have focused on plants remote sensing based et and soil condition developing dynamic prescription maps derived from canopy temperature and its related parameters has been effective in addressing field scale spatial and temporal variations but the work has been limited by the temporal frequency of available data and cloudy days o shaughnessy et al 2015 remote sensing based et is feasible for use only when sufficient cloud free satellite images can be provided barker et al 2018 hence soil property related parameters have become the most stable and reliable way to make irrigation decisions zhao et al 2017 bhatti et al 2020 the apparent soil electrical conductivity eca has been confirmed to have a close relationship with the crop yield potential corwin et al 2003 and can be used for vri johnson et al 2003 haghverdi et al 2015 additionally commercial devices for mapping soil eca e g the veris 3100 instrument have been widely accepted and adopted to quickly and accurately evaluate the soil spatial variability of field sudduth et al 2017 however little information is available about the effects of spatial eca variabilities on irrigation yield and water productivity hence the objectives of this study were i to compare the soil water crop yield and water productivity differences among all zones ii to evaluate the performance of vri in forage crops by comparing vri with uniform rate irrigation uri and iii to assess the feasibility of delineating mzs based on the eca 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this research was conducted from 2019 to 2021 at the china agricultural university experimental station 39 37 n 115 51 e in zhuozhou hebei province china fig 1a the climate is a typical temperate continental semihumid monsoon climate with a summertime precipitation pattern annual precipitation in the area ranges from 550 to 650 mm 50 75 of which falls from july to august 2 2 variable rate irrigation system in the experiments we used a three span center pivot irrigation system modern agricultural equipment co ltd beijing china the center pivot was 140 m long of which the first span second span third span and overhang lengths were 37 38 50 and 15 m respectively on the center pivot system relevant equipment such as solenoid valves valve controllers beidou rtk receivers and software were added to achieve vri control at the connection between each drop hose and the lateral pipe a solenoid valve pgv hunter industries corp usa was attached and each of the four solenoid valves shared a valve controller intelirri technology co ltd beijing china each sprinkler could be operated separately by turning the solenoid on or off the on off cycle including the cycle time and duty cycle of each solenoid valve could be independently controlled by a small wechat program on a smartphone thereby regulating the flows and pulse rates through various sprinklers the desired application depths in specific control zones could be realized by changing the center pivot s travel speed and the duty cycle of the sprinklers by turning the electric solenoid valves on or off at the same time the beidou rtk receiver determined the position of the center pivot in the field for the real time identification of control zones field tests showed that this center pivot vri system with r3000 sprinklers had a heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of 85 3 with constant rate application and of 84 4 with variable rate application more details about the vri system and field tests are provided in hui et al 2022 2 3 management zones delineation the mz delineation of fields was created based on the eca many studies have reported that eca was highly related to the soil texture and can be used for site specific management corwin and scudiero 2020 hedley et al 2004 sui and yan 2017 sudduth et al 2005 the veris 3100 soil ec mapping device ec 3100 veris usa can measure field soil depths of 0 30 cm ecash and 0 90 cm ecadp at the same time ec 3100 veris usa our previous study proved that the spatial distribution of ecash changed obviously after tillage in addition ecadp showed stronger linear relationships than ecash with the soil particle composition displaying correlation coefficients of 0 83 0 90 and 0 86 for the sand silt and clay contents respectively compared to ecash ecadp was also less affected by external factors such as tillage and rainfall and can more accurately reflect the spatial variabilities caused by the soil itself more information can be found in li et al 2020 due to space limits therefore ecadp and its spatial distribution were used to delineate the vri mzs in this study on 19 march 2019 the soil eca of the field was measured by a veris 3100 soil ec mapping system and values ranging from 0 10 to 7 10 ms m 1 were obtained the field was categorized into three categories labeled as mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 according to the ecadp spatial distribution fig 1 mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 had ecadp values ranging from 0 to 2 1 from 2 1 to 3 1 and from 3 1 to 7 1 ms m 1 respectively table 1 showed the main physicochemical properties of each mz the shallow layers from 0 to 40 cm had a larger field capacity fc than the deeper layers from 40 to 80 cm the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the mzs rose by orders of 1 2 and 3 despite the fact that the field capacities of the three mzs were similar the saturated hydraulic conductivities of mz 2 and mz 3 were clearly higher than that of mz 1 particularly at depths of 40 80 cm 2 4 experimental design to execute the vri and uri treatments each mz was divided into two subzones each subzone was divided into three plots each of which was 7 m 7 m in size both the vri and uri treatments were irrigated on the same day to ensure constant operating efficiencies energy consumption and costs as was common in irrigation management studies when the average soil moisture at the main root depth of the mzs under uri dropped to 60 of the fc all mzs were irrigated the main root depth was 40 cm for both sudangrass and alfalfa in this study for the vri the irrigation amount in a specific mz was equivalent to the average water depth that could supplement each plot s current soil moisture to 90 fc for the uri all mzs were irrigated at the same irrigation depth that could supplement the soil moisture from 60 fc to 90 fc in our study we created buffer zones in the circumferential direction to avoid interference among plots of neighboring subzones due to the covid 19 outbreak uniform water application was applied throughout the field during the first cutting from march to june of alfalfa in 2020 no irrigation was carried out during the third or fourth cuttings in 2021 because of extreme and unusual rainfall 2 5 cultural practices and harvest procedures sudangrass sorghum sudanense an annual forage of cultivar sudangrass no 1 was seeded with a grain drill on 6 may 2019 in rows with a row spacing of 0 3 m and a seed rate of 75 kg hm 2 all subzones were applied uniformly with 225 kg hm 2 potassium sulfate k₂so₄ as base fertilizer the remaining nitrogen was applied on 8 and 31 may 2019 and 6 mm of water was simultaneously applied by center pivot fertigation system sudangrass was harvested at the heading stage the first and second cuttings were harvested on 1 july and 6 august 2019 respectively then on 11 september 2019 the alfalfa medicago sativa l cultivar wl363hq was seeded with a grain drill in rows with a spacing of 0 3 m and a seed rate of 22 5 kg hm 2 in 2020 the alfalfa spring green up began on 25 march while it began on 27 march in 2021 alfalfa was harvested in the early flowering stage when 10 of the alfalfa had bloomed the four harvests in 2020 occurred sequentially on 2 june 1 july 6 august and 21 september the four harvests in 2021 occurred sequentially on 30 may 29 june 5 august and 5 september the sudangrass and alfalfa yields were measured using the same procedures three squares 1 m 1 m of fresh grass were collected and weighed along the diagonals of each plot to estimate the crop yield the final hay yield per unit area was determined after oven drying the samples at 105 c for 1 h and then at 65 c for 72 h residual no sampling areas at the field site were immediately removed with the bulk forage harvester to prepare the site for normal grass regrowth in 2020 a hard freeze occurred after spring green up and lasted for three weeks this freeze was harmful to alfalfa production additionally the fourth cutting in 2021 was harvested approximately 2 weeks earlier than usual since alfalfa dropped and experienced mildew due to frequent heavy rainfall 2 6 measurement and calculated parameters 2 6 1 weather data weather data including precipitation temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity data were collected from a portable weather station u30 hobo usa installed in the study field 2 6 2 soil physicochemical properties three locations in each mz and a total of 18 locations across the experimental field were chosen to investigate the soil physicochemical characteristics under vri and uri from four soil depths 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm at each location soil samples and two intact soil cores were collected using aluminum boxes and 100 cm3 rings respectively based on the particle fractions measured by a granulometer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern u k the soil texture was categorized using the soil texture triangle recommended by the usda shirazi and boersma 1984 the fc of the samples were determined according to the wilcox method wilcox 1962 the bulk density was measured by the volumetric cylinder method as described by iso iso 2017 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured by a laboratory test at a constant head of 56 cm klute 1965 soil organic matter was determined by dry combustion at 900 c using an elemental analyzer vario el iii elementar germany soil water was monitored at 9 am by a tdr trime tube system trime t3 tdr imko germany every day except on irrigation rainfall or harvest days throughout the growth period a pvc tube was installed in each plot as shown in fig 1b to track changes in the soil moisture of each mz considering the root distribution soil depth of 60 and 80 cm were measured in 20 cm increments for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively 2 6 3 deep percolation the deep percolation dp was measured using automatic weighing devices beijing sinton technology co ltd china with an accuracy of 0 02 mm in each mz the automatic weighing equipment was a stainless steel cylinder with a diameter of 30 cm and a height of 80 cm the cylinder was filled with undisturbed soil and grass of the same size the soil filled cylinder was kept on an electronic balance any water that percolated through the bottom of the cylinder was immediately pumped into an automatically weighed storage jar the data were recorded at 10 min intervals in total six automatic weighing devices were installed across the entire study field with one device in each subzone dp value of each mz was calculated as the mean of two subzones 2 6 4 crop water use the actual crop water use eta in the different growing seasons was estimated using the water balance method james 1988 kresović et al 2016 1 e t a δ s w i p o g w d p r where eta is the actual crop water use mm δsw is the change in soil water storage mm in the 0 60 cm sudangrass or 0 80 cm alfalfa soil layers between the initial and terminal stages i is the actual amount of irrigation mm po is the effective rainfall mm calculated by multiplying the total rainfall by the reduction coefficient the coefficient are 0 0 8 and 0 7 when the total rainfall is less than 5 mm between 5 mm and 50 mm and more than 50 mm respectively gw is the ground water contribution to water use which was ignored in this study because its deep depth exceeded 30 m dp is the deep percolation from the root zone which was measured by an automatic weighing device and r is the runoff caused by irrigation mm which was also ignored herein due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low irrigation rate for each event 2 6 5 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue was calculated by dividing the grass hay yield by eta 2 6 5 1 irrigation water use efficiency the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing the grass hay yield by the irrigated water 2 7 data analysis data from each irrigation treatment in each year were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova in which the treatments were separated using fisher s protected lsd at the 5 significance level spss 20 0 3 results 3 1 climate rainfall and irrigation the field region has a typical summer precipitation pattern with the majority of annual precipitation occurring in the second cutting of sudangrass and the last two cuttings of alfalfa from june to july 2019 the total rainfall during growing days of sudangrass was173 mm from april to september the total rainfall amounts during growing days of alfalfa were 414 mm in 2020 and 536 mm in 2021 in 2021 however all rainfall fell in the third and fourth cutting periods which lasted from late june to early september indicating an extreme rainfall pattern the precipitation in july and august varied dramatically among the three years of study with total amounts of 128 324 and 467 mm throughout in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the rainfall in august 2020 and in july 2021 were three times and twice that of the corresponding long term averages respectively table 2 among the three years of study no obvious differences in temperature or solar radiation were observed relatively high relative humidity and low solar radiation were observed in july 2021 compared to the previous two years due to frequent rainfall in 2019 the uri plots received 171 mm of seasonal irrigation water while the mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 under vri received 169 145 and 140 mm of water respectively in 2020 the seasonal irrigation amounts for the uri vri 1 vri 2 and vri 3 treatments were 374 382 359 and 359 mm respectively in 2021 the uri vri 1 vri 2 and vri 3 treatments received 304 294 293 and 300 mm of seasonal irrigation respectively when averaging the annual values of the subzones vri saved 11 5 and 2 of irrigation water during sudangrass and alfalfa growing seasons respectively table 3 in the rainy season the second cutting for sudangrass and last two cuttings for alfalfa vri saved more water than uri with average reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively excessive rainfall from july to august 2021 resulted in the absence of irrigation during the third and fourth cuttings generally the seasonal irrigation amount in mz 1 undergoing vri was close to that in the uri plots in three study years 3 2 soil water variation and deep percolation the variation trends in the 0 80 cm soil layer were nearly the same from 2019 to 2021 fig 3 before the rainy season the soil water content beneath a depth of 40 cm was steady for all treatments later it continued to rise and decrease as a result of rainfall and depletion these findings revealed that the movement of irrigation water mainly occurred at depths of 0 40 cm the results also supported our hypothesis that sudangrass and alfalfa roots were mainly distributed within the top 40 cm of soils the deep soil gravels in the field inhibited alfalfa root growth that was the reason why the relatively shallow soil wetting layer 40 cm was designed for the deep rooted alfalfa some differences in soil water were also observed between different soil layers the soil water profiles of the 0 20 cm depth were essentially similar among all treatments during the three years of study throughout all growing days the soil water of mz 3 was below that of the other managements at the 20 40 cm depth although the same water conditions were obtained under the uri treatments similarly the mz 1 soil water was clearly superior to the conditions measured in the other management plots at depths of 40 80 cm the dp results obtained for different mzs were displayed in fig 2 in total eleven dp values were measured during the growing days from 2019 to 2021 ranging from 3 to 68 mm specifically dp ranged from 3 to 56 mm 5 64 mm and 7 68 mm for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively all of the dp values were caused by heavy rainfall with the greater dp trending greater alongside lower fc in the 2019 season only one dp was observed after a 71 mm rainfall event with values of 37 43 and 57 mm for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 received totals of 119 148 and 176 mm in 2020 respectively and totals of 129 160 and 213 mm in 2021 respectively the average cumulative dp values were 95 117 and 149 mm per year for mz 1 mz 2 and mz 3 respectively it was worth noting that relatively large differences in dp existed when the rainfall amounts were similar for example averaging three mzs dp of approximately 23 mm was detected with 42 4 mm rainfall on 17july 2021 while only 11 mm of dp was measured after 41 2 mm rainfall event on 5 september 2020 this might be because the dp was determined using both the rainfall intensity and soil water content 3 3 yields and crop water use significant differences existed among the mzs in each cutting and annual harvests of sudangrass whereas significant differences in alfalfa harvests among the mzs existed only in the second cutting regardless of whether sudangrass or alfalfa was considered mz 3 produced a higher yield than the other treatments in the rainy season for example during the second cutting of sudangrass mz 2 and mz 3 obtained approximately 13 and 63 higher yields than mz 1 respectively and this difference was pronounced when using vri fig 4 similarly mz 3 obtained a greater alfalfa yield than the other two zones in the third cutting with heavy rainfall the frequent and strong rains supplied the soil water and maintained at a high level mz 3 had a much higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than mz 1 and mz 2 thus providing optimal growth conditions for sudangrass and alfalfa during the rainy season no significant differences were found between vri and uri in the three years when the data analysis was performed by grouping by different mzs to compare vri and uri however vri widened the yield gaps among mzs and increased the yields of both sudangrass and alfalfa figs 5 and 7 to some extent significant differences between vri and uri were buffered out by the high standard deviation sd among the three mzs with sds ranging from 333 to 1574 kg hm 2 and from 201 to 981 kg hm 2 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively the contributions of the sudangrass yields between cuttings to the annual harvests were similar with the first and second cuttings providing average proportions of the annual harvests of 46 and 54 respectively in contrast the alfalfa yields declined by successive harvests fig 6 the yield distributions in each cutting were typical patterns with proportions of 39 30 18 and 12 of the annual harvests as reported by li et al 2018 and zhao et al 2016 since a serious yield reduction was caused in the first cutting due to the delayed irrigation during the regrowth and hard freezing events in the branching stage the average annual yields in 2020 were approximately 3000 kg hm 2 lower than those in 2021 in total the alfalfa annual yields were better than the regional normal yield of 11855 kg hm 2 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 for the same cultivar table 4 showed the seasonal eta trends of sudangrass and alfalfa under various irrigation methods and mzs using the soil water balance approach similarly no significant differences were found between two irrigation methods although significant differences existed among the three mzs different soil water storage capacities resulted in significant differences among the three zones sudangrass had a far lower eta than alfalfa due to its short growth period of approximately three months the average seasonal eta of alfalfa in 2021 was 146 mm higher than that in 2020 due to adequate irrigation in the first cutting period and heavy rainfall in the third cutting period 3 4 wue and iwue significant differences were observed in wue and iwue among the mzs for both sudangrass and alfalfa no significant differences were observed in wue or iwue between uri and vri from 2019 to 2021 across all data under the two irrigation methods table 5 when further comparing the two irrigation methods in the same mzs vri was founded to improve the wue and iwue in all mzs the wue of alfalfa was 2 28 kg m 3 on average much higher than the local value of 1 78 kg m 3 reported by pan et al 2011 due to decreased water application vri slightly increased the wue and iwue although the yields were essentially equal this situation was more pronounced for zones with loamy sand soils especially in the rainy season for example in the second cutting period of 2019 the iwue under vri increased by approximately 48 and 63 for mz 2 and mz 3 respectively no irrigation was applied in the third or fourth cuttings of 2021 due to frequent rainfall consequently the iwue could not be calculated 3 5 spatial variability the spatial variabilities in the irrigation amount yields eta wue and iwue values between uri and vri were analyzed in this study to investigate the necessity of vri and the feasibility of mzs delineating based on the eca table 6 the degree of variation in eca in the test field was moderate with a coefficient of variation cv of 49 58 according to the soil variation classification lei et al 1985 the growth of sudangrass had a stronger response to soil spatial variabilities with the yields eta wue and iwue cvs ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 in contrast the spatial variabilities in these variables for alfalfa were relatively low ranging from only 1 13 6 12 for sudangrass the greatest variability as defined by the cvs was observed in the iwue followed by in the wue and annual yields for alfalfa the greatest variability was observed in the eta followed by in the annual yields overall regardless of whether uri or vri was applied the annual yields obtained relatively high cvs vri strengthened the variability in annual yields especially in the alfalfa seasons of 2020 and 2021 additionally vri helped increase the crop yields compared to uri all of these results indicated that vri could increase productivity under the given soil conditions in terms of the wue and iwue higher values and lower spatial variabilities demonstrated that vri conserved water by matching specific water requirements to different mzs the higher cvs of the wue and iwue results for vri in the sudangrass season were caused by the large differences in the second cutting yields 4 discussions in this paper we evaluated the application of vri in two typical forages on north china plain ncp despite the single year of data sudangrass growth was found to be more sensitive to soil spatial variabilities and vri management than alfalfa growth significant differences prevailed among the mzs in each cutting and annual harvests of sudangrass while only in the second cutting were observed significant differences in the alfalfa yield among mzs furthermore the cvs of the alfalfa yields were lower than those of the sudangrass yields the extensive roots of alfalfa might weaken the effects of variabilities in the soil conditions and irrigation amounts on alfalfa growth this could also be proven by the lower cvs of the alfalfa yields in 2021 the third established year meanwhile the adequate soil water storage generated by winter irrigation and rainfall through the previous year resulted in small alfalfa yield differences in the first cutting period when the rainy season arrived high temperatures and soil moisture increased the risks of pests and disease outbreaks mo et al 2011 and even caused alfalfa to enter dormancy consequently the alfalfa yield in the third and fourth cuttings showed little differences however sudangrass had a better tolerance for high temperatures and wet soil conditions than alfalfa allowing it to obtain higher yields and water productivity this is also the result of sudangrass being a c4 plant with a higher rate of net photosynthetic co2 assimilation rate than alfalfa which is a c3 plant leakey et al 2019 in total the significant differences and higher cvs of water management related parameters among the mzs illustrated two facts the feasibility of delineating mzs based on the eca and the greater importance of vri in sudangrass than in alfalfa irrigation managers are particularly concerned about soil moisture and dp in this study the substantial differences observed in dp among the three mzs were mainly attributed to soil hydraulic properties the hydraulic properties of the relatively coarse soil indicate a greater depth of wetting per unit quantity of infiltration water moves more quickly through the large pores in sandy soils than through the small pores in clayey soils the higher soil saturation water conductivity and lower fc of the mz 3 plots induced water to move into deep soils restricting the water from use by planta and thereby increasing the opportunity for dp to occur the dp values measured in this study were much higher than the results reported by li et al 2021 at the same experimental site which could be due to synthetic factors such as the amount and pattern of rainfall plant water uptake soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture bethune 2004 during the same period from june to september rainfall was relatively greater and intense in our study period reaching nearly twice that reported by li et al 2021 especially in 2021 sudangrass and alfalfa have lower transpiration than summer maize which reduces their water uptake rates from the soil profile fouli et al 2012 in addition there were obvious variations in soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture between these two studies although no significant differences were observed in the yield wue or iwue between uri and vri both for either sudangrass or alfalfa vri widened the yield gaps among mzs and increased the average yields the yield differences among mzs revealed that soil conditions played an important role in determining the yield vri irrigates using different water amounts according to the differences in the soil water holding capacity of the mzs thus allocating limited irrigation water to mzs with a high production potential this is why vri could save water and improve the wue and iwue conditions the advantages of saving water and increasing crop water productivity are more obvious in the rainy season than in other seasons continuous and severe rainfall result in variations in soil water between among mzs and thus require the application of vri to match different irrigation amounts for example vri increased sudangrass yield by approximately 500 kg hm 2 compared to that obtained under uri during the rainy season second cutting vri also conserved 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 of the water amount for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively during the rainy season we did not discover any environmental benefits resulting from vri in our study such as preventing deep percolation or runoff daccache et al 2015 perea et al 2018 this was because the irrigation schedule was based on the primary plant root depth 40 cm for both sudangrass and alfalfa whereas the deep percolation monitoring depth comprised the entire root soil layer 60 and 80 cm for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively furthermore due to extremely weak topographic variations and strong soil water conductivity performance in the experimental field no runoff was recorded overall this paper confirmed the vri advantages in terms of water conservation and improving water productivity for sudangrass and alfalfa on the ncp especially during the rainy seasons unlike many previous studies lamm et al 2012 clément et al 2022 alfalfa roots in our experimental field were certainly quite shallow and were primarily concentrated in the 0 40 cm soil layer as was reported in our previous studies meng et al 2020 the root growth of alfalfa in this study was mainly restricted by the sand soils containing large amounts of sand gravels below the 60 cm soil layer alfalfa roots were seldom observed at depths of 60 80 cm consequently it was logical to gauge deep percolation from alfalfa using a device with an 80 cm depth additionally it is a typical practice on the ncp to plant alfalfa in areas with poor soils as alfalfa can improve soil fertility inevitably the shallow root zone in our study area limited the storage of available water and water uptake in the soils and thereby affecting the growth and water use of alfalfa therefore further research on the use of vri in deep root alfalfa is necessary 5 conclusions a three year field experiment was carried out on the ncp during the summertime precipitation pattern the research field was divided into three mzs based on the eca and each mz was divided into two subzones to execute the vri and uri treatments the application depths of each subzone under the vri treatment were set as the corresponding differences between the current soil moisture and upper irrigation limits all of subzones received the same irrigation amounts the different mzs and irrigation treatments were compared in terms of the irrigation amount soil water variations crop yields eta wue and iwue although no significant differences existed between vri and uri in terms of the crop yields wue or iwue vri increased the crop yields wue and iwue values in both sudangrass and alfalfa significant differences existed among the mzs in each cutting and annual sudangrass harvest whereas significant differences in the alfalfa yield were observed among mzs only in the second cutting period compared to uri vri strengthened the variations in the annual yields eta wue and iwue sudangrass had a stronger response than alfalfa to spatial soil variabilities with the yields eta wue and iwue results providing cvs of ranging from 7 64 to 21 25 and from 1 13 to 7 63 for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively these findings support the feasibility of considering eca when delineating mzs vri saved 11 5 and 2 of irrigation water than uri when the results of the three mzs were averaged for the sudangrass and alfalfa seasons vri saved more water in the rainy season with averages reductions of 22 2 and 12 6 only in 2020 obtained for sudangrass and alfalfa respectively overall our research confirmed the advantages of vri with regards to conserving water and saving and increasing water productivity in two forages vri exhibited a better performance in sudangrass than in alfalfa although only one year data was obtained sudangrass declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

irrisurf2d is constituted by a combination of three elements i e i high resolution topographic data of ground surface ii two dimensional shallow water equations and iii one dimensional green ampt approach for describing infiltration process the modelling framework was validated with a real case study where timings of waterfront advance and water depths on the field were monitored during a border irrigation event the results show that irrisurf2d was able to reproduce both the timings of waterfront advance and the maximum water depths with high accuracy i e with average rmse below 2 min and 3 cm respectively model performance was robust and accurate even using literature parameters without a tailored calibration of infiltration and roughness parameters details of the digital terrain model which affect the computational grid resolution had a strong influence on the description of waterfront propagation a coarse grid resolution 1 m2 was found inadequate for reproducing reliable timings of waterfront advance and water depths in the field while with a finer grid 0 01 m2 as modelling input the simulation results appeared properly consistent with the observations the modeling approach appears promising to describe the dynamics of border irrigation and paves the way for the development of an operational tool for improving the management of surface irrigation keywords border irrigation two dimensional modelling microtopography on field measurements operational tools irrigation water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface irrigation is the oldest and currently the predominant irrigation practice worldwide vico and porporato 2011 soroush et al 2013 akbari et al 2018 according to the information included in the food and agriculture organization s aquastat web site international commission on irrigation and drainage available at http www icid org imp data pdf accessed on may 2022 surface irrigation is used on 97 of the irrigated land in india approx 60 8 mha 94 in china approx 57 8 mha 44 in the united states approx 22 4 mha and 100 in pakistan approx 19 6 mha in the eu this irrigation practice is predominant in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in the eu with about 4 7 mha of irrigated areas where irrigated areas are largely watered with surface irrigation methods masseroni et al 2017 in general among the different types of surface irrigation border irrigation is the most common method for watering row crops across the world fadul et al 2020 despite this irrigation technique continues to interest researchers owing to its low operation and maintenance costs e g very low energy consumptions compared with pressurized systems border irrigation often suffers from high inefficiency due to over irrigation and poor application uniformity gillies and smith 2015 morris et al 2015 chari et al 2019 in the border irrigation method water flows down the slope exploiting only gravity and when the desired amount of water has been delivered to the field the stream is turned off and this may occur before the water has reached the whole extent of the field guidelines defining how to calculate cutoff time according to soil characteristic can be found in literature brouwer et al 1988 even though they should be intended as merely indicative and this decision is typically taken according to the farmer s experience in addition the farmer s experience guides the land preparation before the irrigation season especially in terms of slope and strip width masseroni et al 2022 found that the correct implementation of these geometrical variables plays a fundamental role for increasing the efficiency of water usage of border irrigation practice it follows that efficient border irrigation systems require proper design and management which can be addressed by using specialized modeling tools alavi et al 2022 the performance of border irrigation systems depends on border dimensions border slope inflow rate cutoff time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 mailapalli 2008 smith et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the optimization of irrigation parameters has been an important topic of long term studies smith et al 2005 zerihun et al 1997 researchers have worked to improve border irrigation performance mainly optimizing border dimensions chen et al 2013 anwar et al 2016 inflow rates and cutoff times morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 evaluating the performance of this irrigation technique can play an essential role in the decisions made by farmers to reduce the gap between the potential and actual performance increasing water use efficiency at the field scale the first step to achieve this is to evaluate the current performance of border irrigation events for this purpose first the hydraulic behavior of the waterfront advancement should be described by hydrodynamic models and the models should be calibrated and validated by observed data sharifi et al 2021 secondly the simulations obtained changing geometrical border slope border width border length etc and or kinematic variables inflow rate irrigation duration etc in the calibrated hydrodynamic models should suggest novel design and management strategies based on the optimization of irrigation performances in terms of application efficiency and distribution uniformity mazarei et al 2020 a wide range of numerical models has been proposed to simulate border irrigation systems changes have been relevant from the standpoint of the equations on which these models were based researchers started solving simplified versions of the one dimensional saint venant equations i e kinematic wave e g walker and humpherys 1983 and diffusion wave e g clemmens 1979 strelkoff and souza 1984 schmitz and seus 1989 approximations one dimensional 1d field scale models such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009 sirmod walker 2003 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 are commonly used to simulate border irrigation these models assume that the waterfront is uniform along the border width and they cannot examine the impacts on irrigation performances of engineered changes in the field microtopography in such circumstances two dimensional models should be used when the variations of both longitudinal and transverse components of the waterfront are significant such as water flow velocity and water depth strelkoff et al 2003 two dimensional simulations permit overcoming many problems related to one dimensional modeling among them there are irregular field geometries or the spatial variability of key irrigation variables khanna and malano 2006 reviewed several surface irrigation models in the literature they concluded that two dimensional models had higher capabilities than one dimensional models furthermore these authors reported that the inclusion of microtopography soil undulations could improve the accuracy of simulations moreover many borders are characterized by irregular layouts singh and bhallamudi 1997 khanna et al 2003 or are irrigated by several point inflows these situations are best simulated with two dimensional models surface water flow in border irrigation is shallow and can be accurately described by complete hydrodynamic equations also called shallow water equations swe in two dimensional problems playán et al 1994 1996 proposed a numerical model for surface water flows in border irrigation based on the finite difference approach singh and bhallamudi 1997 bradford and katopodes 2001 and brufau et al 2002 developed numerical models by using the finite volume approach gandolfi and savi 2000 developed a mathematical model which integrates the complete two dimensional swes with the one dimensional richards equations to reduce the computational time and the complexity of the numerical schemes some approaches based on simplified governing equations have been proposed considering that surface water flow in border irrigation is slow thus inertia terms or acceleration terms of the complete hydrodynamic equations are sometimes ignored and zero inertia equations have been proposed these equations can be solved by a numerical approach more easily than complete hydrodynamic equations because of their simple mathematical properties strelkoff et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 in this context liu et al 2020 validated a zero inertia model even in presence of rapidly varied inflow discharge naghedifar et al 2019 proposed a basin border irrigation model combining the 2d overland flow equations based on the diffusion wave approximation of the swes with the 3d infiltration computed by the mixed form of richards equation using a non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to speed up the model computation performance liu et al 2021 developed a semi lagrangian solution of the 2d shallow water equations that was found to be computationally six times more efficient than the eulerian scheme considered by the authors githui et al 2020 adapted the 2d anuga model originally developed for inundation simulations to simulate border and basin irrigation by incorporating an infiltration algorithm based on empirical formulations the correct implementation of the infiltration process is an important work that can help to improve the description of the dynamics of border irrigations bautista et al 2009 from a physical point of view most of the water applied during irrigation events infilters in the vertical direction whereas later infiltration through the berms can be ignored bo et al 2012 according to this traditional tools such as winsrfr sirmod and sisco use one dimensional empirical formulas for infiltration computations where all variables are functions of distance and time only the most widely applied family of infiltration formulations is the one based on kostiakov equations kostiakov 1932 which models a declining infiltration rate with the opportunity time i e the time during which water is available for infiltration at each point along the length of the wetted border a modification of the kostiakov equation for taking into account the macropore infiltration was proposed by lewis 1937 and this new formulation is well known in the literature as kostiakov lewis equation despite kostiakov equation have a long history of use in surface irrigation engineering analyses they require to be well calibrated to fit accurately the real infiltration processes therefore measures of advance and recession trajectories or of the volumetric water content at different depths and along the longitudinal direction of the field should be performed at each irrigation event for a good determination of infiltration parameters pereira et al 2007 more complex physical formulations such as richards equation were tested and implemented in two dimensional hydrodynamic models gandolfi and savi 2000 but difficulties to reach converged solutions in reasonable computational times were observed the semi physical approaches appear to be the better solutions kacimov et al 2010 since they reproduce a simplistic but elegant approximation for infiltration when water is ponded on the soil surface in light of the previous considerations this work proposes a novel integrated modelling framework based on the combination of on field measurements and hydrodynamic modelling for describing the dynamics of border irrigation more in detail in this work the structure of the modelling framework is constituted by a combination of i high resolution topographic information and ii two dimensional surface hydrodynamic modelling coupled with a semi physical infiltration modelling that will be described and tested the proposed approach overcomes the simplification related to i the one dimensional water front advance description ii the empirical representation of the infiltration processes iii the flat delineation of the ground surface providing a tool that might support the management of border irrigations at field scale performances of the proposed approach evaluated in terms of the ability to describe i the times of the waterfront advance and ii the actual water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field during irrigations have been estimated by comparing modelling outputs with observations obtained in a real world case study where border irrigation events were accurately monitored during the 2022 agricultural season 2 framework of the modelling approach correct management of the water distribution onto the field during the irrigation events can help to reduce water consumption making the watering more consistent with the crop water needs to reach this goal in the context of border irrigations an optimal combination of flow rate cutoff time distance field strip size and slope should be investigated the proposed modelling framework whose structure is reported in fig 1 provides a useful tool able to analyze the impact of different combinations of these variables on the overall performance of border irrigations it combines microtopography infiltration and hydrodynamic information and takes advantage of direct on field measurements when available for improving the description of surface water dynamics on borders in the following the main components of the modelling framework are presented 2 1 exploring microtopographic characteristics of the ground surface several studies emphasized the need to pay more attention to the spatial variability of microtopography in basin irrigation design for management and decision making purposes see for example bai et al 2017 bai et al 2011 moreover there is some evidence that the spatial variability of surface elevations has more influence on basin irrigation performance than the spatial variability of infiltration zapata and playán 2000 on the other hand the potential of the 2d fully dynamic shallow water modelling for the management of surface irrigation systems can be effectively explored once high resolution topographic surface models are available to finely describe the physical effects associated to the inertial and convective terms that gain more significance in high resolution modeling especially in the case of low water depths cea and costabile 2022 to this aim several survey techniques are available and the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles uav for performing photogrammetric surveys fits very well in this context in fact by properly setting flight parameters see e g pagliari et al 2017 ground sample distance gsd i e the average ground resolution of the digital acquisitions of centimeter level can be reached moreover measuring also some ground control points gcps by gnss or total stations gagliolo et al 2018 accuracies at the same level of gsd can be obtained this means that the photogrammetric derived digital terrain models dtms meet the requirements of microtopography 2 2 describing water propagation onto the field simulation of the water propagation on the border strips has been based on the fully dynamic version of the 2d shallow water equations expressed in eq 1 1 u t f x g y s where 2 u h h u h v f h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s r f g h s 0 x s f x g h s 0 y s f y in which t s is time x m and y m are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u m s v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration f m s is the infiltration losses s 0 x m m and s 0 y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions s f x m m and s f y m m are the friction slopes in x and y directions s f x and s f y were computed as in eq 3 3 s f x n u 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 s f y n v 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 in which n is the manning coefficient which is one of the parameters of the model that needs calibration the numerical integration of eq 1 was obtained using the irrisurf2d code which is a specific extension for border irrigation of the flood propagation model developed for research purposes at the university of calabria italy based on the expertise in the field of fluvial pluvial and urban flood modelling acquired in previous studies among the most recent ones see for example costabile et al 2020 costabile and costanzo 2021 costabile et al 2021 padulano et al 2021 costabile et al 2022 barbero et al 2022 the key features of irrisurf2d include the use of the well known roe riemann solver for the computation of the numerical fluxes the adoption of an upwind approach to discretize the bottom variations and of a semi implicit treatment of the friction source term finally the time steps are estimated according to the courant friedrichs lewy condition to ensure the model stability the computational domain is generated using an unstructured grid of irregular triangular elements and a robust wet dry procedure is considered irrisurf2d is coded in fortran 90 and is configured for parallel execution using message passing interface mpi directives in order to reduce computational time 2 3 simulating infiltration process the infiltration process in the irrisurf2d model has been simulated through the semi physical green ampt ga formula green and ampt 1911 described by eq 4 4 f t k s t ψ δ θ ln 1 f t ψ δ θ where f represents the cumulative amount of infiltrated water k s is the conductivity of the saturated profile δθ is the difference between the water content of the saturated soil approx the soil effective porosity η and the initial water content ϑ i before infiltration began ψ is the soil suction head on the interface between the wet soil layer and the underlining dry soil the ga formula has been chosen due to i the simplicity in its implementation and computation and ii the definition of its parameters which have a physical meaning therefore they can be adjusted within realistic ranges of values obtained from previous literature experiences achieved in similar contexts of the examined fields the infiltration losses f in eq 5 have been then evaluated by deriving eq 4 over time 5 f t k s k ψ δ θ f t the discretization in time of eqs 4 and 5 and the valuation of the rate of water available to infiltrate before and after the ponding time are calculated in a coupled manner within the swes considering the approach proposed in fiedler and ramirez 2000 3 application of the modelling framework on a real world case study 3 1 field characteristics the performances of the modelling approach were evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed timings of the waterfront advance and water depths along the field monitored during one of the watering events carried out in a maize field about 2 ha in size and subdivided into strip sectors located in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in eu in the year 2022 the employed irrigation method in the experimental field is closed border irrigation more in detail the water flows onto the field through a series of steel gates which are opened manually in sequence to supply water to each strip starting from the main supply canal at the upper end of the field this practice is shown in fig 2 where the first watering carried out in the experimental field immediately after the sowing in the year 2021 is presented once the water is released onto the field it is gravity driven following the longitudinal slope of the field this latter was found at about 6 5 through the procedure described in section 3 2 1 the monitored irrigation event was performed on may 23 about one month after the sowing with regards to soil properties disturbed soil samples at different depths about 10 30 and 50 cm were collected at five different points of the field to evaluate soil texture the analysis of the samples showed a predominance of sandy sandy loam texture with a skeleton higher than 30 no vertical pattern in soil layers was found in the field which could thus be considered homogeneous along the vertical profile the level of the groundwater table was about 5 m from the ground surface thus the potential interactions of the capillary fringe with the infiltration process can be neglected additional information about the study domain is reported by masseroni et al 2022 whereas specific information regarding the monitored field is summarized in table 1 3 2 measurements 3 2 1 microtopography survey microtopography of the ground surface of the experimental field was determined just after the sowing through a photogrammetric flight performed through a dji mavic 2 pro uav acquiring 366 images at about 36 5 m a g l leading to a gsd of about 0 8 cm the images were processed with the agisoft metashape software version 1 7 0 including also some gcps that were measured by nrtk gnss network real time kinematic global navigation satellite system with a centimetric accuracy the estimated model accuracy evaluated at the gcps is 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm in the planimetric and altimetric components respectively from the photogrammetric dense point cloud a digital terrain model dtm with about 3 cm resolution was computed and provided as input of the two dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the dtm of the experimental field is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 flow rate and irrigation event duration the flow rate during the irrigation event was determined by measuring the flow level in the supply canals where the flow can reasonably be considered to be in uniform condition the roughness parameter was calibrated at the beginning of the irrigation season using the well known manning strickler formula ven te chow 1959 in which 1 the flow rate was measured by a manual portable magnetic inductive flow meter flow sensor nautilus c 2000 ott usa by using the so called conventional current meter methodology anon 2010 peruzzi et al 2021 2 the canal slope was evaluated using a portable global positioning system gps grs 1 topcon japan vertical accuracy of 2 5 cm 3 the cross section area and the hydraulic radius were computed considering the shape of the cross section trapezoidal and a graduated rod precision is 1 mm for the measurement of the water depth using this information the estimated strickler coefficient was equal to 75 m1 3 s 1 the watering time of each strip of the experimental field was measured using a chronometer during the irrigation event additional information on the measurement campaigns is reported in masseroni et al 2022 3 2 3 water depth onto the field the monitoring of the water depth evolution onto the field during the irrigation event and therefore the timings of the waterfront advance was carried out through 10 crafted water level devices specifically developed for this study which were installed along the longitudinal direction of the field see s1 s2 s10 shown in fig 3 such devices consist of an arduino nano microcontroller and they are equipped with an ultrasonic range finder sensor hy srf 05 model az delivery germany the single sensor works as both an ultrasound transmitter and receiver and it can be used to measure distances in a range between 0 02 and 4 5 m with resolution up to 0 2 cm a maximum measurement frequency of 40 hz and a detection angle of 15 a digital thermometer ds18b20 model az delivery germany was used to adjust the ultrasonic signal on the basis of air temperature distance data were recorded every 0 2 s and downloaded insitu at the end of the irrigation intervention the device was able to detect distances under different flow regimes with a high level of accuracy as demonstrated during several tests performed in the open channel flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of pavia italy fig 4 shows the electronic circuit diagram of the water level device and an example of its installation in the field the sensors were installed in the second sector just before the irrigation event and removed right after the water depth across the field was completely depleted the water level sensors were installed at 5 10 15 20 30 50 75 110 145 and 180 m from the head of the field see fig 3 3 3 modelling settings the model setup can be summarized as follows 1 generation of the computational grid for a required spatial resolution 2 determination of the initial and boundary conditions 3 parameters assumptions and estimations as mentioned in section 2 2 the numerical model is built upon computational domains represented by irregular triangular elements so that a variable resolution can be set throughout the field however the use of a uniform resolution is more practical considering the purposes of the work specifically we generated three different grids having substantially uniform resolutions 0 01 m2 fine grid 0 1 m2 medium grid and 1 m2 coarse grid in order to assess how much the dynamics of surface irrigation are influenced by the microtopographic features of the field the numerical grids were generated using the aquaveo sms surface water modeling system software in which it was possible to interpolate the ground levels related to the input dtm described in section 3 2 1 onto the grid nodes associated with the fine medium and coarse grid in practice the microtopographic features are progressively lost when moving from the fine to the coarse grid being only the finer grid able to adequately exploit all the topographic information as regards the boundary conditions we imposed the flow rate and the cutoff time of the examined sector in the computational cells that cover the inflow section and the associated critical flow condition for the computation of the water depths downstream we set closed boundary conditions the field was assumed to be initially dry so the water depths were set to a very low value everywhere 10 9 m finally the four parameters of the model n k s δ θ ψ were assumed uniformly distributed onto the field this assumption is reasonable at least for the parameter related to the ga formula since the soil samples revealed that the soil was quite homogeneous along all directions of the field the initial soil moisture condition was obtained from a multilevel soil moisture probe teros12 meter group usa averaging the monitored volumetric water content just before the irrigation event over about 0 5 m of depth i e approximately the depth of the rooted layer the initial soil moisture ϑ i was then subtracted from the effective porosity η to obtain δ θ i e the actual soil space that water can exploit during the infiltration process 3 4 performance evaluation the performance of the modelling approach was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated times of the waterfront advance and the water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field the metric used for this purpose was the root mean square error rmse described in eq 6 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where p i are the simulated values o i are the observed values and n is the total number of observations before evaluating the irrisurf2d model performance the four parameters of the model k s ψ δθ and n were calibrated using an expeditious procedure considering as border conditions the flow rate and the cutoff time of the examined sector i e the second sector and as a computational mesh a fine grid resolution of 0 01 m2 the model parameters were estimated with the aim to reproduce the observed timings of waterfront advance but ensuring also a reasonable prediction of the maximum water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field starting from the ranges typically proposed in literature for both ga parameters in sandy sandy loam soils and the roughness of cultivated fields rawls et al 1983 the model parameters were slightly adjusted to fit the observed data the comparison between model results and experimental measurements was analyzed from a statistical point of view specifically in order to filter out the noise component and uncertainty in the dtm generation and consequently in the simulation results the median of the simulated values in an area of 2 m2 surrounding the position of water level sensors was computed instead of considering the simulated water depth in the computational cell closest to the position of the sensors themselves the effects of different grid resolutions on model performances were examined as well considering the computational grids mentioned in section 3 3 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the irrigation event the characteristics of the selected irrigation event are summarized in table 2 where the flow rate cutoff time an average water depth and volume of irrigation are presented for each irrigated sector the average flow rate and irrigation duration were respectively about 350 l s and 31 min the applied water depth and the irrigated volume for the sector resulted in about 180 mm and 650 m3 on average overall a total volume of irrigation of about 3200 m3 was distributed onto the field with an irrigation event duration of about 2 5 h concerning the examined sector i e the second sector it was irrigated with a flow rate of 354 l s for 35 min this led to an applied water depth onto the sector of about 188 mm the monitored volumetric soil water content before the irrigation event of may 23rd resulted to be about 0 2 m3 m3 i e about half of the effective porosity generally indicated in literature for sandy sandy loam soils η 0 4 4 2 performance of the modelling approach the results of the nine simulations performed adjusting the irrisurf2d model parameters are summarized in table 3 more in detail the model parameters were adjusted starting from the selected literature parameters reported in sim1 for a sandy sandy loam type of soil in general all simulations resulted consistent with the observations for both timings of waterfront advance and maximum water depths the rmse between the observed and simulated periods of the waterfront advance was less than 7 min in all cases whereas between observed and simulated maximum water depth was less than 5 cm the sim 8 characterized by n k s θ and ψ respectively equal to 0 1 s m1 3 100 mm h 0 2 and 20 cm has resulted to be the more accurate simulation with an average rmse over the ten monitored points of about 1 min between observed and simulated times of the waterfront advance and 2 7 cm between observed and simulated maximum water depths therefore these parameters were considered in the analysis discussed in the following sections the computational time needed to perform a generic simulation is approximately 30 min for 60 min of the real event considering the number of cells approximately 106 and mostly the very low value of their size 0 01 m2 that drastically limits the time step according to the stability requirements provided by the cfl condition the efficiency of the numerical model can be considered good the model performances are also reported in figs 5 and 6 where the scatter plot of the computed and observed times of the waterfront advance and maximum water depths is followed by a comparison between simulated and measured values of times of the waterfront advance and maximum water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field fig 5a shows the very good performances of model predictions in terms of times of water advance since the points are very close to the line of perfect agreement as further confirmation the coefficient of determination r2 is approximately equal to 0 99 a limited variability of model estimations was observed also along the longitudinal direction of the field as shown in fig 5b in general the interquartile range resulted less than 1 min in all the monitored points the accuracies in reproducing the maximum water depths are less than those obtained for the times of water advance but they can be considered acceptable for the purpose of the modelling framework i e supporting the surface irrigation management computed and observed maximum water depths resulted slightly dispersed around the line of perfect agreement as shown in fig 6a in this case the coefficient of determination r2 is equal to 0 77 in addition the variability of model estimation along the longitudinal direction of the field resulted more emphasized at the beginning and at end of the field point s1 s2 s9 and s10 with an interquartile range of about 2 3 cm that is more than double on average than that obtained between s3 and s8 fig 6b the evolution of measured and simulated water depths onto the field is reported in fig 7 in general the model appears able to reliably reproduce the observed water depths in all monitored points i e from s1 to s10 small differences were observed in the last part of the field where overestimations of the simulated water depths with respect to measurements were found probably due to some boundary effect simulated shapes of water depletion after irrigation appear very consistent with the observations in all monitored points confirming the accuracy of the ga approach in the description of the infiltration process in border irrigation 4 3 effects of grid resolution on model performance medium and coarse grids defined in section 3 3 were used to perform simulations aimed at the evaluation of the effects on the model performance caused by different resolutions the results are shown in table 4 where the rmse between observed and simulated times of waterfront advance and maximum water depths is reported for the three different considered grid resolutions in general a significant reduction in model performances was found when the detail of the computational grid changes from fine to coarse the rmse increased by about 12 times on average in case of time of waterfront advance 1 1 min in fine grid and 12 5 min in coarse grid and by about 2 times in case of maximum water depth 2 7 cm in fine grid and 6 9 cm in coarse grid the decreasing of model performance connected with the lowering of grid resolution had repercussions on the description of surface flow dynamics in fig 8 the timings of waterfront advance fig 8a and the maximum water depths fig 8b for different grid resolutions are compared a significant reduction in the speed of waterfront advance was found at a distance of about 50 m from the head of the field which corresponds with the position of sensor s6 if the coarse grid was considered in this case the waterfront advance was interrupted before reaching the end of the field the same effect was found using in the model a medium grid but in this case the waterfront advance was interrupted at about 110 m from the head of the field i e where s8 sensor is located using a fine grid instead the model was able to match the observations both in case of times of waterfront advance and the maximum water depths in fig 9 the effects of the changes in grid resolution on the temporal evolution of the waterfront advance are presented in particular three instants in time i e 1 5 and 10 min following the irrigation event were considered the results show that the use of the fine grid allows an accurate and more realistic simulation of the waterfront advance which instead is not captured by using the grid with 1 m2 of resolution significant differences in progressive waterfront distances from the head of the field were accumulated during the simulation in particular about 25 m of difference in waterfront advance between fine and coarse grid were found after 10 min of simulation errors in the lateral spread of waterfront advance were also found if the coarse grid is used in particular from 5 min onward unrealistic lateral overflows were reproduced as a consequence of a minor topographic detail that is not able to consider the presence of the levees separating the strips the differences in grid resolutions affect the spatial distribution of cumulative infiltration volumes as well fig 10 considering the coarse grid the infiltration process remained confined to the first 65 m i e about 30 of the total length of the field clearly the simulations related to the medium and coarse grid are computationally less demanding than that one based on the fine grid as regards the medium grid 105 elements the computational time was approximately 2 min whereas only 27 s were needed to perform a generic simulation using the coarse grid 104 elements 5 discussion the rmse values reported in table 4 highlighted that grid resolution change from coarse to medium didn t improve model performance too much while from medium to fine the model performance was improved a lot therefore searching for a critical grid resolution as a trade off between computational time and model performance could be interesting for this reason three additional computational grids have been generated having resolutions equal to 0 02 m2 0 05 m2 and 0 08 m2 for comparative purposes we introduce here the accuracy variation index avi and the performance variation index pvi defined as in eq 7 and eq 8 respectively 7 a v i rmse fine grid rmse generic grid 8 p v i 1 computational time generic grid computational time fine grid in which rmse values are related to the timings of waterfront advance avi provides information about the accuracy of the solution obtained using a generic grid compared to that obtained with the finest grid its value is lower than 1 and approaches to zero as the rmse of the generic grid deviates with respect to that of the fine grid pvi gives indication about the computational time saving induced by the use of a generic grid in relation to the finest grid therefore the greater its value the greater is the reduction of the run time both avi and pvi values expressed as function of the grid resolution ratio grr defined as the ratio between the resolution of the generic and the finest grids are reported in fig 11 fig 11 highlights the fact that the accuracy of the solution is characterized by a non linear behavior in which as expected avi decreases as the grid size increases in particular doubling the area of the computational element with respect to the finest grid grr 2 induces the halving of avi 0 5 however for grr 2 the rmse value is about 2 2 min so that the overall result may be still considered satisfying for grr 8 avi reduces of one order of magnitude and the overall accuracy seems to be independent from the grr value confirming what has been reported in table 4 moreover the waterfront stopped before the end of the field for grr values equal to or greater than 8 and this contradicted the observations conversely the performance in terms of computational times rapidly increases for lower values of grr whereas no significant benefits can be observed for grr 5 in particular for grr 2 the pvi value is approximately 0 65 meaning that doubling the area of the computational cell in respect to the finest grid leads to an important reduction of the computational times of course the pvi values are strictly connected to both the hardware characteristics of the cpu cluster used in this work and the efficiency of the numerical code therefore they should be considered carefully just as a gross indication however the simulation related to grr 2 that is grid resolution equal to 0 02 m2 seems to be a good balance between accuracy of the results and reduced computational times as in any modelling study model calibration is required where the optimized parameters are not readily observed in modelling framework of this study three out of four parameters ks ψ and n were slightly adjusted starting from those suggested in literature whereas the remaining one θ was obtained by combining field measurements of volumetric water content before the irrigation events and literature values of effective porosity with regard to the set of parameter values that provided the best performances sim 8 table 3 it is interesting to note that n and k s fall exactly within the range reported in literature for the type of soil of the experimental field sim 1 table 3 while ψ is larger i e from 5 cm to 20 cm this is probably due to the dependence of the water suction head in the ga infiltration process on initial soil moisture conditions ϑ i in fact aggelides and youngs 1978 by investigating the dependence of the ga parameters on the initial water content in draining and wetting states found that in sandy soils ψ was significantly influenced by the initial soil moisture condition when this latter resulted in less than 0 3 m3 m3 they found a linear relationship between ψ and ϑ i which in case of ϑ i equal to 0 2 m3 m3 i e the initial soil moisture condition registered in our case study the value of ψ resulted in about 17 cm very close to the value found in our study these results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed modelling approach in reproducing surface dynamics also when typical literature observations for calibrating ga and roughness are used concerning the simulation of the infiltration process additional spatial and temporal measurements of infiltration volumes should be performed for validating the model estimations however in the absence of these data the good representation of the surface phenomenon while respecting the conservation of the mass also implies a good representation of the infiltration process in fact in githui et al 2020 the infiltration volume in time compared to the numerical results is obtained as the difference between the total incoming volume and that one observed on the surface this confirms that performing good measurements of water depth along the longitudinal direction of the field during irrigation events as carried out in our work can help to validate the model estimations both in surface water dynamic and infiltration process a limitation of the proposed modelling approach is that the spatial and temporal variability of ga model parameters is neglected moreover the use of a constant roughness parameter could influence flow dynamics as well the effect of these limitations can be observed in fig 7 where the simulated water depths are slightly inconsistent with observations especially at the end of the field point s10 i e where the velocities are reduced in the study of mailapalli et al 2008 a methodology for taking into account the spatial and temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient under bare and cropped field conditions as well as between the irrigation events was developed more in detail manning s coefficient n varied with the crop growing water depth flow velocity and in particular before and after the cut off time however the complexity and the computational effort of the mailapalli et al 2008 solution were not accompanied by a significant improvement in the description of surface irrigation dynamics this further confirms that the irrisurf2d approach can provide a reliable representation of the dynamics of surface waterings without requiring very high model complexity and computational times concerning the results obtained with grids of different resolutions table 4 and figs 8 10 demonstrate that the ground microtopography details are needed for an exhaustive representation of surface and subsurface water dynamics in border irrigation this result corroborates the experimental evidence found by bai et al 2011 and githui et al 2020 high resolutions of topographic characteristics of the ground surface are required if a 2d hydrodynamic modelling is used for describing dynamics of surface irrigations especially when water depths onto the field are of the same order of magnitude as ground roughness finally it may be interesting to highlight the good efficiency of the numerical model used in this work since it is configured for parallel execution using message passing interface mpi directives in order to drastically reduce the computational time to the author s knowledge this is the first time in the literature that such an approach is used in the context of surface irrigation 6 conclusion in this work irrisurf2d a new integrated modelling framework based on a combination of high resolution topographic data infiltration and surface hydrodynamic modelling is proposed with the aim to obtain detailed simulations of border irrigation events and ultimately to improve the management of this widespread irrigation method more in detail irrisurf2d couples the two dimensional shallow water equation with a semi physical infiltration model based on the green ampt approach in order to describe the advance phase of the border irrigation irrisurf2d fully exploits microtopography information obtained by detailed topographic surveys for simulating the surface water dynamics during irrigations and its parameters can be effectively calibrated using on field measurements of flowrate cut off time timings of water advance water depths onto the field and soil moisture results obtained using data collected at an experimental field showed that when using a high resolution grid to represent the microtopography irrisurf2d is able to accurately reproduce both times of water advance and water depths onto the field with parameter values falling within the range of variability indicated in the literature for the specific soil of the experimental field this increases the possibility to apply the modelling framework with a limited amount of field observations for parameters calibration or even when field measurements are not available however the results also show that the grid resolution plays a significant role with simulation quality significantly deteriorating when applying coarser grids the results of this work can be considered relevant in view of the implementation of an operational tool aimed to support strategies for improving the design and management of border irrigation the next goal is to investigate the effects on irrigation performances i e water saving distribution uniformity etc of different combinations of flow rate cut off time distance field strip size and initial moisture conditions the combined effects of microtopography accuracy and spatial and temporal variability of model parameters will be also further investigated a key challenge will be to translate the findings obtained through a combination of field experiments and modelling exercises into operational guidelines and best practices leading to a significant increase in border irrigation efficiency

9211,the structure of an integrated hydrodynamic modelling framework intended to describe the dynamics of surface irrigation is presented in this work specifically the modelling framework named irrisurf2d is constituted by a combination of three elements i e i high resolution topographic data of ground surface ii two dimensional shallow water equations and iii one dimensional green ampt approach for describing infiltration process the modelling framework was validated with a real case study where timings of waterfront advance and water depths on the field were monitored during a border irrigation event the results show that irrisurf2d was able to reproduce both the timings of waterfront advance and the maximum water depths with high accuracy i e with average rmse below 2 min and 3 cm respectively model performance was robust and accurate even using literature parameters without a tailored calibration of infiltration and roughness parameters details of the digital terrain model which affect the computational grid resolution had a strong influence on the description of waterfront propagation a coarse grid resolution 1 m2 was found inadequate for reproducing reliable timings of waterfront advance and water depths in the field while with a finer grid 0 01 m2 as modelling input the simulation results appeared properly consistent with the observations the modeling approach appears promising to describe the dynamics of border irrigation and paves the way for the development of an operational tool for improving the management of surface irrigation keywords border irrigation two dimensional modelling microtopography on field measurements operational tools irrigation water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface irrigation is the oldest and currently the predominant irrigation practice worldwide vico and porporato 2011 soroush et al 2013 akbari et al 2018 according to the information included in the food and agriculture organization s aquastat web site international commission on irrigation and drainage available at http www icid org imp data pdf accessed on may 2022 surface irrigation is used on 97 of the irrigated land in india approx 60 8 mha 94 in china approx 57 8 mha 44 in the united states approx 22 4 mha and 100 in pakistan approx 19 6 mha in the eu this irrigation practice is predominant in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in the eu with about 4 7 mha of irrigated areas where irrigated areas are largely watered with surface irrigation methods masseroni et al 2017 in general among the different types of surface irrigation border irrigation is the most common method for watering row crops across the world fadul et al 2020 despite this irrigation technique continues to interest researchers owing to its low operation and maintenance costs e g very low energy consumptions compared with pressurized systems border irrigation often suffers from high inefficiency due to over irrigation and poor application uniformity gillies and smith 2015 morris et al 2015 chari et al 2019 in the border irrigation method water flows down the slope exploiting only gravity and when the desired amount of water has been delivered to the field the stream is turned off and this may occur before the water has reached the whole extent of the field guidelines defining how to calculate cutoff time according to soil characteristic can be found in literature brouwer et al 1988 even though they should be intended as merely indicative and this decision is typically taken according to the farmer s experience in addition the farmer s experience guides the land preparation before the irrigation season especially in terms of slope and strip width masseroni et al 2022 found that the correct implementation of these geometrical variables plays a fundamental role for increasing the efficiency of water usage of border irrigation practice it follows that efficient border irrigation systems require proper design and management which can be addressed by using specialized modeling tools alavi et al 2022 the performance of border irrigation systems depends on border dimensions border slope inflow rate cutoff time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 mailapalli 2008 smith et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the optimization of irrigation parameters has been an important topic of long term studies smith et al 2005 zerihun et al 1997 researchers have worked to improve border irrigation performance mainly optimizing border dimensions chen et al 2013 anwar et al 2016 inflow rates and cutoff times morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 evaluating the performance of this irrigation technique can play an essential role in the decisions made by farmers to reduce the gap between the potential and actual performance increasing water use efficiency at the field scale the first step to achieve this is to evaluate the current performance of border irrigation events for this purpose first the hydraulic behavior of the waterfront advancement should be described by hydrodynamic models and the models should be calibrated and validated by observed data sharifi et al 2021 secondly the simulations obtained changing geometrical border slope border width border length etc and or kinematic variables inflow rate irrigation duration etc in the calibrated hydrodynamic models should suggest novel design and management strategies based on the optimization of irrigation performances in terms of application efficiency and distribution uniformity mazarei et al 2020 a wide range of numerical models has been proposed to simulate border irrigation systems changes have been relevant from the standpoint of the equations on which these models were based researchers started solving simplified versions of the one dimensional saint venant equations i e kinematic wave e g walker and humpherys 1983 and diffusion wave e g clemmens 1979 strelkoff and souza 1984 schmitz and seus 1989 approximations one dimensional 1d field scale models such as winsrfr bautista et al 2009 sirmod walker 2003 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 are commonly used to simulate border irrigation these models assume that the waterfront is uniform along the border width and they cannot examine the impacts on irrigation performances of engineered changes in the field microtopography in such circumstances two dimensional models should be used when the variations of both longitudinal and transverse components of the waterfront are significant such as water flow velocity and water depth strelkoff et al 2003 two dimensional simulations permit overcoming many problems related to one dimensional modeling among them there are irregular field geometries or the spatial variability of key irrigation variables khanna and malano 2006 reviewed several surface irrigation models in the literature they concluded that two dimensional models had higher capabilities than one dimensional models furthermore these authors reported that the inclusion of microtopography soil undulations could improve the accuracy of simulations moreover many borders are characterized by irregular layouts singh and bhallamudi 1997 khanna et al 2003 or are irrigated by several point inflows these situations are best simulated with two dimensional models surface water flow in border irrigation is shallow and can be accurately described by complete hydrodynamic equations also called shallow water equations swe in two dimensional problems playán et al 1994 1996 proposed a numerical model for surface water flows in border irrigation based on the finite difference approach singh and bhallamudi 1997 bradford and katopodes 2001 and brufau et al 2002 developed numerical models by using the finite volume approach gandolfi and savi 2000 developed a mathematical model which integrates the complete two dimensional swes with the one dimensional richards equations to reduce the computational time and the complexity of the numerical schemes some approaches based on simplified governing equations have been proposed considering that surface water flow in border irrigation is slow thus inertia terms or acceleration terms of the complete hydrodynamic equations are sometimes ignored and zero inertia equations have been proposed these equations can be solved by a numerical approach more easily than complete hydrodynamic equations because of their simple mathematical properties strelkoff et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 in this context liu et al 2020 validated a zero inertia model even in presence of rapidly varied inflow discharge naghedifar et al 2019 proposed a basin border irrigation model combining the 2d overland flow equations based on the diffusion wave approximation of the swes with the 3d infiltration computed by the mixed form of richards equation using a non orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to speed up the model computation performance liu et al 2021 developed a semi lagrangian solution of the 2d shallow water equations that was found to be computationally six times more efficient than the eulerian scheme considered by the authors githui et al 2020 adapted the 2d anuga model originally developed for inundation simulations to simulate border and basin irrigation by incorporating an infiltration algorithm based on empirical formulations the correct implementation of the infiltration process is an important work that can help to improve the description of the dynamics of border irrigations bautista et al 2009 from a physical point of view most of the water applied during irrigation events infilters in the vertical direction whereas later infiltration through the berms can be ignored bo et al 2012 according to this traditional tools such as winsrfr sirmod and sisco use one dimensional empirical formulas for infiltration computations where all variables are functions of distance and time only the most widely applied family of infiltration formulations is the one based on kostiakov equations kostiakov 1932 which models a declining infiltration rate with the opportunity time i e the time during which water is available for infiltration at each point along the length of the wetted border a modification of the kostiakov equation for taking into account the macropore infiltration was proposed by lewis 1937 and this new formulation is well known in the literature as kostiakov lewis equation despite kostiakov equation have a long history of use in surface irrigation engineering analyses they require to be well calibrated to fit accurately the real infiltration processes therefore measures of advance and recession trajectories or of the volumetric water content at different depths and along the longitudinal direction of the field should be performed at each irrigation event for a good determination of infiltration parameters pereira et al 2007 more complex physical formulations such as richards equation were tested and implemented in two dimensional hydrodynamic models gandolfi and savi 2000 but difficulties to reach converged solutions in reasonable computational times were observed the semi physical approaches appear to be the better solutions kacimov et al 2010 since they reproduce a simplistic but elegant approximation for infiltration when water is ponded on the soil surface in light of the previous considerations this work proposes a novel integrated modelling framework based on the combination of on field measurements and hydrodynamic modelling for describing the dynamics of border irrigation more in detail in this work the structure of the modelling framework is constituted by a combination of i high resolution topographic information and ii two dimensional surface hydrodynamic modelling coupled with a semi physical infiltration modelling that will be described and tested the proposed approach overcomes the simplification related to i the one dimensional water front advance description ii the empirical representation of the infiltration processes iii the flat delineation of the ground surface providing a tool that might support the management of border irrigations at field scale performances of the proposed approach evaluated in terms of the ability to describe i the times of the waterfront advance and ii the actual water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field during irrigations have been estimated by comparing modelling outputs with observations obtained in a real world case study where border irrigation events were accurately monitored during the 2022 agricultural season 2 framework of the modelling approach correct management of the water distribution onto the field during the irrigation events can help to reduce water consumption making the watering more consistent with the crop water needs to reach this goal in the context of border irrigations an optimal combination of flow rate cutoff time distance field strip size and slope should be investigated the proposed modelling framework whose structure is reported in fig 1 provides a useful tool able to analyze the impact of different combinations of these variables on the overall performance of border irrigations it combines microtopography infiltration and hydrodynamic information and takes advantage of direct on field measurements when available for improving the description of surface water dynamics on borders in the following the main components of the modelling framework are presented 2 1 exploring microtopographic characteristics of the ground surface several studies emphasized the need to pay more attention to the spatial variability of microtopography in basin irrigation design for management and decision making purposes see for example bai et al 2017 bai et al 2011 moreover there is some evidence that the spatial variability of surface elevations has more influence on basin irrigation performance than the spatial variability of infiltration zapata and playán 2000 on the other hand the potential of the 2d fully dynamic shallow water modelling for the management of surface irrigation systems can be effectively explored once high resolution topographic surface models are available to finely describe the physical effects associated to the inertial and convective terms that gain more significance in high resolution modeling especially in the case of low water depths cea and costabile 2022 to this aim several survey techniques are available and the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles uav for performing photogrammetric surveys fits very well in this context in fact by properly setting flight parameters see e g pagliari et al 2017 ground sample distance gsd i e the average ground resolution of the digital acquisitions of centimeter level can be reached moreover measuring also some ground control points gcps by gnss or total stations gagliolo et al 2018 accuracies at the same level of gsd can be obtained this means that the photogrammetric derived digital terrain models dtms meet the requirements of microtopography 2 2 describing water propagation onto the field simulation of the water propagation on the border strips has been based on the fully dynamic version of the 2d shallow water equations expressed in eq 1 1 u t f x g y s where 2 u h h u h v f h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v g h v h u v h v 2 g h 2 2 s r f g h s 0 x s f x g h s 0 y s f y in which t s is time x m and y m are the horizontal coordinates h m is the water depth u m s v m s are the depth averaged flow velocities in x and y directions g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration f m s is the infiltration losses s 0 x m m and s 0 y m m are the bed slopes in x and y directions s f x m m and s f y m m are the friction slopes in x and y directions s f x and s f y were computed as in eq 3 3 s f x n u 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 s f y n v 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 in which n is the manning coefficient which is one of the parameters of the model that needs calibration the numerical integration of eq 1 was obtained using the irrisurf2d code which is a specific extension for border irrigation of the flood propagation model developed for research purposes at the university of calabria italy based on the expertise in the field of fluvial pluvial and urban flood modelling acquired in previous studies among the most recent ones see for example costabile et al 2020 costabile and costanzo 2021 costabile et al 2021 padulano et al 2021 costabile et al 2022 barbero et al 2022 the key features of irrisurf2d include the use of the well known roe riemann solver for the computation of the numerical fluxes the adoption of an upwind approach to discretize the bottom variations and of a semi implicit treatment of the friction source term finally the time steps are estimated according to the courant friedrichs lewy condition to ensure the model stability the computational domain is generated using an unstructured grid of irregular triangular elements and a robust wet dry procedure is considered irrisurf2d is coded in fortran 90 and is configured for parallel execution using message passing interface mpi directives in order to reduce computational time 2 3 simulating infiltration process the infiltration process in the irrisurf2d model has been simulated through the semi physical green ampt ga formula green and ampt 1911 described by eq 4 4 f t k s t ψ δ θ ln 1 f t ψ δ θ where f represents the cumulative amount of infiltrated water k s is the conductivity of the saturated profile δθ is the difference between the water content of the saturated soil approx the soil effective porosity η and the initial water content ϑ i before infiltration began ψ is the soil suction head on the interface between the wet soil layer and the underlining dry soil the ga formula has been chosen due to i the simplicity in its implementation and computation and ii the definition of its parameters which have a physical meaning therefore they can be adjusted within realistic ranges of values obtained from previous literature experiences achieved in similar contexts of the examined fields the infiltration losses f in eq 5 have been then evaluated by deriving eq 4 over time 5 f t k s k ψ δ θ f t the discretization in time of eqs 4 and 5 and the valuation of the rate of water available to infiltrate before and after the ponding time are calculated in a coupled manner within the swes considering the approach proposed in fiedler and ramirez 2000 3 application of the modelling framework on a real world case study 3 1 field characteristics the performances of the modelling approach were evaluated by comparing the simulated and observed timings of the waterfront advance and water depths along the field monitored during one of the watering events carried out in a maize field about 2 ha in size and subdivided into strip sectors located in the padana plain i e the largest irrigated plain in eu in the year 2022 the employed irrigation method in the experimental field is closed border irrigation more in detail the water flows onto the field through a series of steel gates which are opened manually in sequence to supply water to each strip starting from the main supply canal at the upper end of the field this practice is shown in fig 2 where the first watering carried out in the experimental field immediately after the sowing in the year 2021 is presented once the water is released onto the field it is gravity driven following the longitudinal slope of the field this latter was found at about 6 5 through the procedure described in section 3 2 1 the monitored irrigation event was performed on may 23 about one month after the sowing with regards to soil properties disturbed soil samples at different depths about 10 30 and 50 cm were collected at five different points of the field to evaluate soil texture the analysis of the samples showed a predominance of sandy sandy loam texture with a skeleton higher than 30 no vertical pattern in soil layers was found in the field which could thus be considered homogeneous along the vertical profile the level of the groundwater table was about 5 m from the ground surface thus the potential interactions of the capillary fringe with the infiltration process can be neglected additional information about the study domain is reported by masseroni et al 2022 whereas specific information regarding the monitored field is summarized in table 1 3 2 measurements 3 2 1 microtopography survey microtopography of the ground surface of the experimental field was determined just after the sowing through a photogrammetric flight performed through a dji mavic 2 pro uav acquiring 366 images at about 36 5 m a g l leading to a gsd of about 0 8 cm the images were processed with the agisoft metashape software version 1 7 0 including also some gcps that were measured by nrtk gnss network real time kinematic global navigation satellite system with a centimetric accuracy the estimated model accuracy evaluated at the gcps is 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm in the planimetric and altimetric components respectively from the photogrammetric dense point cloud a digital terrain model dtm with about 3 cm resolution was computed and provided as input of the two dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the dtm of the experimental field is shown in fig 3 3 2 2 flow rate and irrigation event duration the flow rate during the irrigation event was determined by measuring the flow level in the supply canals where the flow can reasonably be considered to be in uniform condition the roughness parameter was calibrated at the beginning of the irrigation season using the well known manning strickler formula ven te chow 1959 in which 1 the flow rate was measured by a manual portable magnetic inductive flow meter flow sensor nautilus c 2000 ott usa by using the so called conventional current meter methodology anon 2010 peruzzi et al 2021 2 the canal slope was evaluated using a portable global positioning system gps grs 1 topcon japan vertical accuracy of 2 5 cm 3 the cross section area and the hydraulic radius were computed considering the shape of the cross section trapezoidal and a graduated rod precision is 1 mm for the measurement of the water depth using this information the estimated strickler coefficient was equal to 75 m1 3 s 1 the watering time of each strip of the experimental field was measured using a chronometer during the irrigation event additional information on the measurement campaigns is reported in masseroni et al 2022 3 2 3 water depth onto the field the monitoring of the water depth evolution onto the field during the irrigation event and therefore the timings of the waterfront advance was carried out through 10 crafted water level devices specifically developed for this study which were installed along the longitudinal direction of the field see s1 s2 s10 shown in fig 3 such devices consist of an arduino nano microcontroller and they are equipped with an ultrasonic range finder sensor hy srf 05 model az delivery germany the single sensor works as both an ultrasound transmitter and receiver and it can be used to measure distances in a range between 0 02 and 4 5 m with resolution up to 0 2 cm a maximum measurement frequency of 40 hz and a detection angle of 15 a digital thermometer ds18b20 model az delivery germany was used to adjust the ultrasonic signal on the basis of air temperature distance data were recorded every 0 2 s and downloaded insitu at the end of the irrigation intervention the device was able to detect distances under different flow regimes with a high level of accuracy as demonstrated during several tests performed in the open channel flume of the hydraulic laboratory of the university of pavia italy fig 4 shows the electronic circuit diagram of the water level device and an example of its installation in the field the sensors were installed in the second sector just before the irrigation event and removed right after the water depth across the field was completely depleted the water level sensors were installed at 5 10 15 20 30 50 75 110 145 and 180 m from the head of the field see fig 3 3 3 modelling settings the model setup can be summarized as follows 1 generation of the computational grid for a required spatial resolution 2 determination of the initial and boundary conditions 3 parameters assumptions and estimations as mentioned in section 2 2 the numerical model is built upon computational domains represented by irregular triangular elements so that a variable resolution can be set throughout the field however the use of a uniform resolution is more practical considering the purposes of the work specifically we generated three different grids having substantially uniform resolutions 0 01 m2 fine grid 0 1 m2 medium grid and 1 m2 coarse grid in order to assess how much the dynamics of surface irrigation are influenced by the microtopographic features of the field the numerical grids were generated using the aquaveo sms surface water modeling system software in which it was possible to interpolate the ground levels related to the input dtm described in section 3 2 1 onto the grid nodes associated with the fine medium and coarse grid in practice the microtopographic features are progressively lost when moving from the fine to the coarse grid being only the finer grid able to adequately exploit all the topographic information as regards the boundary conditions we imposed the flow rate and the cutoff time of the examined sector in the computational cells that cover the inflow section and the associated critical flow condition for the computation of the water depths downstream we set closed boundary conditions the field was assumed to be initially dry so the water depths were set to a very low value everywhere 10 9 m finally the four parameters of the model n k s δ θ ψ were assumed uniformly distributed onto the field this assumption is reasonable at least for the parameter related to the ga formula since the soil samples revealed that the soil was quite homogeneous along all directions of the field the initial soil moisture condition was obtained from a multilevel soil moisture probe teros12 meter group usa averaging the monitored volumetric water content just before the irrigation event over about 0 5 m of depth i e approximately the depth of the rooted layer the initial soil moisture ϑ i was then subtracted from the effective porosity η to obtain δ θ i e the actual soil space that water can exploit during the infiltration process 3 4 performance evaluation the performance of the modelling approach was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated times of the waterfront advance and the water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field the metric used for this purpose was the root mean square error rmse described in eq 6 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where p i are the simulated values o i are the observed values and n is the total number of observations before evaluating the irrisurf2d model performance the four parameters of the model k s ψ δθ and n were calibrated using an expeditious procedure considering as border conditions the flow rate and the cutoff time of the examined sector i e the second sector and as a computational mesh a fine grid resolution of 0 01 m2 the model parameters were estimated with the aim to reproduce the observed timings of waterfront advance but ensuring also a reasonable prediction of the maximum water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field starting from the ranges typically proposed in literature for both ga parameters in sandy sandy loam soils and the roughness of cultivated fields rawls et al 1983 the model parameters were slightly adjusted to fit the observed data the comparison between model results and experimental measurements was analyzed from a statistical point of view specifically in order to filter out the noise component and uncertainty in the dtm generation and consequently in the simulation results the median of the simulated values in an area of 2 m2 surrounding the position of water level sensors was computed instead of considering the simulated water depth in the computational cell closest to the position of the sensors themselves the effects of different grid resolutions on model performances were examined as well considering the computational grids mentioned in section 3 3 4 results 4 1 characteristics of the irrigation event the characteristics of the selected irrigation event are summarized in table 2 where the flow rate cutoff time an average water depth and volume of irrigation are presented for each irrigated sector the average flow rate and irrigation duration were respectively about 350 l s and 31 min the applied water depth and the irrigated volume for the sector resulted in about 180 mm and 650 m3 on average overall a total volume of irrigation of about 3200 m3 was distributed onto the field with an irrigation event duration of about 2 5 h concerning the examined sector i e the second sector it was irrigated with a flow rate of 354 l s for 35 min this led to an applied water depth onto the sector of about 188 mm the monitored volumetric soil water content before the irrigation event of may 23rd resulted to be about 0 2 m3 m3 i e about half of the effective porosity generally indicated in literature for sandy sandy loam soils η 0 4 4 2 performance of the modelling approach the results of the nine simulations performed adjusting the irrisurf2d model parameters are summarized in table 3 more in detail the model parameters were adjusted starting from the selected literature parameters reported in sim1 for a sandy sandy loam type of soil in general all simulations resulted consistent with the observations for both timings of waterfront advance and maximum water depths the rmse between the observed and simulated periods of the waterfront advance was less than 7 min in all cases whereas between observed and simulated maximum water depth was less than 5 cm the sim 8 characterized by n k s θ and ψ respectively equal to 0 1 s m1 3 100 mm h 0 2 and 20 cm has resulted to be the more accurate simulation with an average rmse over the ten monitored points of about 1 min between observed and simulated times of the waterfront advance and 2 7 cm between observed and simulated maximum water depths therefore these parameters were considered in the analysis discussed in the following sections the computational time needed to perform a generic simulation is approximately 30 min for 60 min of the real event considering the number of cells approximately 106 and mostly the very low value of their size 0 01 m2 that drastically limits the time step according to the stability requirements provided by the cfl condition the efficiency of the numerical model can be considered good the model performances are also reported in figs 5 and 6 where the scatter plot of the computed and observed times of the waterfront advance and maximum water depths is followed by a comparison between simulated and measured values of times of the waterfront advance and maximum water depths along the longitudinal direction of the field fig 5a shows the very good performances of model predictions in terms of times of water advance since the points are very close to the line of perfect agreement as further confirmation the coefficient of determination r2 is approximately equal to 0 99 a limited variability of model estimations was observed also along the longitudinal direction of the field as shown in fig 5b in general the interquartile range resulted less than 1 min in all the monitored points the accuracies in reproducing the maximum water depths are less than those obtained for the times of water advance but they can be considered acceptable for the purpose of the modelling framework i e supporting the surface irrigation management computed and observed maximum water depths resulted slightly dispersed around the line of perfect agreement as shown in fig 6a in this case the coefficient of determination r2 is equal to 0 77 in addition the variability of model estimation along the longitudinal direction of the field resulted more emphasized at the beginning and at end of the field point s1 s2 s9 and s10 with an interquartile range of about 2 3 cm that is more than double on average than that obtained between s3 and s8 fig 6b the evolution of measured and simulated water depths onto the field is reported in fig 7 in general the model appears able to reliably reproduce the observed water depths in all monitored points i e from s1 to s10 small differences were observed in the last part of the field where overestimations of the simulated water depths with respect to measurements were found probably due to some boundary effect simulated shapes of water depletion after irrigation appear very consistent with the observations in all monitored points confirming the accuracy of the ga approach in the description of the infiltration process in border irrigation 4 3 effects of grid resolution on model performance medium and coarse grids defined in section 3 3 were used to perform simulations aimed at the evaluation of the effects on the model performance caused by different resolutions the results are shown in table 4 where the rmse between observed and simulated times of waterfront advance and maximum water depths is reported for the three different considered grid resolutions in general a significant reduction in model performances was found when the detail of the computational grid changes from fine to coarse the rmse increased by about 12 times on average in case of time of waterfront advance 1 1 min in fine grid and 12 5 min in coarse grid and by about 2 times in case of maximum water depth 2 7 cm in fine grid and 6 9 cm in coarse grid the decreasing of model performance connected with the lowering of grid resolution had repercussions on the description of surface flow dynamics in fig 8 the timings of waterfront advance fig 8a and the maximum water depths fig 8b for different grid resolutions are compared a significant reduction in the speed of waterfront advance was found at a distance of about 50 m from the head of the field which corresponds with the position of sensor s6 if the coarse grid was considered in this case the waterfront advance was interrupted before reaching the end of the field the same effect was found using in the model a medium grid but in this case the waterfront advance was interrupted at about 110 m from the head of the field i e where s8 sensor is located using a fine grid instead the model was able to match the observations both in case of times of waterfront advance and the maximum water depths in fig 9 the effects of the changes in grid resolution on the temporal evolution of the waterfront advance are presented in particular three instants in time i e 1 5 and 10 min following the irrigation event were considered the results show that the use of the fine grid allows an accurate and more realistic simulation of the waterfront advance which instead is not captured by using the grid with 1 m2 of resolution significant differences in progressive waterfront distances from the head of the field were accumulated during the simulation in particular about 25 m of difference in waterfront advance between fine and coarse grid were found after 10 min of simulation errors in the lateral spread of waterfront advance were also found if the coarse grid is used in particular from 5 min onward unrealistic lateral overflows were reproduced as a consequence of a minor topographic detail that is not able to consider the presence of the levees separating the strips the differences in grid resolutions affect the spatial distribution of cumulative infiltration volumes as well fig 10 considering the coarse grid the infiltration process remained confined to the first 65 m i e about 30 of the total length of the field clearly the simulations related to the medium and coarse grid are computationally less demanding than that one based on the fine grid as regards the medium grid 105 elements the computational time was approximately 2 min whereas only 27 s were needed to perform a generic simulation using the coarse grid 104 elements 5 discussion the rmse values reported in table 4 highlighted that grid resolution change from coarse to medium didn t improve model performance too much while from medium to fine the model performance was improved a lot therefore searching for a critical grid resolution as a trade off between computational time and model performance could be interesting for this reason three additional computational grids have been generated having resolutions equal to 0 02 m2 0 05 m2 and 0 08 m2 for comparative purposes we introduce here the accuracy variation index avi and the performance variation index pvi defined as in eq 7 and eq 8 respectively 7 a v i rmse fine grid rmse generic grid 8 p v i 1 computational time generic grid computational time fine grid in which rmse values are related to the timings of waterfront advance avi provides information about the accuracy of the solution obtained using a generic grid compared to that obtained with the finest grid its value is lower than 1 and approaches to zero as the rmse of the generic grid deviates with respect to that of the fine grid pvi gives indication about the computational time saving induced by the use of a generic grid in relation to the finest grid therefore the greater its value the greater is the reduction of the run time both avi and pvi values expressed as function of the grid resolution ratio grr defined as the ratio between the resolution of the generic and the finest grids are reported in fig 11 fig 11 highlights the fact that the accuracy of the solution is characterized by a non linear behavior in which as expected avi decreases as the grid size increases in particular doubling the area of the computational element with respect to the finest grid grr 2 induces the halving of avi 0 5 however for grr 2 the rmse value is about 2 2 min so that the overall result may be still considered satisfying for grr 8 avi reduces of one order of magnitude and the overall accuracy seems to be independent from the grr value confirming what has been reported in table 4 moreover the waterfront stopped before the end of the field for grr values equal to or greater than 8 and this contradicted the observations conversely the performance in terms of computational times rapidly increases for lower values of grr whereas no significant benefits can be observed for grr 5 in particular for grr 2 the pvi value is approximately 0 65 meaning that doubling the area of the computational cell in respect to the finest grid leads to an important reduction of the computational times of course the pvi values are strictly connected to both the hardware characteristics of the cpu cluster used in this work and the efficiency of the numerical code therefore they should be considered carefully just as a gross indication however the simulation related to grr 2 that is grid resolution equal to 0 02 m2 seems to be a good balance between accuracy of the results and reduced computational times as in any modelling study model calibration is required where the optimized parameters are not readily observed in modelling framework of this study three out of four parameters ks ψ and n were slightly adjusted starting from those suggested in literature whereas the remaining one θ was obtained by combining field measurements of volumetric water content before the irrigation events and literature values of effective porosity with regard to the set of parameter values that provided the best performances sim 8 table 3 it is interesting to note that n and k s fall exactly within the range reported in literature for the type of soil of the experimental field sim 1 table 3 while ψ is larger i e from 5 cm to 20 cm this is probably due to the dependence of the water suction head in the ga infiltration process on initial soil moisture conditions ϑ i in fact aggelides and youngs 1978 by investigating the dependence of the ga parameters on the initial water content in draining and wetting states found that in sandy soils ψ was significantly influenced by the initial soil moisture condition when this latter resulted in less than 0 3 m3 m3 they found a linear relationship between ψ and ϑ i which in case of ϑ i equal to 0 2 m3 m3 i e the initial soil moisture condition registered in our case study the value of ψ resulted in about 17 cm very close to the value found in our study these results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed modelling approach in reproducing surface dynamics also when typical literature observations for calibrating ga and roughness are used concerning the simulation of the infiltration process additional spatial and temporal measurements of infiltration volumes should be performed for validating the model estimations however in the absence of these data the good representation of the surface phenomenon while respecting the conservation of the mass also implies a good representation of the infiltration process in fact in githui et al 2020 the infiltration volume in time compared to the numerical results is obtained as the difference between the total incoming volume and that one observed on the surface this confirms that performing good measurements of water depth along the longitudinal direction of the field during irrigation events as carried out in our work can help to validate the model estimations both in surface water dynamic and infiltration process a limitation of the proposed modelling approach is that the spatial and temporal variability of ga model parameters is neglected moreover the use of a constant roughness parameter could influence flow dynamics as well the effect of these limitations can be observed in fig 7 where the simulated water depths are slightly inconsistent with observations especially at the end of the field point s10 i e where the velocities are reduced in the study of mailapalli et al 2008 a methodology for taking into account the spatial and temporal variation of manning s roughness coefficient under bare and cropped field conditions as well as between the irrigation events was developed more in detail manning s coefficient n varied with the crop growing water depth flow velocity and in particular before and after the cut off time however the complexity and the computational effort of the mailapalli et al 2008 solution were not accompanied by a significant improvement in the description of surface irrigation dynamics this further confirms that the irrisurf2d approach can provide a reliable representation of the dynamics of surface waterings without requiring very high model complexity and computational times concerning the results obtained with grids of different resolutions table 4 and figs 8 10 demonstrate that the ground microtopography details are needed for an exhaustive representation of surface and subsurface water dynamics in border irrigation this result corroborates the experimental evidence found by bai et al 2011 and githui et al 2020 high resolutions of topographic characteristics of the ground surface are required if a 2d hydrodynamic modelling is used for describing dynamics of surface irrigations especially when water depths onto the field are of the same order of magnitude as ground roughness finally it may be interesting to highlight the good efficiency of the numerical model used in this work since it is configured for parallel execution using message passing interface mpi directives in order to drastically reduce the computational time to the author s knowledge this is the first time in the literature that such an approach is used in the context of surface irrigation 6 conclusion in this work irrisurf2d a new integrated modelling framework based on a combination of high resolution topographic data infiltration and surface hydrodynamic modelling is proposed with the aim to obtain detailed simulations of border irrigation events and ultimately to improve the management of this widespread irrigation method more in detail irrisurf2d couples the two dimensional shallow water equation with a semi physical infiltration model based on the green ampt approach in order to describe the advance phase of the border irrigation irrisurf2d fully exploits microtopography information obtained by detailed topographic surveys for simulating the surface water dynamics during irrigations and its parameters can be effectively calibrated using on field measurements of flowrate cut off time timings of water advance water depths onto the field and soil moisture results obtained using data collected at an experimental field showed that when using a high resolution grid to represent the microtopography irrisurf2d is able to accurately reproduce both times of water advance and water depths onto the field with parameter values falling within the range of variability indicated in the literature for the specific soil of the experimental field this increases the possibility to apply the modelling framework with a limited amount of field observations for parameters calibration or even when field measurements are not available however the results also show that the grid resolution plays a significant role with simulation quality significantly deteriorating when applying coarser grids the results of this work can be considered relevant in view of the implementation of an operational tool aimed to support strategies for improving the design and management of border irrigation the next goal is to investigate the effects on irrigation performances i e water saving distribution uniformity etc of different combinations of flow rate cut off time distance field strip size and initial moisture conditions the combined effects of microtopography accuracy and spatial and temporal variability of model parameters will be also further investigated a key challenge will be to translate the findings obtained through a combination of field experiments and modelling exercises into operational guidelines and best practices leading to a significant increase in border irrigation efficiency

9212,the healthy and sustainable development of irrigation area not only serves as the guarantee of national food production security but also shoulders the important task of regional ecological security in which maintaining groundwater level plays an important role due to the close relationship between groundwater level and irrigation recharge groundwater realizing rational use of water resources under strictly implementing the total limit of water use and holding reasonable groundwater level is of great significance to the healthy development of irrigated areas therefore this study established a spatial temporal optimal allocation regulation method of irrigation water resources by coupling groundwater numerical technology and the characteristics of hydrological cycle with comprehensively considering the dual constraints between total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth besides taking helan county a typical area of qingtongxia irrigation district in ningxia as an example a case study on optimal allocation of irrigation water resources was carried out the results show that compared with the actual current water use situation the total irrigation water shortage rate of helan county irrigation district hcid decreases from 21 61 to 21 under the combined control of total available water and groundwater depths it is realized the fairness and balance of water use in different regions and periods by the allocation of water resources in spatial and temporal meanwhile the area located in the reasonable groundwater depth range increased by 1 65 after optimization overall the balanced and optimal allocation method of irrigation water resources with both total water use and groundwater depth control is not only improving the efficient and rational utilization of limited water resources but also can regulate groundwater depth to guarantee regional ecological health and sustainable development keywords efficient utilization of water resources groundwater level water use constraints water resources allocation irrigation district data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction farmland is the largest artificial ecosystem in the organic composition of mountain water forest field lake grass sand its healthy development has become the lifeblood of national agricultural development and the cornerstone of food security shouldering the important task of ecological security singh 2014 2018 however due to the difference of regional precipitation distribution the spatial distribution of water and soil resources is mismatched singh 2018 agriculture has become a large water user accounting for 70 of global water resources consumption of which irrigation water accounts for more than 90 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 even under such conditions more than 60 about 171 million ha of irrigated farmland in the world is still highly water deficient china is a populous and agricultural country the distribution of land and water resources is dislocated and agricultural production is highly dependent on irrigation geng et al 2022 zha et al 2022 according to china water resources bulletin in 2020 about 62 of total water resources is used for agriculture of which nearly 90 is used for farmland irrigation with the climate change and the northward rainless shift of cultivated land the mismatch of spatial distribution of land and water resources has intensified to supplement the shortage of surface water groundwater has become an important water source to alleviate water shortage in irrigation areas guo et al 2020 yin et al 2020 due to long term underground water exploitation and unreasonable irrigation the phenomenon of groundwater level too deep or too shallow in the irrigation area coexists causing a series of ecological and environmental problems such as ecological degradation and soil salinization dai et al 2020 mi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 and seriously restricting the benign and sustainable development of the irrigation area wang et al 2020 to effectively solve the ecological environment problems caused by the unreasonable utilization of irrigation water improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and optimize the use of various water sources in the irrigation area exploring the optimal allocation of water resources under the reasonable depth of groundwater is one of the technologies that need to be solved urgently to ensure the sustainable development of the irrigation area in recent years much effort has been made in the rational utilization of water resources and many excellent research results have been obtained for example li et al carried out optimal allocation of water resources of various uncertainties and irrigation sources with the objective function of maximizing economic and social benefits and ecological benefits li and guo 2014 liu et al discussed the research on the joint optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater in china under the constraint of groundwater development amount in irrigation areas liu et al 2020 shangguan et al took the maximization of crop yield as the optimization objective and adopted the three level optimization algorithm to realize the rational allocation of irrigation water resources based on the theory of insufficient irrigation shangguan et al 2002 many studies related to the methods of optimal water allocation focused on the optimal allocation algorithm of irrigation water resources or the optimal allocation of different water sources in irrigation areas or the specific optimization objectives such as crop yield water productivity and so on berbel and expósito 2022 cheng et al 2021 linker 2020 nikoo et al 2022 there were relatively few studies focusing on the interaction between the water resources allocation and the hydrological process in irrigation area especially on the comprehensive water resource allocation and dynamic feedback of water cycle simulation tian et al 2015 it is difficult to truly reflect the impact of irrigation on the groundwater in irrigation area and neglects the effective supply of crops through capillary action in shallow groundwater areas and the restriction of water resource demand changes by irrigation saving measures chen et al 2022 in view of the interaction between water resources allocation and hydrological cycle process in irrigation area the interaction and mutual restriction between water resources allocation and groundwater level is an extremely complex nonlinear process integrating natural artificial water cycle jimenez martinez et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 based on the above difficulties the objectives of the study are describing the accurate changes of groundwater level after water resources allocation the effects of different groundwater levels on irrigation water demand and water resource allocation realizing the interactive allocation of water resources and groundwater level with considering the regulation of groundwater depth it can realize the water management by groundwater level and the double real constraints of total water use therefore this study explored the space time equilibrium optimal allocation of water resources with constraining total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth by means of the mode of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation in the paper there are mainly three parts 1 introduced the general situation of the study area and its existing problems 2 described and established the spatial temporal equilibrium optimization model of irrigation water resources considering the dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation 3 realized the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources under the real water use constraints and groundwater level optimization in hcid 2 study area qingtongxia irrigation area in ningxia is one of the three largest artesian irrigation areas in china which is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river and surrounded by tengger desert ulan buh desert and muus desert fig 1b the ecology is extremely fragile with sparse rainfall and intense evaporation the yellow river passes through the territory bringing vitality to the development of the irrigation area supported by the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river qingtongxia irrigation area has become an important component of the northwest arid desert grassland ecological barrier embedded in the western edge of north china and the seven zones and twenty three zones of agricultural production areas in china helan county irrigation district hcid is located in the north central part of qingtongxia irrigation area with 105 53 106 36 e and 38 27 38 52 n fig 1b it belongs to a typical temperate continental climate with annual average precipitation of 193 mm 80 of which is concentrated from june to september and the annual evaporation reaches 1716 8 mm the local water resources are extremely limited and the yellow river water becomes its main water source supported by the yellow river diversion water helan county has become a typical irrigated agricultural area with a land area of 1197 57 km2 and 77 56 of which is agricultural land including cultivated land garden woodland grass land and other agricultural land the current agricultural sown area is 48 794 ha including 12 760 ha for rice and 10 633 ha for wheat and corn due to the abundant light and heat resources it has become the main planting area of rice and vegetables supplied for hong kong in ningxia large scale planting of high water consumption crops and long term unreasonable irrigation development have led to the coexistence of water shortage waste of irrigation water and partial overloading of groundwater in hcid the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water was only 0 508 in 2018 lower than the average level of 0 535 in ningxia and 0 554 in china the annual groundwater consumption was 64 million m3 which is greater than the groundwater utilization index 35 million m3 the abnormal groundwater level caused by unreasonable water use is mainly manifested as a large number of groundwater exploitation around the city and well irrigated areas resulting in the continuous decline of groundwater level in the diversion irrigation area unreasonable irrigation such as waste of irrigation leads to shallow groundwater level and soil salinization according to the groundwater observation data of helan county the average groundwater depth in 2013 2017 in the south of hcid has reached 6 65 m which has decreased by 4 02 m compared with it in 1998 2005 while the average annual groundwater depth was only 1 19 m in 2013 2017 and only about 0 2 m in some periods in the north of hcid due to strong regional evaporation and shallow groundwater level regional soil salinization was caused li et al 2013 mi et al 2020 therefore based on the dual constraints of total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth it is of great significance to explore the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in the way of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation for the sustainable development of irrigation area 3 method introduction 3 1 data sources and model description in this paper the development level of irrigation area in helan county in 2017 is taken as the current year to carry out the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the data of crop planting area in hcid came from the statistical yearbook http www nx gov cn and the statistical data of irrigation district management department http slt nx gov cn the irrigation water volume of each irrigation area was obtained from the ningxia water resources bulletin and the data recorded by the irrigation area management department the groundwater depth observation data was obtained from ningxia hydrology and water resources survey bureau the meteorological data such as precipitation temperature sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed used to calculate crop water demand is from the china meteorological data sharing network http www cma gov cn the spatial temporal equilibrium optimal allocation model of irrigation water resources with considering groundwater level optimization adopts the three layer optimal structure of time optimization space optimization and groundwater optimization which is composed of an optimal allocation model and a groundwater simulation model in the spatial optimization the objective of optimization is the equity of social water use in each region and the minimum water shortage rate in each region of the irrigation area at the same time maintaining reasonable groundwater depth is considered to prevent soil degradation and salinization in irrigated areas specifically the irrigation water volume of different water sources and different periods output by the water resource allocation model is used as the input of the groundwater numerical model and the groundwater level in the corresponding periods of water supply and consumption conditions is obtained through groundwater numerical simulation through the repeated interaction and iterative calculation between the allocation process and the groundwater depth simulation the results of spatial optimal allocation of water resources with considering reasonable groundwater level are obtained in the temporal optimization the optimization within the year mainly takes the equilibrium degree of irrigation water shortage rate in different months of the year as the optimization objective specifically firstly the influence of groundwater depth changes on irrigation water demand is fully considered then according to the groundwater level of the last month the irrigation water demand of each month is calculated and the proportion of the current monthly irrigation water demand to annual irrigation water demand is obtained finally according to the proportion in the current month to the remaining available water resources in the allocation year the monthly cycle within the year is calculated to realize the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources within the year in the above mentioned way the distribution method of inter annual and intra annual adopts to realize the yearly and monthly continuous time balanced optimal control of the inter annual and intra annual periods under the constraint of the available irrigation water resources allocated by the administrative department year by year in the model composition the coupling process of spatial temporal equilibrium optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and groundwater simulation model consists of 5 modules fig 2 which includes data preparation module temporal optimization module spatial optimization module groundwater optimization module and cycle optimization module 3 2 the model s module description data preparation module it is mainly to prepare the basic data required for optimization and provide operation data support the minimum calculation unit i i 1 2 n can be divided according to the scope of irrigation water management in different reaches or irrigation channels

represents the planting area of the k crop in the j month of the i calculation unit ha temporal optimization module it is mainly responsible for calculating irrigation water demand in different months and optimizing irrigation water resources allocation within the year irrigation water demand is calculated by crop coefficient method and taking effective precipitation amount of groundwater directly absorbed and utilized by crop roots effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water and so on into consideration jiang et al 2014 seidel et al 2019 the crop coefficient method is used to

water in the optimized distribution of irrigation water resources within the year firstly according to the irrigation water demand of each calculation unit in different periods the ratio a j j 1 2 n of irrigation water demand in different periods to the total irrigation water demand of the region is determined then according to the available regional agricultural irrigation water if it is the first water supply stage of regional agricultural irrigation water the available water in the current optimization period is calculated by formula 6 if it is not the first water supply stage the current optimal monthly available water supply is calculated by formula 7 6 i 1 a 1 i 7 i j a j i 1 j 1 i y j 2 n where i is the available irrigation water 104 m3 a j is the ratio of irrigation water

groundwater depth adopts the modflow numerical simulation model which follows the principle of groundwater balance and darcy s law the spatial optimization results are inputted into the groundwater model and the groundwater optimization is realized by repeatedly adjusting the proportion of surface water and groundwater supply the objective of groundwater optimization is to minimize the deviation

outputs the allocation results of irrigation water resources after each optimization stage and the groundwater depth after optimization and then enter the next stage through the cycle iteration optimization calculation of multiple periods the regional water units can realize the balanced and reasonable distribution of water consumption in the whole cycle 4 results and discussion 4 1 preparation for model calculation unit and initial groundwater depth according to the requirements of river canal and other irrigation water management scope of hcid hcid is divided into 20 basic calculation units fig 3a in combination with the irrigation scope and township boundary managed by the channel management of the main channels based on the monitoring data of groundwater level the initial groundwater depth of each calculation unit before optimization is obtained according to the data of groundwater level observation wells in hcid the groundwater depth distribution in the initial stage is obtained fig 3b the distribution of groundwater depth shows a trend of gradually shallower from south to north and the spatial distribution of groundwater depth has an important impact on the amount of direct utilization of groundwater by crop roots kahlown et al 2005 therefore it cannot be ignored in the optimal allocation of water resources constrained by the total amount of irrigation water resources the planting type and area they were obtained by combining statistical data and field investigation a i j k represent the planting area of the k crop in the month j of the i calculation unit mu the effective irrigated area of hcid is 42 18 thousand ha and the total planting area of crops is 48 79 thousand ha the proportion of main grain planting areas rice wheat corn wheat interplanting corn is 26 16 9 73 8 24 and 3 83 respectively the detailed planting structure and area of each calculation unit is shown in fig 4 reasonable groundwater depth range the change of groundwater level has great impact on ecological health and sustainable development of irrigation area if groundwater is too shallow the salt will rise along the capillary and accumulates in the topsoil under the action of evaporation causing salinization of the soil surface liu et al 2016 if the groundwater is too deep the natural vegetation will be subjected to water stress and wither resulting in desertification in the irrigation area fan et al 2008 yang et al 2006 hcid is the irrigation area of yellow river diversion the large scale irrigation of diverting the yellow river makes the surface water from the yellow river and groundwater transform frequently and it is common for groundwater to be buried too deep or too shallow therefore to protect the irrigated area from secondary salinization caused by too shallow groundwater and desertification caused by too deep groundwater the reasonable groundwater depth threshold h of hcid in this study is set from 1 2 m to 3 0 m which is relatively appropriate based on the local investigation and observation data and relevant research results du 2020 han et al 2009 wang et al 2004 xie et al 2007 the detailed monthly reasonable groundwater depth range is shown in fig 5 4 2 irrigation water allocation results irrigation water demand results according to the meteorological data crop planting area groundwater depth irrigation water utilization coefficient etc in the current optimization period and combined with the research results of xie et al xie et al 2001 the supplement of groundwater to crop water demand under different groundwater depths is calculated by formula 1 7 the results shown that the irrigation period of hcid is mainly concentrated from march to august and november of which march to august is the irrigation water requirement for crop growth and the winter irrigation under the traditional irrigation mode in november is used to maintain the ecological health of the irrigation area the final calculation shows that the total annual irrigation water demand of hcid is 574 95 million m3 of which the maximum irrigation water demand is 357 million m3 from june to august during the peak crop growth period accounting for 62 09 of the total water demand in november the irrigation water demand for winter irrigation is 64 million m3 accounting for 11 19 fig 6 groundwater level simulation setting the simulation of groundwater depth adopts modflow numerical simulation model the 6753 groundwater calculation grids are obtained by 0 4 km 0 4 km subdivision scheme the groundwater level data of groundwater monitoring well in hcid from january 2016 to december 2018 are used to identify and verify the groundwater simulation model the groundwater flow field lines fit well fig 7a the model has a good simulation effect on the groundwater flow field the observed and simulated groundwater levels of each observation well scatter around the slope of 45 and the error between the observed and simulated values of the observation well at the simulation period is small which the probability of being in the 99 confidence interval is 80 78 fig 7b fig 8 presents the comparison of groundwater level in two representative monitoring wells the model can well reflect the law of groundwater movement and can be used to predict the groundwater level under different irrigation schemes results of optimized irrigation water supply under the comprehensive consideration of water supply engineering capacity and available water then optimizing the allocation of irrigation water resources in hcid every month for the year the result of water resources allocation of the total water supply is 454million m3 including 429million m3 of surface water 25million m3 of underground water and the total water shortage ratio is 21 after optimization in total water supply the water supply of unit 1 4 9 and 13 lg hn jg hy cx tlmdq and cx tlnl accounts for more than 10 of the total water supply the water supply of unit 11 14 and 16 xg tlmdq nl tlnl and nq tlnq is less than 1 of the total water supply the amount of water supply is closely related to unit area and water demand in groundwater supply the groundwater supply of units 2 5 and 17 jx hn xg hy and hg tlnq accounts for more than 15 of the unit s water supply the detailed results of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources are shown in table 1 4 3 discussion and evaluation the evaluation of the calculation results of irrigation water demand the water demand for crop growth in the irrigation area mainly comes from irrigation water precipitation for the arid irrigated areas precipitation is rare and irrigation becomes the main water source to support crop growth uniyal and dietrich 2021 however due to long term diversion irrigation uneven spatial distribution of irrigation water resources and different groundwater utilization in different regions the groundwater level in irrigated areas is too shallow or too deep yin et al 2020 when the groundwater level is relatively shallow the crop root system can directly absorb the groundwater growth and the corresponding irrigation water demand is reduced if irrigation amount is still carried out with irrigation quota the groundwater level would continue to rise leading to soil salinization in the irrigated area and other problems the real water resource management constraints cannot be realized aiming at this the irrigation water demand and irrigation water allocation were calculated with considering the groundwater depth the annual irrigation water demand in hcid decreased by about 5 625 million m3 and 0 98 with an average reduction of 115 29 m3 per ha the irrigation water demand per ha decreases more were shallower groundwater depth fig 9 spatial temporal water use equilibrium and equity compared with before spatial temporal equilibrium optimization the total irrigation water shortage rate decreases from 21 61 to 21 on space optimization the difference of the water shortage rate in each calculation unit becomes smaller which remains between 12 9 and 23 5 two indicators the cumulative and the variance of water shortage rate of each calculation unit were involved to represent the spatial equilibrium degree of water use which decreased by 14 7 and 96 2 respectively table 2 and fig 10 in time optimization the difference of monthly water shortage rate is also reduced remains between 13 41 and 22 01 the cumulative and the variance water shortage rate of each month in the year decreases by 26 6 and 99 7 respectively table 2 and fig 11 the spatial balance of irrigation water use not only reflects the fairness of social benefits but also ensures the balance of regional water use which is an important factor to ensure the good social development of various regions li et al 2021 the relative equilibrium of water shortage rate in each region was realized through spatial equilibrium optimization for irrigation water it can achieve water use fairness in each region and maintain social equity and stability improve the crop yield of the whole region and enhance the regional risk resistance ability magidi et al 2021 temporal equilibrium optimization of irrigation water is to balance the uniformity of water use in each growth period of crops according to relevant studies shirazi et al 2014 zamora re et al 2020 zou et al 2021 the effect of water shortage in the key growth period on crop yield is irreversible it can effectively avoid the severe reduction of crop yield by considering the water demand and water shortage in each irrigation month and balancing the water shortage rate in the critical period of crop growth optimization of groundwater depth maintaining a reasonable groundwater depth can effectively prevent desertification and soil salinization in arid irrigated areas after groundwater depth optimization the average annual area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds increases from 168 50 km2 to 171 28 km2 which is by 1 65 compared with that before and after optimization from march to april the area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds increases from 250 95 km2 to 264 08 km2 with an increase of 5 23 from may to october the area increases by 0 6 minimum increase of 0 24 from november to february table 3 it is realized the optimal regulation of groundwater level in irrigated areas from the perspective of rational distribution of irrigation water resources meanwhile coupling the groundwater level numerical simulation model made up for the lack of characterization of groundwater depth in the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources uncertainty and limitation the uncertainty mainly comes from two aspects which are meteorological data and groundwater depth in the uncertainty of meteorological data for calculating irrigation water demand there is some difference between meteorological factors in each calculation unit in space which affects the accuracy of the result of calculating irrigation water demand in some degree however the uncertainty from meteorological data is acceptable in this study because the difference of meteorological factors can be ignored due to in small plain region ukhurebor et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 in the uncertainty of groundwater depth it is mainly in groundwater spatial distribution in this study 11 observation wells data in hcid are used the spatial distribution of groundwater depth calculated by interpolation can well reflect the spatial change of groundwater depth however due to the complex spatial variability of groundwater depth change regional microtopography change and groundwater permeability coefficient it also has some uncertainty influence on the amount of direct absorption of groundwater by crops with groundwater depth distribution bahrami et al 2020 moon et al 2004 the optimization of groundwater depth is changed to a good direction although the optimization effect of the average annual area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds is only improved by 1 65 as the groundwater problems in the irrigation area are formed by perennial accumulation we only take the current representative year 2017 as an example to conduct optimal irrigation regulation for one year in the process of groundwater regulation water demand for crop growth should not be completely ignored and both groundwater level regulation and water demand for crop growth should be taken into account li et al 2020 therefore the one year optimization effect of groundwater given in this study is not significant and long term real time dynamic regulation is needed 5 conclusions we focus on the problem that allocation of irrigation water resources in irrigated areas cannot realize the real limited water uses constraint and the problem of the regulation of groundwater aiming at realizing the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources with the dual control of irrigation water quantity and groundwater level in this study we come up with a temporal and spatial optimal allocation method of water resources with considering groundwater level in irrigated areas to solve the problems addressed above there are three main highlights firstly in the calculation of irrigation water demand and allocation the irrigation water demand of hcid is reduced by 5 625 million m3 about 0 98 with fully considering the influence of direct utilization of groundwater by crop roots in shallow groundwater deep area on irrigation water demand the corresponding total water shortage rate reduced from 21 61 to 21 under the condition of limited available irrigation water resources it can effectively and accurately calculate regional irrigation water demand and provide support for groundwater regulation from the angle of irrigation water demand secondly under the real constraint of limited available irrigation water situation it is realized the fairness and balance of water use in each region and period through optimum allocation of irrigation water resources in time and space equilibrium optimization of hcid has been achieved for each calculation unit and for each month s water shortage rate which remains in 12 9 23 5 and in 13 41 22 01 respectively it can achieve water use fairness in each region and maintain social equity and stability and can meet the water demand in critical growth period of crops and guarantee the safety of regional food production thirdly under fully considering the basic water demand of crops and the groundwater depth optimized regulation of groundwater depth is realized by repeatedly iterations the process of spatial and temporal equilibrium irrigation water resources allocation the results show that the area located in the reasonable groundwater depth range increases by 1 65 it can optimize groundwater table while ensuring basic water use for crops and guarantee regional ecological health and sustainable development funding this work was financially supported by the national key research and development program

9212,the healthy and sustainable development of irrigation area not only serves as the guarantee of national food production security but also shoulders the important task of regional ecological security in which maintaining groundwater level plays an important role due to the close relationship between groundwater level and irrigation recharge groundwater realizing rational use of water resources under strictly implementing the total limit of water use and holding reasonable groundwater level is of great significance to the healthy development of irrigated areas therefore this study established a spatial temporal optimal allocation regulation method of irrigation water resources by coupling groundwater numerical technology and the characteristics of hydrological cycle with comprehensively considering the dual constraints between total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth besides taking helan county a typical area of qingtongxia irrigation district in ningxia as an example a case study on optimal allocation of irrigation water resources was carried out the results show that compared with the actual current water use situation the total irrigation water shortage rate of helan county irrigation district hcid decreases from 21 61 to 21 under the combined control of total available water and groundwater depths it is realized the fairness and balance of water use in different regions and periods by the allocation of water resources in spatial and temporal meanwhile the area located in the reasonable groundwater depth range increased by 1 65 after optimization overall the balanced and optimal allocation method of irrigation water resources with both total water use and groundwater depth control is not only improving the efficient and rational utilization of limited water resources but also can regulate groundwater depth to guarantee regional ecological health and sustainable development keywords efficient utilization of water resources groundwater level water use constraints water resources allocation irrigation district data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction farmland is the largest artificial ecosystem in the organic composition of mountain water forest field lake grass sand its healthy development has become the lifeblood of national agricultural development and the cornerstone of food security shouldering the important task of ecological security singh 2014 2018 however due to the difference of regional precipitation distribution the spatial distribution of water and soil resources is mismatched singh 2018 agriculture has become a large water user accounting for 70 of global water resources consumption of which irrigation water accounts for more than 90 mclaughlin and kinzelbach 2015 even under such conditions more than 60 about 171 million ha of irrigated farmland in the world is still highly water deficient china is a populous and agricultural country the distribution of land and water resources is dislocated and agricultural production is highly dependent on irrigation geng et al 2022 zha et al 2022 according to china water resources bulletin in 2020 about 62 of total water resources is used for agriculture of which nearly 90 is used for farmland irrigation with the climate change and the northward rainless shift of cultivated land the mismatch of spatial distribution of land and water resources has intensified to supplement the shortage of surface water groundwater has become an important water source to alleviate water shortage in irrigation areas guo et al 2020 yin et al 2020 due to long term underground water exploitation and unreasonable irrigation the phenomenon of groundwater level too deep or too shallow in the irrigation area coexists causing a series of ecological and environmental problems such as ecological degradation and soil salinization dai et al 2020 mi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 and seriously restricting the benign and sustainable development of the irrigation area wang et al 2020 to effectively solve the ecological environment problems caused by the unreasonable utilization of irrigation water improve the utilization efficiency of water resources and optimize the use of various water sources in the irrigation area exploring the optimal allocation of water resources under the reasonable depth of groundwater is one of the technologies that need to be solved urgently to ensure the sustainable development of the irrigation area in recent years much effort has been made in the rational utilization of water resources and many excellent research results have been obtained for example li et al carried out optimal allocation of water resources of various uncertainties and irrigation sources with the objective function of maximizing economic and social benefits and ecological benefits li and guo 2014 liu et al discussed the research on the joint optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater in china under the constraint of groundwater development amount in irrigation areas liu et al 2020 shangguan et al took the maximization of crop yield as the optimization objective and adopted the three level optimization algorithm to realize the rational allocation of irrigation water resources based on the theory of insufficient irrigation shangguan et al 2002 many studies related to the methods of optimal water allocation focused on the optimal allocation algorithm of irrigation water resources or the optimal allocation of different water sources in irrigation areas or the specific optimization objectives such as crop yield water productivity and so on berbel and expósito 2022 cheng et al 2021 linker 2020 nikoo et al 2022 there were relatively few studies focusing on the interaction between the water resources allocation and the hydrological process in irrigation area especially on the comprehensive water resource allocation and dynamic feedback of water cycle simulation tian et al 2015 it is difficult to truly reflect the impact of irrigation on the groundwater in irrigation area and neglects the effective supply of crops through capillary action in shallow groundwater areas and the restriction of water resource demand changes by irrigation saving measures chen et al 2022 in view of the interaction between water resources allocation and hydrological cycle process in irrigation area the interaction and mutual restriction between water resources allocation and groundwater level is an extremely complex nonlinear process integrating natural artificial water cycle jimenez martinez et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 based on the above difficulties the objectives of the study are describing the accurate changes of groundwater level after water resources allocation the effects of different groundwater levels on irrigation water demand and water resource allocation realizing the interactive allocation of water resources and groundwater level with considering the regulation of groundwater depth it can realize the water management by groundwater level and the double real constraints of total water use therefore this study explored the space time equilibrium optimal allocation of water resources with constraining total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth by means of the mode of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation in the paper there are mainly three parts 1 introduced the general situation of the study area and its existing problems 2 described and established the spatial temporal equilibrium optimization model of irrigation water resources considering the dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation 3 realized the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources under the real water use constraints and groundwater level optimization in hcid 2 study area qingtongxia irrigation area in ningxia is one of the three largest artesian irrigation areas in china which is located in the middle and upper reaches of the yellow river and surrounded by tengger desert ulan buh desert and muus desert fig 1b the ecology is extremely fragile with sparse rainfall and intense evaporation the yellow river passes through the territory bringing vitality to the development of the irrigation area supported by the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river qingtongxia irrigation area has become an important component of the northwest arid desert grassland ecological barrier embedded in the western edge of north china and the seven zones and twenty three zones of agricultural production areas in china helan county irrigation district hcid is located in the north central part of qingtongxia irrigation area with 105 53 106 36 e and 38 27 38 52 n fig 1b it belongs to a typical temperate continental climate with annual average precipitation of 193 mm 80 of which is concentrated from june to september and the annual evaporation reaches 1716 8 mm the local water resources are extremely limited and the yellow river water becomes its main water source supported by the yellow river diversion water helan county has become a typical irrigated agricultural area with a land area of 1197 57 km2 and 77 56 of which is agricultural land including cultivated land garden woodland grass land and other agricultural land the current agricultural sown area is 48 794 ha including 12 760 ha for rice and 10 633 ha for wheat and corn due to the abundant light and heat resources it has become the main planting area of rice and vegetables supplied for hong kong in ningxia large scale planting of high water consumption crops and long term unreasonable irrigation development have led to the coexistence of water shortage waste of irrigation water and partial overloading of groundwater in hcid the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water was only 0 508 in 2018 lower than the average level of 0 535 in ningxia and 0 554 in china the annual groundwater consumption was 64 million m3 which is greater than the groundwater utilization index 35 million m3 the abnormal groundwater level caused by unreasonable water use is mainly manifested as a large number of groundwater exploitation around the city and well irrigated areas resulting in the continuous decline of groundwater level in the diversion irrigation area unreasonable irrigation such as waste of irrigation leads to shallow groundwater level and soil salinization according to the groundwater observation data of helan county the average groundwater depth in 2013 2017 in the south of hcid has reached 6 65 m which has decreased by 4 02 m compared with it in 1998 2005 while the average annual groundwater depth was only 1 19 m in 2013 2017 and only about 0 2 m in some periods in the north of hcid due to strong regional evaporation and shallow groundwater level regional soil salinization was caused li et al 2013 mi et al 2020 therefore based on the dual constraints of total water consumption and reasonable groundwater depth it is of great significance to explore the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in the way of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and dynamic coupling feedback of groundwater simulation for the sustainable development of irrigation area 3 method introduction 3 1 data sources and model description in this paper the development level of irrigation area in helan county in 2017 is taken as the current year to carry out the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the data of crop planting area in hcid came from the statistical yearbook http www nx gov cn and the statistical data of irrigation district management department http slt nx gov cn the irrigation water volume of each irrigation area was obtained from the ningxia water resources bulletin and the data recorded by the irrigation area management department the groundwater depth observation data was obtained from ningxia hydrology and water resources survey bureau the meteorological data such as precipitation temperature sunshine hours relative humidity and wind speed used to calculate crop water demand is from the china meteorological data sharing network http www cma gov cn the spatial temporal equilibrium optimal allocation model of irrigation water resources with considering groundwater level optimization adopts the three layer optimal structure of time optimization space optimization and groundwater optimization which is composed of an optimal allocation model and a groundwater simulation model in the spatial optimization the objective of optimization is the equity of social water use in each region and the minimum water shortage rate in each region of the irrigation area at the same time maintaining reasonable groundwater depth is considered to prevent soil degradation and salinization in irrigated areas specifically the irrigation water volume of different water sources and different periods output by the water resource allocation model is used as the input of the groundwater numerical model and the groundwater level in the corresponding periods of water supply and consumption conditions is obtained through groundwater numerical simulation through the repeated interaction and iterative calculation between the allocation process and the groundwater depth simulation the results of spatial optimal allocation of water resources with considering reasonable groundwater level are obtained in the temporal optimization the optimization within the year mainly takes the equilibrium degree of irrigation water shortage rate in different months of the year as the optimization objective specifically firstly the influence of groundwater depth changes on irrigation water demand is fully considered then according to the groundwater level of the last month the irrigation water demand of each month is calculated and the proportion of the current monthly irrigation water demand to annual irrigation water demand is obtained finally according to the proportion in the current month to the remaining available water resources in the allocation year the monthly cycle within the year is calculated to realize the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources within the year in the above mentioned way the distribution method of inter annual and intra annual adopts to realize the yearly and monthly continuous time balanced optimal control of the inter annual and intra annual periods under the constraint of the available irrigation water resources allocated by the administrative department year by year in the model composition the coupling process of spatial temporal equilibrium optimal allocation of irrigation water resources and groundwater simulation model consists of 5 modules fig 2 which includes data preparation module temporal optimization module spatial optimization module groundwater optimization module and cycle optimization module 3 2 the model s module description data preparation module it is mainly to prepare the basic data required for optimization and provide operation data support the minimum calculation unit i i 1 2 n can be divided according to the scope of irrigation water management in different reaches or irrigation channels

and optimizing irrigation water resources allocation within the year irrigation water demand is calculated by crop coefficient method and taking effective precipitation amount of groundwater directly absorbed and utilized by crop roots effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water and so on into consideration jiang et al 2014 seidel et al 2019 the crop coefficient method is used to

water in the optimized distribution of irrigation water resources within the year firstly according to the irrigation water demand of each calculation unit in different periods the ratio a j j 1 2 n of irrigation water demand in different periods to the total irrigation water demand of the region is determined then according to the available regional agricultural irrigation water if it is the first water supply stage of regional agricultural irrigation water the available water in the current optimization period is calculated by formula 6 if it is not the first water supply stage the current optimal monthly available water supply is calculated by formula 7 6 i 1 a 1 i 7 i j a j i 1 j 1 i y j 2 n where i is the available irrigation water 104 m3 a j is the ratio of irrigation water

groundwater depth adopts the modflow numerical simulation model which follows the principle of groundwater balance and darcy s law the spatial optimization results are inputted into the groundwater model and the groundwater optimization is realized by repeatedly adjusting the proportion of surface water and groundwater supply the objective of groundwater optimization is to minimize the deviation index of groundwater depth i e the cumulative value f 3 of the difference distance between groundwater depth and reasonable groundwater depth at each groundwater observation well and maximize the area

outputs the allocation results of irrigation water resources after each optimization stage and the groundwater depth after optimization and then enter the next stage through the cycle iteration optimization calculation of multiple periods the regional water units can realize the balanced and reasonable distribution of water consumption in the whole cycle 4 results and discussion 4 1 preparation for model calculation unit and initial groundwater depth according to the requirements of river canal and other irrigation water management scope of hcid hcid is divided into 20 basic calculation units fig 3a in combination with the irrigation scope and township boundary managed by the channel management of the main channels based on the monitoring data of groundwater level the initial groundwater depth of each calculation unit before optimization is obtained according to the data of groundwater level observation wells in hcid the groundwater depth distribution in the initial stage is obtained fig 3b the distribution of groundwater depth shows a trend of gradually shallower from south to north and the spatial distribution of groundwater depth has an important impact on the amount of direct utilization of groundwater by crop roots kahlown et al 2005 therefore it cannot be ignored in the optimal allocation of water resources constrained by the total amount of irrigation water resources the planting type and area they were obtained by combining statistical data and field investigation a i j k represent the planting area of the k crop in the month j of the i calculation unit mu the effective irrigated area of hcid is 42 18 thousand ha and the total planting area of crops is 48 79 thousand ha the proportion of main grain planting areas rice wheat corn wheat interplanting corn is 26 16 9 73 8 24 and 3 83 respectively the detailed planting structure and area of each calculation unit is shown in fig 4 reasonable groundwater depth range the change of groundwater level has great impact on ecological health and sustainable development of irrigation area if groundwater is too shallow the salt will rise along the capillary and accumulates in the topsoil under the action of evaporation causing salinization of the soil surface liu et al 2016 if the groundwater is too deep the natural vegetation will be subjected to water stress and wither resulting in desertification in the irrigation area fan et al 2008 yang et al 2006 hcid is the irrigation area of yellow river diversion the large scale irrigation of diverting the yellow river makes the surface water from the yellow river and groundwater transform frequently and it is common for groundwater to be buried too deep or too shallow therefore to protect the irrigated area from secondary salinization caused by too shallow groundwater and desertification caused by too deep groundwater the reasonable groundwater depth threshold h of hcid in this study is set from 1 2 m to 3 0 m which is relatively appropriate based on the local investigation and observation data and relevant research results du 2020 han et al 2009 wang et al 2004 xie et al 2007 the detailed monthly reasonable groundwater depth range is shown in fig 5 4 2 irrigation water allocation results irrigation water demand results according to the meteorological data crop planting area groundwater depth irrigation water utilization coefficient etc in the current optimization period and combined with the research results of xie et al xie et al 2001 the supplement of groundwater to crop water demand under different groundwater depths is calculated by formula 1 7 the results shown that the irrigation period of hcid is mainly concentrated from march to august and november of which march to august is the irrigation water requirement for crop growth and the winter irrigation under the traditional irrigation mode in november is used to maintain the ecological health of the irrigation area the final calculation shows that the total annual irrigation water demand of hcid is 574 95 million m3 of which the maximum irrigation water demand is 357 million m3 from june to august during the peak crop growth period accounting for 62 09 of the total water demand in november the irrigation water demand for winter irrigation is 64 million m3 accounting for 11 19 fig 6 groundwater level simulation setting the simulation of groundwater depth adopts modflow numerical simulation model the 6753 groundwater calculation grids are obtained by 0 4 km 0 4 km subdivision scheme the groundwater level data of groundwater monitoring well in hcid from january 2016 to december 2018 are used to identify and verify the groundwater simulation model the groundwater flow field lines fit well fig 7a the model has a good simulation effect on the groundwater flow field the observed and simulated groundwater levels of each observation well scatter around the slope of 45 and the error between the observed and simulated values of the observation well at the simulation period is small which the probability of being in the 99 confidence interval is 80 78 fig 7b fig 8 presents the comparison of groundwater level in two representative monitoring wells the model can well reflect the law of groundwater movement and can be used to predict the groundwater level under different irrigation schemes results of optimized irrigation water supply under the comprehensive consideration of water supply engineering capacity and available water then optimizing the allocation of irrigation water resources in hcid every month for the year the result of water resources allocation of the total water supply is 454million m3 including 429million m3 of surface water 25million m3 of underground water and the total water shortage ratio is 21 after optimization in total water supply the water supply of unit 1 4 9 and 13 lg hn jg hy cx tlmdq and cx tlnl accounts for more than 10 of the total water supply the water supply of unit 11 14 and 16 xg tlmdq nl tlnl and nq tlnq is less than 1 of the total water supply the amount of water supply is closely related to unit area and water demand in groundwater supply the groundwater supply of units 2 5 and 17 jx hn xg hy and hg tlnq accounts for more than 15 of the unit s water supply the detailed results of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources are shown in table 1 4 3 discussion and evaluation the evaluation of the calculation results of irrigation water demand the water demand for crop growth in the irrigation area mainly comes from irrigation water precipitation for the arid irrigated areas precipitation is rare and irrigation becomes the main water source to support crop growth uniyal and dietrich 2021 however due to long term diversion irrigation uneven spatial distribution of irrigation water resources and different groundwater utilization in different regions the groundwater level in irrigated areas is too shallow or too deep yin et al 2020 when the groundwater level is relatively shallow the crop root system can directly absorb the groundwater growth and the corresponding irrigation water demand is reduced if irrigation amount is still carried out with irrigation quota the groundwater level would continue to rise leading to soil salinization in the irrigated area and other problems the real water resource management constraints cannot be realized aiming at this the irrigation water demand and irrigation water allocation were calculated with considering the groundwater depth the annual irrigation water demand in hcid decreased by about 5 625 million m3 and 0 98 with an average reduction of 115 29 m3 per ha the irrigation water demand per ha decreases more were shallower groundwater depth fig 9 spatial temporal water use equilibrium and equity compared with before spatial temporal equilibrium optimization the total irrigation water shortage rate decreases from 21 61 to 21 on space optimization the difference of the water shortage rate in each calculation unit becomes smaller which remains between 12 9 and 23 5 two indicators the cumulative and the variance of water shortage rate of each calculation unit were involved to represent the spatial equilibrium degree of water use which decreased by 14 7 and 96 2 respectively table 2 and fig 10 in time optimization the difference of monthly water shortage rate is also reduced remains between 13 41 and 22 01 the cumulative and the variance water shortage rate of each month in the year decreases by 26 6 and 99 7 respectively table 2 and fig 11 the spatial balance of irrigation water use not only reflects the fairness of social benefits but also ensures the balance of regional water use which is an important factor to ensure the good social development of various regions li et al 2021 the relative equilibrium of water shortage rate in each region was realized through spatial equilibrium optimization for irrigation water it can achieve water use fairness in each region and maintain social equity and stability improve the crop yield of the whole region and enhance the regional risk resistance ability magidi et al 2021 temporal equilibrium optimization of irrigation water is to balance the uniformity of water use in each growth period of crops according to relevant studies shirazi et al 2014 zamora re et al 2020 zou et al 2021 the effect of water shortage in the key growth period on crop yield is irreversible it can effectively avoid the severe reduction of crop yield by considering the water demand and water shortage in each irrigation month and balancing the water shortage rate in the critical period of crop growth optimization of groundwater depth maintaining a reasonable groundwater depth can effectively prevent desertification and soil salinization in arid irrigated areas after groundwater depth optimization the average annual area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds increases from 168 50 km2 to 171 28 km2 which is by 1 65 compared with that before and after optimization from march to april the area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds increases from 250 95 km2 to 264 08 km2 with an increase of 5 23 from may to october the area increases by 0 6 minimum increase of 0 24 from november to february table 3 it is realized the optimal regulation of groundwater level in irrigated areas from the perspective of rational distribution of irrigation water resources meanwhile coupling the groundwater level numerical simulation model made up for the lack of characterization of groundwater depth in the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources uncertainty and limitation the uncertainty mainly comes from two aspects which are meteorological data and groundwater depth in the uncertainty of meteorological data for calculating irrigation water demand there is some difference between meteorological factors in each calculation unit in space which affects the accuracy of the result of calculating irrigation water demand in some degree however the uncertainty from meteorological data is acceptable in this study because the difference of meteorological factors can be ignored due to in small plain region ukhurebor et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 in the uncertainty of groundwater depth it is mainly in groundwater spatial distribution in this study 11 observation wells data in hcid are used the spatial distribution of groundwater depth calculated by interpolation can well reflect the spatial change of groundwater depth however due to the complex spatial variability of groundwater depth change regional microtopography change and groundwater permeability coefficient it also has some uncertainty influence on the amount of direct absorption of groundwater by crops with groundwater depth distribution bahrami et al 2020 moon et al 2004 the optimization of groundwater depth is changed to a good direction although the optimization effect of the average annual area of groundwater within reasonable groundwater table thresholds is only improved by 1 65 as the groundwater problems in the irrigation area are formed by perennial accumulation we only take the current representative year 2017 as an example to conduct optimal irrigation regulation for one year in the process of groundwater regulation water demand for crop growth should not be completely ignored and both groundwater level regulation and water demand for crop growth should be taken into account li et al 2020 therefore the one year optimization effect of groundwater given in this study is not significant and long term real time dynamic regulation is needed 5 conclusions we focus on the problem that allocation of irrigation water resources in irrigated areas cannot realize the real limited water uses constraint and the problem of the regulation of groundwater aiming at realizing the spatial temporal equilibrium and optimal allocation of irrigation water resources with the dual control of irrigation water quantity and groundwater level in this study we come up with a temporal and spatial optimal allocation method of water resources with considering groundwater level in irrigated areas to solve the problems addressed above there are three main highlights firstly in the calculation of irrigation water demand and allocation the irrigation water demand of hcid is reduced by 5 625 million m3 about 0 98 with fully considering the influence of direct utilization of groundwater by crop roots in shallow groundwater deep area on irrigation water demand the corresponding total water shortage rate reduced from 21 61 to 21 under the condition of limited available irrigation water resources it can effectively and accurately calculate regional irrigation water demand and provide support for groundwater regulation from the angle of irrigation water demand secondly under the real constraint of limited available irrigation water situation it is realized the fairness and balance of water use in each region and period through optimum allocation of irrigation water resources in time and space equilibrium optimization of hcid has been achieved for each calculation unit and for each month s water shortage rate which remains in 12 9 23 5 and in 13 41 22 01 respectively it can achieve water use fairness in each region and maintain social equity and stability and can meet the water demand in critical growth period of crops and guarantee the safety of regional food production thirdly under fully considering the basic water demand of crops and the groundwater depth optimized regulation of groundwater depth is realized by repeatedly iterations the process of spatial and temporal equilibrium irrigation water resources allocation the results show that the area located in the reasonable groundwater depth range increases by 1 65 it can optimize groundwater table while ensuring basic water use for crops and guarantee regional ecological health and sustainable development funding this work was financially supported by the national key research and development program

9213,agricultural subsurface drainage is necessary for crop production in humid poorly drained regions with frequent rainfall flooding and waterlogging have become more widespread and frequent in recent years and effective measures should be adopted to increase the subsurface drainage capacity and alleviate flooding and waterlogging disasters after short term heavy rainfall however subsurface drainage focused on the layout parameters drain depth drain spacing etc in previous studies and these measures were limited and cumbersome in the improvement of the flow rate of subsurface drainage thus we aimed to alleviate the flooding and waterlogging threats to farmland and innovatively proposed a new method to increase the flow rate of subsurface drainage namely siphon type subsurface drainage the paper evaluated the performance of the siphon type subsurface drainage by the indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model three factors were considered during the experiments conventional and improved subsurface drainage shallow medium and deep drain depth and the outlet elevation including the outlet elevation of the drain pipe under the non siphon drainage and the outlet elevation of the siphon pipe under the siphon drainage the results indicated that the siphon type subsurface drainage performed better under the conditions of steady state ponding and ponding subsided the flow rate of the siphon type subsurface drainage was 27 1 45 7 41 8 89 8 and 39 3 50 5 higher than that of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage with non siphon drainage under steady state ponding respectively it also had a significant advantage when the outlet elevation was the same the siphon type subsurface drainage could increase the flow rate during ponding subsided and reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappears the flooding removal effect of the siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly better than that of non siphon subsurface drainage the water head and flow rate were used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d model the results indicated that the simulated values of flow rate matched well with the measured ones and the relative errors were less than 10 the influence range and absolute values of the negative water head increased with the decrease of outlet elevation and the increase effect of flow rate increased with the decrease of the water head the siphon type subsurface drainage has more control distance than the non siphon the advantages of siphon type subsurface drainage are not only prominent in quart sand but also applicable to field soil the results of this study could provide technical support for the application of flooding and waterlogging removal in areas where waterlogging is prone to occur and could improve the ability of agricultural production to address waterlogging disasters keywords siphon type subsurface drainage flow rate conventional subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage ponding hydrus 2d model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction climate change intensifies with social development and changes regional hydrological cycles and water resource distribution barnett et al 2008 milly et al 2008 resulting in an increasing number of extreme precipitation events karl et al 1995 karl and knight 1998 and frequent flood events wang et al 2013 flood events have become the most frequent and severe natural disaster over the past 25 years fao 2018 and they may cause excess soil water on farmland long term soaking in water affects the physical characteristics of soil sharma and de datta 1985 growth and yield of the crop lal and taylor 1969 painuli et al 1988 ashraf 2012 therefore to adapt to the adverse effects of extreme climate the harm of flood disasters to agricultural production needs to be alleviated farmland drainage is an essential means of solving flood disasters and alleviating crop waterlogging stress the farmland drainage system can provide better ventilation conditions haghnazari et al 2020 nakajima and lal 2014 ritzema et al 2008 change the structure of soil jafari talukolaee et al 2018 and significantly increase the growth indices and yield of the crop darzi naftchali et al 2018 asgari et al 2021 subsurface drainage is a crucial part of farmland drainage it has gradually matured since the 1950 s li et al 2003 and has begun to be popularized and applied in irrigation districts subsurface drainage has the advantages of less cultivated land occupation convenient farming and maintenance ren et al 2021 and is an effective way to remove excess soil water from the fields control the water table reduce surface runoff and reduce loss of nitrogen and phosphorus algoazany et al 2007 bengtson 1995 ren et al 2021 proved that conventional subsurface drainage also can assist in removing surface ponding however the flow rate of subsurface drainage was limited many researchers have studied the increase in drainage capacity and the rapid decrease in the water table filipović et al 2014 compared conventional subsurface drainage with or without gravel trenches and the results indicated that the improved systems could more effectively increase the flow rate and reduce the surface runoff than conventional subsurface drainage based on this another improved drainage method hereafter referred to as improved subsurface drainage was proposed by replacing the soil around the drain pipe with a soil medium of high permeability tao et al 2016 found that the improved subsurface drainage had a larger flow rate than conventional subsurface drainage in a fully saturated fine sand medium by indoor experiments and confirmed the research results by field experiments tao et al 2019a 2019b to increase the flow rate of conventional subsurface drainage nie et al 2018 proposed a means of forming a preferential flow by installing a guide pipe from the soil surface to the drain pipe the combinations of different drainage measures wang et al 2014 or different drain depths hornbuckle et al 2007 were applied to increase the flow rate of subsurface drainage however such methods are usually costly and cumbersome in practical application therefore to improve the drainage capacity of conventional subsurface drainage it is necessary to explore a simple and efficient new method currently the siphon principle is widely used in drainage primarily for roof drainage arthur and swaffield 2001 wright et al 2006 mine drainage yan 2016 road landslide drainage yu et al 2019 gillarduzzi 2008 reservoir emergency rescues li and tao 2007 and other drainage projects the drainage effect increased as the water head difference increased between the inlet and outlet wu 2019 however the siphon has not been used in agricultural subsurface drainage therefore it is important to evaluate the effect of flooding and waterlogging removal of siphon type subsurface drainage due to the limitations of field experiments the design parameters are often optimized by numerical methods the hydrus 2d model can be used to simulate the water distribution and movement in the soil conditions ebrahimian and noory 2015 kesgin et al 2019 and has been widely used in farmland irrigation and drainage yang et al 2019 feng et al 2021 this study was conducted using an indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model to study the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage a siphon pipe was connected to the outlet of the drain pipe conventional and improved subsurface drainage the drainage performance of different subsurface drainage measures with or without a siphon was studied and the effects of siphon type subsurface drainage on increasing the performance of subsurface drainage under shallow and medium drains were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 the siphon type subsurface drainage limited by soil hydraulic conductivity the flow rate of the subsurface drainage is much lower than that of the open ditch drainage in existing subsurface drainage engineering to obtain a larger flow rate the drain pipe is buried deep in areas where the water table is high and prone to waterlogging disasters however there are also some problems such as difficulty in construction more auxiliary facilities and relatively high costs a shallow drain pipe can shorten the infiltration path of surface water and accelerate its infiltration the shallow drain pipe is easier to receive the surface infiltration water than the deep ones but its flow rate is limited siphon drainage is caused by the water head difference between the inlet and outlet lucke and beecham 2015 a new drainage form was proposed to increase the flow rate of the shallow drain in farmlands the use of the siphon called siphon type subsurface drainage siphon type subsurface drainage is comprised of two parts a subsurface drain pipe and a siphon and only a siphon needs to be installed at the outlet of the subsurface drain pipe to lower the outlet elevation thus it has the advantages of simple installation low cost and is easy to improve the drainage capacity of the current subsurface drain pipe it overcomes the shallow drain disadvantage of the small flow rate and makes use of the advantages of the small infiltration path and the difference in water head which can improve the efficiency of flooding and waterlogging removal in farmland the diagram of the siphon type subsurface drainage is shown in fig 1 2 2 indoor test 2 2 1 experimental material an indoor sand tank test was conducted in this study based on the seepage similarity principle lennoz gratin 1989 wen et al 2021 the drain pipe and drain depth were reduced to a scale of 1 20 the net size of the sand tank was 50 20 30 cm length width height the diameter of the drain pipe was 6 35 mm and holes were evenly distributed on the pipe wall with a perforation rate of 1 2 the test soil was divided into two types one was highly permeable gravel 2 4 mm diameter of quartz sand which was laid at the bottom of the sand tank at a height of 4 cm a 1 cm diameter open hole charging pipe was laid along the length of the sand tank and used for the water charge and gas removal from the bottom the other soil medium was 80 120 mesh quartz sand with a height of 22 5 cm which was filled layer by layer according to the bulk density of quartz sand to simulate the soil conditions the quartz sand was used to reduce the duration of the test facilitate water charging and gas removal and effectively explore the drainage law a gauze was directly laid at the interface between the two soils to avoid the loss of upper soil the water was gradually injected through the charging pipe at the bottom until the water table reached the soil surface when the soil was saturated the bottom charging pipe was closed and the fixed height of the water tank was connected to the upper charging pipe to maintain a certain ponding height a schematic diagram of the test device is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 experimental design a steady state ponding and an unsteady state ponding subsided on the soil surface were used to test the performance of the siphon type subsurface drainage under soil saturated conditions the drain pipes were arranged on one side wall of the sand tank and the drain spacing l was assumed to be constant the soil was a homogeneous and isotropic medium three factors were selected in the experiment first two types of subsurface drainage were selected namely conventional subsurface drainage cd and improved subsurface drainage id the improved subsurface drainage adopted two kinds of filter height 1 cm height was called thin improved subsurface drainage id 1 and 2 cm height was called thick improved subsurface drainage id 2 since the pipe was located on the sidewall of the sand tank the filter body shown in fig 3 b and c adopted half the bottom width i e 1 cm second the drain depth was selected the selection of drain depth primarily considered the crop waterlogging tolerance depth and economic feasibility in waterlogging prone areas of southern china three drain depth schemes were set up shallow 2 5 cm medium 4 0 cm and deep 5 5 cm which corresponded to actual drain depths of 50 80 and 110 cm represented by s m and d respectively third the outlet elevation was selected and divided into two cases one was the outlet elevation of the drain pipe under non siphon drainage and the other was the outlet elevation of the siphon pipe under siphon drainage considering the drain depth the siphon pipe was set to increase the shallow drain to medium drain and deep drain and the medium drain to deep drain the design of the experiment is presented in table 1 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage for example s id 1 was used to represent the thin improved subsurface drainage with non siphon drainage under shallow drain conditions and s id 1 d was used to represent the thin improved subsurface drainage with siphon drainage under shallow drain conditions when the outlet elevation was consistent with a deep drain 2 2 3 measurement method the test was divided into two free outflow conditions steady state drainage with a 2 0 cm ponding height and unsteady state drainage with a 2 0 cm ponding height as the initial conditions of the ponding subsided the flow rate and water head were both measured over time the flow rate under different drainage treatments was measured five times by measuring the outflow volume at a certain time using a counting cup the water head was measured by the piezometer 2 3 numerical simulation the field subsurface drainage experiment is time consuming and laborious the hydrus 2d model was used to further quantify the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage 2 3 1 the basic theory of hydrus 2d in hydrus 2d model a two dimensional saturated unsaturated richards equation šimůnek et al 2006 was adopted to describe soil water movement 1 θ t x k θ θ x z k θ θ z k θ z s where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d k θ is the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 x and z are the spatial coordinates cm s is a sink term d 1 the van genuchten vg model was used to describe soil hydraulic functions van genuchten 1980 the expressions of the vg model were given by 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s denote the residual and saturated volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively s e is the effective saturation α cm 1 and n are retention curve shape factors and l is a pore connectivity parameter the hydrus 2d has five soil hydraulic parameters of which the θ r θ s a and n were obtained by manual model calibration the k was obtained by a one dimensional soil column test 2 3 2 initial condition and boundary condition in this experiment the initial condition of the soil was saturation and the pressure head gradually increased from the soil surface to the bottom the a b d c boundary of the sand tank was defined as no flux boundary the drain pipe was set to be a seepage boundary under non siphon drainage conditions the specified pressure head of the seepage boundary was 0 under siphon drainage conditions the specified pressure head was the difference between the water head with and without the siphon table 2 the unsteady state drainage started from the initial condition of 2 0 cm ponding height until the water table decreased below the depth of the plowing layer during the experiment the water head was obtained according to the piezometer and it changed dynamically with time the a c boundary was set as the variable head boundary under soil saturated conditions the atmospheric boundary under soil unsaturated conditions and the constant head boundary under different ponding heights fig 4 evaporation and rainfall were ignored because of the short test time 2 3 3 calibration and validation firstly the hydrus 2d was used to calibrate unknown parameters θ r θ s a and n of the quartz sand and filter medium according to observed drain processes on the non siphon drainage of m cd m id 1 m id 2 and the siphon drainage of m cd d m id 1 d m id 2 d then it was verified by s cd d cd d id 2 d id 1 s id 1 s cd d s cd m s id 1 d and s id 1 m 2 3 4 soil hydraulic parameters the hydraulic conductivity of the quartz sand and filter medium were calculated using darcy s law eq 6 by a one dimensional soil column test under steady state drainage conditions 6 k q s a h 2 h 1 where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil medium cm d 1 q is the flow rate per unit time cm3 d 1 s is the seepage path length cm a is the cross sectional area of the soil medium cm2 and h 2 and h 1 are the water heads of the upper and lower layers of the soil medium respectively cm the calculated average hydraulic conductivity of the quartz sand and filter medium is 196 99 cm d and 384 48 cm d respectively the soil hydraulic parameters of the hydrus 2d model are shown in table 3 for the conventional subsurface drainage the width b 0 and height z 0 of the filter were both 0 for the improved subsurface drainage b 0 and z 0 were set according to the actual situation and the soil around the pipe was changed into the filter medium 2 3 5 the evaluation indicators of the simulation model the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model 7 r 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 9 n r m s e r m s e p where o i and p i are measured and simulated values respectively n is the number of measured values o and p are the average values of measured and simulated the closer the determination coefficient r2 is to 1 the better the correlation degree is the root mean square error rmse measures the average difference between the simulated and measured values the closer the rmse value is to 0 the smaller the deviation between the simulated and measured values the normalized root mean square error nrmse represents the performance of the model when nrmse 10 the simulation performance is excellent when 10 nrmse 20 the simulation performance is good when 20 nrmse 30 the simulation performance is fair when nrmse 30 the simulation performance is poor the comparison and statistical results of the simulated and measured flow rates with or without the siphon are shown in fig 5 and table 4 respectively the results showed that the simulated values have a good fitting trend with the measured values in the stage of flooding removal the results were distributed near the y x line and the overall errors were within 10 the errors were large in the stage of waterlogging removal and the measured values were larger than the simulated values the statistical parameters r2 rmse and nrmse varied from 0 87 to 0 97 0 85 2 32 ml min and 2 2 19 9 for non siphon drainage and 0 87 0 97 1 22 3 58 ml min and 9 0 16 2 for siphon drainage respectively which reflected the good performance of the model 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance was carried out using spss ver 19 0 spss corp chicago usa one way analysis of variance anova was used the least significant difference lsd the significant differences between treatments at p 0 05 it was used to compare the flow rate with or without the siphon of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage respectively fig 6 it was also used to compare the flow rate with or without the siphon of drainage types under different water heads fig 9 two way anova was also used the least significant difference lsd the significant differences between treatments at p 0 05 it was used to test the interaction effects between drainage type and the same outlet elevation with or without siphon deep drain and medium deep drain table 5 the significance analysis was carried out for five sets of the flow rates under the same conditions 3 results 3 1 effect of the flow rate under steady state ponding under steady state ponding a comparison of the flow rate with or without the siphon is shown in fig 6 the results indicated that compared with the subsurface drainage with non siphon the siphon could significantly increase the drainage capacity of the conventional and improved subsurface drainage by increasing the water head under the same drain depth for the conventional subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 30 6 60 4 compared with the non siphon under the shallow drain and by 27 1 under the medium drain for the thin improved subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 41 8 89 8 compared with the non siphon under the shallow drain and by 50 5 under the medium drain for the thick improved subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 39 3 compared with the non siphon under the medium drain the siphon type subsurface drainage can shorten the infiltration path of ponding to increase the flow rate at the same outlet elevation compared with m cd and m id 1 the flow rate of s cd m and s id 1 m increased by 31 9 and 16 7 respectively compared with d cd the flow rates of s cd d and m cd d increased by 35 2 and 19 6 respectively for the thin improved subsurface drainage compared with d id 1 the flow rate of s id 1 d and m id 1 d increased by 44 8 and 23 3 respectively for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of m id 2 d was 24 9 higher than that of d id 2 the significance analysis showed that the flow rate had significant differences among different treatments p 0 05 for the same drainage type fig 6 and the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than the non siphon the results of the intersubjective effect test for the same outlet elevation between deep drain and medium deep drain are shown in table 5 the drainage type with or without the siphon and two factor interaction had an extremely significant relationship p 0 01 by simulation the distribution of simulated water head with or without siphon under the steady state drainage condition is shown in fig 7 the results showed that the siphon could produce a negative water head near the drain pipe the influence range and the absolute value of the negative water head increased as the outlet elevation decreased because the equivalent radius of the improved subsurface drainage is larger than that of the conventional subsurface drainage tao et al 2016 the influence range of the negative water head of the improved subsurface drainage is larger than that of the conventional subsurface drainage under the siphon drainage 3 2 effect of the flow rate under ponding subsided the siphon can play the full advantage of conventional and improved subsurface drainage in removing flooding and waterlogging fig 8 shows the change of flow rate during the whole drainage process with or without the siphon from 2 0 cm of ponding height to ponding disappearance and then the water table drops down near the elevation of the drain pipe the whole drainage process could be divided into three stages firstly the flow rate decreased linearly with time under the ponding condition secondly when the ponding dropped to the soil surface the flow rate decreased rapidly in a short time which was also the transition stage between the saturated and unsaturated soils finally in the waterlogging removal stage the water table was lower than the soil surface and dropped close to the drain pipe and the flow rate was small and decreased gradually until it approached zero the relationship between flow rate and water head with or without the siphon is shown in fig 9 the soil surface was considered as the zero reference line when there was ponding on the soil surface the water head was greater than 0 when the ponding disappeared and the water table was in the falling stage the water head was smaller than 0 the flow rate attenuation degree was defined as the change of flow rate from the time when the ponding began to subside to the time when the ponding water disappeared for the conventional subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the s cd m and s cd d was reduced from 44 8 non siphon to 37 5 and 33 1 respectively and that of the m cd d was reduced from 44 9 non siphon to 31 9 for the thin improved subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the s id 1 m and s id 1 d was reduced from 66 0 non siphon to 43 5 and 34 3 respectively and that of the m id 1 d was reduced from 54 2 non siphon to 32 8 for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the m id 2 d was reduced from 44 8 non siphon to 37 9 the siphon type subsurface drainage could significantly increase the flow rate and effectively reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappeared thus it could further increase the efficiency of flooding removal when there was ponding on the soil surface the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than that of non siphon when the ponding water disappeared the flow rate of siphon drainage was still greater than that of non siphon drainage but the significance differences was weak fig 10 shows the variation of simulated flow rate increase effect with the water head for the siphon type subsurface drainage under the same drainage type and drain depth conditions the results showed that the flow rate increase effect increased with the decrease of water head and presented an exponential curve when the water table was close to the plowing layer the flow rate decreased rapidly and the increase effect reached its maximum for conventional subsurface drainage the flow rate of s cd m and s cd d increased by 24 7 88 2 and 49 5 161 6 compared with s cd compared with m cd the flow rate of m cd d increased by 24 7 49 5 for the thin improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of s id 1 m and s id 1 d increased by 33 5 102 3 79 0 223 3 compared with s id 1 and that of m id 1 d increased by 32 0 64 4 compared with m id 1 for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of m id 2 d increased by 35 4 69 5 compared with m id 2 in the stage of flooding removal the flow rate was large but the flow rate increase effect was relatively small while in the stage of waterlogging removal the flow rate was small but the flow rate increase effect was relatively large at the stage of flooding removal the flow rate increase effects of simulated values have the same change trend as measured and there is little difference but the difference may increase in the stage of waterlogging removal 3 3 effect of flooding and waterlogging removal the effect of siphon type subsurface drainage on flooding and waterlogging removal could be intuitively expressed through changes in the water head over time fig 11 the time when the ponding height decreased from 2 0 cm to 0 0 cm was defined as the flooding removal time and the time when the water table decreased from the surface to below the plowing layer was defined as the waterlogging removal time for the conventional subsurface drainage compared with s cd s cd m and s cd d reduced the flooding removal time by 10 3 and 37 9 respectively and the waterlogging removal time by 25 0 and 62 5 respectively compared with m cd m cd d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 15 2 and 33 3 respectively for the thin improved subsurface drainage compared with s id 1 s id 1 m and s id 1 d reduced the flooding removal time by 41 7 and 57 9 respectively and the waterlogging removal time by 40 0 and 60 0 respectively compared with m id 1 m id 1 d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 47 1 and 60 0 respectively for the thick improved subsurface drainage compared with m id 2 m id 2 d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 35 7 and 30 0 respectively generally m id 2 d took the least time to remove the flooding the waterlogging removal effect of the siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly better than that of non siphon subsurface drainage when the outlet elevation was consistent with the deep drain there was a slight difference in the waterlogging removal time for the improved subsurface drainage with the siphon because of the small amount of soil water stored within the effective plowing layer 3 4 effect of the drain spacing when the height of the ponding water is fixed the flow rate q variation with drain spacing l is shown in fig 12 when the drain spacing was at the effective control distance the flow rate obviously increases with the increased of drain spacing and when the drain spacing exceeded the effective control distance the flow rate was close to stable for the improved subsurface drainage the flow rate variation range was larger than the conventional subsurface drainage when the drain spacing was 15 25 cm this indicated that the improved subsurface drainage has a larger control distance and when l h d was greater than 10 the flow rate was little affected by the drain spacing tao et al 2017 have obtained the same result when comparing the effects of conventional and improved subsurface drainage regarding effective control distance in addition it was not difficult to find that siphon drainage can increase the effective control distance of the subsurface drainage measures 3 5 effect of the soil texture soil texture is an important factor affecting flow rate kaur et al 2017 nelson 2017 to reflect the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage in the field conditions soil parameters of the xinmaqiao experimental station in anhui province china tao et al 2017 were used for model simulation fig 13 shows the simulation results of conventional subsurface drainage using indoor sand tank test and field soil parameters it could be seen from the figure that the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage in the field was slightly larger than that in the indoor test it further proved the feasibility of siphon type subsurface drainage 4 discussion 4 1 theoretical analysis 4 1 1 influencing parameters of subsurface drainage according to the kirkham equation of conventional subsurface drainage and the tao equation of improved subsurface drainage eq 10 under the ponding the flow rate is related to the soil hydraulic conductivity k the thickness of ponding water s drain depth h d the radius of the drain pipe r 0 f values and the drain spacing l s h d r 0 is the effective water head above the pipe center kirkham 1949 tao et al 2019a 2019b the f value is the important parameter that affects the flow rate under the same water head soil texture and drain spacing when the depth of the impermeable layer t is large the f value can be expressed by eq 11 and the second term in the formula can be ignored when the drain spacing l is large the f value can be expressed by eq 12 and the second term in the formula can be ignored the width and height of the filter were both 2 cm for improved subsurface drainage the calculation results of the influence of geometric parameters on f value are shown in table 6 and fig 13 fig 14 10 q 2 π k s h d r 0 f l 11 f ln sinh π 2 h r l sinh π r l m 1 1 m ln sinh 2 2 π m t l sinh 2 π r l sinh 2 2 π m t l sinh 2 π 2 h

inversely proportional to the drain spacing and the depth of the impermeable layer when the parameters were increased by the same multiple the f values with drain depth the radius of drain pipe drain spacing and the depth of impermeable layer changed by 0 293 0 163 0 015 and 0 010 respectively for conventional subsurface drainage and by 0 920 0 004 0 013 and 0 011 respectively for improved subsurface drainage the results indicated that the order of the influence of geometric parameters on f value for the conventional subsurface drainage was drain depth radius of the drain pipe drain spacing the depth of the impermeable layer and the result was the same as that proved by wang et al 2021 for the improved subsurface drainage the r 0 was different from the conventional subsurface drainage and the slope of the curve was the smallest the reason was that the equivalent radius of improved subsurface drainage was much bigger than the actual radius tao et al 2016 4 1 2 principle of the siphon type subsurface drainage the flow rate increased as the drain depth increased and the result explained that the effect of the water head was greater than the f value the lower the outlet elevation the larger the acting water head the greater the flow rate increase of siphon type subsurface drainage at the same outlet elevation the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than that of conventional drainage the main reason was that under the same water head the f value of non siphon drainage was large so the flow rate was small similarly at the same outlet elevation the shallow deep drain was superior to the medium deep drain therefore the shallow deep drain increased the flow rate by increasing the water head and decreasing the f value which has not been studied in the past 4 2 analysis of the simulation result in the stage of waterlogging removal the main reasons for the large errors between the simulated and measured values by hydrus 2d figs 5 and 9 were as follows firstly due to the limited amount of water stored in the soil the water table dropped rapidly to the depth of the drain pipe secondly since the change of the piezometer might lag behind the actual water table the systematic errors of the measured values might occur thirdly when the soil was unsaturated the water table was not horizontal but elliptical or parabolic the hydrus 2d model was difficult to set the initial water head accurately which led to the large errors between the simulated and measured values in the waterlogging removal stage the errors could be magnified several times in hydrus 2d the setting of boundary conditions is the key to numerical simulation salehi et al 2017 but it often be simplified in practical application the subsurface drain pipe is mainly composed of corrugated plastic pipe and synthetic geotextile the perforation rate of corrugated plastic pipe and the specification of synthetic geotextile affect the drainage performance dierickx 1980 in principle the perforation rate should be as large as possible to reduce inlet resistance and as small as possible to prevent soil particles from entering and blocking the pipe nijland et al 2005 the conventional subsurface drainage is regularly treated as the seepage boundary in the hydrus 2d model ebrahimian and noory 2015 but the perforation rate of the drain pipe often less than 3 in practical applications li et al 2022 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 is ignored li et al 2016 geotextiles of different specifications should be covered according to different soil types to prevent soil particles from entering the pipe under the condition of a certain perforation rate li et al 2022 the specifications of geotextile will affect the effective radius and the flow rate of conventional subsurface drainage rollin et al 1987 but the actual specifications of the geotextile are ignored in the hydrus 2d the boundary conditions need to be further improved in future verification moreover it is also necessary to further study whether the negative pressure value of siphon type subsurface drainage will change during the drawdown stage of the water head besides it is necessary to further verify the feasibility of siphon type subsurface drainage through field experiments and apply the hydrus 2d model to provide technical support for the parameter design and economic benefits 4 3 application of siphon type subsurface drainage 4 3 1 layout of the siphon pipe when the pipe is running full the drainage efficiency is obvious and once there is air into the siphon pipe the bubble will break down the negative pressure conditions greatly affecting the drainage effect beecham and lucke 2013 to avoid the bubble entering the drain pipe two measures are often adopted one is to use the siphon with a smaller inner diameter which can maximize the drainage efficiency of the siphon cai et al 2014 sun et al 2019 mei et al 2017 the other is to immerse the outlet of the siphon pipe in water to create a vacuum yu et al 2019 in the application of farmland drainage the elevation height of the siphon type subsurface drainage should not be too large it should be comprehensively determined according to the constant water level height and duration time of the drainage ditch during the rainstorm the head loss coefficient is a key parameter in the hydraulic optimization design the influencing factors include the roughness of the pipe wall the area of the pipe cross section the angle of the turning the radius of the turning etc li et al 2008 in addition to the three factors of the experiment we have also taken into account the length of the siphon pipe with a constant turning angle and the turning angle between the siphon and subsurface drainage with a constant siphon pipe length under the same outlet elevation however the results indicated that the siphon pipe length and turning angle had little effect on the flow rate the frictional head loss and the local head loss produced by the drain pipe could be ignored in the test an inverted siphon form was also used to study the outflow of the pipe because the pipe s outflow was the full pipe flow an inverted siphon had no advantage in the experiment therefore further experimental research has not been conducted 4 3 2 layout of subsurface drainage drain depth is an important factor that affects the flow rate and nutrient loss of subsurface drainage the shallow drain can be easier to accept the ponding water into the drain pipe and it can reduce the nitrogen craft et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 and phosphorus saadat et al 2018 load the deep drain was more efficient in improving the flow rate and mitigating the environmental effects of heavy metals darzi naftchali et al 2022 than the shallow ones the filter around the drain pipe not only improves the drainage performance turtola and paajanen 1995 but also alleviates the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus tao et al 2019a 2019b siphon type subsurface drainage is a new way to improve the drainage efficiency of conventional subsurface drainage it has a more obvious flow rate increase effect than the existing improved subsurface drainage id under the same drain depth at steady state ponding fig 6 the drain depth and outflow elevation should be set reasonably according to the actual condition to improve the flow rate and alleviate the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus farmland drainage can be used in the combination form of shallow deep alternating drainage shallow deep alternating drainage can also reduce excavation and construction costs and avoid excessive drainage or inadequate drainage verma et al 1998 ren et al 2021 on the shallow side the siphon can be installed at the outlet of conventional subsurface drainage on the deep side improved subsurface drainage can be used 5 conclusions the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage was studied by an indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model three key factors were considered in the test the type of subsurface drainage drain depth and outlet elevation based on the test results the following conclusions were drawn first the siphon type subsurface drainage could increase the flow rate of conventional and improved subsurface drainage it had an apparent effect on the increase of flow rate at the same drain depth and the flow rate of the siphon was significantly higher than that of the non siphon at the same outlet elevation for conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of the siphon type subsurface drainage was 27 1 45 7 41 8 89 8 and 39 3 50 5 higher than that of non siphon drainage at the same drain depth respectively and 19 6 35 2 16 7 44 8 and 24 9 higher than that of non siphon at the same outlet elevation respectively the siphon could reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappears second siphon type subsurface drainage could significantly shorten the drainage time of flooding and waterlogging removal for conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage the siphon type subsurface drainage could reduce the flooding removal time by 10 3 37 9 41 7 57 9 and 35 7 the waterlogging removal time by 25 0 62 5 40 0 60 0 and 30 respectively finally the simulated flow rate by the hydrus 2d model matched well with the measured values the influence range and absolute values of the negative water head increased with the decrease of outlet elevation and the increase effect of the flow rate increased with the decrease of water head the siphon type subsurface drainage has more control distance than the non siphon and the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage of the field soil was slightly larger than that quart sand in the indoor test generally siphon type subsurface drainage has advantages such as less cultivated land occupation shallow excavation depth good drainage effect and convenient construction siphon type subsurface drainage has excellent application and popularization value for flooding and waterlogging removal in waterlogging prone areas and farmland drainage reconstruction under the premise of reducing land excavation and increasing the efficiency of subsurface drainage the present results can provide theoretical support and technical guidance for flooding and waterlogging removal projects in areas with

9213,agricultural subsurface drainage is necessary for crop production in humid poorly drained regions with frequent rainfall flooding and waterlogging have become more widespread and frequent in recent years and effective measures should be adopted to increase the subsurface drainage capacity and alleviate flooding and waterlogging disasters after short term heavy rainfall however subsurface drainage focused on the layout parameters drain depth drain spacing etc in previous studies and these measures were limited and cumbersome in the improvement of the flow rate of subsurface drainage thus we aimed to alleviate the flooding and waterlogging threats to farmland and innovatively proposed a new method to increase the flow rate of subsurface drainage namely siphon type subsurface drainage the paper evaluated the performance of the siphon type subsurface drainage by the indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model three factors were considered during the experiments conventional and improved subsurface drainage shallow medium and deep drain depth and the outlet elevation including the outlet elevation of the drain pipe under the non siphon drainage and the outlet elevation of the siphon pipe under the siphon drainage the results indicated that the siphon type subsurface drainage performed better under the conditions of steady state ponding and ponding subsided the flow rate of the siphon type subsurface drainage was 27 1 45 7 41 8 89 8 and 39 3 50 5 higher than that of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage with non siphon drainage under steady state ponding respectively it also had a significant advantage when the outlet elevation was the same the siphon type subsurface drainage could increase the flow rate during ponding subsided and reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappears the flooding removal effect of the siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly better than that of non siphon subsurface drainage the water head and flow rate were used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 2d model the results indicated that the simulated values of flow rate matched well with the measured ones and the relative errors were less than 10 the influence range and absolute values of the negative water head increased with the decrease of outlet elevation and the increase effect of flow rate increased with the decrease of the water head the siphon type subsurface drainage has more control distance than the non siphon the advantages of siphon type subsurface drainage are not only prominent in quart sand but also applicable to field soil the results of this study could provide technical support for the application of flooding and waterlogging removal in areas where waterlogging is prone to occur and could improve the ability of agricultural production to address waterlogging disasters keywords siphon type subsurface drainage flow rate conventional subsurface drainage improved subsurface drainage ponding hydrus 2d model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction climate change intensifies with social development and changes regional hydrological cycles and water resource distribution barnett et al 2008 milly et al 2008 resulting in an increasing number of extreme precipitation events karl et al 1995 karl and knight 1998 and frequent flood events wang et al 2013 flood events have become the most frequent and severe natural disaster over the past 25 years fao 2018 and they may cause excess soil water on farmland long term soaking in water affects the physical characteristics of soil sharma and de datta 1985 growth and yield of the crop lal and taylor 1969 painuli et al 1988 ashraf 2012 therefore to adapt to the adverse effects of extreme climate the harm of flood disasters to agricultural production needs to be alleviated farmland drainage is an essential means of solving flood disasters and alleviating crop waterlogging stress the farmland drainage system can provide better ventilation conditions haghnazari et al 2020 nakajima and lal 2014 ritzema et al 2008 change the structure of soil jafari talukolaee et al 2018 and significantly increase the growth indices and yield of the crop darzi naftchali et al 2018 asgari et al 2021 subsurface drainage is a crucial part of farmland drainage it has gradually matured since the 1950 s li et al 2003 and has begun to be popularized and applied in irrigation districts subsurface drainage has the advantages of less cultivated land occupation convenient farming and maintenance ren et al 2021 and is an effective way to remove excess soil water from the fields control the water table reduce surface runoff and reduce loss of nitrogen and phosphorus algoazany et al 2007 bengtson 1995 ren et al 2021 proved that conventional subsurface drainage also can assist in removing surface ponding however the flow rate of subsurface drainage was limited many researchers have studied the increase in drainage capacity and the rapid decrease in the water table filipović et al 2014 compared conventional subsurface drainage with or without gravel trenches and the results indicated that the improved systems could more effectively increase the flow rate and reduce the surface runoff than conventional subsurface drainage based on this another improved drainage method hereafter referred to as improved subsurface drainage was proposed by replacing the soil around the drain pipe with a soil medium of high permeability tao et al 2016 found that the improved subsurface drainage had a larger flow rate than conventional subsurface drainage in a fully saturated fine sand medium by indoor experiments and confirmed the research results by field experiments tao et al 2019a 2019b to increase the flow rate of conventional subsurface drainage nie et al 2018 proposed a means of forming a preferential flow by installing a guide pipe from the soil surface to the drain pipe the combinations of different drainage measures wang et al 2014 or different drain depths hornbuckle et al 2007 were applied to increase the flow rate of subsurface drainage however such methods are usually costly and cumbersome in practical application therefore to improve the drainage capacity of conventional subsurface drainage it is necessary to explore a simple and efficient new method currently the siphon principle is widely used in drainage primarily for roof drainage arthur and swaffield 2001 wright et al 2006 mine drainage yan 2016 road landslide drainage yu et al 2019 gillarduzzi 2008 reservoir emergency rescues li and tao 2007 and other drainage projects the drainage effect increased as the water head difference increased between the inlet and outlet wu 2019 however the siphon has not been used in agricultural subsurface drainage therefore it is important to evaluate the effect of flooding and waterlogging removal of siphon type subsurface drainage due to the limitations of field experiments the design parameters are often optimized by numerical methods the hydrus 2d model can be used to simulate the water distribution and movement in the soil conditions ebrahimian and noory 2015 kesgin et al 2019 and has been widely used in farmland irrigation and drainage yang et al 2019 feng et al 2021 this study was conducted using an indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model to study the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage a siphon pipe was connected to the outlet of the drain pipe conventional and improved subsurface drainage the drainage performance of different subsurface drainage measures with or without a siphon was studied and the effects of siphon type subsurface drainage on increasing the performance of subsurface drainage under shallow and medium drains were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 the siphon type subsurface drainage limited by soil hydraulic conductivity the flow rate of the subsurface drainage is much lower than that of the open ditch drainage in existing subsurface drainage engineering to obtain a larger flow rate the drain pipe is buried deep in areas where the water table is high and prone to waterlogging disasters however there are also some problems such as difficulty in construction more auxiliary facilities and relatively high costs a shallow drain pipe can shorten the infiltration path of surface water and accelerate its infiltration the shallow drain pipe is easier to receive the surface infiltration water than the deep ones but its flow rate is limited siphon drainage is caused by the water head difference between the inlet and outlet lucke and beecham 2015 a new drainage form was proposed to increase the flow rate of the shallow drain in farmlands the use of the siphon called siphon type subsurface drainage siphon type subsurface drainage is comprised of two parts a subsurface drain pipe and a siphon and only a siphon needs to be installed at the outlet of the subsurface drain pipe to lower the outlet elevation thus it has the advantages of simple installation low cost and is easy to improve the drainage capacity of the current subsurface drain pipe it overcomes the shallow drain disadvantage of the small flow rate and makes use of the advantages of the small infiltration path and the difference in water head which can improve the efficiency of flooding and waterlogging removal in farmland the diagram of the siphon type subsurface drainage is shown in fig 1 2 2 indoor test 2 2 1 experimental material an indoor sand tank test was conducted in this study based on the seepage similarity principle lennoz gratin 1989 wen et al 2021 the drain pipe and drain depth were reduced to a scale of 1 20 the net size of the sand tank was 50 20 30 cm length width height the diameter of the drain pipe was 6 35 mm and holes were evenly distributed on the pipe wall with a perforation rate of 1 2 the test soil was divided into two types one was highly permeable gravel 2 4 mm diameter of quartz sand which was laid at the bottom of the sand tank at a height of 4 cm a 1 cm diameter open hole charging pipe was laid along the length of the sand tank and used for the water charge and gas removal from the bottom the other soil medium was 80 120 mesh quartz sand with a height of 22 5 cm which was filled layer by layer according to the bulk density of quartz sand to simulate the soil conditions the quartz sand was used to reduce the duration of the test facilitate water charging and gas removal and effectively explore the drainage law a gauze was directly laid at the interface between the two soils to avoid the loss of upper soil the water was gradually injected through the charging pipe at the bottom until the water table reached the soil surface when the soil was saturated the bottom charging pipe was closed and the fixed height of the water tank was connected to the upper charging pipe to maintain a certain ponding height a schematic diagram of the test device is shown in fig 2 2 2 2 experimental design a steady state ponding and an unsteady state ponding subsided on the soil surface were used to test the performance of the siphon type subsurface drainage under soil saturated conditions the drain pipes were arranged on one side wall of the sand tank and the drain spacing l was assumed to be constant the soil was a homogeneous and isotropic medium three factors were selected in the experiment first two types of subsurface drainage were selected namely conventional subsurface drainage cd and improved subsurface drainage id the improved subsurface drainage adopted two kinds of filter height 1 cm height was called thin improved subsurface drainage id 1 and 2 cm height was called thick improved subsurface drainage id 2 since the pipe was located on the sidewall of the sand tank the filter body shown in fig 3 b and c adopted half the bottom width i e 1 cm second the drain depth was selected the selection of drain depth primarily considered the crop waterlogging tolerance depth and economic feasibility in waterlogging prone areas of southern china three drain depth schemes were set up shallow 2 5 cm medium 4 0 cm and deep 5 5 cm which corresponded to actual drain depths of 50 80 and 110 cm represented by s m and d respectively third the outlet elevation was selected and divided into two cases one was the outlet elevation of the drain pipe under non siphon drainage and the other was the outlet elevation of the siphon pipe under siphon drainage considering the drain depth the siphon pipe was set to increase the shallow drain to medium drain and deep drain and the medium drain to deep drain the design of the experiment is presented in table 1 fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage for example s id 1 was used to represent the thin improved subsurface drainage with non siphon drainage under shallow drain conditions and s id 1 d was used to represent the thin improved subsurface drainage with siphon drainage under shallow drain conditions when the outlet elevation was consistent with a deep drain 2 2 3 measurement method the test was divided into two free outflow conditions steady state drainage with a 2 0 cm ponding height and unsteady state drainage with a 2 0 cm ponding height as the initial conditions of the ponding subsided the flow rate and water head were both measured over time the flow rate under different drainage treatments was measured five times by measuring the outflow volume at a certain time using a counting cup the water head was measured by the piezometer 2 3 numerical simulation the field subsurface drainage experiment is time consuming and laborious the hydrus 2d model was used to further quantify the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage 2 3 1 the basic theory of hydrus 2d in hydrus 2d model a two dimensional saturated unsaturated richards equation šimůnek et al 2006 was adopted to describe soil water movement 1 θ t x k θ θ x z k θ θ z k θ z s where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 t is the time d k θ is the unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 x and z are the spatial coordinates cm s is a sink term d 1 the van genuchten vg model was used to describe soil hydraulic functions van genuchten 1980 the expressions of the vg model were given by 2 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 3 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 5 m 1 1 n n 1 where θ r and θ s denote the residual and saturated volumetric water contents cm3 cm 3 respectively s e is the effective saturation α cm 1 and n are retention curve shape factors and l is a pore connectivity parameter the hydrus 2d has five soil hydraulic parameters of which the θ r θ s a and n were obtained by manual model calibration the k was obtained by a one dimensional soil column test 2 3 2 initial condition and boundary condition in this experiment the initial condition of the soil was saturation and the pressure head gradually increased from the soil surface to the bottom the a b d c boundary of the sand tank was defined as no flux boundary the drain pipe was set to be a seepage boundary under non siphon drainage conditions the specified pressure head of the seepage boundary was 0 under siphon drainage conditions the specified pressure head was the difference between the water head with and without the siphon table 2 the unsteady state drainage started from the initial condition of 2 0 cm ponding height until the water table decreased below the depth of the plowing layer during the experiment the water head was obtained according to the piezometer and it changed dynamically with time the a c boundary was set as the variable head boundary under soil saturated conditions the atmospheric boundary under soil unsaturated conditions and the constant head boundary under different ponding heights fig 4 evaporation and rainfall were ignored because of the short test time 2 3 3 calibration and validation firstly the hydrus 2d was used to calibrate unknown parameters θ r θ s a and n of the quartz sand and filter medium according to observed drain processes on the non siphon drainage of m cd m id 1 m id 2 and the siphon drainage of m cd d m id 1 d m id 2 d then it was verified by s cd d cd d id 2 d id 1 s id 1 s cd d s cd m s id 1 d and s id 1 m 2 3 4 soil hydraulic parameters the hydraulic conductivity of the quartz sand and filter medium were calculated using darcy s law eq 6 by a one dimensional soil column test under steady state drainage conditions 6 k q s a h 2 h 1 where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil medium cm d 1 q is the flow rate per unit time cm3 d 1 s is the seepage path length cm a is the cross sectional area of the soil medium cm2 and h 2 and h 1 are the water heads of the upper and lower layers of the soil medium respectively cm the calculated average hydraulic conductivity of the quartz sand and filter medium is 196 99 cm d and 384 48 cm d respectively the soil hydraulic parameters of the hydrus 2d model are shown in table 3 for the conventional subsurface drainage the width b 0 and height z 0 of the filter were both 0 for the improved subsurface drainage b 0 and z 0 were set according to the actual situation and the soil around the pipe was changed into the filter medium 2 3 5 the evaluation indicators of the simulation model the determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model 7 r 2 i 1 n p i p o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 9 n r m s e r m s e p where o i and p i are measured and simulated values respectively n is the number of measured values o and p are the average values of measured and simulated the closer the determination coefficient r2 is to 1 the better the correlation degree is the root mean square error rmse measures the average difference between the simulated and measured values the closer the rmse value is to 0 the smaller the deviation between the simulated and measured values the normalized root mean square error nrmse represents the performance of the model when nrmse 10 the simulation performance is excellent when 10 nrmse 20 the simulation performance is good when 20 nrmse 30 the simulation performance is fair when nrmse 30 the simulation performance is poor the comparison and statistical results of the simulated and measured flow rates with or without the siphon are shown in fig 5 and table 4 respectively the results showed that the simulated values have a good fitting trend with the measured values in the stage of flooding removal the results were distributed near the y x line and the overall errors were within 10 the errors were large in the stage of waterlogging removal and the measured values were larger than the simulated values the statistical parameters r2 rmse and nrmse varied from 0 87 to 0 97 0 85 2 32 ml min and 2 2 19 9 for non siphon drainage and 0 87 0 97 1 22 3 58 ml min and 9 0 16 2 for siphon drainage respectively which reflected the good performance of the model 2 4 statistical analysis the analysis of variance was carried out using spss ver 19 0 spss corp chicago usa one way analysis of variance anova was used the least significant difference lsd the significant differences between treatments at p 0 05 it was used to compare the flow rate with or without the siphon of conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage respectively fig 6 it was also used to compare the flow rate with or without the siphon of drainage types under different water heads fig 9 two way anova was also used the least significant difference lsd the significant differences between treatments at p 0 05 it was used to test the interaction effects between drainage type and the same outlet elevation with or without siphon deep drain and medium deep drain table 5 the significance analysis was carried out for five sets of the flow rates under the same conditions 3 results 3 1 effect of the flow rate under steady state ponding under steady state ponding a comparison of the flow rate with or without the siphon is shown in fig 6 the results indicated that compared with the subsurface drainage with non siphon the siphon could significantly increase the drainage capacity of the conventional and improved subsurface drainage by increasing the water head under the same drain depth for the conventional subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 30 6 60 4 compared with the non siphon under the shallow drain and by 27 1 under the medium drain for the thin improved subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 41 8 89 8 compared with the non siphon under the shallow drain and by 50 5 under the medium drain for the thick improved subsurface drainage the siphon could increase the flow rate by 39 3 compared with the non siphon under the medium drain the siphon type subsurface drainage can shorten the infiltration path of ponding to increase the flow rate at the same outlet elevation compared with m cd and m id 1 the flow rate of s cd m and s id 1 m increased by 31 9 and 16 7 respectively compared with d cd the flow rates of s cd d and m cd d increased by 35 2 and 19 6 respectively for the thin improved subsurface drainage compared with d id 1 the flow rate of s id 1 d and m id 1 d increased by 44 8 and 23 3 respectively for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of m id 2 d was 24 9 higher than that of d id 2 the significance analysis showed that the flow rate had significant differences among different treatments p 0 05 for the same drainage type fig 6 and the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than the non siphon the results of the intersubjective effect test for the same outlet elevation between deep drain and medium deep drain are shown in table 5 the drainage type with or without the siphon and two factor interaction had an extremely significant relationship p 0 01 by simulation the distribution of simulated water head with or without siphon under the steady state drainage condition is shown in fig 7 the results showed that the siphon could produce a negative water head near the drain pipe the influence range and the absolute value of the negative water head increased as the outlet elevation decreased because the equivalent radius of the improved subsurface drainage is larger than that of the conventional subsurface drainage tao et al 2016 the influence range of the negative water head of the improved subsurface drainage is larger than that of the conventional subsurface drainage under the siphon drainage 3 2 effect of the flow rate under ponding subsided the siphon can play the full advantage of conventional and improved subsurface drainage in removing flooding and waterlogging fig 8 shows the change of flow rate during the whole drainage process with or without the siphon from 2 0 cm of ponding height to ponding disappearance and then the water table drops down near the elevation of the drain pipe the whole drainage process could be divided into three stages firstly the flow rate decreased linearly with time under the ponding condition secondly when the ponding dropped to the soil surface the flow rate decreased rapidly in a short time which was also the transition stage between the saturated and unsaturated soils finally in the waterlogging removal stage the water table was lower than the soil surface and dropped close to the drain pipe and the flow rate was small and decreased gradually until it approached zero the relationship between flow rate and water head with or without the siphon is shown in fig 9 the soil surface was considered as the zero reference line when there was ponding on the soil surface the water head was greater than 0 when the ponding disappeared and the water table was in the falling stage the water head was smaller than 0 the flow rate attenuation degree was defined as the change of flow rate from the time when the ponding began to subside to the time when the ponding water disappeared for the conventional subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the s cd m and s cd d was reduced from 44 8 non siphon to 37 5 and 33 1 respectively and that of the m cd d was reduced from 44 9 non siphon to 31 9 for the thin improved subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the s id 1 m and s id 1 d was reduced from 66 0 non siphon to 43 5 and 34 3 respectively and that of the m id 1 d was reduced from 54 2 non siphon to 32 8 for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate attenuation degree of the m id 2 d was reduced from 44 8 non siphon to 37 9 the siphon type subsurface drainage could significantly increase the flow rate and effectively reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappeared thus it could further increase the efficiency of flooding removal when there was ponding on the soil surface the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than that of non siphon when the ponding water disappeared the flow rate of siphon drainage was still greater than that of non siphon drainage but the significance differences was weak fig 10 shows the variation of simulated flow rate increase effect with the water head for the siphon type subsurface drainage under the same drainage type and drain depth conditions the results showed that the flow rate increase effect increased with the decrease of water head and presented an exponential curve when the water table was close to the plowing layer the flow rate decreased rapidly and the increase effect reached its maximum for conventional subsurface drainage the flow rate of s cd m and s cd d increased by 24 7 88 2 and 49 5 161 6 compared with s cd compared with m cd the flow rate of m cd d increased by 24 7 49 5 for the thin improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of s id 1 m and s id 1 d increased by 33 5 102 3 79 0 223 3 compared with s id 1 and that of m id 1 d increased by 32 0 64 4 compared with m id 1 for the thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of m id 2 d increased by 35 4 69 5 compared with m id 2 in the stage of flooding removal the flow rate was large but the flow rate increase effect was relatively small while in the stage of waterlogging removal the flow rate was small but the flow rate increase effect was relatively large at the stage of flooding removal the flow rate increase effects of simulated values have the same change trend as measured and there is little difference but the difference may increase in the stage of waterlogging removal 3 3 effect of flooding and waterlogging removal the effect of siphon type subsurface drainage on flooding and waterlogging removal could be intuitively expressed through changes in the water head over time fig 11 the time when the ponding height decreased from 2 0 cm to 0 0 cm was defined as the flooding removal time and the time when the water table decreased from the surface to below the plowing layer was defined as the waterlogging removal time for the conventional subsurface drainage compared with s cd s cd m and s cd d reduced the flooding removal time by 10 3 and 37 9 respectively and the waterlogging removal time by 25 0 and 62 5 respectively compared with m cd m cd d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 15 2 and 33 3 respectively for the thin improved subsurface drainage compared with s id 1 s id 1 m and s id 1 d reduced the flooding removal time by 41 7 and 57 9 respectively and the waterlogging removal time by 40 0 and 60 0 respectively compared with m id 1 m id 1 d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 47 1 and 60 0 respectively for the thick improved subsurface drainage compared with m id 2 m id 2 d reduced the flooding and waterlogging removal time by 35 7 and 30 0 respectively generally m id 2 d took the least time to remove the flooding the waterlogging removal effect of the siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly better than that of non siphon subsurface drainage when the outlet elevation was consistent with the deep drain there was a slight difference in the waterlogging removal time for the improved subsurface drainage with the siphon because of the small amount of soil water stored within the effective plowing layer 3 4 effect of the drain spacing when the height of the ponding water is fixed the flow rate q variation with drain spacing l is shown in fig 12 when the drain spacing was at the effective control distance the flow rate obviously increases with the increased of drain spacing and when the drain spacing exceeded the effective control distance the flow rate was close to stable for the improved subsurface drainage the flow rate variation range was larger than the conventional subsurface drainage when the drain spacing was 15 25 cm this indicated that the improved subsurface drainage has a larger control distance and when l h d was greater than 10 the flow rate was little affected by the drain spacing tao et al 2017 have obtained the same result when comparing the effects of conventional and improved subsurface drainage regarding effective control distance in addition it was not difficult to find that siphon drainage can increase the effective control distance of the subsurface drainage measures 3 5 effect of the soil texture soil texture is an important factor affecting flow rate kaur et al 2017 nelson 2017 to reflect the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage in the field conditions soil parameters of the xinmaqiao experimental station in anhui province china tao et al 2017 were used for model simulation fig 13 shows the simulation results of conventional subsurface drainage using indoor sand tank test and field soil parameters it could be seen from the figure that the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage in the field was slightly larger than that in the indoor test it further proved the feasibility of siphon type subsurface drainage 4 discussion 4 1 theoretical analysis 4 1 1 influencing parameters of subsurface drainage according to the kirkham equation of conventional subsurface drainage and the tao equation of improved subsurface drainage eq 10 under the ponding the flow rate is related to the soil hydraulic conductivity k the thickness of ponding water s drain depth h d the radius of the drain pipe r 0 f values and the drain spacing l s h d r 0 is the effective water head above the pipe center kirkham 1949 tao et al 2019a 2019b the f value is the important parameter that affects the flow rate under the same water head soil texture and drain spacing when the depth of the impermeable layer t is large the f value can be expressed by eq 11 and the second term in the formula can be ignored when the drain spacing l is large the f value can be expressed by eq 12 and the second term in the formula can be ignored the width and height of the filter were both 2 cm for improved subsurface drainage the calculation results of the influence of geometric parameters on f value are shown in table 6 and fig 13 fig 14 10 q 2 π k s h d r 0 f l 11 f ln sinh π 2 h r l sinh π r l m 1 1 m ln sinh 2 2 π m t l sinh 2 π r l sinh 2 2 π m t l sinh 2 π 2 h

conventionalsubsurfacedrainage improvedsubsurfacedrainage 14 h h d h d r 0 b 0 z 0 π conventionalsubsurfacedrainage improvedsubsurfacedrainage where r is the equivalent radius of conventional and improved subsurface drainage h is the depth from the equivalent radius center to the surface soil as the results showed the f value was proportional to the drain depth of the subsurface drainage and inversely proportional to the drain spacing and the depth of the impermeable layer when the parameters were increased by the same multiple the f values with drain depth the radius of drain pipe drain spacing and the depth of impermeable layer changed by 0 293 0 163 0 015 and 0 010 respectively for conventional subsurface drainage and by 0 920 0 004 0 013 and 0 011 respectively for improved subsurface drainage the results indicated that the order of the influence of geometric parameters on f value for the conventional subsurface drainage was drain depth radius of the drain pipe drain spacing the depth of the impermeable layer and the result was the same as that proved by wang et al 2021 for the improved subsurface drainage the r 0 was different from the conventional subsurface drainage and the slope of the curve was the smallest the reason was that the equivalent radius of improved subsurface drainage was much bigger than the actual radius tao et al 2016 4 1 2 principle of the siphon type subsurface drainage the flow rate increased as the drain depth increased and the result explained that the effect of the water head was greater than the f value the lower the outlet elevation the larger the acting water head the greater the flow rate increase of siphon type subsurface drainage at the same outlet elevation the flow rate of siphon type subsurface drainage was significantly higher than that of conventional drainage the main reason was that under the same water head the f value of non siphon drainage was large so the flow rate was small similarly at the same outlet elevation the shallow deep drain was superior to the medium deep drain therefore the shallow deep drain increased the flow rate by increasing the water head and decreasing the f value which has not been studied in the past 4 2 analysis of the simulation result in the stage of waterlogging removal the main reasons for the large errors between the simulated and measured values by hydrus 2d figs 5 and 9 were as follows firstly due to the limited amount of water stored in the soil the water table dropped rapidly to the depth of the drain pipe secondly since the change of the piezometer might lag behind the actual water table the systematic errors of the measured values might occur thirdly when the soil was unsaturated the water table was not horizontal but elliptical or parabolic the hydrus 2d model was difficult to set the initial water head accurately which led to the large errors between the simulated and measured values in the waterlogging removal stage the errors could be magnified several times in hydrus 2d the setting of boundary conditions is the key to numerical simulation salehi et al 2017 but it often be simplified in practical application the subsurface drain pipe is mainly composed of corrugated plastic pipe and synthetic geotextile the perforation rate of corrugated plastic pipe and the specification of synthetic geotextile affect the drainage performance dierickx 1980 in principle the perforation rate should be as large as possible to reduce inlet resistance and as small as possible to prevent soil particles from entering and blocking the pipe nijland et al 2005 the conventional subsurface drainage is regularly treated as the seepage boundary in the hydrus 2d model ebrahimian and noory 2015 but the perforation rate of the drain pipe often less than 3 in practical applications li et al 2022 liu et al 2021 qian et al 2021 is ignored li et al 2016 geotextiles of different specifications should be covered according to different soil types to prevent soil particles from entering the pipe under the condition of a certain perforation rate li et al 2022 the specifications of geotextile will affect the effective radius and the flow rate of conventional subsurface drainage rollin et al 1987 but the actual specifications of the geotextile are ignored in the hydrus 2d the boundary conditions need to be further improved in future verification moreover it is also necessary to further study whether the negative pressure value of siphon type subsurface drainage will change during the drawdown stage of the water head besides it is necessary to further verify the feasibility of siphon type subsurface drainage through field experiments and apply the hydrus 2d model to provide technical support for the parameter design and economic benefits 4 3 application of siphon type subsurface drainage 4 3 1 layout of the siphon pipe when the pipe is running full the drainage efficiency is obvious and once there is air into the siphon pipe the bubble will break down the negative pressure conditions greatly affecting the drainage effect beecham and lucke 2013 to avoid the bubble entering the drain pipe two measures are often adopted one is to use the siphon with a smaller inner diameter which can maximize the drainage efficiency of the siphon cai et al 2014 sun et al 2019 mei et al 2017 the other is to immerse the outlet of the siphon pipe in water to create a vacuum yu et al 2019 in the application of farmland drainage the elevation height of the siphon type subsurface drainage should not be too large it should be comprehensively determined according to the constant water level height and duration time of the drainage ditch during the rainstorm the head loss coefficient is a key parameter in the hydraulic optimization design the influencing factors include the roughness of the pipe wall the area of the pipe cross section the angle of the turning the radius of the turning etc li et al 2008 in addition to the three factors of the experiment we have also taken into account the length of the siphon pipe with a constant turning angle and the turning angle between the siphon and subsurface drainage with a constant siphon pipe length under the same outlet elevation however the results indicated that the siphon pipe length and turning angle had little effect on the flow rate the frictional head loss and the local head loss produced by the drain pipe could be ignored in the test an inverted siphon form was also used to study the outflow of the pipe because the pipe s outflow was the full pipe flow an inverted siphon had no advantage in the experiment therefore further experimental research has not been conducted 4 3 2 layout of subsurface drainage drain depth is an important factor that affects the flow rate and nutrient loss of subsurface drainage the shallow drain can be easier to accept the ponding water into the drain pipe and it can reduce the nitrogen craft et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 and phosphorus saadat et al 2018 load the deep drain was more efficient in improving the flow rate and mitigating the environmental effects of heavy metals darzi naftchali et al 2022 than the shallow ones the filter around the drain pipe not only improves the drainage performance turtola and paajanen 1995 but also alleviates the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus tao et al 2019a 2019b siphon type subsurface drainage is a new way to improve the drainage efficiency of conventional subsurface drainage it has a more obvious flow rate increase effect than the existing improved subsurface drainage id under the same drain depth at steady state ponding fig 6 the drain depth and outflow elevation should be set reasonably according to the actual condition to improve the flow rate and alleviate the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus farmland drainage can be used in the combination form of shallow deep alternating drainage shallow deep alternating drainage can also reduce excavation and construction costs and avoid excessive drainage or inadequate drainage verma et al 1998 ren et al 2021 on the shallow side the siphon can be installed at the outlet of conventional subsurface drainage on the deep side improved subsurface drainage can be used 5 conclusions the performance of siphon type subsurface drainage was studied by an indoor sand tank test and the hydrus 2d model three key factors were considered in the test the type of subsurface drainage drain depth and outlet elevation based on the test results the following conclusions were drawn first the siphon type subsurface drainage could increase the flow rate of conventional and improved subsurface drainage it had an apparent effect on the increase of flow rate at the same drain depth and the flow rate of the siphon was significantly higher than that of the non siphon at the same outlet elevation for conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage the flow rate of the siphon type subsurface drainage was 27 1 45 7 41 8 89 8 and 39 3 50 5 higher than that of non siphon drainage at the same drain depth respectively and 19 6 35 2 16 7 44 8 and 24 9 higher than that of non siphon at the same outlet elevation respectively the siphon could reduce the flow rate attenuation degree before the ponding disappears second siphon type subsurface drainage could significantly shorten the drainage time of flooding and waterlogging removal for conventional thin improved and thick improved subsurface drainage the siphon type subsurface drainage could reduce the flooding removal time by 10 3 37 9 41 7 57 9 and 35 7 the waterlogging removal time by 25 0 62 5 40 0 60 0 and 30 respectively finally the simulated flow rate by the hydrus 2d model matched well with the measured values the influence range and absolute values of the negative water head increased with the decrease of outlet elevation and the increase effect of the flow rate increased with the decrease of water head the siphon type subsurface drainage has more control distance than the non siphon and the flow rate increase effect of siphon type subsurface drainage of the field soil was slightly larger than that quart sand in the indoor test generally siphon type subsurface drainage has advantages such as less cultivated land occupation shallow excavation depth good drainage effect and convenient construction siphon type subsurface drainage has excellent application and popularization value for flooding and waterlogging removal in waterlogging prone areas and farmland drainage reconstruction under the premise of reducing land excavation and increasing the efficiency of subsurface drainage the present results can provide theoretical support and technical guidance for flooding and waterlogging removal projects in areas with

9214,a clear understanding of the drought impact on crops is essential to reduce drought related yield losses in this study a framework to explicitly quantify the impact of drought on a specific crop has been proposed the sugarcane is selected as the target crop and the growth process is divided into 4 stages in different areas in guangxi the evolution of drought and water requirements as well as the impact of drought on water requirement and yield are evaluated based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei crop water requirement and sugarcane standardized yield residual series the drought in sugarcane growing season tends to intensify and the drought risk in southwest guangxi will increase nevertheless different drought trends exhibit in different growth stages during the sugarcane seeding and tillering stages the drought trend in guangxi is dominant consistent with the detected trend of increasing drought the water demand of sugarcane in most areas showed a significant upward trend crop water requirement and irrigation water requirement reached the maximum at the stem extension stage the relationship between drought and irrigation water requirement varied in different regions sugarcane is vulnerable to drought risk during stem extension stage resulting in a decline in yield and the water demand at this stage is also the largest the fluctuation of sugarcane yield can be explained by the interannual variation of spei specifically the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater the severe and long lasting drought has a serious impact on sugarcane yield the method is expected to be applied to other crops in other regions keywords drought spei crop water requirement irrigation water requirements yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sugarcane is one of the most productive crops in the world and is mostly grown in tropical and subtropical regions and countries wiedenfeld 2000 in many countries sugarcane has become an important crop for sugar and bioenergy at present due to the high consumption of sugar and by products the demand for sugarcane is increasing therefore it is necessary to ensure a sustainable increase in sugarcane production however sugarcane is affected by a combination of factors during its growth such as natural factors soil climate botany etc and anthropogenic factors crop and economic management etc larrahondo and villegas 1995 the impact of drought is the most important environmental factor restricting the growth of sugarcane ellis and lankford 1990 analyzing the occurrence and development of drought affecting crops is more complex than individual drought events which requires a series of indicators to construct and select a set of comprehensive and accurate indices closely related to drought and its impact on crops has always been the key point according to previous study ramesh 2000 the higher the degree of drought in india the greater the impact on sugarcane moisture and sugar accumulation in australia more than 60 of sucrose production relied on irrigation owning to drought conditions inman bamber 2004 sugarcane production in south africa and other places was threatened by drought and increasing irrigation was necessary to maintain the yield and accumulation of sucrose in crops inman bamber and smith 2005 sun et al 2012 potopova et al 2016 in addition in brazil and other places increased water shortages had led to a decline in sugarcane production santos and sentelhas 2012 marin et al 2013 cardozo and sentelhas 2013 the frequent occurrence of droughts makes it a limiting factor for sugarcane growth and the crop water requirements cwr will be significantly affected by climate change cao et al 2008 liu and lin 2004 piao et al 2010 in fact severe drought events have occurred in southwest china cheng et al 2020 for instance the drought in 2006 caused 311 300 ha of crop failure in sichuan guizhou and guangxi li et al 2011 several studies discussed the impact of drought on crop yield in southwest china jia et al 2016 he et al 2017 china is the third largest sugarcane producer in the world and guangxi takes the largest share of total sugar production with the proportion of approximately 67 producing 6 34 million tons of cane sugar chen et al 2020 guangxi has become more and more sensitive to the effects of drought in recent years precipitation was pointed out to decrease in southwest guangxi xie et al 2019 and the frequency of extreme droughts increased in the coastal areas of southern guangxi in the past 50 years zhang et al 2013 therefore the impact of drought may have a fundamental impact on the irrigation demand and water system management of sugarcane in guangxi to date studies have investigated the changes in water requirements of different crops but have seldom considered the variances in different crop growth stages yoon and choi 2020 li et al 2016 however crops have different water requirements in different growth periods and water shortage during the critical water requirements period of crops often leads to crop yield reduction or even no harvest xu et al 2013 previous studies mainly focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of drought and the changes in drought risks insufficient attention has been paid to the relationships among drought water requirement and yield the drought impact on the crop yield during different growth periods of a specific crop like sugarcane have not been paid enough attention to the indices of drought or water demand without considering the spatiotemporal variations may lead to uncertainties for assessing the drought and its impact across the entire region during the whole crop growth period which needs further discussion in this study a framework to explicitly quantify the impact of drought on a specific crop has been proposed the sugarcane is selected as the target crop and the growth process is divided into 4 stages in different areas in guangxi the evolution of drought and water requirements as well as the impact of drought on water requirement and yield are evaluated based on a series of indicators to be specific three aspects of drought impact on sugarcane in guangxi are addressed 1 the temporal and spatial variations of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and water requirements in guangxi during different sugarcane growth stages 2 the evolution of the standardized yield residual series syrs at 1 to 12 month lags and the monthly changes of corresponding spei in 2 selected severe drought years 3 in terms of correlation coefficients the relationship between drought and irrigation water requirement iwr in different growth stages and the relationship between spei and syrs to quantify the drought impact on sugarcane yield 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the guangxi zhuang autonomous region is located in southwestern china 104 112 e and 20 26 n as shown in fig 1 the tropic of cancer traverses the central part and it has a subtropical monsoon climate while the southern part is biased towards the tropical monsoon climate on the whole guangxi has a warm climate rich in light and heat the annual average temperature is 16 5 23 1 the extreme maximum temperature is about 34 43 and the extreme minimum temperature is about 8 4 3 0 the accumulated temperature with values of 10 is from 5075 to 8328 frost free period is about 288 365 days total solar radiation ranges from 3664 to 5304 mj m2 which decreases from south to north and from valley plain to hilly and mountainous areas guangxi is one of the provinces with the richest precipitation in china with the annual average precipitation of about 1000 2000 mm but the temporal and spatial distribution is uneven the eastern region especially the coastal regions has abundant precipitation while the western region has relatively less precipitation there is plenty of rain in spring and summer but less rain in autumn and winter seasonal droughts often occur annual average precipitation in guangxi is 1086 2760 mm the spatial distribution of annual average precipitation varies greatly with more in the east north and south while less in the west annual average evaporation is about 1239 1861 mm which is also quite uneven in guangxi guangxi covers an area of 237 600 km2 about 40 of the total land area in guangxi is hilly elevation declines from west to east and from north to south the karst landform is widely distributed in the southwest northwest central and northeast of guangxi accounting for 37 8 of the total land area the karst area is characterized by the two layer structure of surface layer and underground layer and the soil layer of the karst area is thin with weak soil water storage capacity owing to this topographical condition a large part of rainwater can infiltrate into the underground quickly which can increase the susceptibility of flood and drought hazards in this area in guangxi sugarcane planting areas are mostly distributed in hilly basins and semi mountain slopes with steep slopes and low water retention capacity which belong to rain fed dry farming according to the similarity of agroclimatic characteristics the study area was divided into 5 sugarcane planting areas xie and kuang 2006 in fig 1 and table 1 which are western guangxi southern guangxi northern guangxi east of central guangxi and west of central guangxi according to the characteristics of sugarcane growth the sugarcane growth process is divided into 4 stages the seeding stage the tillering stage the stem extension stage and the maturity stage van dillewijn 1952 due to the difference of climate the periods of sugarcane growth stages in different areas are also different table1 also lists the starting and ending dates of different growth phases of sugarcane in each region quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 sugarcanes in western southern northern central and west central guangxi usually begin to sprout on february 14th february 21 march 26 april 13th march 11 enter the tillering stages on april 11th april 11 june 1 june 13th may 11 and ripening stages on october 21st october 21 december 11 november 21st and november 11 respectively due to its special climatic conditions in northern guangxi sugarcane is planted sporadically 2 2 datasets light heat and water are the most important factors for crop growth and agricultural production in this study daily meteorological data from 1984 to 2016 are adopted which is released by china meteorological administration 2021 including sunshine duration sd h precipitation p mm temperature t maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet the meteorological factors including wind speed at 2 m above ground level u 2 m s atmospheric pressure p r hpa and relative humidity rh are also adopted all these daily meteorological datasets 1984 2016 used in this study were measured at 24 meteorological stations across guangxi fig 1b thus the spatiotemporal evolution of drought in different growth stages of sugarcane in guangxi from 1984 to 2016 is analyzed to eliminate the influence of non climatic factors all data have undergone limit checks and time consistency checks in this study the annual sugarcane production and planting area during 1995 2016 are extracted from the guangxi statistical yearbook guangxi zhuang autonomous region bureau of statistics 1996 2017 and per unit yield data is obtained by dividing the annual output of the same period by the average annual planting area due to lack of sugarcane data with a longer sequence the relations among drought irrigation water requirement iwr and sugar production only from 1995 to 2016 are analyzed based on the 22 year drought iwr and sugar yield data in the study area correlation analysis about the drought impact on the sugarcane yields are conducted 3 methodologies 3 1 selection and calculation of the spei a number of drought indices have been proposed to estimate the drought severity duration magnitude and spatial extent and improve the risk management richard and heim 2002 liu et al 2018a vergni et al 2021 masanta and srinivas 2022 wang et al 2022 such as the palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 self calibrating palmer drought severity index wells et al 2004 standard precipitation index mckee et al 1993 standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 standardized wetness index liu et al 2017 etc using the difference between precipitation and pet as input spei at various timescales has been developed and employed in an increasing number of climatological and hydrological studies vicente serrano et al 2010 yu et al 2014 liu and jiang 2015 li et al 2019 spei considers the effects of evapotranspiration through the simple difference between precipitation and pet and has been widely used in many studies so far li et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 zhao et al 2021 to further test the suitability for application of spei the spei values with the historical drought events and drought flood incidence rates in the study area during the same period are compared and analyzed the correspondence between the spei values and typical historical drought events are compared and listed in table 2 the spei values agree well with the historical drought events the correlation coefficients between the spei values and the flood and drought incidence rates are also computed and listed in table 3 respectively there is high significance between spei and flood or drought rates based on the pearson correlation analysis spei index is not only applicable to analyze drought and flood changes in guangxi but also can detect the drought hazard event and effectively reflect the impact of drought and flood on crop yield therefore spei index can be used to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought in guangxi and quantify its impact on crop production thus spei was selected as the drought indicator in this study the spei in monthly scale corresponding to different sugarcane growth periods are therefore analyzed in addition the spei on the scale of 1 12 months was also calculated to detect the correlation between drought and sugarcane yield the spei is calculated based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration and the normalization of the difference the specific calculation steps are as follows 1 calculate the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration 1 d i p i pet i where d i is the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration in the i th month mm pi is the precipitation in the i th month mm pet i is the potential evapotranspiration in the i th month mm using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 2 establish the accumulation sequence of the precipitation and the pet at different time scales 2 d n k i 0 k 1 p n i et n i n k where k is the time scale month n is the number of calculations 3 use the log logistic probability distribution f x to fit the d sequence transform the sequence into a standard normal distribution and calculate the final spei value 3 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w 2 ln p where p is the cumulative probability of exceeding the undetermined d when p 0 5 the sign of the spei is reversed fixed constant c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 43278 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the detailed explanation of the specific process could be found in the previous studies zhuang et al 2013 gao et al 2017 the spei can be calculated at different time scales which is very flexible wang et al 2018 in this study the spei yan and li 2015 corresponding to different sugarcane growth periods is discussed in addition the spei on the scale of 1 12 months was also calculated to analyze the correlation between drought and sugarcane yield see table 4 for specific classification 3 2 standardized yield residual series syrs the formation of the final crop yield is not only related to varieties management techniques etc but also restricted by meteorological conditions generally crop yield is decomposed into three parts trend yield meteorological yield and random error lian 2005 fang 2011 niu et al 2018 trend yield is the long period output component that reflects the level of productivity development in the historical period and is also called technical yield meteorological yield is a fluctuating output component that is influenced by the short term changing factor mainly agricultural and meteorological disasters dominated by climate variables the random error is very small and can be ignored therefore the actual crop yield it can be regarded as the sum of trend yield and meteorological yield fu et al 2019 yue et al 2021 namely 4 g t y t y w where g t is the actual yield y t is the trend yield and y w is the meteorological yield the correct assessment of the impact of meteorological conditions on crop yields must be based on the acquisition of accurate meteorological yields this paper uses logistic method to separate the meteorological yield of sugarcane compared with linear equations logistic curve has better fitting accuracy and can better capture the long term trend of time series growth ji 2012 this paper constructs the following logistic cumulative distribution curve equation based on the data of guangxi sugarcane output from 1995 to 2016 per unit area ahmad et al 1988 yin 2002 cui 2005 5 g t k 1 e a rt where k a r are the three unknown parameters of the logistic cumulative distribution curve equation and the estimation method is as follows first use the four point method to estimate the unknown parameter k in the equation let it be k 1 then 6 k 1 n 1 n 4 n 2 n 3 n 2 n 3 n 1 n 4 n 1 n 4 n 2 n 3 where t 1 n 1 t 4 n 4 are the start and end points of the actual production sequence respectively t 2 n 2 t 3 n 3 are the two points in the middle of the sequence estimate the remaining two unknown parameters a and r according to the obtained k value and convert eq 5 into the following equation 7 ln k 1 g t g t a rt let g t ln k 1 g t g t and get the linear function of g t with respect to time t 8 g t a rt use the principle of least squares to determine the parameter values a 1 and r 1 of the remaining two parameters a and r the fitted value y t1 of the sugarcane trend yield series can be obtained 9 y t 1 k 1 1 e a 1 r 1 t the meteorological yield of sugarcane can be calculated using g t and y t in order to compare the yield variability between crops with different average values and standard deviations the z score transformation was used to standardize the yield residuals of the meteorological yield time series then the syrs with the mean and standard deviation values equal to 0 and 1 are obtained respectively based on the standard normal distribution that is the syrs values between 0 5 and 0 5 between 1 0 and 0 5 between 1 5 and 1 0 and below 1 5 are classified as normal low yield loss medium yield loss and high yield loss liu et al 2018b potopová et al 2015 see table 4 for specific classification 3 3 cwr of sugarcane the occurrence and development of drought affecting crops is more complex than general drought it is not only related to the biological characteristics of crops such as crop varieties crop characteristics drought tolerance planting status and growth status but also affected by natural factors such as meteorology hydrology and underlying surface as well as human management farming system and sci technology li and zhou 2014 the water requirement of sugarcane is the total amount of water to meet the growth of sugarcane and give full play to its productive potential the energy balance method i e the modified penman method was used to calculate the cwr according to following equation quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 10 cwr i k c et 0 i i 1 2 n where cwr i is crop water requirement at a certain stage et 0i is reference crop evapotranspiration at a certain stage i growing stage and k c is crop coefficient the thornthwaite method was used to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 the crop coefficient is obtained from the sugarcane irrigation quota and irrigation technical regulation in guangxi zhuang autonomous region quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 the specific sugarcane coefficient k c is listed in table 5 3 4 iwr of sugarcane typically iwr is calculated as differences between cwr and effective precipitation ep brouwer and heibloem 1986 li et al 2010 11 iwr n 1 n cwr n 1 n ep where iwr is the irrigation water requirement mm n is the length of the growth stage days cwr is the crop water requirement mm day 1 ep is effective precipitation mm day 1 the ep during the growth stage in the guangxi sugarcane of china using the usda recommended method döll and siebert 2002 li et al 2010 can be computed as follows 12 ep p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 where ep is effective precipitation mm day 1 p is daily precipitation mm day 1 this method has been used by many scholars to calculate ep in southwest china and the effect quite satisfactory li et al 2011 fu et al 2014 3 5 the proposed framework to detect the impact of droughts on crop yields the flow chart of the framework proposed in this study is shown in fig 2 spei is calculated using precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets calculated by thornthwaite method deng et al 2020 the drought evolution in guangxi from 1984 to 2016 is analyzed using spei series during different growth stages then pet and kc are leveraged to calculate cwr iwr is obtained by calculating the differences between the cwr and the ep the syrs is normalized based on the meteorological yield the spatiotemporal variations of the drought water demand and yield in different sugarcane growth stages are discussed the correlation between spei and iwr in space domain and the correlation coefficients between the monthly detrended spei series at 1 to 12 month lags and the syrs are discussed respectively the drought impact on the sugarcane yield is therefore assessed 4 results and discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial variations of 3 month spei in different growth stages fig 3 shows the temporal variations of drought in each growth stage of sugarcane indicated by 3 month spei in the seeding stage before 2000 the main dry and wet conditions occurred alternatively after 2000 significant drought events occurred dry wet dry alternate variations dominated the spei evolution throughout the tillering stage in the stem extension stage there were obvious interdecadal dry wet alternation drought events were mainly concentrated in 1984 1992 and 2003 2012 in the maturity stage the spei also showed obvious dry wet alternation the driest period was from 2000 to 2011 the main continuous drought stages identified in different growth stages were 1984 1992 and 2003 2012 while the main continuous humid stages were 1993 2002 and 2013 2016 the driest stage in guangxi coincided with the warmest decade in 2001 2010 the frequency of extreme drought in summer increased in most parts of guangxi after 2000 the interdecadal characteristics of spei is consistent with the findings in the previous studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2019 the magnitude and significance of the spei trend during 1984 2016 at each sugarcane growth stage in guangxi were detected using the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 as shown in fig 4 during the seeding stage of sugarcane an overall drought trend was detected with high values in western and southern guangxi and 9 stations passed the 90 and above significance test on the contrary a slight wetting trend was observed in the eastern and northern parts of guangxi during the tillering stage most areas of guangxi showed a trend of aridification and three stations passed the 90 significance test during the stem extension stage the drought trend was concentrated in the northern central and western guangxi only three stations showed a slight trend of drought at the maturity stage drought prevailed during the sugarcane sowing and tillering stages the area with a dry tendency were distributed mainly in the southwest guangxi 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of water requirement in different growth stages table 6 lists the amount and proportion of water requirement in different sugarcane growth stages maximum water requirement was observed during the stem extension stage followed by the tillering and seeding stage and the smallest during the maturity stage the distribution of climate tendency rates fig 5a c and the mann kendall trend test results fig 5d f of ep cwr and iwr from 1984 to 2016 in guangxi are shown in fig 5 ep decreased at seeding and stem extension stages while increased in tillering and the maturity stages fig 5a the increase of ep in maturity stage was mainly due to the increase in precipitation days in december and january and the increase of ep in tillering stage was mainly due to the increase in precipitation days during june july yin et al 2021 the overall trend of ep did not change significantly fig 5d the linear trend of cwr increased during the stem extension stage fig 5b the trend increased significantly in the seeding tillering and stem extension stages passing the 90 significance test fig 5e the increasing trend of iwr was mainly concentrated in seeding and stem extension stages fig 5c the iwr in the seeding and stem extension stages increased significantly in western and central western guangxi fig 5f in general the cwr and iwr of sugarcane tended to increase while ep tended to decrease water requirement varied greatly in different growth stages this may further increase the frequency and intensity of drought disasters bringing more challenges to sugarcane production in guangxi figs 6 8 show the spatial distributions of four growth stages of sugarcane cwr iwr and ep using mann kendall statistical test analysis the cwr during seeding stage increased at the selected 22 stations and a significant increase was found in the west and east of guangxi fig 6a the cwr during the tillering and stem extension stages in most parts of guangxi increased while the cwr in the east of central west and south of guangxi showed a relatively obvious increasing trend fig 6b c in the maturity stage cwr increased significantly in the east of central and west of guangxi while decreased in southern guangxi fig 6d there were in general increasing trends in iwr during the seeding stage especially in the western and southern guangxi fig 7a at the tillering stage iwr decreased significantly in the central and northern parts of guangxi while iwr in western and southern guangxi showed a slightly increasing trend fig 7b at the stem extension stage iwr increased in most parts of guangxi while it showed a decreasing trend the western part of guangxi fig 7c at the maturity stage iwr decreased in most areas especially in the northern and eastern guangxi fig 7d in the seedling stage ep showed an increasing trend in northern guangxi while a decreasing trend in southwest guangxi fig 8a at the tillering stage ep showed an increasing trend in most areas of guangxi especially in central guangxi fig 8b in stem extension stage there was a decreasing trend in southeast guangxi while an increasing trend in west guangxi fig 8c during the maturity stage ep showed an increasing trend in most areas of guangxi and a significant increasing trend in northern guangxi fig 8d 4 3 evolution of the sugarcane syrs according to the results the unit output of sugarcane in guangxi increased from 1995 to 2016 with linear growth rates of 0 56 0 88 0 39 0 72 0 91 ton ha year in the west south north east of central west of central of guangxi respectively this is regarded as the results of advance in agricultural techniques the influence of non climatic factors should be excluded and the syrs results from 1995 to 2016 were further analyzed fig 9a the high yield loss years of guangxi sugarcane were 2000 2010 and 2011 respectively and the year of moderate yield loss was 2005 to explore the possible causes of sugarcane yield reduction the monthly change of spei with a lag of 1 12 months in 2000 and 2011 was further analyzed fig 9b c in 2000 drought occurred from june to september corresponding to the sugarcane stem extension stage in 2011 a drought event occurred from march to october covering the seeding tillering and stem extension stages of sugarcane the most severe drought occurred in july september which corresponds to the period when sugarcane water requirement was the highest if not irrigated in time sugarcane production will be reduced in fact a decline in sugarcane production was indicated in 2000 and 2011 in fig 9 which could further illustrate the serious impact of drought on crop production the longer the drought lasts the more serious the drought is and the greater the impact of drought on sugarcane yields in addition clear differences between the onsets of drought based on different time lags were observed in general short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater although sugarcane yields may be high in dry years if the sugarcane was irrigated the sugarcane yields in extremely dry years would be still affected for example the extreme drought in the southwest from the summer of 2009 to the spring of 2010 was extremely severe resulting in a large reduction in crop yields due to lack of water liu et al 2017 4 4 correlation between spei and iwr the relationship between drought and iwr in different growth stages was tested using pearson s correlation coefficient as shown in fig 10 a significant negative correlation was detected between drought and irrigation water demand throughout the entire growth process the correlation coefficients of spei and iwr in the seeding stem extension and maturity stages ranged from 0 6 to 1 across the study area showing a significant negative correlation fig 10 a c and d during the critical growth stages of seeding and stem extension of sugarcane drought steadily raise the demand for sugarcane irrigation making it necessary for sugarcane output spei has the closest correlation with irrigation during the stem extension stage meanwhile it faced the most critical water shortage during this stage sugarcane is susceptible to drought which would lead to a decline in yield during the stem extension stage dingre and gorantiwar 2021 furthermore the correlation coefficients between spei and irrigation in the maturity stage are also high moderate water shortage during maturity is tolerable because it increases the flow of sucrose into the stem maximizing sucrose production and internode storage singels et al 2019 the correlation coefficients at southwest guangxi during the tillering stage ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 but the correlation between drought and irrigation water demand in northeastern guangxi was not obvious previous studies pointed out that there was a high tolerance to drought during the tillering stage and iwr was not high during this stage ellis and lankford 1990 the possible reason is that the ep during the seeding stage in northeast guangxi is large with a relatively large quantity of water stored in the sugarcane and soil during the tillering stage according to the recent studies dingre and gorantiwar 2021 sugarcane has the potential to cope with the effects of drought to some extent 4 5 correlation between spei and syrs the impact of drought with different durations on sugarcane yields is further analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficients between syrs and spei at the five regions of guangxi fig 11 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between the spei time series at 1 12 months lags and the syrs of sugarcane from 1995 to 2016 the sugarcane growth stages were in general from february to december there are significant differences in the response of sugarcane to spei with different months lags when drought conditions significantly affected sugarcane yields a positive correlation was observed indicating that the year to year changes of sugarcane yields i e syrs was related to the year to year changes of the spei time series a close correlation between sugarcane syrs and spei from june to october was observed the fluctuation of sugarcane yields can be explained by the interannual variation of spei and it is highly sensitive to drought during the stem extension stage with reference to the sugarcane growth stages listed in table 5 the sugarcane yields during the stem extension stage is highly sensitive to drought conditions the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production syrs had high correlation coefficients with short term spei in august and september to be specific sugarcane syrs has the highest correlation coefficient with august spei 2 in western guangxi with value of 0 483 the correlation coefficient between sugarcane syrs and spei 1 in august was the highest in northern guangxi that is r 0 49 the sugarcane syrs had the highest correlation coefficients with spei 2 in august and spei 3 in september in the east of central guangxi with values of 0 534 0 521 respectively the correlation coefficient between sugarcane syrs and spei 3 in august was the highest in west of central guangxi with r 0 437 4 6 limitations and uncertainties due to the limited records and data the current research considers only the effects of climate variability but does not account for the impact of human factors such as irrigation fertilization and technological progress there are other uncertainties in analyzing the evolution of drought and its impact on water demand and production according to the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 1996 2007 the average effective irrigation rate in guangxi zhuang autonomous region from 1995 to 2005 was 57 2 therefore most of the sugarcane in guangxi may be in the irrigated area which will pose a challenge to derive the proper drought index and evaluate the actual agricultural impact however it still clearly indicated that drought is closely related to the water requirement and sugarcane yields and seriously threaten sugarcane production in guangxi 5 conclusions this study analyzed the evolution of drought and water requirement from 1984 to 2016 and the impact of drought on water demand and sugarcane yields from 1995 to 2016 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the drought in sugarcane growing season tends to intensify and the drought risk in southwest guangxi will increase nevertheless different drought trends exhibit in different growth stages during the sugarcane seeding and tillering stages the drought trend in guangxi is dominant 2 consistent with the detected trend of increasing drought the water demand of sugarcane in most areas showed a significant upward trend cwr and iwr reached the maximum at the stem extension stage ep decreased during sowing and stem extension stage the relationship between drought and iwr varied in different regions sugarcane is vulnerable to drought risk during stem extension stage resulting in a decline in yield and the water demand at this stage is also the largest 3 the fluctuation of sugarcane yield can be explained by the interannual variation of spei specifically the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater the severe and long lasting drought has a serious impact on sugarcane yield the research results are expected to be useful for a better understanding of the impact of drought on sugarcane in guangxi which could provide information for decision makers the method is expected to be applied to other crops in other regions declaration of

9214,a clear understanding of the drought impact on crops is essential to reduce drought related yield losses in this study a framework to explicitly quantify the impact of drought on a specific crop has been proposed the sugarcane is selected as the target crop and the growth process is divided into 4 stages in different areas in guangxi the evolution of drought and water requirements as well as the impact of drought on water requirement and yield are evaluated based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei crop water requirement and sugarcane standardized yield residual series the drought in sugarcane growing season tends to intensify and the drought risk in southwest guangxi will increase nevertheless different drought trends exhibit in different growth stages during the sugarcane seeding and tillering stages the drought trend in guangxi is dominant consistent with the detected trend of increasing drought the water demand of sugarcane in most areas showed a significant upward trend crop water requirement and irrigation water requirement reached the maximum at the stem extension stage the relationship between drought and irrigation water requirement varied in different regions sugarcane is vulnerable to drought risk during stem extension stage resulting in a decline in yield and the water demand at this stage is also the largest the fluctuation of sugarcane yield can be explained by the interannual variation of spei specifically the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater the severe and long lasting drought has a serious impact on sugarcane yield the method is expected to be applied to other crops in other regions keywords drought spei crop water requirement irrigation water requirements yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sugarcane is one of the most productive crops in the world and is mostly grown in tropical and subtropical regions and countries wiedenfeld 2000 in many countries sugarcane has become an important crop for sugar and bioenergy at present due to the high consumption of sugar and by products the demand for sugarcane is increasing therefore it is necessary to ensure a sustainable increase in sugarcane production however sugarcane is affected by a combination of factors during its growth such as natural factors soil climate botany etc and anthropogenic factors crop and economic management etc larrahondo and villegas 1995 the impact of drought is the most important environmental factor restricting the growth of sugarcane ellis and lankford 1990 analyzing the occurrence and development of drought affecting crops is more complex than individual drought events which requires a series of indicators to construct and select a set of comprehensive and accurate indices closely related to drought and its impact on crops has always been the key point according to previous study ramesh 2000 the higher the degree of drought in india the greater the impact on sugarcane moisture and sugar accumulation in australia more than 60 of sucrose production relied on irrigation owning to drought conditions inman bamber 2004 sugarcane production in south africa and other places was threatened by drought and increasing irrigation was necessary to maintain the yield and accumulation of sucrose in crops inman bamber and smith 2005 sun et al 2012 potopova et al 2016 in addition in brazil and other places increased water shortages had led to a decline in sugarcane production santos and sentelhas 2012 marin et al 2013 cardozo and sentelhas 2013 the frequent occurrence of droughts makes it a limiting factor for sugarcane growth and the crop water requirements cwr will be significantly affected by climate change cao et al 2008 liu and lin 2004 piao et al 2010 in fact severe drought events have occurred in southwest china cheng et al 2020 for instance the drought in 2006 caused 311 300 ha of crop failure in sichuan guizhou and guangxi li et al 2011 several studies discussed the impact of drought on crop yield in southwest china jia et al 2016 he et al 2017 china is the third largest sugarcane producer in the world and guangxi takes the largest share of total sugar production with the proportion of approximately 67 producing 6 34 million tons of cane sugar chen et al 2020 guangxi has become more and more sensitive to the effects of drought in recent years precipitation was pointed out to decrease in southwest guangxi xie et al 2019 and the frequency of extreme droughts increased in the coastal areas of southern guangxi in the past 50 years zhang et al 2013 therefore the impact of drought may have a fundamental impact on the irrigation demand and water system management of sugarcane in guangxi to date studies have investigated the changes in water requirements of different crops but have seldom considered the variances in different crop growth stages yoon and choi 2020 li et al 2016 however crops have different water requirements in different growth periods and water shortage during the critical water requirements period of crops often leads to crop yield reduction or even no harvest xu et al 2013 previous studies mainly focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of drought and the changes in drought risks insufficient attention has been paid to the relationships among drought water requirement and yield the drought impact on the crop yield during different growth periods of a specific crop like sugarcane have not been paid enough attention to the indices of drought or water demand without considering the spatiotemporal variations may lead to uncertainties for assessing the drought and its impact across the entire region during the whole crop growth period which needs further discussion in this study a framework to explicitly quantify the impact of drought on a specific crop has been proposed the sugarcane is selected as the target crop and the growth process is divided into 4 stages in different areas in guangxi the evolution of drought and water requirements as well as the impact of drought on water requirement and yield are evaluated based on a series of indicators to be specific three aspects of drought impact on sugarcane in guangxi are addressed 1 the temporal and spatial variations of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and water requirements in guangxi during different sugarcane growth stages 2 the evolution of the standardized yield residual series syrs at 1 to 12 month lags and the monthly changes of corresponding spei in 2 selected severe drought years 3 in terms of correlation coefficients the relationship between drought and irrigation water requirement iwr in different growth stages and the relationship between spei and syrs to quantify the drought impact on sugarcane yield 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the guangxi zhuang autonomous region is located in southwestern china 104 112 e and 20 26 n as shown in fig 1 the tropic of cancer traverses the central part and it has a subtropical monsoon climate while the southern part is biased towards the tropical monsoon climate on the whole guangxi has a warm climate rich in light and heat the annual average temperature is 16 5 23 1 the extreme maximum temperature is about 34 43 and the extreme minimum temperature is about 8 4 3 0 the accumulated temperature with values of 10 is from 5075 to 8328 frost free period is about 288 365 days total solar radiation ranges from 3664 to 5304 mj m2 which decreases from south to north and from valley plain to hilly and mountainous areas guangxi is one of the provinces with the richest precipitation in china with the annual average precipitation of about 1000 2000 mm but the temporal and spatial distribution is uneven the eastern region especially the coastal regions has abundant precipitation while the western region has relatively less precipitation there is plenty of rain in spring and summer but less rain in autumn and winter seasonal droughts often occur annual average precipitation in guangxi is 1086 2760 mm the spatial distribution of annual average precipitation varies greatly with more in the east north and south while less in the west annual average evaporation is about 1239 1861 mm which is also quite uneven in guangxi guangxi covers an area of 237 600 km2 about 40 of the total land area in guangxi is hilly elevation declines from west to east and from north to south the karst landform is widely distributed in the southwest northwest central and northeast of guangxi accounting for 37 8 of the total land area the karst area is characterized by the two layer structure of surface layer and underground layer and the soil layer of the karst area is thin with weak soil water storage capacity owing to this topographical condition a large part of rainwater can infiltrate into the underground quickly which can increase the susceptibility of flood and drought hazards in this area in guangxi sugarcane planting areas are mostly distributed in hilly basins and semi mountain slopes with steep slopes and low water retention capacity which belong to rain fed dry farming according to the similarity of agroclimatic characteristics the study area was divided into 5 sugarcane planting areas xie and kuang 2006 in fig 1 and table 1 which are western guangxi southern guangxi northern guangxi east of central guangxi and west of central guangxi according to the characteristics of sugarcane growth the sugarcane growth process is divided into 4 stages the seeding stage the tillering stage the stem extension stage and the maturity stage van dillewijn 1952 due to the difference of climate the periods of sugarcane growth stages in different areas are also different table1 also lists the starting and ending dates of different growth phases of sugarcane in each region quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 sugarcanes in western southern northern central and west central guangxi usually begin to sprout on february 14th february 21 march 26 april 13th march 11 enter the tillering stages on april 11th april 11 june 1 june 13th may 11 and ripening stages on october 21st october 21 december 11 november 21st and november 11 respectively due to its special climatic conditions in northern guangxi sugarcane is planted sporadically 2 2 datasets light heat and water are the most important factors for crop growth and agricultural production in this study daily meteorological data from 1984 to 2016 are adopted which is released by china meteorological administration 2021 including sunshine duration sd h precipitation p mm temperature t maximum temperature t max and minimum temperature t min to calculate the potential evapotranspiration pet the meteorological factors including wind speed at 2 m above ground level u 2 m s atmospheric pressure p r hpa and relative humidity rh are also adopted all these daily meteorological datasets 1984 2016 used in this study were measured at 24 meteorological stations across guangxi fig 1b thus the spatiotemporal evolution of drought in different growth stages of sugarcane in guangxi from 1984 to 2016 is analyzed to eliminate the influence of non climatic factors all data have undergone limit checks and time consistency checks in this study the annual sugarcane production and planting area during 1995 2016 are extracted from the guangxi statistical yearbook guangxi zhuang autonomous region bureau of statistics 1996 2017 and per unit yield data is obtained by dividing the annual output of the same period by the average annual planting area due to lack of sugarcane data with a longer sequence the relations among drought irrigation water requirement iwr and sugar production only from 1995 to 2016 are analyzed based on the 22 year drought iwr and sugar yield data in the study area correlation analysis about the drought impact on the sugarcane yields are conducted 3 methodologies 3 1 selection and calculation of the spei a number of drought indices have been proposed to estimate the drought severity duration magnitude and spatial extent and improve the risk management richard and heim 2002 liu et al 2018a vergni et al 2021 masanta and srinivas 2022 wang et al 2022 such as the palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 self calibrating palmer drought severity index wells et al 2004 standard precipitation index mckee et al 1993 standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 standardized wetness index liu et al 2017 etc using the difference between precipitation and pet as input spei at various timescales has been developed and employed in an increasing number of climatological and hydrological studies vicente serrano et al 2010 yu et al 2014 liu and jiang 2015 li et al 2019 spei considers the effects of evapotranspiration through the simple difference between precipitation and pet and has been widely used in many studies so far li et al 2019 zarei and moghimi 2019 zhao et al 2021 to further test the suitability for application of spei the spei values with the historical drought events and drought flood incidence rates in the study area during the same period are compared and analyzed the correspondence between the spei values and typical historical drought events are compared and listed in table 2 the spei values agree well with the historical drought events the correlation coefficients between the spei values and the flood and drought incidence rates are also computed and listed in table 3 respectively there is high significance between spei and flood or drought rates based on the pearson correlation analysis spei index is not only applicable to analyze drought and flood changes in guangxi but also can detect the drought hazard event and effectively reflect the impact of drought and flood on crop yield therefore spei index can be used to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought in guangxi and quantify its impact on crop production thus spei was selected as the drought indicator in this study the spei in monthly scale corresponding to different sugarcane growth periods are therefore analyzed in addition the spei on the scale of 1 12 months was also calculated to detect the correlation between drought and sugarcane yield the spei is calculated based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration and the normalization of the difference the specific calculation steps are as follows 1 calculate the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration 1 d i p i pet i where d i is the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration in the i th month mm pi is the precipitation in the i th month mm pet i is the potential evapotranspiration in the i th month mm using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 2 establish the accumulation sequence of the precipitation and the pet at different time scales 2 d n k i 0 k 1 p n i et n i n k where k is the time scale month n is the number of calculations 3 use the log logistic probability distribution f x to fit the d sequence transform the sequence into a standard normal distribution and calculate the final spei value 3 spei w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w 2 ln p where p is the cumulative probability of exceeding the undetermined d when p 0 5 the sign of the spei is reversed fixed constant c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 43278 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 the detailed explanation of the specific process could be found in the previous studies zhuang et al 2013 gao et al 2017 the spei can be calculated at different time scales which is very flexible wang et al 2018 in this study the spei yan and li 2015 corresponding to different sugarcane growth periods is discussed in addition the spei on the scale of 1 12 months was also calculated to analyze the correlation between drought and sugarcane yield see table 4 for specific classification 3 2 standardized yield residual series syrs the formation of the final crop yield is not only related to varieties management techniques etc but also restricted by meteorological conditions generally crop yield is decomposed into three parts trend yield meteorological yield and random error lian 2005 fang 2011 niu et al 2018 trend yield is the long period output component that reflects the level of productivity development in the historical period and is also called technical yield meteorological yield is a fluctuating output component that is influenced by the short term changing factor mainly agricultural and meteorological disasters dominated by climate variables the random error is very small and can be ignored therefore the actual crop yield it can be regarded as the sum of trend yield and meteorological yield fu et al 2019 yue et al 2021 namely 4 g t y t y w where g t is the actual yield y t is the trend yield and y w is the meteorological yield the correct assessment of the impact of meteorological conditions on crop yields must be based on the acquisition of accurate meteorological yields this paper uses logistic method to separate the meteorological yield of sugarcane compared with linear equations logistic curve has better fitting accuracy and can better capture the long term trend of time series growth ji 2012 this paper constructs the following logistic cumulative distribution curve equation based on the data of guangxi sugarcane output from 1995 to 2016 per unit area ahmad et al 1988 yin 2002 cui 2005 5 g t k 1 e a rt where k a r are the three unknown parameters of the logistic cumulative distribution curve equation and the estimation method is as follows first use the four point method to estimate the unknown parameter k in the equation let it be k 1 then 6 k 1 n 1 n 4 n 2 n 3 n 2 n 3 n 1 n 4 n 1 n 4 n 2 n 3 where t 1 n 1 t 4 n 4 are the start and end points of the actual production sequence respectively t 2 n 2 t 3 n 3 are the two points in the middle of the sequence estimate the remaining two unknown parameters a and r according to the obtained k value and convert eq 5 into the following equation 7 ln k 1 g t g t a rt let g t ln k 1 g t g t and get the linear function of g t with respect to time t 8 g t a rt use the principle of least squares to determine the parameter values a 1 and r 1 of the remaining two parameters a and r the fitted value y t1 of the sugarcane trend yield series can be obtained 9 y t 1 k 1 1 e a 1 r 1 t the meteorological yield of sugarcane can be calculated using g t and y t in order to compare the yield variability between crops with different average values and standard deviations the z score transformation was used to standardize the yield residuals of the meteorological yield time series then the syrs with the mean and standard deviation values equal to 0 and 1 are obtained respectively based on the standard normal distribution that is the syrs values between 0 5 and 0 5 between 1 0 and 0 5 between 1 5 and 1 0 and below 1 5 are classified as normal low yield loss medium yield loss and high yield loss liu et al 2018b potopová et al 2015 see table 4 for specific classification 3 3 cwr of sugarcane the occurrence and development of drought affecting crops is more complex than general drought it is not only related to the biological characteristics of crops such as crop varieties crop characteristics drought tolerance planting status and growth status but also affected by natural factors such as meteorology hydrology and underlying surface as well as human management farming system and sci technology li and zhou 2014 the water requirement of sugarcane is the total amount of water to meet the growth of sugarcane and give full play to its productive potential the energy balance method i e the modified penman method was used to calculate the cwr according to following equation quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 10 cwr i k c et 0 i i 1 2 n where cwr i is crop water requirement at a certain stage et 0i is reference crop evapotranspiration at a certain stage i growing stage and k c is crop coefficient the thornthwaite method was used to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration thornthwaite 1948 the crop coefficient is obtained from the sugarcane irrigation quota and irrigation technical regulation in guangxi zhuang autonomous region quality and technical supervision bureau of guangxi zhuang autonomous 2015 the specific sugarcane coefficient k c is listed in table 5 3 4 iwr of sugarcane typically iwr is calculated as differences between cwr and effective precipitation ep brouwer and heibloem 1986 li et al 2010 11 iwr n 1 n cwr n 1 n ep where iwr is the irrigation water requirement mm n is the length of the growth stage days cwr is the crop water requirement mm day 1 ep is effective precipitation mm day 1 the ep during the growth stage in the guangxi sugarcane of china using the usda recommended method döll and siebert 2002 li et al 2010 can be computed as follows 12 ep p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 where ep is effective precipitation mm day 1 p is daily precipitation mm day 1 this method has been used by many scholars to calculate ep in southwest china and the effect quite satisfactory li et al 2011 fu et al 2014 3 5 the proposed framework to detect the impact of droughts on crop yields the flow chart of the framework proposed in this study is shown in fig 2 spei is calculated using precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets calculated by thornthwaite method deng et al 2020 the drought evolution in guangxi from 1984 to 2016 is analyzed using spei series during different growth stages then pet and kc are leveraged to calculate cwr iwr is obtained by calculating the differences between the cwr and the ep the syrs is normalized based on the meteorological yield the spatiotemporal variations of the drought water demand and yield in different sugarcane growth stages are discussed the correlation between spei and iwr in space domain and the correlation coefficients between the monthly detrended spei series at 1 to 12 month lags and the syrs are discussed respectively the drought impact on the sugarcane yield is therefore assessed 4 results and discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial variations of 3 month spei in different growth stages fig 3 shows the temporal variations of drought in each growth stage of sugarcane indicated by 3 month spei in the seeding stage before 2000 the main dry and wet conditions occurred alternatively after 2000 significant drought events occurred dry wet dry alternate variations dominated the spei evolution throughout the tillering stage in the stem extension stage there were obvious interdecadal dry wet alternation drought events were mainly concentrated in 1984 1992 and 2003 2012 in the maturity stage the spei also showed obvious dry wet alternation the driest period was from 2000 to 2011 the main continuous drought stages identified in different growth stages were 1984 1992 and 2003 2012 while the main continuous humid stages were 1993 2002 and 2013 2016 the driest stage in guangxi coincided with the warmest decade in 2001 2010 the frequency of extreme drought in summer increased in most parts of guangxi after 2000 the interdecadal characteristics of spei is consistent with the findings in the previous studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2019 the magnitude and significance of the spei trend during 1984 2016 at each sugarcane growth stage in guangxi were detected using the mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1948 as shown in fig 4 during the seeding stage of sugarcane an overall drought trend was detected with high values in western and southern guangxi and 9 stations passed the 90 and above significance test on the contrary a slight wetting trend was observed in the eastern and northern parts of guangxi during the tillering stage most areas of guangxi showed a trend of aridification and three stations passed the 90 significance test during the stem extension stage the drought trend was concentrated in the northern central and western guangxi only three stations showed a slight trend of drought at the maturity stage drought prevailed during the sugarcane sowing and tillering stages the area with a dry tendency were distributed mainly in the southwest guangxi 4 2 temporal and spatial variations of water requirement in different growth stages table 6 lists the amount and proportion of water requirement in different sugarcane growth stages maximum water requirement was observed during the stem extension stage followed by the tillering and seeding stage and the smallest during the maturity stage the distribution of climate tendency rates fig 5a c and the mann kendall trend test results fig 5d f of ep cwr and iwr from 1984 to 2016 in guangxi are shown in fig 5 ep decreased at seeding and stem extension stages while increased in tillering and the maturity stages fig 5a the increase of ep in maturity stage was mainly due to the increase in precipitation days in december and january and the increase of ep in tillering stage was mainly due to the increase in precipitation days during june july yin et al 2021 the overall trend of ep did not change significantly fig 5d the linear trend of cwr increased during the stem extension stage fig 5b the trend increased significantly in the seeding tillering and stem extension stages passing the 90 significance test fig 5e the increasing trend of iwr was mainly concentrated in seeding and stem extension stages fig 5c the iwr in the seeding and stem extension stages increased significantly in western and central western guangxi fig 5f in general the cwr and iwr of sugarcane tended to increase while ep tended to decrease water requirement varied greatly in different growth stages this may further increase the frequency and intensity of drought disasters bringing more challenges to sugarcane production in guangxi figs 6 8 show the spatial distributions of four growth stages of sugarcane cwr iwr and ep using mann kendall statistical test analysis the cwr during seeding stage increased at the selected 22 stations and a significant increase was found in the west and east of guangxi fig 6a the cwr during the tillering and stem extension stages in most parts of guangxi increased while the cwr in the east of central west and south of guangxi showed a relatively obvious increasing trend fig 6b c in the maturity stage cwr increased significantly in the east of central and west of guangxi while decreased in southern guangxi fig 6d there were in general increasing trends in iwr during the seeding stage especially in the western and southern guangxi fig 7a at the tillering stage iwr decreased significantly in the central and northern parts of guangxi while iwr in western and southern guangxi showed a slightly increasing trend fig 7b at the stem extension stage iwr increased in most parts of guangxi while it showed a decreasing trend the western part of guangxi fig 7c at the maturity stage iwr decreased in most areas especially in the northern and eastern guangxi fig 7d in the seedling stage ep showed an increasing trend in northern guangxi while a decreasing trend in southwest guangxi fig 8a at the tillering stage ep showed an increasing trend in most areas of guangxi especially in central guangxi fig 8b in stem extension stage there was a decreasing trend in southeast guangxi while an increasing trend in west guangxi fig 8c during the maturity stage ep showed an increasing trend in most areas of guangxi and a significant increasing trend in northern guangxi fig 8d 4 3 evolution of the sugarcane syrs according to the results the unit output of sugarcane in guangxi increased from 1995 to 2016 with linear growth rates of 0 56 0 88 0 39 0 72 0 91 ton ha year in the west south north east of central west of central of guangxi respectively this is regarded as the results of advance in agricultural techniques the influence of non climatic factors should be excluded and the syrs results from 1995 to 2016 were further analyzed fig 9a the high yield loss years of guangxi sugarcane were 2000 2010 and 2011 respectively and the year of moderate yield loss was 2005 to explore the possible causes of sugarcane yield reduction the monthly change of spei with a lag of 1 12 months in 2000 and 2011 was further analyzed fig 9b c in 2000 drought occurred from june to september corresponding to the sugarcane stem extension stage in 2011 a drought event occurred from march to october covering the seeding tillering and stem extension stages of sugarcane the most severe drought occurred in july september which corresponds to the period when sugarcane water requirement was the highest if not irrigated in time sugarcane production will be reduced in fact a decline in sugarcane production was indicated in 2000 and 2011 in fig 9 which could further illustrate the serious impact of drought on crop production the longer the drought lasts the more serious the drought is and the greater the impact of drought on sugarcane yields in addition clear differences between the onsets of drought based on different time lags were observed in general short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater although sugarcane yields may be high in dry years if the sugarcane was irrigated the sugarcane yields in extremely dry years would be still affected for example the extreme drought in the southwest from the summer of 2009 to the spring of 2010 was extremely severe resulting in a large reduction in crop yields due to lack of water liu et al 2017 4 4 correlation between spei and iwr the relationship between drought and iwr in different growth stages was tested using pearson s correlation coefficient as shown in fig 10 a significant negative correlation was detected between drought and irrigation water demand throughout the entire growth process the correlation coefficients of spei and iwr in the seeding stem extension and maturity stages ranged from 0 6 to 1 across the study area showing a significant negative correlation fig 10 a c and d during the critical growth stages of seeding and stem extension of sugarcane drought steadily raise the demand for sugarcane irrigation making it necessary for sugarcane output spei has the closest correlation with irrigation during the stem extension stage meanwhile it faced the most critical water shortage during this stage sugarcane is susceptible to drought which would lead to a decline in yield during the stem extension stage dingre and gorantiwar 2021 furthermore the correlation coefficients between spei and irrigation in the maturity stage are also high moderate water shortage during maturity is tolerable because it increases the flow of sucrose into the stem maximizing sucrose production and internode storage singels et al 2019 the correlation coefficients at southwest guangxi during the tillering stage ranged from 0 4 to 0 8 but the correlation between drought and irrigation water demand in northeastern guangxi was not obvious previous studies pointed out that there was a high tolerance to drought during the tillering stage and iwr was not high during this stage ellis and lankford 1990 the possible reason is that the ep during the seeding stage in northeast guangxi is large with a relatively large quantity of water stored in the sugarcane and soil during the tillering stage according to the recent studies dingre and gorantiwar 2021 sugarcane has the potential to cope with the effects of drought to some extent 4 5 correlation between spei and syrs the impact of drought with different durations on sugarcane yields is further analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficients between syrs and spei at the five regions of guangxi fig 11 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between the spei time series at 1 12 months lags and the syrs of sugarcane from 1995 to 2016 the sugarcane growth stages were in general from february to december there are significant differences in the response of sugarcane to spei with different months lags when drought conditions significantly affected sugarcane yields a positive correlation was observed indicating that the year to year changes of sugarcane yields i e syrs was related to the year to year changes of the spei time series a close correlation between sugarcane syrs and spei from june to october was observed the fluctuation of sugarcane yields can be explained by the interannual variation of spei and it is highly sensitive to drought during the stem extension stage with reference to the sugarcane growth stages listed in table 5 the sugarcane yields during the stem extension stage is highly sensitive to drought conditions the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production syrs had high correlation coefficients with short term spei in august and september to be specific sugarcane syrs has the highest correlation coefficient with august spei 2 in western guangxi with value of 0 483 the correlation coefficient between sugarcane syrs and spei 1 in august was the highest in northern guangxi that is r 0 49 the sugarcane syrs had the highest correlation coefficients with spei 2 in august and spei 3 in september in the east of central guangxi with values of 0 534 0 521 respectively the correlation coefficient between sugarcane syrs and spei 3 in august was the highest in west of central guangxi with r 0 437 4 6 limitations and uncertainties due to the limited records and data the current research considers only the effects of climate variability but does not account for the impact of human factors such as irrigation fertilization and technological progress there are other uncertainties in analyzing the evolution of drought and its impact on water demand and production according to the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 1996 2007 the average effective irrigation rate in guangxi zhuang autonomous region from 1995 to 2005 was 57 2 therefore most of the sugarcane in guangxi may be in the irrigated area which will pose a challenge to derive the proper drought index and evaluate the actual agricultural impact however it still clearly indicated that drought is closely related to the water requirement and sugarcane yields and seriously threaten sugarcane production in guangxi 5 conclusions this study analyzed the evolution of drought and water requirement from 1984 to 2016 and the impact of drought on water demand and sugarcane yields from 1995 to 2016 the main conclusions are as follows 1 the drought in sugarcane growing season tends to intensify and the drought risk in southwest guangxi will increase nevertheless different drought trends exhibit in different growth stages during the sugarcane seeding and tillering stages the drought trend in guangxi is dominant 2 consistent with the detected trend of increasing drought the water demand of sugarcane in most areas showed a significant upward trend cwr and iwr reached the maximum at the stem extension stage ep decreased during sowing and stem extension stage the relationship between drought and iwr varied in different regions sugarcane is vulnerable to drought risk during stem extension stage resulting in a decline in yield and the water demand at this stage is also the largest 3 the fluctuation of sugarcane yield can be explained by the interannual variation of spei specifically the mid to short term drought in august and september have a significant impact on sugarcane production short term spei can predict the occurrences of drought events earlier than long term spei and the fluctuation range is also greater the severe and long lasting drought has a serious impact on sugarcane yield the research results are expected to be useful for a better understanding of the impact of drought on sugarcane in guangxi which could provide information for decision makers the method is expected to be applied to other crops in other regions declaration of
