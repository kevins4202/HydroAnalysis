9600,the close relationship between the onset and severity of agricultural and hydrological drought is considered self evident yet relatively few studies have addressed the effects of applying agricultural drought adaptation to hydrological drought characteristics the present study applies a model cascade capable of simultaneously considering the interactions between agricultural and hydrological droughts the study area covers all river basins in the czech republic and includes the periods of 1956 2015 baseline and 2021 2080 future the model cascade was shown to explain 91 of the variability in the seasonal and annual accumulated runoff and allows for the analysis of increasing maintaining decreasing available water capacity awc across the 133 defined basins with a total area of c 78 000 km2 the study reports that the probability and extent of agricultural drought increased over the entire period with higher awc scenario showing slower pace of such increase especially from april to june the trends in the extent or severity of hydrological droughts were of low magnitude the future climate has been projected through the use of ensembles of five global cmip5 and five regional euro cordex climate models the results showed a significant increase in the duration of agricultural drought stress and in the area affected throughout the year particularly in july september the hydrological drought response showed a marked difference between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance i e areas where long term reference evapotranspiration exceeds long term precipitation negative climatic water balance and where it does not positive climatic water balance the overall results indicate that increasing soil awc would decrease the frequency and likely also impact of future agricultural droughts especially during spring this result would be especially true if the wetter winters predicted by some of the models materialized hydrological droughts at the country level are estimated to become more pronounced with increasing awc particularly in catchments with a negative climatic water balance keywords agricultural drought hydrological drought climate

is considered a multifaceted phenomenon e g wilhite and pulwarty 2017 compared to hazards such as floods drought tends to occur less frequently but when it does occur it generally affects a broad region for seasons or years unisdr 2009 the drought episodes in russia in 2010 trenberth and fasullo 2012 shmakin et al 2013 the usa in 2011 2012 hoerling et al 2014 china in 2013 and brazil in 2014 were for each particular year among the 10 natural disasters with the highest recorded damage worldwide munich re 2015 the most recent 2015 2020 drought episode significantly affected agriculture forest and water resources across much of central europe e g european drought observatory https www copernicus eu en european drought observatory edo 2021 meteorological drought originates from a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time and can result in impacts within weeks in the case of agricultural drought or within longer time periods in the case of hydrological drought e g br√°zdil and trnka 2015 van loon 2015 wilhite and pulwarty 2017 the deficiency can result in water shortages for some activities groups or environmental sectors e g blauhut et al 2016 in this study we understand agricultural droughts as a deficit of soil moisture mostly in the root zone reducing the supply of moisture to vegetation similar to soil moisture drought as understood e g by van loon 2015 as hydrological drought we understand negative anomalies in surface and subsurface water flow and storage that result into below normal groundwater levels or water levels in lakes declining wetland area and decreased river discharge in recent years severe drought events with different degrees of intensity affected more than 800 000 km2 of the eu s territory 37 and at least 100 million inhabitants 20 the eu countries austria belgium the czech republic cyprus finland france germany hungary italy lithuania malta the netherlands norway portugal spain and the united kingdom have been hit with the economic impacts of drought with estimated losses of 60 billion euros over the 1980 2017 period ec 2018 the single most damaging drought and heat event across eu countries was the summer of 2003 with estimated damage of 15 billion euros which were mostly uninsured ec 2018 i e the financial impacts on various sectors were not mitigated beyond ad hoc assistance from individual eu member states the water shortage in europe is an important problem in many regions vogt and somma 2000 and estimates for the 21st century show increasing drought occurrence and severity across most of the european continent e g samaniego et al 2018 grillakis 2019 including central europe e g dai 2013 trnka et al 2013 the first sector affected by drought is usually agriculture which is particularly sensitive to changes in drought occurrence during the early growing season i e april june in central europe hlavinka et al 2009 this is crucial for both the productivity of managed ecosystems e g rain fed field crops and the net primary production of ecosystems as a whole this period was usually wet due to snow melt saturating the soil profile just prior to the beginning of the growing season this condition allowed for the maximum use of the soil storage capacity in the following months and provided vegetation with significant reserve buffering for the naturally high rain variability however this is no longer the case due to both the observed and expected decline in snow cover trnka et al 2011 coupled with a marked decrease in the soil water holding capacity during recent years e g trnka et al 2016a in particular the latter process has intensified the impact of the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts trnka et al 2016b the increases in temperature solar radiation water vapor pressure deficit and stagnating precipitation trnka et al 2015 have contributed to the drying of the soil across the czech republic at the same time the soil available water capacity awc decreased due to chronic erosion and soil compaction exacerbating the problems caused by climatic trends trnka et al 2016a this phenomenon could help explain the marked increase in the sensitivity of agriculture to drought observed over the past century e g trnka et al 2012 2016c and is a reason for concerns for the coming decades due to the expected increasing frequency of droughts e g hanel et al 2012 hanel and vizina 2013 trnka et al 2013 as a result efforts to restore the awc of agricultural soils have been initiated to at least partly alleviate the problem of agricultural drought changing the water holding capacity and retaining water to be evaporated by or transpired through agricultural crops might however significantly alter other elements of the landscape water balance existing studies in a number of catchments in central europe project relatively small annual changes in the reference evapotranspiration eto and the precipitation despite considerable changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation and overall increase in eto this situation corresponds to high impact scenarios e g hanel et al 2012 2013a this finding suggests that increasing of water accumulation capacity is the best adaptation strategy to maintain sufficient river flow as it could store excess water from generally wet winter months for summer when water availability is decreasing any formulation of the national policies aimed at mitigating agricultural and hydrological droughts should consider key processes in both the soil profiles as well as the surface and underground reservoirs the need for such integrated analysis was pointed out in a recent survey and was indicated as priority research by trnka et al 2018 this study aims to test the hypothesis that increasing the soil water holding capacity will enhance landscape resilience to agricultural drought without making worse the frequency duration and area affected by the hydrological droughts in this paper we i introduce modelling cascade simultaneously considering agricultural and hydrological drought ii test the new tool during the 1956 2015 baseline period iii use a bias corrected ensemble of regional climate models rcms and global climate models gcms to estimate the consequences of mitigating agricultural drought via increased soil water holding capacity on the future frequency and severity of hydrological droughts and finally iv test the initial hypothesis defined above 2 data and methods 2 1 meteorological data daily precipitation temperature sunshine duration global radiation air humidity and wind speed data from 268 climatological and 787 rain gauge stations over the czech republic cr were quality controlled and homogenized for the 1956 2015 period the daily data were interpolated by the regression kriging method using geographical coordinates elevation and other terrain characteristics as predictors in the cr the mean minimal distance between two neighboring stations is approximately 17 km for the elements measured at climatological stations and approximately 10 km for rain gauges fig 1 the daily global radiation balance accounts for the slope aspect and horizon obstruction using the methodology proposed and tested by schaumberger 2005 2 2 soil moisture the soil moisture content expressed as relative available water awr was estimated using the soilclim model hlavinka et al 2011 which is principally based on the modeling approach suggested by allen et al 1998 awr values were constrained by the wilting point i e water content at 1500 kpa suction pressure awr 0 and field capacity i e water content at 33 kpa suction pressure awr 1 the soilclim model was applied for each 500 m x 500 m grid and accounted not only for the maximum awc within the grid but also for the type of vegetation cover phenology development root growth or snow cover accumulation melting trnka et al 2010 the module for actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content estimates considers two soil layers the topsoil layer from the ground surface to 0 4 m depth and the subsoil layer between 0 41 and 1 0 m the cascading approach for transferring water from the topsoil to subsoil layers is used when the topsoil is more than 50 saturated in the case of higher than 50 saturation in the topsoil seepage to the subsoil is allowed mimicking macropores and preferential water transport hlavinka et al 2011 the soilclim estimates of the soil moisture content are affected by awc for both soil layers in each grid the awc value was estimated through a combination of digital soil maps and detailed soil physics data from 1073 soil pits collected by the czech national soil survey more details in trnka et al 2015 the awc was calculated assuming a 1 0 m soil profile unless the soil database indicated a shallower soil depth the topsoil 0 0 4 m and subsoil 0 41 1 0 m or maximum rooting depth when it was shallow layers had their properties defined separately based on the available soil data in addition grids in which at least some part of the vegetation season was influenced by high underground water tables that are likely to be reached by roots for natural subsurface irrigation and therefore respond to drought differently in terms of both the stress magnitude and timing were compared to other grids the soils with an observed gleyic process which were within close proximity and at the same altitude to water bodies and peat and bog areas had their soil moisture depletion rate slowed significantly compared to neighboring grids without such influence trnka et al 2015 soilclim has dynamically simulated vegetation cover that changes the parameters of the canopy e g root depth or crop height during the vegetation season based on the thermal time and vernalization requirement in case of winter crops and perennials therefore the crop parameter kc allen et al 1998 as well as root growth dynamics vary for individual vegetation covers and throughout the year or growing season to account for the seasonally changing crop cover composition on grids of arable land which dominate the landscape a fixed proportion of crops on each arable grid was considered in these grids the soil moisture contents using spring and winter c3 crops based on present spring barley and winter wheat cultivars and spring c4 crops maize were calculated and then averaged for the three considered crops the information about the land cover relied on the corine land cover clc2006 100 m product version 12 2009 the following proportion of the individual land use classes was found for the cr territory i arable land 46 2 ii permanent grasslands 7 6 iii conifer forest 20 3 iv deciduous forest 3 1 v mixed forests 6 0 and vi other agricultural areas 8 7 areas where no realistic soilclim calculation was possible i e urbanized areas 7 0 and water bodies 1 1 were still considered by the bilan hydrological model through a simplified internal procedure the land use cover was considered static over the analyzed period as our study focuses on agricultural and hydrological drought interactions 2 3 hydrological balance hydrological balance was assessed by the bilan conceptual hydrological model van lanen et al 2004 vizina et al 2015 this model has been widely used in the cr for evaluation of water balance with monitoring applications by the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi and for assessment of climate change impacts e g hanel et al 2012 2013b the structure of the model is defined by a system of relationships describing the basic principles of water balance in the hydrological basin in the aeration zone for calibration of the key model parameters a runoff series at the outlet of the basin was used for calibration of the bilan hydrological model we used a database on observed monthly runoff and water use maintained by the t g masaryk water research institute that contained records for 631 hydrologic stations over the 1961 2015 period in addition to total runoff the model simulates soil and ground water storage and snow water equivalent the bilan model has been calibrated with a focus on the reproduction of drought characteristics moreover the available soil moisture content simulated by the soilclim model having spatially distributed soil parameters was also considered within the calibration i e the awc of the bilan model was forced to mimic the variation in the soil water content from the soilclim model the bilan model was set up for 133 basins with areas ranging from 620 to 1925 km2 covering the cr see fig 1 2 4 water balance of reservoirs and available water resources the balance of reservoirs was simulated by the wateres model available as an r package at https github com tgmwri wateres wateres 2021 which simulates the balance of individual reservoirs and reservoir networks in daily time steps and provides reservoir performance characteristics yield reliability deficit volume etc the balance is calculated considering the reported water use together with the estimated runoff precipitation and evaporation from the water surface of the reservoirs which are shown in fig 1a in the cr water use exceeding 500 m3 month or 6000 m3 year has to be approved and reported to the water authority and all water uses above these thresholds were considered in the study 2 5 drought definition and statistical analysis agricultural drought is defined for the purposes of this study as conditions that cause adverse crop responses because plants usually cannot meet reference transpiration as a result of too high atmospheric demands and or limited soil moisture the decrease in transpiration occurs whenever the available water within reach of the roots is not freely available i e whenever readily available water becomes scarce in the soil the readily available water represents approximately half of the awc allen et al 1998 therefore the moment when the awr reached or dropped below 0 5 was considered the onset of agricultural drought agricultural drought ends when awr increases above this threshold we also considered drought duration as the number of days when awr 0 5 hydrological drought is defined by considering a threshold level through the so called deficit index tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon 2015 a drought event starts when the index drops below a threshold here the minimum residual flow as defined in the decree of the ministry of environment of the cr and ends when it rises above the threshold the deficit index for an event also called deficit volume representing drought severity equals a cumulative deviation from the threshold the number of months for which the runoff does not reach the minimum residual flow is considered the drought duration the mann kendall test was used to determine if the slope of the estimated linear regression line was different from zero hirsch et al 1982 with the p value provided the statistical analysis has been done with the use of anclim and proclimdb software packages http www climahom eu software solution anclim anclim 2021 developed specifically for the analysis of meteorological climatological and hydrological data e g ≈°tƒõp√°nek et al 2009 the performance of the models in comparison with the observed data have been assessed through mean bias error root mean square error the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and theil sen estimator 2 6 future climate simulations the analysis of future climate conditions used a set of rcm simulations that were carried out within the european part of the global coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment euro cordex 2021 www euro cordex net the euro cordex experimental design is based on the utilization of state of the art rcms forced by multiple gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 ensemble euro cordex rcm simulations deliver new insight into european climate development at two spatial scales for three greenhouse gas emission scenarios from representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 from all available euro cordex simulations we chose the following five gcm rcm pairs that were performed for rcp4 5 at a 0 11 spatial resolution clarke et al 2007 cnrm cm5 aladin53 ec earth racmo22e ec earth rca4 mohc hadgem2 es rca4 and mpi esm lr cclm4 8 17 this choice was influenced by the availability of the euro cordex data within the time of preparation of this study and by the effort to capture a variety of the different rcms and their driving gcms all climate model simulations were subject to bias correction by applying the distribution adjusting by percentiles dap method ≈°tƒõp√°nek et al 2016 this method relies on the quantile mapping bias correction approach the chmi dataset of 787 stations with daily precipitation observations and 268 stations with daily air temperature humidity and wind speed observations within the 1981 2010 period was used for bias correction as a part of the dap method the rcm data from the several nearest grids were first recalculated into station locations and then the bias correction itself was performed on the daily data within the 1981 2005 period in addition five gcms were considered through the delta approach method as used by trnka et al 2016a and were applied to obtain daily data for each 500 m x 500 m grid for future climate 2021 2080 gcms were used as representations of ensemble central estimates ipsl model of institute of pierre simone laplace france and for the best capture of the variability in the expected changes in precipitation and temperature bnu beijing normal university china mri meteorological research institute japan cnmr national centre for meteorological research france hadgem hadley centre global environment model uk these models were selected from 40 climate models available in the cmip5 database taylor et al 2012 we followed the methodology developed by dubrovsky et al 2015 and used the rcp4 5 and a climatic sensitivity of 3 0 c 2 7 scenarios of soil water holding capacity in addition to the climate change scenarios we introduced perturbations in the parameters influencing the soil awc within the soilclim simulation and bilan models we considered scenarios where the soil awc remained constant at the baseline levels awc 0 and improved or reduced by 40 awc 40 and awc 40 respectively and varied with a 7 reduction in soil awc per decade awc 7 the awc 0 value of water holding capacity was based on the national soil survey and corresponds to the awc in the early 1970 s as a more recent national survey has not been carried out therefore we used a 7 reduction in awc per decade as an approximation of the deterioration of the soil awc in the cr through a combination of soil erosion soil compaction and loss of organic matter ≈°arapatka and bedn√°≈ô 2015 this decrease in awc is only an approximation but it has been occurring at a faster pace since the 1960 s than that in neighboring countries such as austria dev√°t√Ω et al 2019 the selection of the lower limits of the awc change i e 40 was based on the estimated decrease in the awc from the observed data from the cr caused by soil erosion compaction and loss of soil structure and organic matter e g vopravil 2009 vopravil 2011 over the past 50 years on the other hand the increase in the awc by 40 over the baseline value is considered to be the theoretical upper limit that could theoretically be achieved by considerable and long term efforts that completely change the soil management crop and landscape structure these efforts would constitute i adjusting tillage to improve infiltration and soil structure e g blanco canqui and ruis 2018 ii introducing no till practices while building up layers of organic mulch from intercrops and or using intercrops but also extensive use of soil amendments such as biochar the latter approach was found to be capable of significantly boosting awc values e g yu et al 2013 while the debate still continues if extensive biochar introduction is realistic e g atkinson 2018 3 results 3 1 validation of soilclim and bilan models fig 2 shows the mean annual runoff over all basins analyzed for the observed data 1981 2015 and data simulated by the bilan model 1956 2017 soil moisture in the bilan model was provided by the soilclim simulations at 500 m x 500 m grids overall the bilan model was able to explain more than 90 of the seasonal and annual variability in runoff in comparison with the observed data the minimum annual runoff corresponded to c 120 mm while the maxima exceeded 330 mm and the model was able to capture these large fluctuations well fig 2 also demonstrates the simulation results for awc 40 and awc 40 an increase in awc leads to decreased runoff and vice versa 3 2 trends in agricultural drought during the 1956 2015 period there is a general increase in the area with the soil water content below 50 of the awc fig 3 and in the area with the soil water content swc below the significant water stress threshold i e 30 of awc supplement fig 1 especially in the low pass filter charts the increase in swc during the 1956 2015 period is statistically significant p 0 05 for april june for all considered awc alternatives fig 3c d this increase is particularly pronounced when soil awc is decreased by 40 or when the gradually decreasing awc emulating soil degradation is considered however even if the soil awc would increase by 40 the climate signal is sufficient to significantly increase the duration and extent of the area affected by agricultural drought this means that the climate signal may outweigh even very ambitious soil retention improvement programs the positive effect of high awc is most pronounced during years with normal or above normal precipitation as this allows for the accumulation of the water reserves in the soil typically prior to the peak of the vegetation season i e during winter and early spring in the awc 40 scenario the soil water accumulated over winter can last longer and reduce the area affected by drought especially during april june the differences among soil awc scenarios are smallest during dry years for july september e g 2003 or 2015 as the reserves of the soil moisture are already depleted prior to drought even in soils with high awc on the other hand the highly positive effect of soil awc can be illustrated for early season droughts e g 2000 or 2012 for which increased soil awc can significantly decrease the extent of drought events the awc 40 scenario strengthens the impact of the climate signal first the decreased awc markedly worsens the impact of drought in april june fig 3c d but also notably increases the affected area in july september fig 3e f in line with that the decreased awc also considerably increases the area affected by drought stress supplement fig 1 during both april june and july september 3 3 trends in hydrological drought during the 1956 2015 period the perturbations in the soil awc exhibit an opposite effect on runoff fig 2 as well as on other hydrological drought characteristics fig 4 compared to their effects on agricultural drought in general there is a negative non significant trend in runoff 2 29 mm decade over the 1956 2015 period the awc 40 scenario leads to a steep overall decrease in runoff while the awc 40 scenario leads to a reduction in the negative trend the trends in drought duration and area affected increase for april october but statistically significant trends are observed in only june the available water resources decrease for april september but the decrease is statistically significant for only june and august this condition may negatively influence for example the availability of water for irrigation soil awc also has a significant impact on drought characteristics in particular the most severe droughts e g 1973 1991 and 2015 are on average 0 64 months longer for awc 40 and 0 77 months shorter for awc 40 as can be deduced from fig 6 in addition the area affected by hydrological drought increases with increasing soil awc and vice versa in the case of april june awc 40 caused almost doubling of the drought affected area while awc 40 decreased to approximately one half compared to awc 0 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of mean annual runoff for the cr for constant and perturbed awcs there are two large areas fig 5c with low runoff south moravia runoff 50 mm and northwest bohemia runoff 75 mm the runoff coefficient ratio of runoff to precipitation in these areas ranges from 0 08 to 0 15 according to the bilan model simulation these areas are the most sensitive to soil awc perturbations the awc 40 leads to an increase in runoff on the order of tens of millimeters while the awc 40 results in a further decrease in the already low runoff the effect of the awc 40 scenario can be attributed to an increase in actual evapotranspiration in the investigated basins 3 4 climate conditions for the 2021 2080 period according to five rcms the mean temperature between the 1981 2010 and 2021 2080 periods should increase by 1 5 c the highest warming of 2 0 c is projected by mohc hadgem2 es rca4 and the lowest warming of 0 9 c is projected by mpi esm lr clm4 8 17 the cnrm cm5 aladin53 and mohc hadgem2 es rca4 models indicate the highest temperature increase in winter 2 0 2 7 c in contrast the ec earth model shows the highest positive change in spring 1 8 2 1 c and the mpi esm lr clm4 8 17 model shows the highest positive change in summer 1 3 c the precipitation will increase by approximately 10 for the whole 2021 2080 period compared to the reference 1981 2010 period according to five rcms but they provide very different results the cnrm cm5 aladin53 and mohc hadgem2 es rca4 models project the highest precipitation increases 15 4 and 13 4 respectively while the ec earth racmo22e model predicts an increase of only approximately 3 5 a remarkable increase in precipitation is indicated especially for spring 14 5 and winter 12 8 the summer precipitation should be nearly the same as that in the current climate according to most models only cnrm cm5 aladin53 provides much higher totals when the projections based on five gcms are considered the results are slightly different from the rcm simulations the increase in the annual mean temperatures in the 2021 2080 period compared to the baseline period is expected to be 1 8 c and ranges from 1 4 c mri model to 2 1 c hadgem model while the cnrm ipsl and mri models predict the largest warming in winter ranging from 1 7 c mri to 2 7 c cnrm the remaining two gcms indicate the largest warming during summer bnu 2 2 c or even autumn hadgem 2 6 c on the other hand all gcms agree with the lowest warming in spring ranging from 1 1 c to 1 6 c unlike the rcms the gcms project high variability in terms of precipitation totals the three models bnu ipsl and hadgem show decreases in annual precipitation by 1 or 2 while the two models mri and cnrm indicate increases of 4 and 9 respectively the cnrm model shows precipitation increases across all seasons except for bnu all models project an increase in winter precipitation between 5 1 and 10 0 three models show a decrease in precipitation during autumn and two models always indicate about 6 decrease in precipitation during spring and summer months one model shows no change and remaining two indicate increase of about 5 7 of the baseline precipitation 3 5 impact of climate change on agricultural drought for agricultural drought fig 6 shows its changes with respect to the changing climate simulated by rcms and gcms and to the sensitivity of the duration and spatial extent of the drought with regard to awc under all projections climate change leads to an increased duration of drought episodes as well as their spatial extent the results of all models used show a coherent tendency to increased areas hit by agricultural drought additionally the duration and extent of the ten most severe droughts is increasing indicating not only an increase in the overall drought occurrence but also in its intensity the soil awc 40 scenario should not only shorten the mean duration of agricultural drought but also markedly limit the duration of the ten longest drought episodes and limit their areal extent while increasing soil awc would especially influence the most pronounced drought episodes during 1956 2015 the awc 40 should significantly prolong the duration and area affected by drought in general and the top ten droughts should be markedly more severe while understanding past droughts and the awc role is critically important fig 6 provides a clear indication that awc values are even more important for assessments of future agricultural drought impacts for awc 0 the mean duration of drought events would significantly increase according to four of the five rcms and three out of the five gcms and the areal extent would increase according to all of them the extent and duration of the ten worst events would increase almost twofold the situation with soil awc 40 would be much worse for example as a result of continuing large scale degradation while the climate signal would still be dominant the decreased ability of soil to hold water would result in drought episodes that would be twice as long and twice as large than those in the recent period on the other hand increased soil awc could at least according to three out of the five rcms more or less maintain the current agricultural drought severity and duration similar outcomes were derived from the five gcms fig 6 which showed considerable benefit of increased soil awc on maintaining the spatial extent and duration of future droughts within the order of intensity of the recent droughts however in the case of the top ten drought events even such an increase in awc would not be enough to prevent a significant increase in the drought extent and duration the beneficial effect of increased awc stems from the increased precipitation totals during the winter half year october march that can be stored for the following part of the year later part of the season while the increasing awc seems to be critical for controlling future droughts it would not be enough to prevent increased drought damage in the case of the most severe droughts 3 6 impact of climate change on hydrological drought for hydrological drought fig 7 shows the relation between hydrological drought length and the available water resources in contrast to agricultural drought the rcm signal has only a weak impact on the hydrological drought duration and available water resources but one projection showed even a considerable decrease in drought duration and increase in available water resources in the case of the gcm simulations all consistently indicated a decrease in available water resources and an increase in drought duration the soil awc perturbations have only limited effects on the overall mean duration of drought and the available water resources in the rcm simulations this result is likely due to increasing precipitation which is projected by all rcms leading to increasing direct and hypodermic runoff and sustaining reservoir storage this is not the case for the gcm simulations showing a considerable decrease in available water resources and an increase in drought duration for the improved and reduced soil awc respectively due to limited precipitation for the ten worst hydrological drought events the inverse proportionality between soil awc and available water resources is clear in all rcm and gcm simulations and is more pronounced than for the overall mean characteristics however the signal is again weaker for the rcm simulations than for the gcm simulations while the variation in drought duration due to soil awc perturbations is up to 0 5 rcm simulations and 1 gcm simulations months for the overall mean for the ten worst events these values are 1 5 rcm and 2 gcm months the changes in estimated available water resources show similar patterns of variation the awc 40 scenario effect on maximum and mean deficits is 50 80 of the shifts caused by the changing climate in the case of simulations showing an increase in deficit this result means that the efficiency of any measure compensating for the decrease in available water resources will need to carefully consider any major changes in the awc of the basins 3 7 changes in the dynamics of agricultural and hydrological droughts from 2021 2080 the temporal dynamics of the projected area that could be affected by agricultural drought are demonstrated in fig 8 based on rcms and supplement fig 2 based on the gcms the mean area which is based on the rcm simulations affected by water contents below 50 of the awc indicating drought stress onset and by the presence of pronounced water stress for plants relative saturation of the soil below 30 of awc exhibits statistically significant increases for the entire year particularly for july september the decadal trends double and are pronounced for april june when the future climate is directly projected by gcms supplement fig 2 the mentioned figures also show how the scenario of a stepwise increase in the awc would affect drought frequencies after 2020 improvements to the soil awc by 0 5 or even 1 0 per year would not be enough to counter the overall climate driven trend and would only moderate the extent of the area affected by drought however especially in seasons when agricultural drought follows after a relatively wet period the effect and benefit of improved awc on mitigating agricultural drought would be considerable fig 9 shows the temporal distribution of the area affected by hydrological drought according to rcm and gcm simulations there is a difference in the hydrological drought response between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance fig 1c i e areas where eto exceeds precipitation negative balance and where it is opposite positive balance with a positive balance the runoff and drought characteristics are mostly controlled by available precipitation this control is reflected by the considerable temporal and spatial variability in the area under drought and drought severity in such regions 3 5 of catchments are under drought the most severe droughts cover 20 25 of catchments and usually at least some of the catchments are under drought for most of the years 95 99 in areas with a positive balance runoff is strongly affected by eto and therefore the variability in drought is much smaller although the catchments are naturally dry hydrological drought occurs less frequently 70 80 for rcms and gcms on average 1 3 of the area is under drought each year for extreme droughts the fraction increases to 18 23 figs 8 and 9 taken together indicate that increasing soil awc should decrease the frequency and likely also impact of agricultural drought compared to the baseline soil awc especially during april june improvement is primarily driven by an increased ability to store water from winter precipitation as predicted by some of the climate models hydrological drought in the cr becomes more pronounced with increasing awc particularly in catchments with negative climatic water balance on the other hand strengthening the soil awc in regions with a positive water balance leads to only marginal worsening of the hydrological droughts this result indicates that the adaptation measures need to have different priorities according to the regional specifics to sumarize we have found differences in the hydrological drought response between areas with annual precipitation total exceeding reference evapotranspiration and those where precipitation is lower than eto in the former the water resources are limited by available precipitation this situation leads to considerable spatial and temporal variation in the area under drought with drought being experienced in some of the catchments every year for the basins where the reference evapotranspiration does not exceed total precipitation there are years completely without drought these basins are then more sensitive to soil awc perturbations especially in combination with strong climate forcing i e gcm simulations 4 discussion the absence of a general definition of drought led to the development of drought types specified according to their related impacts and various methods of drought quantification both hydrological and agricultural droughts show good correlation but hydrological droughts lagged behind agricultural droughts by two months on average while agricultural drought is characterized by high sensitivity to precipitation in case of the delimitation of the beginning and end of agricultural drought the decrease in precipitation is not immediately reflected in runoff and hence in the onset of hydrological drought wu et al 2016 showed similar findings with the time lag of the end of hydrological drought reaching at least six months the close relationships between agricultural and hydrological droughts were pointed out by vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 in their evaluation of drought characteristics in a semiarid region poor agricultural drought conditions were associated with the regions with high flow rates according to these authors indicating an inverse relationship between these two drought types which agrees with the findings of our study the results presented in this study indicate that the enhancement of soil awc can be considered a key factor in reducing vulnerability to agricultural drought for example this result was also found by wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 who included soil awc among four key factors in their drought vulnerability index for nebraska us the high vulnerability class included non irrigated cropland and rangeland on sandy soils located in regions with a very high probability of deficiency in seasonal crop moisture similarly wu et al 2011 showed that regions with high awc were characterized by a low degree of vulnerability to agricultural drought while areas with low awc showed higher drought vulnerability the role of soil awc increases if crop growth depends at least partly on the soil water accumulated during the period preceding the vegetation season this is the case for not only the cr but also the agriculture in temperate zones in general e g fischer et al 2012 trnka et al 2013 therefore attempts focusing on increasing soil awc and soil retention of the landscape seem to be obvious solutions to drought mitigation however as indicated in fig 7 the effect of changing the soil awc on hydrological drought is opposite to the effects on agricultural drought fig 6 when the results of our study are expressed in absolute numbers the mean maximum deficit per basin in 1956 2015 corresponds to 1 56 109 m3 of water for awc 40 1 13 109 m3 for awc 0 and 0 97 109 m3 for awc 40 this result means that the czech republic would need to build additional reservoirs with a total volume of c 430 mil m3 to compensate the runoff deficit due to improved soil retention this volume is more than the available storage volume of the largest reservoir orl√≠k on the river vltava in the cr 340 mil m3 this result was also reported by mahe et al 2005 who investigated the possible role of land use change on soil awc in producing the counterintuitive change in runoff regime in west africa since 1970 despite the reduction in annual rainfall and the increase in reservoir storage and the number of dams in the basin and agricultural areas the mean runoff and maximum daily discharges increased indicating lowering awc the model simulation was improved markedly by using the time varying values of soil awc and by accounting factors that lead to decreasing the general capacity to slow water runoff reduction in natural vegetation and increase in bare soil areas and this finding is in agreement with our results of hydrological model calibration for the period 1956 2015 when we introduced slowly decreasing awc value mimicking observed agricultural land degradation especially between 1956 and 2015 the modelling cascade responded by improved results compared to observed river discharges and lake levels our study does not explicitly consider possible soil atmosphere feedbacks increased awc water content and evaporation which increase the water vapor content in the atmosphere can enhance precipitation sch√§r et al 1999 showed that the enhancement of the hydrological cycle over europe is to some degree associated with the existing soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism they suggested that the soil moisture precipitation feedback must rely on some direct and indirect mechanism in which wet soils increase the efficiency of the convective precipitation process in most areas the maximum recycling ratio i e proportion of precipitation originating from the same river basin to the total rainfall over the basin occurs in summer sch√§r et al 1999 bisselink and dolman 2008 for example in the inland iberian peninsula the annual precipitation cycle often exhibits a significant peak in may when the evapotranspiration of moisture stored in soil after the winter accelerates and the enhanced instability induced by wet soil leads to the triggering of soil precipitation feedback with increasing rainfall rios entenza and miguez macho 2014 daniels et al 2015 showed that land use and land cover also strongly influence the precipitation recycling ratio suggesting that precipitation is enhanced over wet soils and reduced over dry soils or urban areas this finding supports the results by harding and snyder 2012 that evapotranspiration increased by c 4 and precipitation increased by 1 in irrigated fields the key role of soil moisture and soil awc in the modulation of climate over central europe especially by the severity of heat waves has also been shown by seneviratne et al 2006 and manning et al 2018 while the above findings indicate plausible mechanisms of soil atmosphere feedback the estimated moisture recycling ratios for central europe are approximately 0 1 i e 10 of regional evaporation contributes to rainfall over the same region even if large regions are considered and the ratio decreases with decreasing area bisselink and dolman 2008 keune and miralles 2019 however bisselink and dolman 2009 report increased significance of local evaporation in dry years which was not necessarily due to the fraction of rainfall originating from local evaporation but rather due to the considerable contribution to instability of the atmosphere and thus the triggering of precipitation this means that allowing for increased awc i e soil water storage enables modulation of agricultural and in particular hydrological droughts see figs 6 and 7 and this effect can be further strengthened by soil atmosphere feedback however this effect cannot be overestimated because evaporation from a particular basin mostly supplies moisture to basins downwind rather than those where the moisture originated keune and miralles 2019 an increase in the probability of soil moisture depletion and prolonged events of agricultural drought across much of europe has been found by many studies e g trnka et al 2015 samaniego et al 2018 grillakis 2019 in which central europe has been considered a region where a considerable increase in severe drought events is likely e g eitzinger et al 2013 ≈°tƒõp√°nek et al 2016 this finding was considered a major threat to the agricultural productivity of the whole region and has been an issue of continuous concern on the other hand in terms of hydrological droughts central europe has not been considered particularly affected e g gosling et al 2017 marx et al 2018 however the cr represents a sandwiched region between central and western europe where no change in low flows is predicted and southern europe where a marked increase in the severity of hydrological droughts is expected e g marx et al 2018 for example the results of marx et al 2018 indicate that the southeastern part of the cr belongs to regions where the shift towards a major decrease in river flows is likely and pronounced under high end scenarios due to the increasing frequency and severity of drought episodes caused by climate change it is necessary to reduce drought vulnerability and prepare suitable adaptation strategies for drought mitigation and preparedness wilhite et al 2014 iglesias and garrote 2015 the findings of this study highlight that agricultural drought mitigation measures that would lead to an increase in soil awc would inevitably result in an increased frequency of low flows i e hydrological drought these findings need to be communicated to decision makers in the government and to public stakeholders at the same time expert opinion in this respect should consider the uncertainties and interdependencies between the hydrological and agricultural aspects of drought taylor et al 2013 leng et al 2015 nam et al 2015 different tendencies of agricultural and hydrological droughts under future climate conditions have been raised for example by wang et al 2011 and duan and mei 2014 both studies concluded that indicators of agricultural droughts and to some extent hydrological droughts are more sensitive than the standardized precipitation index vicente serrano et al 2012 which is frequently used as an indicator of meteorological drought however the majority of the studies covering different drought types e g wang et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2012 duan and mei 2014 wu et al 2016 used fairly simple indicators of drought or their more elaborate concepts such as the aggregated drought index adi which considers three levels of drought from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural by keyantash and dracup 2004 or the multivariate drought index mdi by rajsekhar et al 2015 a more process oriented approach has been used that applies swat models e g tao et al 2003 xie and eheart 2003 narasimhan et al 2005 srinivasan et al 2010 in which some required data had to be replaced by proxies mostly based on remotely sensed data in some cases the proper calibration of the models was limited by a lack of observed data nevertheless the process based models showed quite satisfactory predictions of water and crop yield during dry years as cited by the modeling studies the presented study required several simplifications of real world processes given the data availability as well as computational resources most likely the most relevant simplification which may affect the analysis outcomes for future climate conditions is connected to the daily time step used in agricultural drought modeling and the monthly time step used in hydrological drought modeling as well as using the same land use patterns clc2006 for the entire study period assessment of the water balance at the daily time step does not account for changes in the separation of precipitation into direct runoff and infiltration over short time scales the positive trend in the intensity of rainfall events and negative trend in their duration at sub daily scales have already been detected for the area of the cr by hanel et al 2016 the climate model simulations are generally consistent with these trends svoboda et al 2016 this result suggests that the infiltration ability and thus the soil retention over the basins can be in fact lower singh 1997 than those estimated by daily models quantification of these effects is however beyond the scope of our study in which we assumed that the land use patterns have not changed significantly for the awc sensitivity tests this shortcoming should be analyzed in future studies because recent analyses of land use patterns have shown that such effects are not negligible particularly for hydrological drought van loon and laaha 2015 ahn and merwade 2017 5 conclusions our results based on the country wide example demonstrate the relationship between soil and surface water storage where an increase in the former leads to a decrease in the latter therefore the research hypothesis is rejected in other words if the compensation measures for the effects of agricultural and hydrological drought rely on the same water resources such as basin precipitation then they should not be designed separately to optimize the benefits and minimize potential conflicts this result indicates that if the current attempts to increase the overall soil awc are successful then the agricultural drought severity and duration would indeed be partly alleviated however even if the soil awc would increase by 40 which would require massive long term efforts the climate signal would still significantly increase the duration and extent of the area affected by agricultural drought in the same time substantial efforts and costs would be required to compensate for the surface water deficit and prevent increase in the severity and probability of hydrological droughts our study clearly shows not only the need for joint design of adaptation measures against agricultural and hydrological droughts but also need carefully communicate to policy and decision makers the relatively limited effect of improving soil water holding properties in drought mitigation efforts the results also demonstrate that the impact of changing soil awc or otherwise increasing retention in the landscape leads to nontrivial interactions between agricultural and hydrological drought frequency with both types of droughts showing not only different sensitivities to the increase in the soil awc but also opposite directions of change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9600,the close relationship between the onset and severity of agricultural and hydrological drought is considered self evident yet relatively few studies have addressed the effects of applying agricultural drought adaptation to hydrological drought characteristics the present study applies a model cascade capable of simultaneously considering the interactions between agricultural and hydrological droughts the study area covers all river basins in the czech republic and includes the periods of 1956 2015 baseline and 2021 2080 future the model cascade was shown to explain 91 of the variability in the seasonal and annual accumulated runoff and allows for the analysis of increasing maintaining decreasing available water capacity awc across the 133 defined basins with a total area of c 78 000 km2 the study reports that the probability and extent of agricultural drought increased over the entire period with higher awc scenario showing slower pace of such increase especially from april to june the trends in the extent or severity of hydrological droughts were of low magnitude the future climate has been projected through the use of ensembles of five global cmip5 and five regional euro cordex climate models the results showed a significant increase in the duration of agricultural drought stress and in the area affected throughout the year particularly in july september the hydrological drought response showed a marked difference between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance i e areas where long term reference evapotranspiration exceeds long term precipitation negative climatic water balance and where it does not positive climatic water balance the overall results indicate that increasing soil awc would decrease the frequency and likely also impact of future agricultural droughts especially during spring this result would be especially true if the wetter winters predicted by some of the models materialized hydrological droughts at the country level are estimated to become more pronounced with increasing awc particularly in catchments with a negative climatic water balance keywords agricultural drought hydrological drought climate

is considered a multifaceted phenomenon e g wilhite and pulwarty 2017 compared to hazards such as floods drought tends to occur less frequently but when it does occur it generally affects a broad

forest and water resources across much of central europe e g european drought observatory https www copernicus eu en european drought observatory edo 2021 meteorological drought originates from a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time and can result in impacts within weeks in the case of agricultural drought or within longer time periods in the case of hydrological drought e g br√°zdil and trnka 2015 van loon 2015 wilhite and pulwarty 2017 the deficiency can result in water shortages for some activities groups or environmental sectors e g blauhut et al 2016 in this study we understand agricultural droughts as a deficit of soil moisture mostly in the root zone reducing the supply of moisture to vegetation similar to soil moisture drought as understood e g by van loon 2015 as hydrological drought we understand negative anomalies in surface and subsurface water flow and storage that result into below normal groundwater levels or water levels in lakes declining wetland area and decreased river discharge in recent years severe drought events with different degrees of intensity affected more than 800 000 km2 of the eu s territory 37 and at least 100 million inhabitants 20 the eu countries austria belgium the czech republic cyprus finland france germany hungary italy lithuania malta the netherlands norway portugal spain and the united kingdom have been hit with the economic impacts of drought with estimated losses of 60 billion euros over the 1980 2017 period ec 2018 the single most damaging drought and heat event across eu countries was the summer

states the water shortage in europe is an important problem in many regions vogt and somma 2000 and estimates for the 21st century show increasing drought occurrence and severity across most of the european continent e g samaniego et al 2018 grillakis 2019 including central europe e g dai 2013 trnka et al 2013 the first sector affected by drought is usually agriculture which is particularly sensitive to changes in drought occurrence during the early growing season i e april june in central europe hlavinka et al 2009 this is crucial for both the productivity of managed ecosystems e g rain fed field crops and the net primary production of ecosystems as a whole this period was usually wet due to snow melt saturating the soil profile just prior to the beginning of the growing season this condition allowed for the maximum use of the soil storage capacity in the following months and provided vegetation with significant reserve buffering for the naturally high rain variability however this is no longer the case due to both the observed and expected decline in snow cover trnka et al 2011 coupled with a marked decrease in the soil water holding capacity during recent years e g trnka et al 2016a in particular the latter process has intensified the impact of the increasing frequency of meteorological droughts trnka et al 2016b the increases in temperature solar radiation water vapor pressure deficit and stagnating precipitation trnka et al 2015 have contributed to the drying of the soil across the czech republic at the same time the soil available water capacity awc decreased due to chronic erosion and soil compaction exacerbating the problems caused by climatic trends trnka et al 2016a this phenomenon could help explain the marked increase in the sensitivity of agriculture to drought observed over the past century e g trnka et al 2012 2016c and is a reason for concerns for the coming decades due to the expected increasing frequency of droughts e g hanel et al 2012 hanel and vizina 2013 trnka et al 2013 as a result efforts to restore the awc of agricultural soils have been initiated to at least partly alleviate the problem of agricultural drought changing the water holding capacity and retaining water to be evaporated by or transpired through agricultural crops might however significantly alter other elements of the landscape water balance existing studies in a number of catchments in central europe project relatively small annual changes in the reference evapotranspiration eto and the precipitation despite considerable changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation and overall increase in eto this situation corresponds to high impact scenarios e g hanel et al 2012 2013a this finding suggests that increasing of water accumulation capacity is the best adaptation strategy to maintain sufficient river flow as it could store excess water from generally wet winter months for summer when water availability is decreasing any formulation of the national policies aimed at mitigating agricultural and hydrological droughts should consider key processes in both the soil profiles as well as the surface and underground reservoirs the need for such integrated analysis was pointed out in a recent survey and was indicated as priority research by trnka et al 2018 this study aims to test the hypothesis that increasing the soil water holding capacity will enhance landscape resilience to agricultural drought without making worse the frequency duration and area affected by the hydrological droughts in this paper we i introduce modelling cascade simultaneously considering agricultural and hydrological drought ii test the new tool during the 1956 2015 baseline period iii use a bias corrected ensemble of regional climate models rcms and global climate models gcms to estimate the consequences of mitigating agricultural drought via increased soil water holding capacity on the future frequency and severity of hydrological droughts and finally iv test the initial hypothesis defined above 2 data and methods 2 1 meteorological data daily precipitation temperature sunshine duration global radiation air humidity and wind speed data from 268 climatological and 787 rain gauge stations over the czech republic cr were quality controlled and homogenized for the 1956 2015 period the daily data were interpolated by the regression kriging method using geographical coordinates elevation and other terrain characteristics as predictors in the cr the mean minimal distance between two neighboring stations is approximately 17 km for the elements measured at climatological stations and approximately 10 km for rain gauges fig 1 the daily global radiation balance accounts for the slope aspect and horizon obstruction using the methodology proposed and tested by schaumberger 2005 2 2 soil moisture the soil moisture content expressed as relative available water awr was estimated using the soilclim model hlavinka et al 2011 which is principally based on the modeling approach suggested by allen et al 1998 awr values were constrained by the wilting point i e water content at 1500 kpa suction pressure awr 0 and field capacity i e water content at 33 kpa suction pressure awr 1 the soilclim model was applied for each 500 m x 500 m grid and accounted not only for the maximum awc within the grid but also for the type of vegetation cover phenology development root growth or snow cover accumulation melting trnka et al 2010 the module for actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content estimates considers two soil layers the topsoil layer from the ground surface to 0 4 m depth and the subsoil layer between 0 41 and 1 0 m the cascading approach for transferring water from the topsoil to subsoil layers is used when the topsoil is more than 50 saturated in the case of higher than 50 saturation in the topsoil seepage to the subsoil is allowed mimicking macropores and preferential water transport hlavinka et al 2011 the soilclim estimates of the soil moisture content are affected by awc for both soil layers in each grid the awc value was estimated through a combination of digital soil maps and detailed soil physics data from 1073 soil pits collected by the czech national soil survey more details in trnka et al 2015 the awc was calculated assuming a 1 0 m soil profile unless the soil database indicated a shallower soil depth the topsoil 0 0 4 m and subsoil 0 41 1 0 m or maximum rooting depth when it was shallow layers had their properties defined separately based on the available soil data in addition grids in which at least some part of the vegetation season was influenced by high underground water tables that are likely to be reached by roots for natural subsurface irrigation and therefore respond to drought differently in terms of both the stress magnitude and timing were compared to other grids the soils with an observed gleyic process which were within close proximity and at the same altitude to water bodies and peat and bog areas had their soil moisture depletion rate slowed significantly compared to neighboring grids without such influence trnka et al 2015 soilclim has dynamically simulated vegetation cover that changes the parameters of the canopy e g root depth or crop height during the vegetation season based on the thermal time and vernalization requirement in case of winter crops and perennials therefore the crop parameter kc allen et al 1998 as well as root growth dynamics vary for individual vegetation covers and throughout the year or growing season to account for the seasonally changing crop cover composition on grids of arable land which dominate the landscape a fixed proportion of crops on each arable grid was considered in these grids the soil moisture contents using spring and winter c3 crops based on present spring barley and winter wheat cultivars and spring c4 crops maize were calculated and then averaged for the three considered crops the information about the land cover relied on the corine land cover clc2006 100 m product version 12 2009 the following proportion of the individual land use classes was found for the cr territory i arable land 46 2 ii permanent grasslands 7 6 iii conifer forest 20 3 iv deciduous forest 3 1 v mixed forests 6 0 and vi other agricultural areas 8 7 areas where no realistic soilclim calculation was possible i e urbanized areas 7 0 and water bodies 1 1 were still considered by the bilan hydrological model through a simplified internal procedure the land use cover was considered static over the analyzed period as our study focuses on agricultural and hydrological drought interactions 2 3 hydrological balance hydrological balance was assessed by the bilan conceptual hydrological model van lanen et al 2004 vizina et al 2015 this model has been widely used in the cr for evaluation of water balance with monitoring applications by the czech hydrometeorological institute chmi and for assessment of climate change impacts e g hanel et al 2012 2013b the structure of the model is defined by a system of relationships describing the basic principles of water balance in the hydrological basin in the aeration zone for calibration of the key model parameters a runoff series at the outlet of the basin was used for calibration of the bilan hydrological model we used a database on observed monthly runoff and water use maintained by the t g masaryk water research institute that contained records for 631 hydrologic stations over the 1961 2015 period in addition to total runoff the model simulates soil and ground water storage and snow water equivalent the bilan model has been calibrated with a focus on the reproduction of drought characteristics moreover the available soil moisture content simulated by the soilclim model having spatially distributed soil parameters was also considered within the calibration i e the awc of the bilan model was forced to mimic the variation in the soil water content from the soilclim model the bilan model was set up for 133 basins with areas ranging from 620 to 1925 km2 covering the cr see fig 1 2 4 water balance of reservoirs and available water resources the balance of reservoirs was simulated by the wateres model available as an r package at https github com tgmwri wateres wateres 2021 which simulates the balance of individual reservoirs and reservoir networks in daily time steps and provides reservoir performance characteristics yield reliability deficit volume etc the balance is calculated considering the reported water use together with the estimated runoff precipitation and evaporation from the water surface of the reservoirs which are shown in fig 1a in the cr water use exceeding 500 m3 month or 6000 m3 year has to be approved and reported to the water authority and all water uses above these thresholds were considered in the study 2 5 drought definition and statistical analysis agricultural drought is defined for the purposes of this study as conditions that cause adverse crop responses because plants usually cannot meet reference transpiration as a result of too high atmospheric demands and or limited soil moisture the decrease in transpiration occurs whenever the available water within reach of the roots is not freely available i e whenever readily available water becomes scarce in the soil the readily available water represents approximately half of the awc allen et al 1998 therefore the moment when the awr reached or dropped below 0 5 was considered the onset of agricultural drought agricultural drought ends when awr increases above this threshold we also considered drought duration as the number of days when awr 0 5 hydrological drought is defined by considering a threshold level through the so called deficit index tallaksen and van lanen 2004 van loon 2015 a drought event starts when the index drops below a threshold here the minimum residual flow as defined in the decree of the ministry of environment of the cr and ends when it rises above the threshold the deficit index for an event also called deficit volume representing drought severity equals a cumulative deviation from the threshold the number of months for which the runoff does not reach the minimum residual flow is considered the drought duration the mann kendall test was used to determine if the slope of the estimated linear regression line was different from zero hirsch et al 1982 with the p value provided the statistical analysis has been done

greenhouse gas emission scenarios from representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 from all available euro cordex simulations we chose the following five gcm rcm pairs that were

availability of the euro cordex data within the time of preparation of this study and by the effort to capture a variety of the different rcms and their driving gcms all climate model simulations were subject to bias correction by applying the distribution adjusting by percentiles dap method ≈°tƒõp√°nek et al 2016 this method relies on the quantile mapping bias correction approach the chmi dataset of 787 stations with daily precipitation observations and 268 stations with daily air temperature humidity and wind speed observations within the 1981 2010 period was used for bias correction as a part of the dap method the rcm data from the several nearest grids were first recalculated into station locations and then the bias correction itself was performed on the daily data within the 1981 2005 period in addition five gcms were considered through the delta approach method as used by trnka et al 2016a and were applied to obtain daily data for each 500 m x 500 m grid for future climate

environment model uk these models were selected from 40 climate models available in the cmip5 database taylor et al 2012 we followed the methodology developed by dubrovsky et al 2015 and used the rcp4 5 and a climatic sensitivity of 3 0 c 2 7 scenarios of soil water holding capacity in addition to the climate change scenarios we introduced perturbations in the parameters influencing the soil awc within the soilclim simulation and bilan models we considered scenarios where the soil awc remained constant at the baseline levels awc 0 and improved or reduced by 40 awc 40 and awc 40 respectively and varied with a 7 reduction in soil awc per decade awc 7 the awc 0 value of water holding capacity was based on the national soil survey and corresponds to the awc in the early 1970 s as a more recent national survey has not been carried out therefore we used a 7 reduction in awc per decade as an approximation of the deterioration of the soil awc in the cr through a combination of soil erosion soil compaction and loss of organic matter ≈°arapatka and bedn√°≈ô 2015 this decrease in awc is only an approximation but it has been occurring at a faster pace since the 1960 s than that in neighboring countries such as austria dev√°t√Ω et al 2019 the selection of the lower limits of the awc change i e 40 was based on the estimated decrease in the awc from the observed data from the cr caused by soil erosion compaction and loss of soil structure and organic matter e g vopravil 2009 vopravil 2011 over the past 50 years on the other hand the increase in the awc by 40 over the baseline value is considered to be the theoretical upper limit that could theoretically be achieved by considerable and long term efforts that completely change the soil management crop and landscape structure these efforts would constitute i adjusting tillage to improve infiltration and soil structure e g blanco canqui and ruis 2018 ii introducing no till practices while building up layers of organic mulch from intercrops and or using intercrops but also extensive use of soil amendments such as biochar the latter approach was found to be capable of significantly boosting awc values e g yu et al 2013 while the debate still continues if extensive biochar introduction is realistic e g atkinson 2018 3 results 3 1 validation of soilclim and bilan models fig 2 shows the mean annual runoff over all basins analyzed for the observed data 1981 2015 and data simulated by the bilan model 1956 2017 soil moisture in the bilan model was provided by the soilclim simulations at 500 m x 500 m grids overall the bilan model was able to explain more than 90 of the seasonal and annual variability in runoff in comparison with the observed data the minimum annual runoff corresponded to c 120 mm while the maxima exceeded 330 mm and the model was able to capture these large fluctuations well fig 2 also demonstrates the simulation results for awc 40 and awc 40 an increase in awc leads to decreased runoff and vice versa 3 2 trends in agricultural drought during the 1956 2015 period there is a general increase in the area with the soil water content below 50 of the awc fig 3 and in the area with the soil water content swc below the significant water stress threshold i e 30 of awc supplement fig 1 especially in the low pass filter charts the increase in swc during the 1956 2015 period is statistically significant p 0 05 for april june for all considered awc alternatives fig 3c d this increase is particularly pronounced when soil awc is decreased by 40 or when the gradually decreasing awc emulating soil degradation is considered however even if the soil awc would increase by 40 the climate signal is sufficient to significantly increase the duration and extent of the area affected by agricultural drought this means that the climate signal may outweigh even very ambitious soil retention improvement programs the positive effect of high awc is most pronounced during years with normal or above normal precipitation as this allows for the accumulation of the water reserves in the soil typically prior to the peak of the vegetation season i e during winter and early spring in the awc 40 scenario the soil water accumulated over winter can last longer and reduce the area affected by drought especially during april june the differences among soil awc scenarios are smallest during dry years for july september e g 2003 or 2015 as the reserves of the soil moisture are already depleted prior to drought even in soils with high awc on the other hand the highly positive effect of soil awc can be illustrated for early season droughts e g 2000 or 2012 for which increased soil awc can significantly decrease the extent of drought events the awc 40 scenario strengthens the impact of the climate signal first the decreased awc markedly worsens the impact of drought in april june fig 3c d but also notably increases the affected area in july september fig 3e f in line with that the decreased awc also considerably increases the area affected by drought stress supplement fig 1 during both april june and july september 3 3 trends in hydrological drought during the 1956 2015 period the perturbations in the soil awc exhibit an opposite effect on runoff fig 2 as well as on other hydrological drought characteristics fig 4 compared to their effects on agricultural drought in general there is a negative non significant trend in runoff 2 29 mm decade over the 1956 2015 period the awc 40 scenario leads to a steep overall decrease in runoff while the awc 40 scenario leads to a reduction in the negative trend the trends in drought duration and area affected increase for april october but statistically significant trends are observed in only june the available water resources decrease for april september but the decrease is statistically significant for only june and august this condition may negatively influence for example the availability of water for irrigation soil awc also has a significant impact on drought characteristics in particular the most severe droughts e g 1973 1991 and 2015 are on average 0 64 months longer for awc 40 and 0 77 months shorter for awc 40 as can be deduced from fig 6 in addition the area affected by hydrological drought increases with increasing soil awc and vice versa in the case of april june awc 40 caused almost doubling of the drought affected area while awc 40 decreased to approximately one half compared to awc 0 fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of mean annual runoff for the cr for constant and perturbed awcs there are two large areas fig 5c with low runoff south moravia runoff 50 mm and northwest bohemia runoff 75 mm the runoff coefficient ratio of runoff to precipitation in these areas ranges from 0 08 to 0 15 according to the bilan model simulation these areas are the most sensitive to soil awc perturbations the awc 40 leads to an increase in runoff on the order of tens of millimeters while the awc 40 results in a further decrease in the already low runoff the effect of the awc 40 scenario can be attributed to an increase in actual evapotranspiration in the investigated basins 3 4 climate conditions for the 2021 2080 period according to five rcms the mean temperature between the 1981 2010 and 2021 2080 periods should increase by 1 5 c the highest warming of 2 0 c is projected by mohc hadgem2 es rca4 and the lowest warming of 0 9 c is projected by mpi esm lr clm4 8 17 the cnrm cm5 aladin53 and mohc hadgem2 es rca4 models indicate the highest temperature increase in winter 2 0 2 7 c in contrast the ec earth model shows the highest positive change in spring 1 8 2 1 c and the mpi esm lr clm4 8 17 model shows the highest positive change in summer 1 3 c the precipitation will increase by approximately 10 for the whole 2021 2080 period compared to the reference 1981 2010 period according to five rcms but they provide very different results the cnrm cm5 aladin53 and mohc hadgem2 es rca4 models project the highest precipitation increases 15 4 and 13 4 respectively while the ec earth racmo22e model predicts an increase of only approximately 3 5 a remarkable increase in precipitation is indicated especially for spring 14 5 and winter 12 8 the summer precipitation should be nearly the same as that in the current climate according to most models only cnrm cm5 aladin53 provides much higher totals when the projections based on five gcms are considered the results are slightly different from the rcm simulations the increase in the annual mean temperatures in the 2021 2080 period compared to the baseline period is expected to be 1 8 c and ranges from 1 4 c mri model to 2 1 c hadgem model while the cnrm ipsl and mri models predict the largest warming in winter ranging from 1 7 c mri to 2 7 c cnrm the remaining two gcms indicate the largest warming during summer bnu 2 2 c or even autumn hadgem 2 6 c on the other hand all gcms agree with the lowest warming in spring ranging from 1 1 c to 1 6 c unlike the rcms the gcms project high variability in terms of precipitation totals the three models bnu ipsl and hadgem show decreases in annual precipitation by 1 or 2 while the two models mri and cnrm indicate increases of 4 and 9 respectively the cnrm model shows precipitation increases across all seasons except for bnu all models project an increase in winter precipitation between 5 1 and 10 0 three models show a decrease in precipitation during autumn and two models always indicate about 6 decrease in precipitation during spring and summer months one model shows no change and remaining two indicate increase of about 5 7 of the baseline precipitation 3 5 impact of climate change on agricultural drought for agricultural drought fig 6 shows its changes with respect to the changing climate simulated by rcms and gcms and to the sensitivity of the duration and spatial extent of the drought with regard to awc under all projections climate change leads to an increased duration of drought episodes as well as their spatial extent the results of all models used show a coherent tendency to increased areas hit by agricultural drought additionally the duration and extent of the ten most severe droughts is increasing indicating not only an increase in the overall drought occurrence but also in its intensity the soil awc 40 scenario should not only shorten the mean duration of agricultural drought but also markedly limit the duration of the ten longest drought episodes and limit their areal extent while increasing soil awc would especially influence the most pronounced drought episodes during 1956 2015 the awc 40 should significantly prolong the duration and area affected by drought in general and the top ten droughts should be markedly more severe while understanding past droughts and the awc role is critically important fig 6 provides a clear indication that awc values are even more important for assessments of future agricultural drought impacts for awc 0 the mean duration of drought events would significantly increase according to four of the five rcms and three out of the five gcms and the areal extent would increase according to all of them the extent and duration of the ten worst events would increase almost twofold the situation with soil awc 40 would be much worse for example as a result of continuing large scale degradation while the climate signal would still be dominant the decreased ability of soil to hold water would result in drought episodes that would be twice as long and twice as large than those in the recent period on the other hand increased soil awc could at least according to three out of the five rcms more or less maintain the current agricultural drought severity and duration similar outcomes were derived from the five gcms fig 6 which showed considerable benefit of increased soil awc on maintaining the spatial extent and duration of future droughts within the order of intensity of the recent droughts however in the case of the top ten drought events even such an increase in awc would not be enough to prevent a significant increase in the drought extent and duration the beneficial effect of increased awc stems from the increased precipitation totals during the winter half year october march that can be stored for the following part of the year later part of the season while the increasing awc seems to be critical for controlling future droughts it would not be enough to prevent increased drought damage in the case of the most severe droughts 3 6 impact of climate change on hydrological drought for hydrological drought fig 7 shows the relation between hydrological drought length and the available water resources in contrast to agricultural drought the rcm signal has only a weak impact on the hydrological drought duration and available water resources but one projection showed even a considerable decrease in drought duration and increase in available water resources in the case of the gcm simulations all consistently indicated a decrease in available water resources and an increase in drought duration the soil awc perturbations have only limited effects on the overall mean duration of drought and the available water resources in the rcm simulations this result is likely due to increasing precipitation which is projected by all rcms leading to increasing direct and hypodermic runoff and sustaining reservoir storage this is not the case for the gcm simulations showing a considerable decrease in available water resources and an increase in drought duration for the improved and reduced soil awc respectively due to limited precipitation for the ten worst hydrological drought events the inverse proportionality between soil awc and available water resources is clear in all rcm and gcm simulations and is more pronounced than for the overall mean characteristics however the signal is again weaker for the rcm simulations than for the gcm simulations while the variation in drought duration due to soil awc perturbations is up to 0 5 rcm simulations and 1 gcm simulations months for the overall mean for the ten worst events these values are 1 5 rcm and 2 gcm months the changes in estimated available water resources show similar patterns of variation the awc 40 scenario effect on maximum and mean deficits is 50 80 of the shifts caused by the changing climate in the case of simulations showing an increase in deficit this result means that the efficiency of any measure compensating for the decrease in available water resources will need to carefully consider any major changes in the awc of the basins 3 7 changes in the dynamics of agricultural and hydrological droughts from 2021 2080 the temporal dynamics of the projected area that could be affected by agricultural drought are demonstrated in fig 8 based on rcms and supplement fig 2 based on the gcms the mean area which is based on the rcm simulations affected by water contents below 50 of the awc indicating drought stress onset and by the presence of pronounced water stress for plants relative saturation of the soil below 30 of awc exhibits statistically significant increases for the entire year particularly for july september the decadal trends double and are pronounced for april june when the future climate is directly projected by gcms supplement fig 2 the mentioned figures also show how the scenario of a stepwise increase in the awc would affect drought frequencies after 2020 improvements to the soil awc by 0 5 or even 1 0 per year would not be enough to counter the overall climate driven trend and would only moderate the extent of the area affected by drought however especially in seasons when agricultural drought follows after a relatively wet period the effect and benefit of improved awc on mitigating agricultural drought would be considerable fig 9 shows the temporal distribution of the area affected by hydrological drought according to rcm and gcm simulations there is a difference in the hydrological drought response between areas with a negative and positive climatic water balance fig 1c i e areas where eto exceeds precipitation negative balance and where it is opposite positive balance with a positive balance the runoff and drought characteristics are mostly controlled by available precipitation this control is reflected by the considerable temporal and spatial variability in the area under drought and drought severity in such regions 3 5 of catchments are under drought the most severe droughts cover 20 25 of catchments and usually at least some of the catchments are under drought for most of the years 95 99 in areas with a positive balance runoff is strongly affected by eto and therefore the variability in drought is much smaller although the catchments are naturally dry hydrological drought occurs less frequently 70 80 for rcms and gcms on average 1 3 of the area is under drought each year for extreme droughts the fraction increases to 18 23 figs 8 and 9 taken together indicate that increasing soil awc should decrease the frequency and likely also impact of agricultural drought compared to the baseline soil awc especially during april june improvement is primarily driven by an increased ability to store water from winter precipitation as predicted by some of the climate models hydrological drought in the cr becomes more pronounced with increasing awc particularly in catchments with negative climatic water balance on the other hand strengthening the soil awc in regions with a positive water balance leads to only marginal worsening of the hydrological droughts this result indicates that the adaptation measures need to have different priorities according to the regional specifics to sumarize we have found differences in the hydrological drought response between areas with annual precipitation total exceeding reference evapotranspiration and those where precipitation is lower than eto in the former the water resources are limited by available precipitation this situation leads to considerable spatial and temporal variation in the area under drought with drought being experienced in some of the catchments every year for the basins where the reference evapotranspiration does not exceed total precipitation there are years completely without drought these basins are then more sensitive to soil awc perturbations especially in combination with strong climate forcing i e gcm simulations 4 discussion the absence of a general definition of drought led to the development of drought types specified according to their related impacts and various methods of drought quantification both hydrological and agricultural droughts show good correlation but hydrological droughts lagged behind agricultural droughts by two months on average while agricultural drought is characterized by high sensitivity to precipitation in case of the delimitation of the beginning and end of agricultural drought the decrease in precipitation is not immediately reflected in runoff and hence in the onset of hydrological drought wu et al 2016 showed similar findings with the time lag of the end of hydrological drought reaching at least six months the close relationships between agricultural and hydrological droughts were pointed out by vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 in their evaluation of drought characteristics in a semiarid region poor agricultural drought conditions were associated with the regions with high flow rates according to these authors indicating an inverse relationship between these two drought types which agrees with the findings of our study the results presented in this study indicate that the enhancement of soil awc can be considered a key factor in reducing vulnerability to agricultural drought for example this result was also found by wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 who included soil awc among four key factors in their drought vulnerability index for nebraska us the high vulnerability class included non irrigated cropland and rangeland on sandy soils located in regions with a very high probability of deficiency in seasonal crop moisture similarly wu et al 2011 showed that regions with high awc were characterized by a low degree of vulnerability to agricultural drought while areas with low awc showed higher drought vulnerability the role of soil awc increases if crop growth depends at least partly on the soil water accumulated during the period preceding the vegetation season this is the case for not only the cr but also the agriculture in temperate zones in general e g fischer et al 2012 trnka et al 2013 therefore attempts focusing on increasing soil awc and soil retention of the landscape seem to be obvious solutions to drought mitigation however as indicated in fig 7 the effect of changing the soil awc on hydrological drought is opposite to the effects on agricultural drought fig 6 when the results of our study are expressed in absolute numbers the mean maximum deficit per basin in 1956 2015 corresponds to 1 56 109 m3 of water for awc 40 1 13 109 m3 for awc 0 and 0 97 109 m3 for awc 40 this result means that the czech republic would need to build additional reservoirs with a total volume of c 430 mil m3 to compensate the runoff deficit due to improved soil retention this volume is more than the available storage volume of the largest reservoir orl√≠k on the river vltava in the cr 340 mil m3 this result was also reported by mahe et al 2005 who investigated the possible role of land use change on soil awc in producing the counterintuitive change in runoff regime in west africa since 1970 despite the reduction in annual rainfall and the increase in reservoir storage and the number of dams in the basin and agricultural areas the mean runoff and maximum daily discharges increased indicating lowering awc the model simulation was improved markedly by using the time varying values of soil awc and by accounting factors that lead to decreasing the general capacity to slow water runoff reduction in natural vegetation and increase in bare soil areas and this finding is in agreement with our results of hydrological model calibration for the period 1956 2015 when we introduced slowly decreasing awc value mimicking observed agricultural land degradation especially between 1956 and 2015 the modelling cascade responded by improved results compared to observed river discharges and lake levels our study does not explicitly consider possible soil atmosphere feedbacks increased awc water content and evaporation which increase the water vapor content in the atmosphere can enhance precipitation sch√§r et al 1999 showed that the enhancement of the hydrological cycle over europe is to some degree associated with the existing soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism they suggested that the soil moisture precipitation feedback must rely on some direct and indirect mechanism in which wet soils increase the efficiency of the convective precipitation process in most areas the maximum recycling ratio i e proportion of precipitation originating from the same river basin to the total rainfall over the basin occurs in summer sch√§r et al 1999 bisselink and dolman 2008 for example in the inland iberian peninsula the annual precipitation cycle often exhibits a significant peak in may when the evapotranspiration of moisture stored in soil after the winter accelerates and the enhanced instability induced by wet soil leads to the triggering of soil precipitation feedback with increasing rainfall rios entenza and miguez macho 2014 daniels et al 2015 showed that land use and land cover also strongly influence the precipitation recycling ratio suggesting that precipitation is enhanced over wet soils and reduced over dry soils or urban areas this finding supports the results by harding and snyder 2012 that evapotranspiration increased by c 4 and precipitation increased by 1 in irrigated fields the key role of soil moisture and soil awc in the modulation of climate over central europe especially by the severity of heat waves has also been shown by seneviratne et al 2006 and manning et al 2018 while the above findings indicate plausible mechanisms of soil atmosphere feedback the estimated moisture recycling ratios for central europe are approximately 0 1 i e 10 of regional evaporation contributes to rainfall over the same region even if large regions are considered and the ratio decreases with decreasing area bisselink and dolman 2008 keune and miralles 2019 however bisselink and dolman 2009 report increased significance of local evaporation in dry years which was not necessarily due to the fraction of rainfall originating from local evaporation but rather due to the considerable contribution to instability of the atmosphere and thus the triggering of precipitation this means that allowing for increased awc i e soil water storage enables modulation of agricultural and in particular hydrological droughts see figs 6 and 7 and this effect can be further strengthened by soil atmosphere feedback however this effect cannot be overestimated because evaporation from a particular basin mostly supplies moisture to basins downwind rather than those where the moisture originated keune and miralles 2019 an increase in the probability of soil moisture depletion and prolonged events of agricultural drought across much of europe has been found by many studies e g trnka et al 2015 samaniego et al 2018 grillakis 2019 in which central europe has been considered a region where a considerable increase in severe drought events is likely e g eitzinger et al 2013 ≈°tƒõp√°nek et al 2016 this finding was considered a major threat to the agricultural productivity of the whole region and has been an issue of continuous concern on the other hand in terms of hydrological droughts central europe has not been considered particularly affected e g gosling et al 2017 marx et al 2018 however the cr represents a sandwiched region between central and western europe where no change in low flows is predicted and southern europe where a marked increase in the severity of hydrological droughts is expected e g marx et al 2018 for example the results of marx et al 2018 indicate that the southeastern part of the cr belongs to regions where the shift towards a major decrease in river flows is likely and pronounced under high end scenarios due to the increasing frequency and severity of drought episodes caused by climate change it is necessary to reduce drought vulnerability and prepare suitable adaptation strategies for drought mitigation and preparedness wilhite et al 2014 iglesias and garrote 2015 the findings of this study highlight that agricultural drought mitigation measures that would lead to an increase in soil awc would inevitably result in an increased frequency of low flows i e hydrological drought these findings need to be communicated to decision makers in the government and to public stakeholders at the same time expert opinion in this respect should consider the uncertainties and interdependencies between the hydrological and agricultural aspects of drought taylor et al 2013 leng et al 2015 nam et al 2015 different tendencies of agricultural and hydrological droughts under future climate conditions have been raised for example by wang et al 2011 and duan and mei 2014 both studies concluded that indicators of agricultural droughts and to some extent hydrological droughts are more sensitive than the standardized precipitation index vicente serrano et al 2012 which is frequently used as an indicator of meteorological drought however the majority of the studies covering different drought types e g wang et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2012 duan and mei 2014 wu et al 2016 used fairly simple indicators of drought or their more elaborate concepts such as the aggregated drought index adi which considers three levels of drought from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural by keyantash and dracup 2004 or the multivariate drought index mdi by rajsekhar et al 2015 a more process oriented approach has been used that applies swat models e g tao et al 2003 xie and eheart 2003 narasimhan et al 2005 srinivasan et al 2010 in which some required data had to be replaced by proxies mostly based on remotely sensed data in some cases the proper calibration of the models was limited by a lack of observed data nevertheless the process based models showed quite satisfactory predictions of water and crop yield during dry years as cited by the modeling studies the presented study required several simplifications of real world processes given the data availability as well as computational resources most likely the most relevant simplification which may affect the analysis outcomes for future climate conditions is connected to the daily time step used in agricultural drought modeling and the monthly time step used in hydrological drought modeling as well as using the same land use patterns clc2006 for the entire study period assessment of the water balance at the daily time step does not account for changes in the separation of precipitation into direct runoff and infiltration over short time scales the positive trend in the intensity of rainfall events and negative trend in their duration at sub daily scales have already been detected for the area of the cr by hanel et al 2016 the climate model simulations are generally consistent with these trends svoboda et al 2016 this result suggests that the infiltration ability and thus the soil retention over the basins can be in fact lower singh 1997 than those estimated by daily models quantification of these effects is however beyond the scope of our study in which we assumed that the land use patterns have not changed significantly for the awc sensitivity tests this shortcoming should be analyzed in future studies because recent analyses of land use patterns have shown that such effects are not negligible particularly for hydrological drought van loon and laaha 2015 ahn and merwade 2017 5 conclusions our results based on the country wide example demonstrate the relationship between soil and surface water storage where an increase in the former leads to a decrease in the latter therefore the research hypothesis is rejected in other words if the compensation measures for the effects of agricultural and hydrological drought rely on the same water resources such as basin precipitation then they should not be designed separately to optimize the benefits and minimize potential conflicts this result indicates that if the current attempts to increase the overall soil awc are successful then the agricultural drought severity and duration would indeed be partly alleviated however even if the soil awc would increase by 40 which would require massive long term efforts the climate signal would still significantly increase the duration and extent of the area affected by agricultural drought in the same time substantial efforts and costs would be required to compensate for the surface water deficit and prevent increase in the severity and probability of hydrological droughts our study clearly shows not only the need for joint design of adaptation measures against agricultural and hydrological droughts but also need carefully communicate to policy and decision makers the relatively limited effect of improving soil water holding properties in drought mitigation efforts the results also demonstrate that the impact of changing soil awc or otherwise increasing retention in the landscape leads to nontrivial interactions between agricultural and hydrological drought frequency with both types of droughts showing not only different sensitivities to the increase in the soil awc but also opposite directions of change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9601,bangladesh specifically the northwestern region faces twin challenges namely food and water security which are pressing now and likely to increase in the future mainly due to climate change more crops per drop of water namely crop water productivity wp could be a key strategy to address both challenges this study assessed future wheat triticum aestivum l wp under changing climate along with adaptation strategies in northwestern bangladesh aquacrop 5 0 model prior to calibration and validation was used coupled with global climate models gcms projections to simulate the yield and wp of wheat for the historical baseline 2000 2019 near future 2020 2039 mid future 2040 2059 and far future 2080 2099 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenarios we have tested adaptation strategies such as shifting sowing dates and introducing virtual heat tolerant varieties to compensate for the adverse effect of future climate change in yield and wp of wheat the simulated wheat yields using the observed baseline period 2000 2019 climate data are found as 3 73 t ha 1 for the dinajpur region this study observed the wheat yield reduction by 11 5 21 7 and 40 5 in the near future mid future and 2080 s far future respectively both future maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperatures tmin are projected to increase significantly during the development and Ô¨Çowering stages of wheat production which could reduce the yield significantly the actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat during the baseline period is simulated as 271 mm this eta could be reduced by 3 7 5 9 and 3 0 for wheat in future time slices respectively the wp of wheat during the base period is simulated as 1 37 kg m 3 results show that wheat wp could be reduced by 6 6 21 2 and 33 6 in the future time slices respectively shifting sowing date 15 november as an adaptation measure revealed that 10 day backward shifting of the sowing date from the current optimum 25 november date the losses of wp could be replenished for all cases even be increased 3 5 in the 2030s if compared with the current wp observed similarly the loss of wp could be replenished and even increased up to 10 2 and 11 1 for the 2050s and 2030s respectively in the case of the 20 day backward shifting sowing date 5 november in a 10 day forward shifting 5 december both the yield and wp could be decreased significantly further for all future time slices early sowing of seeds could benefit from escaping the critical periods during the flowering stage and could increase the yields and wps introducing virtual heat tolerant variety as another adaptation measure we find both the yield and wp of wheat could be increased significantly if compared to the benchmark wheat varieties these results suggest that adjusting sowing dates and introducing heat tolerant variety might be a powerful means to mitigate the effect of climate change keywords crop water productivity climate change aquacrop model adaptation measure wheat

change cc which is primarily attributed to the increase of greenhouse gases ghgs is expected to cause global warming over the century pachauri et al 2014 consequently crop productivity could be affected significantly by the changes in mean climatic parameters however productivity could be altered ultimately through the enhancement of photosynthesis due to the fertilization effect of increasing co2 especially of c3 plants though under high end climate change scenarios the benefits of increasing co2 may alter the future yield on the other hand streck 2005 more crops per drop of water namely crop water productivity wp could be a key strategy to address both challenges considering the water use perspective co2 fertilization could lead to higher crop wp through an inferior rate of transpiration at the leaf of the crop thus could alter water requirements for crop productivity significantly betts et al 2007 wullschleger et al 2002 simultaneously however changes in the patterns of rainfall could alter the water balance of the crop fields some regions are projected to increase in seasonal rainfall the irrigated water to reimburse for soil water scarcities could be reduced for optimal crop development and some regions may observe vice versa d√∂ll 2002 gerten et al 2011 the demand for productivity increases to feed the increasing people leads to necessitates the increase in the irrigated water in utmost geographical areas consequently the prevalence of cc could be more noticeable at a time with increasing pressure on the water resources coming from crop production

changes in crop wp using crop simulation modeling practices rosenzweig et al 2014 kang et al 2009 studied the influences of cc on crop productivity and water use efficiencies in the context of food

government of bangladesh gob has given priority to enhance crop wp through optimal use of available water resources and encouraging research on impact assessment and adaptation to cc in their seventh

model which was calibrated and validated for wheat production based on field experiments and expert judgment future climate data for representative conservation pathways rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to simulate yield and wp in the 2030s 2020 2039 2050s 2040 2059 and 2090s 2080 2099 future yield and wp were then compared to the base 2000 2019 to assess the effect of cc on crop wp and measure the necessary adaptation to cope with the adverse situation in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this cc impact study was conducted in the major wheat growing area in the greater dinajpur region of bangladesh as a case study fig 1 this region consists of three districts second tier administration boundary namely panchagarh dinajpur and thakurgaon and is located between 88 05 e to 89 15 e and 25 10 n to 26 37 n among the 33 agro ecological zones aezs of bangladesh this area is under the old himalayan piedmont plain aez 24 and tista meander floodplain aez 28 which includes the moderately sedimentary slanted land formed by waterways land types of this region are medium highland flooded up to 90 cm during the flood to highland above flood level fertility levels are low to mostly medium organic maters are mostly low to medium soil textures are mostly silty loam to clay loam soils are strongly acidic and suitable crops are rice wheat and maize cropping systems in this region are profoundly diverse concentrated and comparatively complex the predominant rice wheat and maize based double or triple cropping patterns are common practices this study region has the major cropping areas and is essential to the current accomplishment of food security in bangladesh particularly for its dry winter season crop production interestingly an extra long winter season favors the production of various crops specifically wheat a c3 crop this region itself supplies the highest wheat production about one fourth of the country bbs 2018 the bangladesh government has also given high priority to sustaining groundwater irrigation in this region hence low water consuming cereal crops like winter wheat and maize have become popular to be cultivated in this region 2 2 data used 2 2 1

as a drought prone ecosystem fahad et al 2018 mainuddin and kirby 2015 shahid 2011 the timing of drought might change here due to the uneven distribution of rainfall and increasing temperature the reduced soil moisture content resulting from a decline in winter precipitation and higher evapotranspiration could affect the dry winter season crop production karim et al 1999 2 2 2 future climate

area were collected from the repositories of the earth system grid federation esgf and the indian institute of technology madras center for climate change research these rcms were driven from cmip5 global climate models gcms table 2 lists the details of rcms obtained for this study among four rcps of the projection scenarios of ipcc rcp 8 5 the high emission scenario was chosen for this study to predict the climate change response to water productivity at different times in the 21st century rcp 8 5 was selected only for this study because modeling through the higher emission scenario could be a reasonable effort in the impact assessment studies high forcing scenarios for example have a much higher signal to noise ratio for significant impact assessment due to climate change besides rcp 8 5 is used for consistency due to the past ipcc modeling effort cmip5 a2 and a1f1 in the sres scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 time series for this study were selected as base period 2000 2019 and three future times as near future 2030s 2020 2039 mid future 2050s 2040 2059 and far future 2090s 2080 2099 2 2 3 crop management data experiments were carried out in the bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur in 2018 for collecting bio physical characteristics data of wheat the design of the experimentation was a split plot including three replications there were three treatments including three seed sowing dates such as 25 november optimum date and two late sowing dates 05 december and 15 december the treatments also include three promising wheat varieties bari gom 26 bari gom 28 bari gom 30 among the treatments sowing dates were set in the main plots and varieties were in subplots the unit experimental field dimensions were 3 m 2 m each field has ten rows including a row to row distance of 20 cm and a block to block distance of 1 5 m agronomic data were collected from those field experiments besides the time series physiological biomass and yield data were collected for calibrating and validating the crop simulation model besides ten potential wheat farmers field data were collected for model calibration and validation these farmers fields were selected for getting data on irrigation fertilizer phenology and yield of wheat in the same experimental year 2018 farmers of the selected crop fields were supplied with questionnaires to collect information regarding farming practices main factors affecting the plantation of crops biomass and yield crop variety crop phenological stages fertilizer and irrigation practices 2 3 methodology the overall methodology of this study is shown in fig 2 various components of the flow diagram of the methodology are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 aquacrop model setup aquacrop 5 0 a water driven wp model raes et al 2009 was used to assess the yield and wp of wheat the biomass growth rate is assumed linearly proportionate to leaf transpiration through a wp parameter in aquacrop model steduto 1996 water productivity parameters are normalized for the climate that enables aquacrop superior applicability in time and space steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 despite the simplified and reduced input variables the aquacrop model maintains a substantial number of key output data such as the simulation of biomass canopy cover soil water components and the crop yield steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model develops from the empirical functions determining the response of yield to evapotranspiration through eq 1 steduto et al 2009 1 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where eta denotes actual evapotranspiration which is the summation of soil evaporation es and crop transpiration tr ya and ym denote actual yield and maximum yield respectively ky is the proportionality factor between relative yield loss and relative reduction in evapotranspiration the ya is calculated through the empirical eq 2 2 ya b hi where b denotes biomass and hi denotes harvest index the biomass gets from the aquacrop growth engine with seasonal tr and wp which states aboveground biomass kg production per unit area m2 per unit water transpired m 3 b wp tr the tr is normalized with reference evapotranspiration eto the normalization of tr makes the b tr relationship general applicable to different climatic regimes the simulation runs of the model are usually performed daily time steps using growing degree days or calendar days the normalization of water productivity wp however depends on atmospheric evaporation demands e g eto and co2 concentrations for the diverse locations and seasons including the future of the climate scenarios steduto et al 2009 the normalized crop water productivity for c3 crops like barley is set between 13 and 18 g m 2 raes et al 2009 the aquacrop model is a dynamic crop simulation model advanced in assessing wp specifically a water stressed cropping system the input parameters include a the climate temperature rainfall evaporation and co2 ii the crop development and yield iii the soil water balance and iv the management planting dates application of irrigation and fertilizer raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis of aquacrop model parameter sensitivity analysis helps to investigate how the model output variables can be accredited to changes in input parameters guiding us to where calibration has to be focused pianosi et al 2016 this analysis was led in this study to assess the influence of input parameters on model output among the default parameters of the current version of aquacrop a few key parameters named non conservative parameters are used as most of the parameters are conservatives for understanding the behavior of the aquacrop model to changes in input parameters the tested input parameters were organized into three classes namely crops soil water and climate based on the comparative effect on the simulated productivity parameters from each class were classified as highly sensitive whether the aquacrop model response to 15 or more changes in the input parameters similarly moderate and low sensible parameters were classified in the case of 2 15 changes and less than 2 changes in input parameters respectively according to geerts et al 2009 sensitivity analysis assists in screening out the non sensitive parameters while defining the highly sensitive parameters in the calibration and validation process dong et al 2004 sensitivity analysis was formerly followed by model calibration 2 3 3 calibration of the aquacrop model calibrations of the crop and soil parameters in aquacrop were done by experimental data in association with expert judgment as proposed by hsiao et al 2009 the outline of the parameters was tracked by altering parameters followed by the substantially representative range the crop file in aquacrop was altered to simulate the observed crop parameters based on the soil parameters at reasonable values the soil water balance was simulated after crop parameter calibration as crop characteristics influence the soil water balance significantly in aquacrop the calibration was done in growing degree day mode as it gives more precise results only when crop development is limited by heat or cold stress the aquacrop model was parameterized and crop databases were constructed for many crops including wheat steduto et al 2012 the parameterization and testing of the model for different crops under local environments take led to the establishment of conservative parameters that do not change significantly with locations for better simulation results conservative parameters still need to be calibrated however that requires extensive measurement on experimental fields as a result for this study conservative parameters are retained and calibration focused on non conservative cultivar specific parameters which were gathered from the experimental data set for this study during the calibration process crop parameters like time to reach different phenological stages were used from experimental data and crop parameters like maximum canopy cover and the rooting depth were fine tuned iteratively until the observed and simulated yield becomes in close agreement soil water stress coefficients for leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence were also fine tuned by simply changing different stress classes non conservative parameters were recognized as final if the simulated values matched the measured data significantly 2 3 4 performance evaluation of the aquacrop model model validation makes us conscious of how competently the model works beneath local environments the performance of the aquacrop model during calibration and validation processes were evaluated using the coefÔ¨Åcient of the determination r2 which describes the variances of data willmott s statistics measures namely the index of agreement d the root mean squared error rmse and the normalized root means squared error

the simulated value for the ith observation oi is the observed value for the ith observation s m and o m are the means of the simulated and observed values respectively and n is the number of observations finally the calibrated and validated model was applied to simulate the base year yield and wp for the study area 2 3 5 the response of future wheat yield wp the future yield and wp of wheat were assessed and compared to the present wp of wheat to assess the climate change impact future climate data for the rcp 8 5 scenario was used to simulate yield and wp for the 2030s near future 2050s mid future and 2090s far future future yield and wp were then estimated compared to the base data 2000 2019 to compare the future results to the baseline the relative changes of crop yield both for wheat were calculated 8 Œ¥ y y future y baseline y baseline 100 where Œ¥ y is the relative change of the crop yield y basel ine is the yield in the base period 2000 2019 y future is the crop yield in the future period these relative changes are analyzed and the reasons for extreme or unusual changes are researched similarly to compare the future to the baseline the relative changes of wp of wheat were calculated 9 Œ¥ wp wp future wp baseline wp baseline 100 where Œ¥ wp is the relative changes of the crop wp wp baseline is the wp in the base period 2000 2019 wp future is the crop wp in the future period these relative changes were analyzed and the reasons for extreme or unusual changes were assessed 2 3 6 adaptation strategies to cope with adverse scenarios measures that support adaptation are taken to cope with the adverse impact of climate change two suitable adaptation strategies such as shifting sowing dates and introducing virtual heat tolerant variety were assessed to reduce the yield and wp loss of wheat in future climate scenarios these adaptation strategies could increase reduce the loss of productivity due to the negative impacts of future climate changes 2 3 6 1 option 1 shifting of the sowing date the optimum sowing date of wheat in the study area is 25 november any dates before or after the optimum date 25 november may alter the yield of wheat due to the favorable condition of the weather 10 day interval forward and backward shifting of the sowing dates with respect to the optimum sowing date 25 november were simulated 10 day backward shifting 15 november and 20 day backward shifting 05 november and 10 day forward shifting 05 december were considered under future changing climate to assess the wheat yield and wp using the aquacrop model with rcp 8 5 scenarios 2 3 6 2 option 2 heat resistant variety a virtual heat resistant variety was designed using the aquacrop model to observe how it performs under an adverse environment in the future in this study a heat resistant characteristic was fused into the existing wheat variety by altering the thresholds of tmax affect reproductive growth specifically in grain filling accordingly the heat tolerant variety was created through increasing 2 c in maximum threshold values in the base varieties as used by singh et al 2014 and tesfaye et al 2018 the potential yield and wp under these adaptation strategies in future time slices were evaluated by assessing them with the aquacrop simulation model compared with the base variety 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameterization and setup of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated by means of experimental and farmers field data set of the year 2018 prior to the sensitivity analysis results show the high sensitivity variables for simulation were senescence time max root zone depth reference harvest index hi0 and wp followed by moderate sensitivity parameters such as maximum canopy cover time to start flowering maximum root depth time to maximize root depth in the case of soil water parameters this model displays high sensitivity to initial soil moisture content and less sensitivity to water extraction pattern and hydraulic conductivity geerts et al 2009 and salemi et al 2011 found similar kind results in their studies the tmax was more sensitive to the output of the model as it affects the yield directly this sensitivity analysis provides suggestions for the most important parameters to be selected for precise field measurements and model calibration 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop models the user specific crop input parameters for wheat bari gom 26 variety were calibrated from experimental and farmers field data literature expert judgment and local conditions crop characteristics soil and climatic conditions in the study area table 3 the calibrated normalized crop water productivity wp for wheat was 15 7 g m 2 which was within the range of the default values set for c3 plants and similar to the values of winter wheat calibrated in china raes et al 2009 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the performance of the aquacrop model under cultivar specific cultivation conditions was assessed based on the data acquired from field experiments and farmers fields the crop growth parameters for wheat were analyzed based on grain yield the agreement between observed and simulated wheat yield during the calibration and validation process is presented in fig 3 the simulated grain yields of wheat agreed significantly to that of observed yields a close correlation between simulated and observed crop parameters was observed during the calibration and validation processes table 4 the nrmse was below 10 for the wheat yield calibration process which indicates excellent model performance similarly the values of d were close to 1 denoting perfect agreement simulated and observed values regarding calibration relatively lower rmse was observed due to cautious parameterization of the aquacrop model though the least error occurs mainly due to the process and human errors this calibrated model was used to assess future yield and wp of wheat in changing climate 3 3 assessment of wheat wp under changing climate 3 3 1 future projections of temperature and rainfall results from the gcm ensemble outputs under the rcp 8 5 during future periods the 2030s 2050s and 2090s for the study area revealed the increasing future temperature compared with the base year 2000 2019 table 5 shows the average monthly temperature and the total rainfall during the future growing period vegetative development and reproductive of wheat both the projected tmax and tmin tend to increase from the baseline during the future time slices during the vegetative and Ô¨Çowering stages of wheat compared with the base year the monthly tmax could be increased by 0 10 5 12 ¬∫c by the near future in the dinajpur region the monthly tmax could be increased by 0 17 6 23 ¬∫c by mid future and 0 73 8 62 ¬∫c by far future table 5 similarly compared with the base year the monthly tmin could be increased by 1 71 5 21 ¬∫c by the near future in the dinajpur region the monthly tmin could be increased by 2 23 6 30 ¬∫c by mid future and 4 78 9 44 ¬∫c by far future projected future monthly rainfall could be increased from the baseline during the wheat growing period specifically in march e g at the maturity stage the variability of the historical yield eta and wp of wheat under present climate conditions and future scenarios were simulated by the aqucrop model 3 3 2 assessment of numerator of wp crop yield the results show that the average yield eta and wp of wheat for the dinajpur region were 3 73 t ha 1 271 mm and 1 37 kg m 3 during the base years 2000 2019 the model simulations show a significant decrease in the yield during the near future mid future and far future fig 4 shows the variations in yield for wheat for the different simulation periods of 2020 2099 the observed higher variations in predicted wheat yields in the future specifically in the 2050s and 2090s might be owing to yearly climatic variations results show a significant yield reduction of 11 6 20 9 and 39 9 could occur in the near future mid future and far future in the dinajpur region table 6 the highest variations were observed in yield ranging from zero to 4 05 4 12 and 4 22 t ha 1 for near future mid future and far future respectively results show a remarkable effect of the future climatic variability on wheat productivity considering different gcms the wheat crop could produce almost no yields in a few observed years might be due to future climatic variability specifically an increase of tmax significantly the number of total crop failures could be occurred mostly in the far future followed by the mid and near future mainuddin et al 2012 found similar crop failure in rice while projecting in 2050 the growth vegetative and development phases of winter wheat in bangladesh exist from december to february january and february are very important since the jointing booting and flowering phases of the winter wheat occurred in these months the grain filling phase occurred in march however the average tmax is observed well above of critical average tmax of 30 c during the reproductive and grain filling stages february march and exceeded the optimum range for wheat growth as speciÔ¨Åed by biswas et al 2017 in their study the future tmin though is observed high which could still be a favorable range for good growth in the future average temperatures are usually unable to specify the plant s cold or heat stress which affects the fertilization and consequently the grain yield raes et al 2009 in aquacrop the upper threshold value of the cold stress is 8 c and the lower threshold value of heat stress is 35 c at which fertilization begins to be failed in this study the wheat crop doesn t experience the cold stress for any rcms because the future tmin observes 8 c during the wheat growing period though the upper level could harm crop development results show the number of days having a tmax 35 c during the entire growing stages of the wheat crop which ranges from 23 to 33 days of the growth cycle for all rcms table 7 the rainfall is expected to increase though in future scenarios this could be significant mainly in april and march whereas it could be insignificant from december to february which is crucial months for vegetative growth flowering and grain formation stages of irrigated wheat moreover during these crucial months both the tmax and tmin could increase significantly which may compensate for the minor positive effects of increased rainfall on irrigated wheat in the future however eta depends on available water at the root zone coming from rainfall in rainfed agriculture the rainfall is the dominating parameter which affects the yield in rainfed agriculture significantly rather than irrigated crop production systems rockstr√∂m et al 2010 heat stress during grain filling appears a major constraint to wheat yield because this stress could intensify the reproductive development rate which reduces photosynthesis duration and seed production as well wheat crop is exposed to high temperatures especially during the anthesis and grain filling phase in this case february march which could prove to be critical in the context of yield formation thus wheat yield could be decreased gradually with the increasing tmax mainly due to the rise of the number of days 35 c researchers have found similar results regarding the tmax effect on wheat yield sofield et al 1977 and wheeler et al 1996 detected the grain filling length of cereals i e wheat was determined principally by temperature higher temperatures 31¬∫c exist before and after the anthesis of wheat could reduction the grain filling rate wardlaw and stone and nicolas et al 1989 1995 the consequence of high temperatures on wheat yields is supposed to be similar to a 2 3 ¬∫c warmer mean temperature during the crop growing season wheeler et al 1996 moreover about 23 loss of yield was reported from 4 days of extreme high temperatures experience stone and nicolas 1995 the impact of this extreme temperature however could be different in different crops and geographical locations consequently uncertainty in crop responses in the future climate should consider significantly rezaei et al 2015 3 3 3 assessment of denominator of wp eta the simulation of actual evapotranspiration eta based on the observed weather data 2000 2019 shows the average eta could be 271 mm for wheat this study shows that eta of wheat could be decreased in the near future mid future and far future under rcp 8 5 emission scenarios fig 5 the aquacrop simulates the shorter duration of the wheat growth as the future crop could achieve the required growing degree days gdd earlier due to the increasing temperature hence eta could be reduced due to the shorter duration which may compensate for the higher demand of eta due to higher temperature yano et al 2007 also observed that eta could be decreased during 2070 2079 while compared to the base period due to a shorter growing season resulting from the temperature rises wheat eta could be decreased by 28 and 8 if compared for the cgcm2 and the rcm data respectively mainly due to the shorter duration projected for the future the consequences of an increasing temperature rise the atmospheric evaporative demand however decreasing wheat eta could reduce crop growing days and transpiration due to the closure of stomatal conductance even through the evaporative demand increases ainsworth and long 2005 observed the significant decreases in eta under raised co2 concentration mainly due to stomatal closure elevated atmospheric co2 concentration could reduce wheat eta due to the reduction of the stomatal conductance the combined effects of the increasing temperature and co2 concentration on the eta varied significantly due to transpiration reduced initiated by stomatal closure which could decrease wheat eta by 24 if compared to without stomata closure yano et al 2007 observed similar trends of eta under the combined effects of increasing co2 and temperature with stomata closure rashid et al 2019 also found the decreasing seasonal wheat eta while compared to the base period they observed the decreasing transpiration with co2 fertilization 10 27 for different rcp scenarios and periods the reduction in transpiration is likely even without co2 fertilization because of the shortening of the growing period nevertheless further research is needed due to the uncertain future changing scenarios 3 3 4 assessment of future wp under changing climate the simulated wheat wp for the base period 2000 2019 based on observed data shows the average wp for 1 37 kg m 3 for wheat results show the wp of wheat could be reduced in the 2030 s 2050 s and 2090 s under rcp 8 5 emission scenarios fig 6 this reduction would be increased gradually over time wheat eta could be decreased through relatively less and similarly to yield along with all future time slices rosenberg et al 1990 observed a 12 17 decrease in eta due to an increase of 40 stomatal resistance jones et al 1985 observed similar results as decreasing eta due to the increasing transpiration which was occurred mainly due to the increasing stomatal resistance in a range of smaller temperature rises 0 2 c the reduced stomatal conductance could alter the global warming effects by reducing the water use in crop production lovelli et al 2010 a few researchers observed the declining stomatal conductance with rising co2 which reduced the length of the growing cycle consequently reduce transpiration of the crops and decreasing eta kruijt et al 2008 therefore aquacrop might simulate the wp somewhat relatively less increasing compared to the significant yield reduction which in turn lessens the future wp deryng et al 2016 found severe negative impacts on global rice maize and wheat yields by 2080 including a minor reduction in eta but a significant reduction in global wp crop wp is enhanced in general by either obtaining higher yields with the same amount of water or using less water to get the same yields zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in this study the wheat wp could be reduced in the future under changing climate fig 6 even though the eta was reduced due to growing cycle shortening thus for maintaining the wheat wp under future climate change threats increasing the wheat yield production would be more important than increasing the water use efficiency ahmad et al 2020 provide emphasis also on boosting up the yield for sustaining the wheat wp improving crop wp and keeping steady relations with production could be important for water productive food security hence adaptation is consequently an essential concern which should be addressed to reduce the adverse impact of climate change on crop wp 3 4 adaptation measures in reducing yield and wp loss in future 3 4 1 impact of shifting planting date on yield and wp of wheat the consequence of the shifting sowing date on wheat yield and wp were assessed using aquacrop compared to the optimum date of sowing 25 november under future adverse scenarios results show that future wheat yield loss could be reduced if the sowing dates shifted 10 day and 20 day backward to 15 and 5 november respectively whereas yield loss could be increased significantly further if sowing dates shifted 10 day forward to 5 december fig 7 anticipated adverse impacts of climate change could be gradually alleviated by shifting the backward date of sowing projected yield reduction would be offset or ultimately upturned this yield could be increased owing to the availability of favorable temperature during the vegetative and flowering stages which would shift backward in january february rather than march in the future period the reduction in wheat yields thus could be minimized by adopting a simple practice of shifting sowing dates backward without altering benchmark variety water and soil management practices similarly jalota et al 2012 observed that shifting planting dates to 15 days for wheat in a future changing environment resulted in the tiniest yields reduction as a practical adaptation measure for sustaining yields in the future this present study shows the increased yield in the case of early sowing primarily due to the increasing number of days with a favorable climate with the backward shifting of the sowing date total unfavorable days could be reduced and consequently increase the yield by shifting forward the wheat sowing date the negative consequence of tmax could be more in the future changing environment due to the increasing the tmax and decreasing the crop season length as well the winter wheat grain yield is usually restricted by heat stress during the reproductive stages this grain reduction could be further degraded due to such unfavorable growing conditions in the future climate wang et al 2017 projected yield reductions in this study were observed in reproductive stages of wheat due to the high temperature measures through the january march period table 7 asseng et al 2011 indicated the productivity losses due to higher temperatures during the reproductive phase for major wheat growing regions in this particular case the consequences of this study illustrate the average warmer days 35 c in january march during the far future are projected to increase which could reduce the productivity significantly however shifting the sowing date could alter the eta demand in crop development besides shifting the sowing of seeds could help crops to escape the critical higher temperature stages during the flowering stage shrestha et al 2018 similar to yield reduction fig 8 shows the change in wheat wp of baseline cultivar bari gom 26 with different sowing dates for gcms scenarios in the study area relative to wp obtained from the current optimum sowing date the loss of wp of wheat could be fully reduced even reversed in some cases during the future time slices in the case of the 10 day backward shifting sowing date the loss of wp could be reduced in the future all time slices even could be increased 3 5 in the near future after replenishing the losses in the case of 20 day backward shifting the loss of wp could be replenished and even increased up to 10 2 and 11 1 during the mid future and near future respectively for the other dates observed a significant loss of wps could be reduced if compared to the observations without shifting dates on the other hand in a 10 day forward shifting wp could be decreased significantly further for three future periods respectively if compared with wp without adaptation measures 3 5 impact of introducing heat tolerant variety on wp of wheat heat resistance characteristics were fused into the current wheat variety by modifying the tmax limit results show that the current wheat yield and wp could be reduced significantly under future adverse environments if compared to the base however this yield loss could be reduced significantly if the virtual heat tolerant variety introduces under cc through all future time slices studied if compared with the benchmark variety fig 9 a similarly loss of water productivity could be reduced in the virtual heat tolerant variety relative to benchmark varieties under future climate conditions fig 9 b among the adaptation options to cope with the future adverse environment are climate specific and non specific reilly and schimmelpfennig 1999 resurreccion et al 2008 many previous studies krishnan et al 2007 hasegawa et al 2008 laux et al 2010 recommended that altering sowing dates could be a very simple but powerful tool for modifying the adverse impacts of the latent changing climate this study finds similar results in changing the sowing date and introducing the heal tolerant variety offsets the negative effects of changing climate on the wheat yield and wp in the future time slices 4 conclusions strategies to sustain and improve the wheat yield and wp under changing climate in the northwestern region of bangladesh have been assessed wheat yield and wp could be reduced significantly in the future time slices mainly due to the projected higher tmax and tmin during the Ô¨Çowering and ripening stages moreover these rising temperatures may compensate for the minor positive effects of projected rainfall in irrigated winter wheat production wheat eta could be reduced in those time slices due to the shorter duration including the closure efficiency of stomata appropriate adaptation strategies are crucial to mitigate the adverse impact of changing climate improve the productivity of wheat in the future adjustment of the planting date and introducing heat tolerant variety as adaptation options could reduce both yield and wp losses significantly during the future time slices early sowing of seeds could benefit from escaping the critical periods during the flowering stage and could increase the yields and wps significantly in the future this study suggests that adjusting planting dates and introducing heat tolerant variety might be a powerful but very simple tool for mitigating the adverse effect of possible global warming on wheat wp finally stakeholders policy and decision makers can use this information to rationalize the type of measures for improving water

9601,bangladesh specifically the northwestern region faces twin challenges namely food and water security which are pressing now and likely to increase in the future mainly due to climate change more crops per drop of water namely crop water productivity wp could be a key strategy to address both challenges this study assessed future wheat triticum aestivum l wp under changing climate along with adaptation strategies in northwestern bangladesh aquacrop 5 0 model prior to calibration and validation was used coupled with global climate models gcms projections to simulate the yield and wp of wheat for the historical baseline 2000 2019 near future 2020 2039 mid future 2040 2059 and far future 2080 2099 under representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 scenarios we have tested adaptation strategies such as shifting sowing dates and introducing virtual heat tolerant varieties to compensate for the adverse effect of future climate change in yield and wp of wheat the simulated wheat yields using the observed baseline period 2000 2019 climate data are found as 3 73 t ha 1 for the dinajpur region this study observed the wheat yield reduction by 11 5 21 7 and 40 5 in the near future mid future and 2080 s far future respectively both future maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperatures tmin are projected to increase significantly during the development and Ô¨Çowering stages of wheat production which could reduce the yield significantly the actual evapotranspiration eta of wheat during the baseline period is simulated as 271 mm this eta could be reduced by 3 7 5 9 and 3 0 for wheat in future time slices respectively the wp of wheat during the base period is simulated as 1 37 kg m 3 results show that wheat wp could be reduced by 6 6 21 2 and 33 6 in the future time slices respectively shifting sowing date 15 november as an adaptation measure revealed that 10 day backward shifting of the sowing date from the current optimum 25 november date the losses of wp could be replenished for all cases even be increased 3 5 in the 2030s if compared with the current wp observed similarly the loss of wp could be replenished and even increased up to 10 2 and 11 1 for the 2050s and 2030s respectively in the case of the 20 day backward shifting sowing date 5 november in a 10 day forward shifting 5 december both the yield and wp could be decreased significantly further for all future time slices early sowing of seeds could benefit from escaping the critical periods during the flowering stage and could increase the yields and wps introducing virtual heat tolerant variety as another adaptation measure we find both the yield and wp of wheat could be increased significantly if compared to the benchmark wheat varieties these results suggest that adjusting sowing dates and introducing heat tolerant variety might be a powerful means to mitigate the effect of climate change keywords crop water productivity climate change aquacrop model adaptation measure wheat crop 1 introduction the world is facing twin challenges namely food and water security which are pressing now and likely to increase in the future mainly due to climate change foley et al 2011 climate change cc which is primarily attributed to the increase of greenhouse gases ghgs is expected to cause global warming over the century pachauri et al 2014 consequently crop productivity could be affected significantly by the changes in mean climatic parameters however productivity could be altered ultimately through the enhancement of photosynthesis due to the fertilization effect of increasing co2 especially of c3 plants though under high end climate change scenarios the benefits of increasing co2 may alter the future yield on the other hand streck 2005 more crops per drop of water namely crop water productivity wp could be a key strategy to address both challenges considering the water use perspective co2 fertilization could lead to higher crop wp through an inferior rate of transpiration at the leaf of the crop thus could alter water requirements for crop productivity significantly betts et al 2007 wullschleger et al 2002 simultaneously however changes in the patterns of rainfall could alter the water balance of the crop fields some regions are projected to increase in seasonal rainfall the irrigated water to reimburse for soil water scarcities could be reduced for optimal crop development and some regions may observe vice versa d√∂ll 2002 gerten et al 2011 the demand for productivity increases to feed the increasing people leads to necessitates the increase in the irrigated water in utmost geographical areas consequently the prevalence of cc could be more noticeable at a time with increasing pressure on the water resources coming from crop production nechifor and winning 2017 climate change impacts on crop wp are becoming gradually substantial for scientists and governments all over the world several assessments have been done so far on the changes in crop wp using crop simulation modeling practices rosenzweig et al 2014 kang et al 2009 studied the influences of cc on crop productivity and water use efficiencies in the context of food safety indicating that wp may decline in the future due to temperature rise and rainfall pattern changes researchers keen out the necessity to study food security in the future assimilated with food climate and population due to uncertainty of the future climate reidsma et al 2010 khan et al 2009 xiao et al 2020 numerous uncertain factors such as uncertainty in the global climate model gcm soil water storage predictions climate variables and enhanced atmospheric co2 levels affect the impacts of climate change on crop wp kang et al 2009 shoaib et al 2021 general circulation models gcms are increasingly capable of making such predictions of seasonal and long term climate variability as well as improving the prospects of predicting the impact on yields crop simulation models e g aquacrop are capable of predicting crop wp under various crop management options and changing climatic parameters using gcms data tao et al 2018 choudhury et al 2018 vanuytrecht et al 2014 the role of adaptation is necessary to consider the assessment of the vulnerability of water productive crop production under changing climate to reduce the extent of the climate change impact significantly reidsma et al 2010 many researchers emphasized the need for effective adaptation consisting of changing sowing dates changing fertilizer application rate and changing varieties as a measure to counter the negative impacts on crop and water productivity e g rivington et al 2013 meza et al 2008 several studies show that suitable adaptation options are usually region specific and need to be appraised as per the location tao and zhang 2010 aggarwal et al 2019 the impacts of cc on crop wp are global concerns and those are very important for the second staple food grain i e wheat of bangladesh the government of bangladesh gob has given priority to enhance crop wp through optimal use of available water resources and encouraging research on impact assessment and adaptation to cc in their seventh five year 2021 2025 plan however we do not have available data for the northwestern region yet this study describes the responses of wheat wp under changing climate in the future using the aquacrop model which was calibrated and validated for wheat production based on field experiments and expert judgment future climate data for representative conservation pathways rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to simulate yield and wp in the 2030s 2020 2039 2050s 2040 2059 and 2090s 2080 2099 future yield and wp were then compared to the base 2000 2019 to assess the effect of cc on crop wp and measure the necessary adaptation to cope with the adverse situation in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this cc impact study was conducted in the major wheat growing area in the greater dinajpur region of bangladesh as a case study fig 1 this region consists of three districts second tier administration boundary namely panchagarh dinajpur and thakurgaon and is located between 88 05 e to 89 15 e and 25 10 n to 26 37 n among the 33 agro ecological zones aezs of bangladesh this area is under the old himalayan piedmont plain aez 24 and tista meander floodplain aez 28 which includes the moderately sedimentary slanted land formed by waterways land types of this region are medium highland flooded up to 90 cm during the flood to highland above flood level fertility levels are low to mostly medium organic maters are mostly low to medium soil textures are mostly silty loam to clay loam soils are strongly acidic and suitable crops are rice wheat and maize cropping systems in this region are profoundly diverse concentrated and comparatively complex the predominant rice wheat and maize based double or triple cropping patterns are common practices this study region has the major cropping areas and is essential to the current accomplishment of food security in bangladesh particularly for its dry winter season crop production interestingly an extra long winter season favors the production of various crops specifically wheat a c3 crop this region itself supplies the highest wheat production about one fourth of the country bbs 2018 the bangladesh government has also given high priority to sustaining groundwater irrigation in this region hence low water consuming cereal crops like winter wheat and maize have become popular to be cultivated in this region 2 2 data used 2 2 1 baseline weather data temperature precipitation humidity solar radiation and other daily meteorological data for the study area were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for the period 1990 2019 table 1 this study area has temperate dry winter and hot summer this is the driest region which has less rainfall 1728 mm including large seasonal and spatial variability and is known as a drought prone ecosystem fahad et al 2018 mainuddin and kirby 2015 shahid 2011 the timing of drought might change here due to the uneven distribution of rainfall and increasing temperature the reduced soil moisture content resulting from a decline in winter precipitation and higher evapotranspiration could affect the dry winter season crop production karim et al 1999 2 2 2 future climate data bias corrected 11 regional climate models rcms were used to simulate the future yield and wp of wheat the future daily climate data precipitation and temperature during 2020 2099 for the study area were collected from the repositories of the earth system grid federation esgf and the indian institute of technology madras center for climate change research these rcms were driven from cmip5 global climate models gcms table 2 lists the details of rcms obtained for this study among four rcps of the projection scenarios of ipcc rcp 8 5 the high emission scenario was chosen for this study to predict the climate change response to water productivity at different times in the 21st century rcp 8 5 was selected only for this study because modeling through the higher emission scenario could be a reasonable effort in the impact assessment studies high forcing scenarios for example have a much higher signal to noise ratio for significant impact assessment due to climate change besides rcp 8 5 is used for consistency due to the past ipcc modeling effort cmip5 a2 and a1f1 in the sres scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 time series for this study were selected as base period 2000 2019 and three future times as near future 2030s 2020 2039 mid future 2050s 2040 2059 and far future 2090s 2080 2099 2 2 3 crop management data experiments were carried out in the bangladesh wheat and maize research institute bwmri dinajpur in 2018 for collecting bio physical characteristics data of wheat the design of the experimentation was a split plot including three replications there were three treatments including three seed sowing dates such as 25 november optimum date and two late sowing dates 05 december and 15 december the treatments also include three promising wheat varieties bari gom 26 bari gom 28 bari gom 30 among the treatments sowing dates were set in the main plots and varieties were in subplots the unit experimental field dimensions were 3 m 2 m each field has ten rows including a row to row distance of 20 cm and a block to block distance of 1 5 m agronomic data were collected from those field experiments besides the time series physiological biomass and yield data were collected for calibrating and validating the crop simulation model besides ten potential wheat farmers field data were collected for model calibration and validation these farmers fields were selected for getting data on irrigation fertilizer phenology and yield of wheat in the same experimental year 2018 farmers of the selected crop fields were supplied with questionnaires to collect information regarding farming practices main factors affecting the plantation of crops biomass and yield crop variety crop phenological stages fertilizer and irrigation practices 2 3 methodology the overall methodology of this study is shown in fig 2 various components of the flow diagram of the methodology are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 aquacrop model setup aquacrop 5 0 a water driven wp model raes et al 2009 was used to assess the yield and wp of wheat the biomass growth rate is assumed linearly proportionate to leaf transpiration through a wp parameter in aquacrop model steduto 1996 water productivity parameters are normalized for the climate that enables aquacrop superior applicability in time and space steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 despite the simplified and reduced input variables the aquacrop model maintains a substantial number of key output data such as the simulation of biomass canopy cover soil water components and the crop yield steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model develops from the empirical functions determining the response of yield to evapotranspiration through eq 1 steduto et al 2009 1 1 ya ym ky 1 eta etm where eta denotes actual evapotranspiration which is the summation of soil evaporation es and crop transpiration tr ya and ym denote actual yield and maximum yield respectively ky is the proportionality factor between relative yield loss and relative reduction in evapotranspiration the ya is calculated through the empirical eq 2 2 ya b hi where b denotes biomass and hi denotes harvest index the biomass gets from the aquacrop growth engine with seasonal tr and wp which states aboveground biomass kg production per unit area m2 per unit water transpired m 3 b wp tr the tr is normalized with reference evapotranspiration eto the normalization of tr makes the b tr relationship general applicable to different climatic regimes the simulation runs of the model are usually performed daily time steps using growing degree days or calendar days the normalization of water productivity wp however depends on atmospheric evaporation demands e g eto and co2 concentrations for the diverse locations and seasons including the future of the climate scenarios steduto et al 2009 the normalized crop water productivity for c3 crops like barley is set between 13 and 18 g m 2 raes et al 2009 the aquacrop model is a dynamic crop simulation model advanced in assessing wp specifically a water stressed cropping system the input parameters include a the climate temperature rainfall evaporation and co2 ii the crop development and yield iii the soil water balance and iv the management planting dates application of irrigation and fertilizer raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 2 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis of aquacrop model parameter sensitivity analysis helps to investigate how the model output variables can be accredited to changes in input parameters guiding us to where calibration has to be focused pianosi et al 2016 this analysis was led in this study to assess the influence of input parameters on model output among the default parameters of the current version of aquacrop a few key parameters named non conservative parameters are used as most of the parameters are conservatives for understanding the behavior of the aquacrop model to changes in input parameters the tested input parameters were organized into three classes namely crops soil water and climate based on the comparative effect on the simulated productivity parameters from each class were classified as highly sensitive whether the aquacrop model response to 15 or more changes in the input parameters similarly moderate and low sensible parameters were classified in the case of 2 15 changes and less than 2 changes in input parameters respectively according to geerts et al 2009 sensitivity analysis assists in screening out the non sensitive parameters while defining the highly sensitive parameters in the calibration and validation process dong et al 2004 sensitivity analysis was formerly followed by model calibration 2 3 3 calibration of the aquacrop model calibrations of the crop and soil parameters in aquacrop were done by experimental data in association with expert judgment as proposed by hsiao et al 2009 the outline of the parameters was tracked by altering parameters followed by the substantially representative range the crop file in aquacrop was altered to simulate the observed crop parameters based on the soil parameters at reasonable values the soil water balance was simulated after crop parameter calibration as crop characteristics influence the soil water balance significantly in aquacrop the calibration was done in growing degree day mode as it gives more precise results only when crop development is limited by heat or cold stress the aquacrop model was parameterized and crop databases were constructed for many crops including wheat steduto et al 2012 the parameterization and testing of the model for different crops under local environments take led to the establishment of conservative parameters that do not change significantly with locations for better simulation results conservative parameters still need to be calibrated however that requires extensive measurement on experimental fields as a result for this study conservative parameters are retained and calibration focused on non conservative cultivar specific parameters which were gathered from the experimental data set for this study during the calibration process crop parameters like time to reach different phenological stages were used from experimental data and crop parameters like maximum canopy cover and the rooting depth were fine tuned iteratively until the observed and simulated yield becomes in close agreement soil water stress coefficients for leaf expansion stomatal closure and early canopy senescence were also fine tuned by simply changing different stress classes non conservative parameters were recognized as final if the simulated values matched the measured data significantly 2 3 4 performance evaluation of the aquacrop model model validation makes us conscious of how competently the model works beneath local environments the performance of the aquacrop model during calibration and validation processes were evaluated using the coefÔ¨Åcient of the determination r2 which describes the variances of data willmott s statistics measures namely the index of agreement d the root mean squared error rmse and the normalized root means squared error nmrse willmott 1982 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o m s i s m i 1 n o i o m 2 i 1 n s i s m 2 2 5 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o i o i o m 2 6 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 7 nrmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 100 o m where si is the simulated value for the ith observation oi is the observed value for the ith observation s m and o m are the means of the simulated and observed values respectively and n is the number of observations finally the calibrated and validated model was applied to simulate the base year yield and wp for the study area 2 3 5 the response of future wheat yield wp the future yield and wp of wheat were assessed and compared to the present wp of wheat to assess the climate change impact future climate data for the rcp 8 5 scenario was used to simulate yield and wp for the 2030s near future 2050s mid future and 2090s far future future yield and wp were then estimated compared to the base data 2000 2019 to compare the future results to the baseline the relative changes of crop yield both for wheat were calculated 8 Œ¥ y y future y baseline y baseline 100 where Œ¥ y is the relative change of the crop yield y basel ine is the yield in the base period 2000 2019 y future is the crop yield in the future period these relative changes are analyzed and the reasons for extreme or unusual changes are researched similarly to compare the future to the baseline the relative changes of wp of wheat were calculated 9 Œ¥ wp wp future wp baseline wp baseline 100 where Œ¥ wp is the relative changes of the crop wp wp baseline is the wp in the base period 2000 2019 wp future is the crop wp in the future period these relative changes were analyzed and the reasons for extreme or unusual changes were assessed 2 3 6 adaptation strategies to cope with adverse scenarios measures that support adaptation are taken to cope with the adverse impact of climate change two suitable adaptation strategies such as shifting sowing dates and introducing virtual heat tolerant variety were assessed to reduce the yield and wp loss of wheat in future climate scenarios these adaptation strategies could increase reduce the loss of productivity due to the negative impacts of future climate changes 2 3 6 1 option 1 shifting of the sowing date the optimum sowing date of wheat in the study area is 25 november any dates before or after the optimum date 25 november may alter the yield of wheat due to the favorable condition of the weather 10 day interval forward and backward shifting of the sowing dates with respect to the optimum sowing date 25 november were simulated 10 day backward shifting 15 november and 20 day backward shifting 05 november and 10 day forward shifting 05 december were considered under future changing climate to assess the wheat yield and wp using the aquacrop model with rcp 8 5 scenarios 2 3 6 2 option 2 heat resistant variety a virtual heat resistant variety was designed using the aquacrop model to observe how it performs under an adverse environment in the future in this study a heat resistant characteristic was fused into the existing wheat variety by altering the thresholds of tmax affect reproductive growth specifically in grain filling accordingly the heat tolerant variety was created through increasing 2 c in maximum threshold values in the base varieties as used by singh et al 2014 and tesfaye et al 2018 the potential yield and wp under these adaptation strategies in future time slices were evaluated by assessing them with the aquacrop simulation model compared with the base variety 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameterization and setup of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated by means of experimental and farmers field data set of the year 2018 prior to the sensitivity analysis results show the high sensitivity variables for simulation were senescence time max root zone depth reference harvest index hi0 and wp followed by moderate sensitivity parameters such as maximum canopy cover time to start flowering maximum root depth time to maximize root depth in the case of soil water parameters this model displays high sensitivity to initial soil moisture content and less sensitivity to water extraction pattern and hydraulic conductivity geerts et al 2009 and salemi et al 2011 found similar kind results in their studies the tmax was more sensitive to the output of the model as it affects the yield directly this sensitivity analysis provides suggestions for the most important parameters to be selected for precise field measurements and model calibration 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop models the user specific crop input parameters for wheat bari gom 26 variety were calibrated from experimental and farmers field data literature expert judgment and local conditions crop characteristics soil and climatic conditions in the study area table 3 the calibrated normalized crop water productivity wp for wheat was 15 7 g m 2 which was within the range of the default values set for c3 plants and similar to the values of winter wheat calibrated in china raes et al 2009 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the performance of the aquacrop model under cultivar specific cultivation conditions was assessed based on the data acquired from field experiments and farmers fields the crop growth parameters for wheat were analyzed based on grain yield the agreement between observed and simulated wheat yield during the calibration and validation process is presented in fig 3 the simulated grain yields of wheat agreed significantly to that of observed yields a close correlation between simulated and observed crop parameters was observed during the calibration and validation processes table 4 the nrmse was below 10 for the wheat yield calibration process which indicates excellent model performance similarly the values of d were close to 1 denoting perfect agreement simulated and observed values regarding calibration relatively lower rmse was observed due to cautious parameterization of the aquacrop model though the least error occurs mainly due to the process and human errors this calibrated model was used to assess future yield and wp of wheat in changing climate 3 3 assessment of wheat wp under changing climate 3 3 1 future projections of temperature and rainfall results from the gcm ensemble outputs under the rcp 8 5 during future periods the 2030s 2050s and 2090s for the study area revealed the increasing future temperature compared with the base year 2000 2019 table 5 shows the average monthly temperature and the total rainfall during the future growing period vegetative development and reproductive of wheat both the projected tmax and tmin tend to increase from the baseline during the future time slices during the vegetative and Ô¨Çowering stages of wheat compared with the base year the monthly tmax could be increased by 0 10 5 12 ¬∫c by the near future in the dinajpur region the monthly tmax could be increased by 0 17 6 23 ¬∫c by mid future and 0 73 8 62 ¬∫c by far future table 5 similarly compared with the base year the monthly tmin could be increased by 1 71 5 21 ¬∫c by the near future in the dinajpur region the monthly tmin could be increased by 2 23 6 30 ¬∫c by mid future and 4 78 9 44 ¬∫c by far future projected future monthly rainfall could be increased from the baseline during the wheat growing period specifically in march e g at the maturity stage the variability of the historical yield eta and wp of wheat under present climate conditions and future scenarios were simulated by the aqucrop model 3 3 2 assessment of numerator of wp crop yield the results show that the average yield eta and wp of wheat for the dinajpur region were 3 73 t ha 1 271 mm and 1 37 kg m 3 during the base years 2000 2019 the model simulations show a significant decrease in the yield during the near future mid future and far future fig 4 shows the variations in yield for wheat for the different simulation periods of 2020 2099 the observed higher variations in predicted wheat yields in the future specifically in the 2050s and 2090s might be owing to yearly climatic variations results show a significant yield reduction of 11 6 20 9 and 39 9 could occur in the near future mid future and far future in the dinajpur region table 6 the highest variations were observed in yield ranging from zero to 4 05 4 12 and 4 22 t ha 1 for near future mid future and far future respectively results show a remarkable effect of the future climatic variability on wheat productivity considering different gcms the wheat crop could produce almost no yields in a few observed years might be due to future climatic variability specifically an increase of tmax significantly the number of total crop failures could be occurred mostly in the far future followed by the mid and near future mainuddin et al 2012 found similar crop failure in rice while projecting in 2050 the growth vegetative and development phases of winter wheat in bangladesh exist from december to february january and february are very important since the jointing booting and flowering phases of the winter wheat occurred in these months the grain filling phase occurred in march however the average tmax is observed well above of critical average tmax of 30 c during the reproductive and grain filling stages february march and exceeded the optimum range for wheat growth as speciÔ¨Åed by biswas et al 2017 in their study the future tmin though is observed high which could still be a favorable range for good growth in the future average temperatures are usually unable to specify the plant s cold or heat stress which affects the fertilization and consequently the grain yield raes et al 2009 in aquacrop the upper threshold value of the cold stress is 8 c and the lower threshold value of heat stress is 35 c at which fertilization begins to be failed in this study the wheat crop doesn t experience the cold stress for any rcms because the future tmin observes 8 c during the wheat growing period though the upper level could harm crop development results show the number of days having a tmax 35 c during the entire growing stages of the wheat crop which ranges from 23 to 33 days of the growth cycle for all rcms table 7 the rainfall is expected to increase though in future scenarios this could be significant mainly in april and march whereas it could be insignificant from december to february which is crucial months for vegetative growth flowering and grain formation stages of irrigated wheat moreover during these crucial months both the tmax and tmin could increase significantly which may compensate for the minor positive effects of increased rainfall on irrigated wheat in the future however eta depends on available water at the root zone coming from rainfall in rainfed agriculture the rainfall is the dominating parameter which affects the yield in rainfed agriculture significantly rather than irrigated crop production systems rockstr√∂m et al 2010 heat stress during grain filling appears a major constraint to wheat yield because this stress could intensify the reproductive development rate which reduces photosynthesis duration and seed production as well wheat crop is exposed to high temperatures especially during the anthesis and grain filling phase in this case february march which could prove to be critical in the context of yield formation thus wheat yield could be decreased gradually with the increasing tmax mainly due to the rise of the number of days 35 c researchers have found similar results regarding the tmax effect on wheat yield sofield et al 1977 and wheeler et al 1996 detected the grain filling length of cereals i e wheat was determined principally by temperature higher temperatures 31¬∫c exist before and after the anthesis of wheat could reduction the grain filling rate wardlaw and stone and nicolas et al 1989 1995 the consequence of high temperatures on wheat yields is supposed to be similar to a 2 3 ¬∫c warmer mean temperature during the crop growing season wheeler et al 1996 moreover about 23 loss of yield was reported from 4 days of extreme high temperatures experience stone and nicolas 1995 the impact of this extreme temperature however could be different in different crops and geographical locations consequently uncertainty in crop responses in the future climate should consider significantly rezaei et al 2015 3 3 3 assessment of denominator of wp eta the simulation of actual evapotranspiration eta based on the observed weather data 2000 2019 shows the average eta could be 271 mm for wheat this study shows that eta of wheat could be decreased in the near future mid future and far future under rcp 8 5 emission scenarios fig 5 the aquacrop simulates the shorter duration of the wheat growth as the future crop could achieve the required growing degree days gdd earlier due to the increasing temperature hence eta could be reduced due to the shorter duration which may compensate for the higher demand of eta due to higher temperature yano et al 2007 also observed that eta could be decreased during 2070 2079 while compared to the base period due to a shorter growing season resulting from the temperature rises wheat eta could be decreased by 28 and 8 if compared for the cgcm2 and the rcm data respectively mainly due to the shorter duration projected for the future the consequences of an increasing temperature rise the atmospheric evaporative demand however decreasing wheat eta could reduce crop growing days and transpiration due to the closure of stomatal conductance even through the evaporative demand increases ainsworth and long 2005 observed the significant decreases in eta under raised co2 concentration mainly due to stomatal closure elevated atmospheric co2 concentration could reduce wheat eta due to the reduction of the stomatal conductance the combined effects of the increasing temperature and co2 concentration on the eta varied significantly due to transpiration reduced initiated by stomatal closure which could decrease wheat eta by 24 if compared to without stomata closure yano et al 2007 observed similar trends of eta under the combined effects of increasing co2 and temperature with stomata closure rashid et al 2019 also found the decreasing seasonal wheat eta while compared to the base period they observed the decreasing transpiration with co2 fertilization 10 27 for different rcp scenarios and periods the reduction in transpiration is likely even without co2 fertilization because of the shortening of the growing period nevertheless further research is needed due to the uncertain future changing scenarios 3 3 4 assessment of future wp under changing climate the simulated wheat wp for the base period 2000 2019 based on observed data shows the average wp for 1 37 kg m 3 for wheat results show the wp of wheat could be reduced in the 2030 s 2050 s and 2090 s under rcp 8 5 emission scenarios fig 6 this reduction would be increased gradually over time wheat eta could be decreased through relatively less and similarly to yield along with all future time slices rosenberg et al 1990 observed a 12 17 decrease in eta due to an increase of 40 stomatal resistance jones et al 1985 observed similar results as decreasing eta due to the increasing transpiration which was occurred mainly due to the increasing stomatal resistance in a range of smaller temperature rises 0 2 c the reduced stomatal conductance could alter the global warming effects by reducing the water use in crop production lovelli et al 2010 a few researchers observed the declining stomatal conductance with rising co2 which reduced the length of the growing cycle consequently reduce transpiration of the crops and decreasing eta kruijt et al 2008 therefore aquacrop might simulate the wp somewhat relatively less increasing compared to the significant yield reduction which in turn lessens the future wp deryng et al 2016 found severe negative impacts on global rice maize and wheat yields by 2080 including a minor reduction in eta but a significant reduction in global wp crop wp is enhanced in general by either obtaining higher yields with the same amount of water or using less water to get the same yields zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 in this study the wheat wp could be reduced in the future under changing climate fig 6 even though the eta was reduced due to growing cycle shortening thus for maintaining the wheat wp under future climate change threats increasing the wheat yield production would be more important than increasing the water use efficiency ahmad et al 2020 provide emphasis also on boosting up the yield for sustaining the wheat wp improving crop wp and keeping steady relations with production could be important for water productive food security hence adaptation is consequently an essential concern which should be addressed to reduce the adverse impact of climate change on crop wp 3 4 adaptation measures in reducing yield and wp loss in future 3 4 1 impact of shifting planting date on yield and wp of wheat the consequence of the shifting sowing date on wheat yield and wp were assessed using aquacrop compared to the optimum date of sowing 25 november under future adverse scenarios results show that future wheat yield loss could be reduced if the sowing dates shifted 10 day and 20 day backward to 15 and 5 november respectively whereas yield loss could be increased significantly further if sowing dates shifted 10 day forward to 5 december fig 7 anticipated adverse impacts of climate change could be gradually alleviated by shifting the backward date of sowing projected yield reduction would be offset or ultimately upturned this yield could be increased owing to the availability of favorable temperature during the vegetative and flowering stages which would shift backward in january february rather than march in the future period the reduction in wheat yields thus could be minimized by adopting a simple practice of shifting sowing dates backward without altering benchmark variety water and soil management practices similarly jalota et al 2012 observed that shifting planting dates to 15 days for wheat in a future changing environment resulted in the tiniest yields reduction as a practical adaptation measure for sustaining yields in the future this present study shows the increased yield in the case of early sowing primarily due to the increasing number of days with a favorable climate with the backward shifting of the sowing date total unfavorable days could be reduced and consequently increase the yield by shifting forward the wheat sowing date the negative consequence of tmax could be more in the future changing environment due to the increasing the tmax and decreasing the crop season length as well the winter wheat grain yield is usually restricted by heat stress during the reproductive stages this grain reduction could be further degraded due to such unfavorable growing conditions in the future climate wang et al 2017 projected yield reductions in this study were observed in reproductive stages of wheat due to the high temperature measures through the january march period table 7 asseng et al 2011 indicated the productivity losses due to higher temperatures during the reproductive phase for major wheat growing regions in this particular case the consequences of this study illustrate the average warmer days 35 c in january march during the far future are projected to increase which could reduce the productivity significantly however shifting the sowing date could alter the eta demand in crop development besides shifting the sowing of seeds could help crops to escape the critical higher temperature stages during the flowering stage shrestha et al 2018 similar to yield reduction fig 8 shows the change in wheat wp of baseline cultivar bari gom 26 with different sowing dates for gcms scenarios in the study area relative to wp obtained from the current optimum sowing date the loss of wp of wheat could be fully reduced even reversed in some cases during the future time slices in the case of the 10 day backward shifting sowing date the loss of wp could be reduced in the future all time slices even could be increased 3 5 in the near future after replenishing the losses in the case of 20 day backward shifting the loss of wp could be replenished and even increased up to 10 2 and 11 1 during the mid future and near future respectively for the other dates observed a significant loss of wps could be reduced if compared to the observations without shifting dates on the other hand in a 10 day forward shifting wp could be decreased significantly further for three future periods respectively if compared with wp without adaptation measures 3 5 impact of introducing heat tolerant variety on wp of wheat heat resistance characteristics were fused into the current wheat variety by modifying the tmax limit results show that the current wheat yield and wp could be reduced significantly under future adverse environments if compared to the base however this yield loss could be reduced significantly if the virtual heat tolerant variety introduces under cc through all future time slices studied if compared with the benchmark variety fig 9 a similarly loss of water productivity could be reduced in the virtual heat tolerant variety relative to benchmark varieties under future climate conditions fig 9 b among the adaptation options to cope with the future adverse environment are climate specific and non specific reilly and schimmelpfennig 1999 resurreccion et al 2008 many previous studies krishnan et al 2007 hasegawa et al 2008 laux et al 2010 recommended that altering sowing dates could be a very simple but powerful tool for modifying the adverse impacts of the latent changing climate this study finds similar results in changing the sowing date and introducing the heal tolerant variety offsets the negative effects of changing climate on the wheat yield and wp in the future time slices 4 conclusions strategies to sustain and improve the wheat yield and wp under changing climate in the northwestern region of bangladesh have been assessed wheat yield and wp could be reduced significantly in the future time slices mainly due to the projected higher tmax and tmin during the Ô¨Çowering and ripening stages moreover these rising temperatures may compensate for the minor positive effects of projected rainfall in irrigated winter wheat production wheat eta could be reduced in those time slices due to the shorter duration including the closure efficiency of stomata appropriate adaptation strategies are crucial to mitigate the adverse impact of changing climate improve the productivity of wheat in the future adjustment of the planting date and introducing heat tolerant variety as adaptation options could reduce both yield and wp losses significantly during the future time slices early sowing of seeds could benefit from escaping the critical periods during the flowering stage and could increase the yields and wps significantly in the future this study suggests that adjusting planting dates and introducing heat tolerant variety might be a powerful but very simple tool for mitigating the adverse effect of possible global warming on wheat wp finally stakeholders policy and decision makers can use this information to rationalize the type of measures for improving water

have been adopted as an additional constraint on watershed modeling to enhance the accuracy of water cycling predictions while reducing uncertainty however plant parameters affecting evapotranspiration et in watershed models are poorly calibrated without the use of appropriate constraints the goal of this study is to assess the predictive uncertainty of the soil and water assessment tool swat depending on the inclusion or exclusion of annual crop yield as an additional constraint for an agricultural watershed we analyzed the simulated results with acceptable performance measures depending on a varying degree of model constraints one constraint streamflow two constraints streamflow and rs et and three constraints streamflow rs et and crop yield the three performance measures used were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias p bias and kling gupta efficiency kge as the number of model s constraints increased the number of acceptable parameter sets were substantially reduced from 180 acceptable for streamflow to 116 acceptable for streamflow and rs et and 2 acceptable for streamflow rs et and crop yield in addition overall model performance measures for et were greatest in the simulation results with three constraints representing 0 02 0 2 and 0 04 0 05 greater nse and kge values than those of one constraint and two constraints respectively the parameter set with the best et performance measures was also acceptable for predicting crop yield based on these results we conclude that this crop yield data can be adopted as a model constraint for agricultural watersheds to reduce model uncertainty in et simulations and to increase model prediction accuracy keywords remotely sensed evapotranspiration additional constraint watershed modeling predictive uncertainty 1 introduction water cycling within a watershed is characterized by a combination of climatic hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions edwards et al 2015 mcdonnell 2013 the level of water balance is determined by climatic factors such as the trade off between precipitation and evapotranspiration et relative to climatic conditions associated with the amount of water stored in a watershed hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions control the pathway of water as it flows downstream edwards et al 2015 mcdonnell 2013 steep topography and soils with low infiltration potential direct water toward downstream areas via surface runoff which flows horizontally across land surfaces when rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity in contrast groundwater serves as a key pathway in flat regions with a high infiltration capacity lee et al 2020a for agricultural watersheds human activities must be considered to improve our understanding of water and nutrient cycling in conjunction with climatic hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions mccarty et al 2008 various activities e g irrigation fertilization planting and harvesting of plants conducted on croplands will substantially modify water and nutrient cycling water applied for irrigation under dry conditions fosters crop growth affecting water loss by et and soil water content mahmood and hubbard 2003 meanwhile fertilizers supply nutrients for crop development subsequently affecting crop soil interactions huang et al 2003 a modeling approach is frequently adopted to simulate the interactions of climate crop and soil across agricultural watersheds the soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the united states department of agriculture usda is a representative model for assessing water and nutrient cycling within agricultural landscapes alemayehu et al 2017 lee et al 2016 strauch and volk 2013 the model allows for the parameterization of agricultural practices and their interactions with climatic and soil conditions neitsch et al 2011 however the use of the swat model is often challenging due to the model s inherent uncertainty the most common reason for this uncertainty relates to insufficient observational data seibert and mcdonnell 2002 yen et al 2016 this limitation leads to inaccurate model parameterization and subsequently less reliable model outputs due to the increased complexity of water cycling that results from natural conditions coupled with human activities the model s uncertainty can be greater in agricultural watersheds than in watersheds with minimal human intervention many recent studies have applied remotely sensed evapotranspiration rs et to the swat model as a constraint to improve predictability while reducing uncertainty becker et al 2019 herman et al 2018 lee et al 2021 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 et is a key component in water cycling as it represents water and energy transfers between the land surface and atmosphere schlesinger and jasechko 2014 the inclusion of rs et is particularly important in agricultural watersheds because et dynamics are substantially affected by crop growth however previous studies have tended to tune et parameters including hydrologic and plant characteristics against rs et without including plant data becker et al 2019 herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 these methods might produce less accurate swat predictions because the plant contribution to et is poorly reflected in swat simulations plant dynamics in agricultural watersheds are highly dependent on crop rotation and associated activities thus the characterization of crop activities might result in more accurate predictions of water cycling within agricultural watersheds the cropland data layer cdl available from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda nass shows annual continental level crop rotation compiling multi year cdls is useful in identifying major crop rotations for individual fields and their spatial configurations lee et al 2016 the usda nass also provides annual crop yield data at state and county levels a study by nair et al 2011 reported that the inclusion of crop yields for model simulation is highly beneficial in improving model accuracy therefore the objective of this study is to explore the impact of crop yield on the predictive uncertainty of the swat model in estimating the et of an agricultural watershed the swat model was selected for this study because it can be effectively used to explore changes in water quantity and quality across agricultural landscapes teshager et al 2016 we adopted the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 as it represents crop rotations and configurations based on cdls well the usda crop yield and rs et data were applied as model constraints for et following common practices we first calibrated the swat against streamflow and rs et then we further constrained the swat using crop yield data for the individual calibration process we identified acceptable parameter sets for streamflow hereafter referred to as par f streamflow and rs et hereafter referred to as par fe and for streamflow rs et and crop yield hereafter referred to as par fec we compared the three parameter sets and their outputs to determine the contribution of crop yield data to reduction of predictive uncertainty in the model s performance in particular we focused on the degree of equifinality i e the fact that multiple parameter sets generate equally acceptable model performances beven 2001 as additional observations are commonly introduced into watershed modeling to address equifinality issues beven 2001 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we explored the utility of streamflow et and crop yield constraints to swat in the sub basin of the choptank river watershed tuckahoe creek watershed tcw in the northeastern us fig 1 the soils of the watershed are almost evenly divided into well 46 and poorly 54 drained soils according to the usda natural resources conservation service soil survey geographical database the major land cover types were croplands 54 and forests 33 followed by pastures 8 urban land 4 and water bodies 1 in the croplands corn and soybean are mainly cultivated during the summer april to october to support the poultry industry sexton et al 2010 during the winter season november to march double crop winter wheat or cover crops are often planted hively et al 2009 the climatic conditions of the tcw exhibit a humid temperature with annual average precipitation of 1200 mm ator et al 2006 the past ten year data show that the seasonal variability of precipitation is small while high et seasonality leads to annual water budget fluctuations in which it is high and low during the winter and summer respectively lee et al 2020b 2 2 swat the swat model is a physical based semi distributed watershed model that operates continuously in time at daily time steps neitsch et al 2011 the model includes multiple components that account for climate hydrology land cover land management nutrients pesticides algae vegetation growth channel routing and reservoirs neitsch et al 2011 the basic modeling unit the hydrologic response unit hru is generated within individual sub watersheds based on the unique combination of land use soil type and slope a sub watershed is delineated within the watershed using a digital elevation model dem with 10 meter resolution model variables are simulated at the hru level and the outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed levels via routing and reservoir processes the water balance of individual hrus was calculated using the following 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf et a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content mm h2o sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is time days r day is the amount of precipitation mm h2o q surf is the amount of surface runoff mm h2o et a is the amount of actual et mm h2o w seep is the amount of percolation and bypass flow at the bottom of the soil profile mm h2o and q gw is the amount of groundwater flow mm h2o the swat model first estimates the potential evapotranspiration pet to compute actual evapotranspiration et a in swat pet denotes the amount of water evaporated and transpired under saturated soil water conditions the pet concept in the swat model is different from the reference et eto defined by the fao method that is the et rate from a grass reference surface liu et al 2015 pereira et al 2021 the swat model provides three options for computing the potential evapotranspiration pet penman monteith priestley taylor and hargreaves neitsch et al 2011 the penman monteith method was adopted in this study because it is the most commonly used method in swat model studies and it considers the impact of plants on pet furthermore this study is comparable to earlier studies parajuli et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 that have adopted this method details regarding the use of the penman monteith equation to calculate pet in the swat model are available in neitsch et al 2011 after pet estimation the swat model computes et a by adjusting pet with consideration of canopy interception crop transpiration and soil evaporation neitsch et al 2011 et a was investigated in this study and this terminology et a is referred to as et hereafter in the swat model crop yield is computed as a fraction of the above ground crop biomass plant biomass growth is simulated using the heat unit approach neitsch et al 2011 biomass growth is allowed at a daily time step when the daily average temperature is higher than the base temperature which varies by species the daily heat unit is computed by subtracting the base temperature from the average temperature if the base temperature is equal to or greater than the average temperature the daily heat unit is zero the plant uptake of water and nutrients for biomass growth ceases once the cumulative daily heat unit reaches the plant maturity heat unit threshold crop yield yld was calculated as a function of the harvest index hi and above ground biomass bio ag as follows 2 yld bio ag hi when hi 1 0 3 yld bio ag 1 1 1 hi when hi 1 0 where bio ag is the aboveground biomass on the day of harvest kg ha 1 further details are available in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 input and calibration data detailed climate and geospatial data were prepared to run the swat model table 1 specifically we obtained the daily precipitation and temperature records from 1999 to 2020 from the national oceanic atmospheric administration national climate data center climate monitoring stations chestertown usc00181750 royal oak usc00187806 and greensboro us1mdcl0009 fig 1 unavailable observations daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were produced using the swat model s built in weather generator neitsch et al 2011 previous studies constructed daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed using a weather generator when the observed three climatic data were not available and these studies provided acceptable model performances wu and xu 2006 zhao et al 2020 in our study region the generated climatic data have been frequently used for swat modeling and the simulations depicted the observed streamflow and nitrate loads well lee et al 2016 sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2016 produced a land use map reflecting local agricultural practices e g crop rotations fertilizer applications planting and harvesting dates they identified eight major crop rotations table s1 and their locations by aggregating multi year cdls detailed agricultural practices for individual crop rotations were developed via communication with local experts table 2 because of the high variability in individual farmer s schedules the average dates of planting harvesting and fertilizer applications were used to specify detailed practices associated with each rotation table 2 by adopting the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 detailed agricultural practices were considered in our simulations due to a lack of detailed information irrigation practices were not considered in this study the raw dem used in the swat simulations was generated from the maryland department of natural resources with post processing conducted by the usda ars beltsville the soil map was obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo monthly streamflow data from 2001 to 2020 collected at the usgs gauging station 01491500 were downloaded for model calibration and validation fig 1 the daily rs et data were generated at 4 km spatial resolution with the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 2007 1997 alexi relates the morning land surface temperature rise retrieved from thermal imaging collected by the geostationary operational environmental satellites goes to compute the surface energy balance partitioning net radiation

evaporation daily et estimates from alexi have been evaluated against eddy covariance flux measurements within the choptank river watershed using the disalexi flux downscaling algorithm anderson et al 2004 2018 yielding an average relative error of 10 sun et al 2017 the 4 km rs et retrievals used here span the period from january 2001 to december 2020 in addition we prepared annual corn and soybean yield data for model calibration and validation because the watershed is predominantly occupied by croplands an accurate simulation of the crop yield is likely to increase the accuracy of the et estimates of the swat these yield data county level yield data 2001 2020 for caroline and queen anne s counties in maryland where the tcw is situated were downloaded from the usda nass 2 4 model evaluation model simulations were evaluated at a monthly time step for 22 year periods monthly values were used because daily simulation outputs tended to depict hydrologic variables poorly as compared with the monthly simulations yeo et al 2019b 2014 the rs et data were aggregated to a watershed scale at a monthly interval for model calibration and validation in total 10 000 parameter sets were prepared using the latin hypercube sampling method which partitions the allowable ranges of each parameter into sub ranges with an equal likelihood to appear and selects one parameter value at each sub range mckay et al 2000 the number of parameter sets was decided based on the general swat calibration approach given in abbaspour et al 2017 this study used 15 hydrologic and 14 plant parameters table 3 that have been noted as the parameters sensitive to streamflow and crop in previous studies parajuli et al 2013 sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 the first two years 1999 2000 were set as the spin up period to calibrate streamflow et and crop yield the remaining simulation periods were split into two periods calibration 2001 2010 and validation 2011 2020 the accuracy of monthly streamflow and et was quantified using the three measures eqs 4 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse moriasi et al 2007 percent bias p bias moriasi et al 2007 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 these three statistics are frequently used to assess model predictability for streamflow and et arnold et al 2012 rajib et al 2020 yeo et al 2019b in addition this study adopted multiple measures since one performance measure may fail to generate the desired calibration results mizukami et al 2019 nse represents how well observed and simulated data fit into the 1 1 line with the range of nse varying from and 1 0 optimal value moriasi et al 2007 p bias computes the average tendency of the simulations relative to the corresponding observations the closer p bias is to zero the more accurate

coefficient œÉ s œÉ o and Œº s Œº o indicate the variability ratio and bias between simulations and observations respectively and œÉ and Œº are the standard deviation and mean of the variables respectively the subscripts s and o indicate the simulations and observations respectively referring to the previous studies srinivasan et al 2010 woznicki et al 2015 percent bias p bias was only used as a model performance measure for crop yields the three performance measures were computed using the hydroeval package of the python program hallouin 2020 acceptable model performance was identified using the following metrics monthly streamflow and et for calibration and validation nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 and annual crop yields for calibration and validation p bias 25 based on the swat model evaluation guideline for satisfactory criteria moriasi et al 2007 strict values were set as the acceptable threshold for streamflow and et in this study the acceptable performance measure for the crop yield p bias 25 was adopted from wang et al 2012 2 5 uncertainty analysis model constraints applied by additional data can lead to a substantial reduction in the degree of equifinality her and chaubey 2015 wambura et al 2018 we first compared the degree of equifinality among the par f par fe and par fec among the 10 000 parameter sets the par f only included the parameter sets with acceptable performances for only streamflow nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 and the par fe represented the parameter sets acceptable for both streamflow and et nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 the par fe that exhibited acceptable performance for corn p bias 25 and soybean p bias 25 yield were selected for the par fec comparing the par fe and par fec could demonstrate whether crop yield data are useful to reduce the degree of equifinality with respect to the model predictive uncertainty in the et simulation the uncertainty of individual parameters for the par fe was compared using a coefficient of variation cv statistic calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the parameter values by their mean and multiplying the resulting ratio by 100 this dimensionless statistic is a practical tool for assessing the uncertainty of behavioral parameter values her and chaubey 2015 we calculated the cv of individual parameters to determine which parameters had significant impacts on the et simulations parameter sensitivity table 3 was computed using a global sensitivity analysis that fits a linear regression between the objective function value and the parameters khalid et al 2016 the objective function value was defined as the nse for estimating et the global sensitivity method estimates the average changes in the objective function relative to changes in each parameter while all other parameters are simultaneously modified khalid et al 2016 parameter sensitivity increases as the absolute value of the t statistics increases and the associated p value decreases 3 results 3 1 model predictive uncertainty 3 1 1 degree of equifinality because the excess of acceptable parameter sets is a key issue in equifinality we began by counting the number of acceptable parameter sets each time additional constraints were introduced fig 2 of the initial 10 000 parameter sets 180 were found to provide an acceptable performance measure for streamflow i e par f alone an acceptable level of performance for the combination of streamflow and et was found in 116 individual parameter sets par fe when the model calibration was further constrained by crop yield the number of acceptable parameter sets par fec was reduced from 116 to 2 these results may indicate that predictive uncertainty existed in the et estimates when the model was calibrated only against streamflow and rs et and that the additional model constraint acquired from crop yield data reduced this uncertainty these results are consistent with the results of a previous study ilampooranan et al 2021 also demonstrating that crop yield data were useful in reducing parameter uncertainty and equifinality overall the model s performance measures for monthly et improved with the inclusion of additional constraints fig 3 the greatest median values of nse and kge for monthly et were observed during the calibration and validation periods in the simulations by par fec the median nse and kge values of par fec were 0 02 0 2 and 0 04 0 05 greater than those of par f and par fe respectively table s3 in the case of p bias values par fec showed values similar to par f and par fe during the calibration period but par f and par fe were slightly lower than par fec during the validation period 3 2 parameter uncertainty using 29 parameter sets with acceptable model performance for streamflow and rs et par fe the cv values of the top ten most sensitive parameters were computed as shown in fig 4 the sensitivity ranking of each parameter is listed in table 3 the parameter uncertainty was greatest for the parameter that controls the leaf area development of soybeans frwrw1 indicating that acceptable values for the frwrw1 soyb parameters were most widely dispersed in contrast the parameters that control the leaf area development of corn frwrw2 produced the lowest cv 3 3 evaluation of simulation results 3 3 1 streamflow the simulated streamflows from par f par fe and par fec were compared with the corresponding observations as shown in figs 5 and 6 simulated streamflow from par fe represented a narrow range of flow duration curves and was closer to observed streamflow than was the simulated streamflow of par f this finding is consistent with the model performance measures representing greater prediction accuracy for par fe relative to par f the two par fecs indicated by par fec 1 and par fec 2 in fig 5 depicted observed streamflow well but the par fecs were underestimated during low flow conditions flows with probability of exceedance 80 these results regarding the flow duration curves show that streamflow predictions were better represented by the model constrained by streamflow and rs et than by the model constrained only by streamflow but that use of crop yield did not substantially improve streamflow predictions as with the flow duration curves the range of simulated time series streamflow from par fe was narrower than that from par f fig 6 and the most representative observed streamflow was found in par fe the simulations from par fe tended to be negatively biased compared with observations especially for high streamflow events fig 6 3 3 2 evapotranspiration the seasonal variations in all acceptable et estimates from the par fe and par fec were similar to those in the rs et fig 7 specifically et peaked in july and reached its minimum in december or january showing results that are consistent with those of an earlier study by fisher et al 2010 as well as with local tower measurement results sun et al 2017 most observed rs et values were within the range of par fe which may imply that an additional constraint for et is useful to simulate et dynamics in this region the par fe and par fec consistently underestimated et during the winter months dec feb this underestimation might be due to inaccurate parameterization of crops during the winter months and to errors in the rs et during the cold seasons 3 3 3 crop yield the observed and simulated crop yields are shown in fig 8 the model performance measures p biases for the par fec 1 were 10 7 calibration and 17 validation for corn and were 22 7 calibration and 11 validation for soybean respectively par fec 2 showed performance measures of 16 8 calibration and 24 2 validation for corn and 20 7 calibration and 7 7 validation for soybean respectively interestingly the par fec 1 not only produced the best et performance measures among the 116 par fe but it also predicted crop yield better than par fec 2 this finding shows that constraining the model constrained with crop yield data can reduce the number of acceptable parameter sets and improve the accuracy of model predictions for et and yield 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainty with additional constraints the simulated results show increased model performance measures and decreased equifinality by gradually adding a constraint figs 2 and 3 this finding may underline the importance of additional constraints in improving the performance of hydrologic models a study by nijzink et al 2018 also found that hydrologic model predictions were improved by an increase in the number of constraining data bai et al 2018 highlighted significant improvements of model predictions as a result of additional constraints both the degree of equifinality and model performance measures directly indicate the benefit of additional constraints this benefit can be interpreted based on hydrological processes watershed water cycling is normally computed using four components precipitation et streamflow soil water and groundwater dynamics edwards et al 2015 et and streamflow are the components reducing watershed water balance by transferring land surface water from terrestrial to atmospheric systems and directing precipitation falling within a watershed to downstream waters along the stream networks respectively oki and kanae 2006 therefore the simultaneous control of parameters against two constraints et and streamflow may lead to better replications of actual hydrological processes the amount of water transported outside of the system via streamflow and et is influenced by a water stored in soil layers within the system edwards et al 2015 in agricultural watersheds a substantial amount of water stored in soil layers is strongly dependent on crop dynamics li et al 2014 considering the chain of water cycling simulated results further constrained by crop yield par fec 1 and par fec 2 showed predictions improvements the two parameter sets par fec 1 and par fec 2 showed high similarity in parameter values table s2 and performance measures table s4 a noticeable difference was observed in the parameter sol z that controls the soil water flow rate the parameter increased by 27 in par fec 1 while decreased by 39 in par fec 2 this difference might lead to quick par fec 1 and slow par fec 2 drainage of soil water resulting in high streamflow of par fec 2 relative to that of par fec 1 during low flow conditions fig 5 et was greater in par fec 1 relative to par fec 2 fig 7 which was likely driven by a lower esco of par fec 1 0 05 compared to par fec 2 0 40 regarding that the lower esco is the greater potential evaporation in soils is crop yield parameters of par fec 1 and par fec 2 also differed but the differences do not well explain varied crop yield predictions between two parameter sets swat crop parameters simulate crop total biomass including above ground and root biomass and then a portion of the total biomass is computed as crop yield to better inform the impact of crop parameters and predict crop yield an advanced swat model would be necessary the analysis of parameter uncertainty provided an interesting point fig 4 among all six vegetation parameters were listed within the ten most sensitive parameters implying that plant parameters should be adjusted for et calibration this result supports the et simulation approach proposed by rajib et al 2018 where the importance of plant parameters was emphasized among these plant parameters those related to corn were more frequently found in the top ten sensitivity parameters than those related to soybeans table 3 this is because corn which was found within a larger fraction of cultivation fields 55 of the total croplands within the study site had a greater impact on et variance compared to soybeans which were found in a smaller fraction of cultivation fields 45 of the total croplands 4 2 simulation results with additional constraints the swat model was calibrated against three constraints and the underestimation of simulated streamflow was found in fig 6 this is likely the result of inherent model limitations and poor precipitation data specifically the swat model tends to produce poor simulations regarding the impact of heavy precipitation because the duration and intensity of precipitation are not considered in the partitioning of water into surface runoff and infiltration qiu et al 2012 the second reason for this underestimation is that the precipitation data collected at weather stations may not fully represent spatial variations in rainfall conditions across the entire study site localized precipitation variability has been observed frequently at this site a fact which might further contribute to the underestimation of streamflow lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2019b 2014 future studies in this region need to use grid format climatic data to consider spatial variability cristiano et al 2017 the overall results of the et estimates from par fe and par fec was lower than that from rs et especially during the summer months june august fig 7 this can be attributed to the absence of irrigation practices in swat simulations in contrast to the thermal et remote sensing approach which implicitly captures the impact of irrigation on et hain et al 2015 the et underestimation during the summer months was greatest during 2007 which had the lowest summer precipitation over the simulation period 2001 2020 such low summer precipitation increases the need for irrigation water to aid in crop production and irrigation likely occurred most frequently during the summer of 2007 however irrigation practices were not represented in our swat simulations leading to great differences between the et simulations and rs et this finding supports the hypothesis that neglect of irrigation can produce underestimation in swat predicted et therefore irrigation practices should be included in swat simulations to more accurately represent the et in agricultural watersheds where irrigation is commonly conducted however the lack of irrigation data for our study site limited our ability to explicitly consider irrigation in our model furthermore vegetation in forested areas accounted for 33 of the study site these areas were simulated using default growth parameters mainly because of the absence of calibration data for forest growth finally depressional wetlands susceptible to water loss via et are abundant in the forested areas of this region thus underestimation of et in the forested settings may be as a result of the above factors for disparities in simulated et compared to rs et even though the par fec satisfied the predefined model performance measures for crop yield p bias 25 large discrepancies between simulated and observed crop yield were found in some years fig 8 most corn yield simulations were underestimated relative to observations while soybean predictions were both over and under estimated our simulation set up the average date of crop planting and harvesting across all individual croplands owing to the lack of precise farm data which might have contributed to differences between simulations and observations the limited information about actual cultivation practices has been previously reported as the main difficulty in predicting crop yield srinivasan et al 2010 furthermore the exclusion of irrigation practices in simulations practices might cause poor predictions of crop yield li et al 2019 irrigated water is frequently used in our study to achieve targeted crop yield and irrigation practices are regarded as a key factor for crop growth tamburino et al 2020 similar et results absence of irrigation might contribute to the difference between observed and simulated crop yield 4 3 implications and limitations modeling agricultural watersheds is important to efficiently manage water resources and mitigate water quality degradations bracmort et al 2006 cai et al 2002 prior to using modeling tools the reliability and robustness of modeling results should be thoroughly confirmed via model calibration validation arnold et al 2012 since the model calibration process is dependent on observational data the agriculture specific dataset would be useful to increase the credibility of modeling results for agricultural landscapes crop yield data have been normally viewed as a prediction target rather than observations for improving model accuracy srinivasan et al 2010 wang et al 2012 this study emphasized the inclusion of crop yield as a model constrain demonstrating the potential of crop yield to reduce model uncertainty by addressing the agriculture specific observational dataset i e crop yield this study addressed a potential approach to increase water cycling predictions across agricultural watersheds the effort would lead to extended understanding of agricultural water resources our results show the value of consideration of crop yield to reduce equifinality for an agricultural watershed however it is necessary to consider the uncertainties embedded in yield data as well discrepancies may exist between crop yield calibration data acquired from county level statistics and watershed level simulated yield mainly because of spatial mismatching in general crop yield data are available at administrative scales but not at hydrologic scales recent progress in remote sensing techniques and abundant statistical data provide opportunities to better constrain model parameters yeo et al 2019a modis driven leaf area index lai may be an alternative plant constraint however this study focused on agricultural watersheds and the coarse spatial resolutions approximately 500 m of modis lai this may not represent the lai values of specific crops because small farmlands ranging from 0 05 km2 to 1 3 km2 are randomly distributed across the watershed downscaled modis lai to 30 m resolution data would be a promising option for future studies that use lai for agricultural landscapes gao et al 2012 our calibration approach using an additional crop yield constraint provided acceptable et and crop yield predictions this approach reduced the degree of equifinality in estimating et and it might better calibrate crop growth however this does not necessarily assure accurate predictions of et through the contribution of crop yield because a limited amount of observed yield data once per year may not accurately capture crop growth time series remotely sensed lai with high spatial resolution might better reflect crop transpiration as such data can potentially be used to calibrate crop growth over the course of the growing period incorporating remotely sensed lai into swat modeling was found to improve water quantity and quality variable model predictions rajib et al 2020 furthermore the strong relations between lai dynamics from remotely sensed data and irrigation practices were detected in agricultural areas supporting the importance of lai in understanding agricultural water resources li et al 2021 the addition of irrigation practices to the model simulation should also make contribution to improved predictions of et future studies should use remotely sensed lai and et for agricultural watershed modeling and reflect irrigation practices into simulations 5 conclusions this study assessed the swat predictive uncertainty for an agricultural watershed with regard to the presence or absence of an additional crop yield constraint although rs et has recently been employed as calibration data to improve model predictions et parameters are not typically tuned for plant calibration data when estimating et despite the fact that transpiration controlled by plants accounts for a substantial portion of et to address this limitation crop yield data were introduced in conjunction with rs et in this study detailed crop rotations and configurations were also thoroughly reflected in the swat model with regard to the influence of cultivation activities on agricultural watersheds simulated results that met the model s performance measures for one constraint streamflow for two constraints streamflow and rs et and for three constraints streamflow rs et and crop yield were compared the comparison results showed that the degree of equifinality was considerably reduced from 180 parameter sets one constraint to 116 two constraints and finally to 2 three constraints along with a reduction in equifinality the model s performance measures increased as additional constraints were included finally one of the two acceptable parameter sets for three constraints indicated the best et performance measures our results found that irrigation practices are critical to improved et modeling in agricultural watersheds these results suggest that crop yield data can be utilized to reduce a model s predictive uncertainty in et estimates and increase the model s prediction accuracy

9602,water cycling within agricultural watersheds includes high uncertainty because of natural and anthropogenic factors e g cultivation practices remotely sensed evapotranspiration products rs et have been adopted as an additional constraint on watershed modeling to enhance the accuracy of water cycling predictions while reducing uncertainty however plant parameters affecting evapotranspiration et in watershed models are poorly calibrated without the use of appropriate constraints the goal of this study is to assess the predictive uncertainty of the soil and water assessment tool swat depending on the inclusion or exclusion of annual crop yield as an additional constraint for an agricultural watershed we analyzed the simulated results with acceptable performance measures depending on a varying degree of model constraints one constraint streamflow two constraints streamflow and rs et and three constraints streamflow rs et and crop yield the three performance measures used were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias p bias and kling gupta efficiency kge as the number of model s constraints increased the number of acceptable parameter sets were substantially reduced from 180 acceptable for streamflow to 116 acceptable for streamflow and rs et and 2 acceptable for streamflow rs et and crop yield in addition overall model performance measures for et were greatest in the simulation results with three constraints representing 0 02 0 2 and 0 04 0 05 greater nse and kge values than those of one constraint and two constraints respectively the parameter set with the best et performance measures was also acceptable for predicting crop yield based on these results we conclude that this crop yield data can be adopted as a model constraint for agricultural watersheds to reduce model uncertainty in et simulations and to increase model prediction accuracy keywords remotely sensed evapotranspiration additional constraint watershed modeling predictive uncertainty 1 introduction water cycling within a watershed is characterized by a combination of climatic hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions edwards et al 2015 mcdonnell 2013 the level of water balance is determined by climatic factors such as the trade off between precipitation and evapotranspiration et relative to climatic conditions associated with the amount of water stored in a watershed hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions control the pathway of water as it flows downstream edwards et al 2015 mcdonnell 2013 steep topography and soils with low infiltration potential direct water toward downstream areas via surface runoff which flows horizontally across land surfaces when rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity in contrast groundwater serves as a key pathway in flat regions with a high infiltration capacity lee et al 2020a for agricultural watersheds human activities must be considered to improve our understanding of water and nutrient cycling in conjunction with climatic hydrogeomorphic and topographic conditions mccarty et al 2008 various activities e g irrigation fertilization planting and harvesting of plants conducted on croplands will substantially modify water and nutrient cycling water applied for irrigation under dry conditions fosters crop growth affecting water loss by et and soil water content mahmood and hubbard 2003 meanwhile fertilizers supply nutrients for crop development subsequently affecting crop soil interactions huang et al 2003 a modeling approach is frequently adopted to simulate the interactions of climate crop and soil across agricultural watersheds the soil and water assessment tool swat developed by the united states department of agriculture usda is a representative model for assessing water and nutrient cycling within agricultural landscapes alemayehu et al 2017 lee et al 2016 strauch and volk 2013 the model allows for the parameterization of agricultural practices and their interactions with climatic and soil conditions neitsch et al 2011 however the use of the swat model is often challenging due to the model s inherent uncertainty the most common reason for this uncertainty relates to insufficient observational data seibert and mcdonnell 2002 yen et al 2016 this limitation leads to inaccurate model parameterization and subsequently less reliable model outputs due to the increased complexity of water cycling that results from natural conditions coupled with human activities the model s uncertainty can be greater in agricultural watersheds than in watersheds with minimal human intervention many recent studies have applied remotely sensed evapotranspiration rs et to the swat model as a constraint to improve predictability while reducing uncertainty becker et al 2019 herman et al 2018 lee et al 2021 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 et is a key component in water cycling as it represents water and energy transfers between the land surface and atmosphere schlesinger and jasechko 2014 the inclusion of rs et is particularly important in agricultural watersheds because et dynamics are substantially affected by crop growth however previous studies have tended to tune et parameters including hydrologic and plant characteristics against rs et without including plant data becker et al 2019 herman et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 these methods might produce less accurate swat predictions because the plant contribution to et is poorly reflected in swat simulations plant dynamics in agricultural watersheds are highly dependent on crop rotation and associated activities thus the characterization of crop activities might result in more accurate predictions of water cycling within agricultural watersheds the cropland data layer cdl available from the usda national agricultural statistics service usda nass shows annual continental level crop rotation compiling multi year cdls is useful in identifying major crop rotations for individual fields and their spatial configurations lee et al 2016 the usda nass also provides annual crop yield data at state and county levels a study by nair et al 2011 reported that the inclusion of crop yields for model simulation is highly beneficial in improving model accuracy therefore the objective of this study is to explore the impact of crop yield on the predictive uncertainty of the swat model in estimating the et of an agricultural watershed the swat model was selected for this study because it can be effectively used to explore changes in water quantity and quality across agricultural landscapes teshager et al 2016 we adopted the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 as it represents crop rotations and configurations based on cdls well the usda crop yield and rs et data were applied as model constraints for et following common practices we first calibrated the swat against streamflow and rs et then we further constrained the swat using crop yield data for the individual calibration process we identified acceptable parameter sets for streamflow hereafter referred to as par f streamflow and rs et hereafter referred to as par fe and for streamflow rs et and crop yield hereafter referred to as par fec we compared the three parameter sets and their outputs to determine the contribution of crop yield data to reduction of predictive uncertainty in the model s performance in particular we focused on the degree of equifinality i e the fact that multiple parameter sets generate equally acceptable model performances beven 2001 as additional observations are commonly introduced into watershed modeling to address equifinality issues beven 2001 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we explored the utility of streamflow et and crop yield constraints to swat in the sub basin of the choptank river watershed tuckahoe creek watershed tcw in the northeastern us fig 1 the soils of the watershed are almost evenly divided into well 46 and poorly 54 drained soils according to the usda natural resources conservation service soil survey geographical database the major land cover types were croplands 54 and forests 33 followed by pastures 8 urban land 4 and water bodies 1 in the croplands corn and soybean are mainly cultivated during the summer april to october to support the poultry industry sexton et al 2010 during the winter season november to march double crop winter wheat or cover crops are often planted hively et al 2009 the climatic conditions of the tcw exhibit a humid temperature with annual average precipitation of 1200 mm ator et al 2006 the past ten year data show that the seasonal variability of precipitation is small while high et seasonality leads to annual water budget fluctuations in which it is high and low during the winter and summer respectively lee et al 2020b 2 2 swat the swat model is a physical based semi distributed watershed model that operates continuously in time at daily time steps neitsch et al 2011 the model includes multiple components that account for climate hydrology land cover land management nutrients pesticides algae vegetation growth channel routing and reservoirs neitsch et al 2011 the basic modeling unit the hydrologic response unit hru is generated within individual sub watersheds based on the unique combination of land use soil type and slope a sub watershed is delineated within the watershed using a digital elevation model dem with 10 meter resolution model variables are simulated at the hru level and the outputs are aggregated at the sub watershed and watershed levels via routing and reservoir processes the water balance of individual hrus was calculated using the following 1 sw t sw 0 i 1 t r day q surf et a w seep q gw where sw t is the final soil water content mm h2o sw 0 is the initial soil water content mm h2o t is time days r day is the amount of precipitation mm h2o q surf is the amount of surface runoff mm h2o et a is the amount of actual et mm h2o w seep is the amount of percolation and bypass flow at the bottom of the soil profile mm h2o and q gw is the amount of groundwater flow mm h2o the swat model first estimates the potential evapotranspiration pet to compute actual evapotranspiration et a in swat pet denotes the amount of water evaporated and transpired under saturated soil water conditions the pet concept in the swat model is different from the reference et eto defined by the fao method that is the et rate from a grass reference surface liu et al 2015 pereira et al 2021 the swat model provides three options for computing the potential evapotranspiration pet penman monteith priestley taylor and hargreaves neitsch et al 2011 the penman monteith method was adopted in this study because it is the most commonly used method in swat model studies and it considers the impact of plants on pet furthermore this study is comparable to earlier studies parajuli et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 wambura et al 2018 that have adopted this method details regarding the use of the penman monteith equation to calculate pet in the swat model are available in neitsch et al 2011 after pet estimation the swat model computes et a by adjusting pet with consideration of canopy interception crop transpiration and soil evaporation neitsch et al 2011 et a was investigated in this study and this terminology et a is referred to as et hereafter in the swat model crop yield is computed as a fraction of the above ground crop biomass plant biomass growth is simulated using the heat unit approach neitsch et al 2011 biomass growth is allowed at a daily time step when the daily average temperature is higher than the base temperature which varies by species the daily heat unit is computed by subtracting the base temperature from the average temperature if the base temperature is equal to or greater than the average temperature the daily heat unit is zero the plant uptake of water and nutrients for biomass growth ceases once the cumulative daily heat unit reaches the plant maturity heat unit threshold crop yield yld was calculated as a function of the harvest index hi and above ground biomass bio ag as follows 2 yld bio ag hi when hi 1 0 3 yld bio ag 1 1 1 hi when hi 1 0 where bio ag is the aboveground biomass on the day of harvest kg ha 1 further details are available in neitsch et al 2011 2 3 input and calibration data detailed climate and geospatial data were prepared to run the swat model table 1 specifically we obtained the daily precipitation and temperature records from 1999 to 2020

observations daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were produced using the swat model s built in weather generator neitsch et al 2011 previous studies constructed daily solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed using a weather generator when the observed three climatic data were not available and these studies provided acceptable model performances wu and xu 2006 zhao et al 2020 in our study region the generated climatic data have been frequently used for swat modeling and the simulations depicted the observed streamflow and nitrate loads well lee et al 2016 sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 lee et al 2016 produced a land use map reflecting local agricultural practices e g crop rotations fertilizer applications planting and harvesting dates they identified eight major crop rotations table s1 and their locations by aggregating multi year cdls detailed agricultural practices for individual crop rotations were developed via communication with local experts table 2 because of the high variability in individual farmer s schedules the average dates of planting harvesting and fertilizer applications were used to specify detailed practices associated with each rotation table 2 by adopting the land use map produced by lee et al 2016 detailed agricultural practices were considered in our simulations due to a lack of detailed information irrigation practices were not considered in this study the raw dem used in the swat simulations was generated from the maryland department of natural resources with post processing conducted by the usda ars beltsville the soil map was obtained from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo monthly streamflow data from 2001 to 2020 collected at the usgs gauging station 01491500 were downloaded for model calibration and validation fig 1 the daily rs et data were generated at 4 km spatial resolution with the atmosphere land exchange inverse alexi model anderson et al 2007 1997 alexi relates the morning

evaporation daily et estimates from alexi have been evaluated against eddy covariance flux measurements within the choptank river watershed using the disalexi flux downscaling algorithm anderson et al 2004 2018 yielding an average relative error of 10 sun et al 2017 the 4 km rs et retrievals used here span the period from january 2001 to december 2020 in addition we prepared annual corn and soybean yield data for model calibration and validation because the watershed is predominantly occupied by croplands an accurate simulation of the crop yield is likely to increase the accuracy of the et estimates of the swat these yield data county level yield data 2001 2020 for caroline and queen anne s counties in maryland where the tcw is situated were downloaded from the usda nass 2 4 model evaluation model simulations were evaluated at a monthly time step for 22 year periods monthly values were used because daily simulation outputs tended to depict hydrologic variables poorly as compared with the monthly simulations yeo et al 2019b 2014 the rs et data were aggregated to a watershed scale at a monthly interval for model calibration and validation in total 10 000 parameter sets were prepared using the latin hypercube sampling method which partitions the allowable ranges of each parameter into sub ranges with an equal likelihood to appear and selects one parameter value at each sub range mckay et al 2000 the number of parameter sets was decided based on the general swat calibration approach given in abbaspour et al 2017 this study used 15 hydrologic and 14 plant parameters table 3 that have been noted as the parameters sensitive to streamflow and crop in previous studies parajuli et al 2013 sexton et al 2010 yeo et al 2014 the first two years 1999 2000 were set as the spin up period to calibrate streamflow et and crop yield the remaining simulation periods were split into two periods calibration 2001 2010 and validation 2011 2020 the accuracy of monthly streamflow and et was quantified using the three measures eqs 4 6 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse moriasi et al 2007 percent bias p bias moriasi et al 2007 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 these three statistics are frequently used to assess model predictability for streamflow and et arnold et al 2012 rajib et al 2020 yeo et al 2019b in addition this study adopted multiple measures since one performance measure may fail to generate the desired calibration results mizukami et al 2019 nse represents how well observed and simulated data fit into the 1 1 line with the range of nse varying from and 1 0 optimal value moriasi et al 2007 p bias computes the average tendency of the simulations relative to the corresponding observations the closer p bias is to zero the more accurate

coefficient œÉ s œÉ o and Œº s Œº o indicate the variability ratio and bias between simulations and observations respectively and œÉ and Œº are the standard deviation and mean of the variables respectively the subscripts s and o indicate the simulations and observations respectively referring to the previous studies srinivasan et al 2010 woznicki et al 2015 percent bias p bias was only used as a model performance measure for crop yields the three performance measures were computed using the hydroeval package of the python program hallouin 2020 acceptable model performance was identified using the following metrics monthly streamflow and et for calibration and validation nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 and annual crop yields for calibration and validation p bias 25 based on the swat model evaluation guideline for satisfactory criteria moriasi et al 2007 strict values were set as the acceptable threshold for streamflow and et in this study the acceptable performance measure for the crop yield p bias 25 was adopted from wang et al 2012 2 5 uncertainty analysis model constraints applied by additional data can lead to a substantial reduction in the degree of equifinality her and chaubey 2015 wambura et al 2018 we first compared the degree of equifinality among the par f par fe and par fec among the 10 000 parameter sets the par f only included the parameter sets with acceptable performances for only streamflow nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 and the par fe represented the parameter sets acceptable for both streamflow and et nse 0 65 p bias 25 and kge 0 65 the par fe that exhibited acceptable performance for corn p bias 25 and soybean p bias 25 yield were selected for the par fec comparing the par fe and par fec could demonstrate whether crop yield data are useful to reduce the degree of equifinality with respect to the model predictive uncertainty in the et simulation the uncertainty of individual parameters for the par fe was compared using a coefficient of variation cv statistic calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the parameter values by their mean and multiplying the resulting ratio by 100 this dimensionless statistic is a practical tool for assessing the uncertainty of behavioral parameter values her and chaubey 2015 we calculated the cv of individual parameters to determine which parameters had significant impacts on the et simulations parameter sensitivity table 3 was computed using a global sensitivity analysis that fits a linear regression between the objective function value and the parameters khalid et al 2016 the objective function value was defined as the nse for estimating et the global sensitivity method estimates the average changes in the objective function relative to changes in each parameter while all other parameters are simultaneously modified khalid et al 2016 parameter sensitivity increases as the absolute value of the t statistics increases and the associated p value decreases 3 results 3 1 model predictive uncertainty 3 1 1 degree of equifinality because the excess of acceptable parameter sets is a key issue in equifinality we began by counting the number of acceptable parameter sets each time additional constraints were introduced fig 2 of the initial 10 000 parameter sets 180 were found to provide an acceptable performance measure for streamflow i e par f alone an acceptable level of performance for the combination of streamflow and et was found in 116 individual parameter sets par fe when the model calibration was further constrained by crop yield the number of acceptable parameter sets par fec was reduced from 116 to 2 these results may indicate that predictive uncertainty existed in the et estimates when the model was calibrated only against streamflow and rs et and that the additional model constraint acquired from crop yield data reduced this uncertainty these results are consistent with the results of a previous study ilampooranan et al 2021 also demonstrating that crop yield data were useful in reducing parameter uncertainty and equifinality overall the model s performance measures for monthly et improved with the inclusion of additional constraints fig 3 the greatest median values of nse and kge for monthly et were observed during the calibration and validation periods in the simulations by par fec the median nse and kge values of par fec were 0 02 0 2 and 0 04 0 05 greater than those of par f and par fe respectively table s3 in the case of p bias values par fec showed values similar to par f and par fe during the calibration period but par f and par fe were slightly lower than par fec during the validation period 3 2 parameter uncertainty using 29 parameter sets with acceptable model performance for streamflow and rs et par fe the cv values of the top ten most sensitive parameters were computed as shown in fig 4 the sensitivity ranking of each parameter is listed in table 3 the parameter uncertainty was greatest for the parameter that controls the leaf area development of soybeans frwrw1 indicating that acceptable values for the frwrw1 soyb parameters were most widely dispersed in contrast the parameters that control the leaf area development of corn frwrw2 produced the lowest cv 3 3 evaluation of simulation results 3 3 1 streamflow the simulated streamflows from par f par fe and par fec were compared with the corresponding observations as shown in figs 5 and 6 simulated streamflow from par fe represented a narrow range of flow duration curves and was closer to observed streamflow than was the simulated streamflow of par f this finding is consistent with the model performance measures representing greater prediction accuracy for par fe relative to par f the two par fecs indicated by par fec 1 and par fec 2 in fig 5 depicted observed streamflow well but the par fecs were underestimated during low flow conditions flows with probability of exceedance 80 these results regarding the flow duration curves show that streamflow predictions were better represented by the model constrained by streamflow and rs et than by the model constrained only by streamflow but that use of crop yield did not substantially improve streamflow predictions as with the flow duration curves the range of simulated time series streamflow from par fe was narrower than that from par f fig 6 and the most representative observed streamflow was found in par fe the simulations from par fe tended to be negatively biased compared with observations especially for high streamflow events fig 6 3 3 2 evapotranspiration the seasonal variations in all acceptable et estimates from the par fe and par fec were similar to those in the rs et fig 7 specifically et peaked in july and reached its minimum in december or january showing results that are consistent with those of an earlier study by fisher et al 2010 as well as with local tower measurement results sun et al 2017 most observed rs et values were within the range of par fe which may imply that an additional constraint for et is useful to simulate et dynamics in this region the par fe and par fec consistently underestimated et during the winter months dec feb this underestimation might be due to inaccurate parameterization of crops during the winter months and to errors in the rs et during the cold seasons 3 3 3 crop yield the observed and simulated crop yields are shown in fig 8 the model performance measures p biases for the par fec 1 were 10 7 calibration and 17 validation for corn and were 22 7 calibration and 11 validation for soybean respectively par fec 2 showed performance measures of 16 8 calibration and 24 2 validation for corn and 20 7 calibration and 7 7 validation for soybean respectively interestingly the par fec 1 not only produced the best et performance measures among the 116 par fe but it also predicted crop yield better than par fec 2 this finding shows that constraining the model constrained with crop yield data can reduce the number of acceptable parameter sets and improve the accuracy of model predictions for et and yield 4 discussion 4 1 model uncertainty with additional constraints the simulated results show increased model performance measures and decreased equifinality by gradually adding a constraint figs 2 and 3 this finding may underline the importance of additional constraints in improving the performance of hydrologic models a study by nijzink et al 2018 also found that hydrologic model predictions were improved by an increase in the number of constraining data bai et al 2018 highlighted significant improvements of model predictions as a result of additional constraints both the degree of equifinality and model performance measures directly indicate the benefit of additional constraints this benefit can be interpreted based on hydrological processes watershed water cycling is normally computed using four components precipitation et streamflow soil water and groundwater dynamics edwards et al 2015 et and streamflow are the components reducing watershed water balance by transferring land surface water from terrestrial to atmospheric systems and directing precipitation falling within a watershed to downstream waters along the stream networks respectively oki and kanae 2006 therefore the simultaneous control of parameters against two constraints et and streamflow may lead to better replications of actual hydrological processes the amount of water transported outside of the system via streamflow and et is influenced by a water stored in soil layers within the system edwards et al 2015 in agricultural watersheds a substantial amount of water stored in soil layers is strongly dependent on crop dynamics li et al 2014 considering the chain of water cycling simulated results further constrained by crop yield par fec 1 and par fec 2 showed predictions improvements the two parameter sets par fec 1 and par fec 2 showed high similarity in parameter values table s2 and performance measures table s4 a noticeable difference was observed in the parameter sol z that controls the soil water flow rate the parameter increased by 27 in par fec 1 while decreased by 39 in par fec 2 this difference might lead to quick par fec 1 and slow par fec 2 drainage of soil water resulting in high streamflow of par fec 2 relative to that of par fec 1 during low flow conditions fig 5 et was greater in par fec 1 relative to par fec 2 fig 7 which was likely driven by a lower esco of par fec 1 0 05 compared to par fec 2 0 40 regarding that the lower esco is the greater potential evaporation in soils is crop yield parameters of par fec 1 and par fec 2 also differed but the differences do not well explain varied crop yield predictions between two parameter sets swat crop parameters simulate crop total biomass including above ground and root biomass and then a portion of the total biomass is computed as crop yield to better inform the impact of crop parameters and predict crop yield an advanced swat model would be necessary the analysis of parameter uncertainty provided an interesting point fig 4 among all six vegetation parameters were listed within the ten most sensitive parameters implying that plant parameters should be adjusted for et calibration this result supports the et simulation approach proposed by rajib et al 2018 where the importance of plant parameters was emphasized among these plant parameters those related to corn were more frequently found in the top ten sensitivity parameters than those related to soybeans table 3 this is because corn which was found within a larger fraction of cultivation fields 55 of the total croplands within the study site had a greater impact on et variance compared to soybeans which were found in a smaller fraction of cultivation fields 45 of the total croplands 4 2 simulation results with additional constraints the swat model was calibrated against three constraints and the underestimation of simulated streamflow was found in fig 6 this is likely the result of inherent model limitations and poor precipitation data specifically the swat model tends to produce poor simulations regarding the impact of heavy precipitation because the duration and intensity of precipitation are not considered in the partitioning of water into surface runoff and infiltration qiu et al 2012 the second reason for this underestimation is that the precipitation data collected at weather stations may not fully represent spatial variations in rainfall conditions across the entire study site localized precipitation variability has been observed frequently at this site a fact which might further contribute to the underestimation of streamflow lee et al 2016 yeo et al 2019b 2014 future studies in this region need to use grid format climatic data to consider spatial variability cristiano et al 2017 the overall results of the et estimates from par fe and par fec was lower than that from rs et especially during the summer months june august fig 7 this can be attributed to the absence of irrigation practices in swat simulations in contrast to the thermal et remote sensing approach which implicitly captures the impact of irrigation on et hain et al 2015 the et underestimation during the summer months was greatest during 2007 which had the lowest summer precipitation over the simulation period 2001 2020 such low summer precipitation increases the need for irrigation water to aid in crop production and irrigation likely occurred most frequently during the summer of 2007 however irrigation practices were not represented in our swat simulations leading to great differences between the et simulations and rs et this finding supports the hypothesis that neglect of irrigation can produce underestimation in swat predicted et therefore irrigation practices should be included in swat simulations to more accurately represent the et in agricultural watersheds where irrigation is commonly conducted however the lack of irrigation data for our study site limited our ability to explicitly consider irrigation in our model furthermore vegetation in forested areas accounted for 33 of the study site these areas were simulated using default growth parameters mainly because of the absence of calibration data for forest growth finally depressional wetlands susceptible to water loss via et are abundant in the forested areas of this region thus underestimation of et in the forested settings may be as a result of the above factors for disparities in simulated et compared to rs et even though the par fec satisfied the predefined model performance measures for crop yield p bias 25 large discrepancies between simulated and observed crop yield were found in some years fig 8 most corn yield simulations were underestimated relative to observations while soybean predictions were both over and under estimated our simulation set up the average date of crop planting and harvesting across all individual croplands owing to the lack of precise farm data which might have contributed to differences between simulations and observations the limited information about actual cultivation practices has been previously reported as the main difficulty in predicting crop yield srinivasan et al 2010 furthermore the exclusion of irrigation practices in simulations practices might cause poor predictions of crop yield li et al 2019 irrigated water is frequently used in our study to achieve targeted crop yield and irrigation practices are regarded as a key factor for crop growth tamburino et al 2020 similar et results absence of irrigation might contribute to the difference between observed and simulated crop yield 4 3 implications and limitations modeling agricultural watersheds is important to efficiently manage water resources and mitigate water quality degradations bracmort et al 2006 cai et al 2002 prior to using modeling tools the reliability and robustness of modeling results should be thoroughly confirmed via model calibration validation arnold et al 2012 since the model calibration process is dependent on observational data the agriculture specific dataset would be useful to increase the credibility of modeling results for agricultural landscapes crop yield data have been normally viewed as a prediction target rather than observations for improving model accuracy srinivasan et al 2010 wang et al 2012 this study emphasized the inclusion of crop yield as a model constrain demonstrating the potential of crop yield to reduce model uncertainty by addressing the agriculture specific observational dataset i e crop yield this study addressed a potential approach to increase water cycling predictions across agricultural watersheds the effort would lead to extended understanding of agricultural water resources our results show the value of consideration of crop yield to reduce equifinality for an agricultural watershed however it is necessary to consider the uncertainties embedded in yield data as well discrepancies may exist between crop yield calibration data acquired from county level statistics and watershed level simulated yield mainly because of spatial mismatching in general crop yield data are available at administrative scales but not at hydrologic scales recent progress in remote sensing techniques and abundant statistical data provide opportunities to better constrain model parameters yeo et al 2019a modis driven leaf area index lai may be an alternative plant constraint however this study focused on agricultural watersheds and the coarse spatial resolutions approximately 500 m of modis lai this may not represent the lai values of specific crops because small farmlands ranging from 0 05 km2 to 1 3 km2 are randomly distributed across the watershed downscaled modis lai to 30 m resolution data would be a promising option for future studies that use lai for agricultural landscapes gao et al 2012 our calibration approach using an additional crop yield constraint provided acceptable et and crop yield predictions this approach reduced the degree of equifinality in estimating et and it might better calibrate crop growth however this does not necessarily assure accurate predictions of et through the contribution of crop yield because a limited amount of observed yield data once per year may not accurately capture crop growth time series remotely sensed lai with high spatial resolution might better reflect crop transpiration as such data can potentially be used to calibrate crop growth over the course of the growing period incorporating remotely sensed lai into swat modeling was found to improve water quantity and quality variable model predictions rajib et al 2020 furthermore the strong relations between lai dynamics from remotely sensed data and irrigation practices were detected in agricultural areas supporting the importance of lai in understanding agricultural water resources li et al 2021 the addition of irrigation practices to the model simulation should also make contribution to improved predictions of et future studies should use remotely sensed lai and et for agricultural watershed modeling and reflect irrigation practices into simulations 5 conclusions this study assessed the swat predictive uncertainty for an agricultural watershed with regard to the presence or absence of an additional crop yield constraint although rs et has recently been employed as calibration data to improve model predictions et parameters are not typically tuned for plant calibration data when estimating et despite the fact that transpiration controlled by plants accounts for a substantial portion of et to address this limitation crop yield data were introduced in conjunction with rs et in this study detailed crop rotations and configurations were also thoroughly reflected in the swat model with regard to the influence of cultivation activities on agricultural watersheds simulated results that met the model s performance measures for one constraint streamflow for two constraints streamflow and rs et and for three constraints streamflow rs et and crop yield were compared the comparison results showed that the degree of equifinality was considerably reduced from 180 parameter sets one constraint to 116 two constraints and finally to 2 three constraints along with a reduction in equifinality the model s performance measures increased as additional constraints were included finally one of the two acceptable parameter sets for three constraints indicated the best et performance measures our results found that irrigation practices are critical to improved et modeling in agricultural watersheds these results suggest that crop yield data can be utilized to reduce a model s predictive uncertainty in et estimates and increase the model s prediction accuracy

9603,understanding the process of crop evapotranspiration et c and developing models for estimating et c are crucial to efficiently schedule irrigation and enhance efficient water use here we investigated variations of et c and local crop coefficient k c et c et o where et o is the reference evapotranspiration in a rotated flooded rice winter wheat system using et c data based on the bowen ratio energy balance method from 2016 to 2020 we propose a modified k c model for estimating daily et c which includes a density coefficient a function of fraction of canopy cover and incorporates the effect of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress on et c results indicated that the total et c over whole growth stage for flooded rice and winter wheat field was 500 2 62 5 and 298 6 28 3 mm means standard deviation respectively the values of local k c at the initial middle and late stages were 0 83 0 14 1 11 0 06 and 0 99 0 15 respectively for flooded rice and 0 71 0 08 0 86 0 06 and 0 76 0 08 respectively for winter wheat there was no water stress over the entire season of the flooded rice winter wheat rotation system except for some days with water draining in paddy rice field heat stress in summer adversely affected the et c of rice the modified k c model can well reproduce the values of daily et c for both flooded rice and winter wheat and improved the accuracy by 6 9 compared to the fao 56 k c model using tabulated values after adjustment the regression coefficient coefficient of determination root mean squared error and modeling efficiency between measured et c and estimated by the modified k c model were 0 99 0 89 0 55 mm d 1 and 0 89 respectively for flooded rice and 1 03 0 85 0 55 mm d 1 and 0 82 respectively for winter wheat therefore the modified k

and evaporation rana and katerji 2000 et c plays an indispensable role in water and energy balance of agriculture as well as for crop production zhang et al 2011a ding et al 2013a furthermore et c is frequently used in hydrologic and water resources management models efficient irrigation scheduling in agriculture and climate change and weather forecasting models allen et al 2011a hence accurate measurement and estimation of et c at a variety of scales is critical for agronomists hydrologists meteorologists and ecologists nearly 70 of total water use in the world is consumed in agriculture kang et al 2017 with the increasing competition for water between agriculture and other sectors improving water productivity is vital for ensuring water safety and food security which requires accurate determination of et c kang et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 qiu et al 2021b the rice winter wheat rotation system has been widely adopted in southern china accounting for 10 of the arable land in china i e 9 13 million ha jing et al 2010 in this rotation system flooded rice is commonly grown during jun and oct nov while winter wheat from oct nov to next may huge water inputs precipitation plus irrigation for rice are required because rice paddy is generally flooded qiu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 while winter wheat is generally rainfed hence the water consumption for flooded rice and winter wheat should have a great difference although water resources are abundant in southern china the irregular spatial and temporal variation of precipitation requires accurate determination of et c of the rice winter wheat rotation system for improving water management and ensuring sustainable production many methods of et c measurement and estimation have been developed allen et al 2011b paredes et al 2018 to date the et c can be directly or indirectly measured from a wide range of measurement systems including soil water balance qiu et al 2015 rashid niaghi and jia 2019 pereira et al 2020a chen et al 2021 lysimeters ding et al 2010 kim et al 2011 duncan et al 2016 l√≥pez urrea et al 2020 sap flow plus micro lysimeters zhang et al 2011b rafi et al 2019 bowen ratio energy balance

vegetation indices methods allen et al 2011b among these methods the bowen ratio energy balance method is a relatively reliable and practical technology for measuring et c allen et al 2011b and has been widely used in a variety of field conditions inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 zhang et al 2008 rashid niaghi and jia 2019 because measurement of et c is costly and limited by temporal and spatial factors numerous mathematical models have been proposed to estimate et c among the proposed models a simple convenient and reproducible et c estimation model at the field scale is the fao 56 crop coefficient model allen et al 1998 olivera guerra et al 2018 pereira et al 2020b where the et c for a specified crop under standard conditions is estimated by reference evapotranspiration et o crop coefficient k c et o defined as evapotranspiration from a reference grass or alfalfa surface represents the atmospheric evaporation demand at a specific location independently of crop factors and can be calculated using only meteorological data allen et al 1998 paredes et al 2018 the k c is the ratio of et c to the et o hence representing the specific crop characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass or alfalfa reference at different time scales such as canopy resistance crop height soil evaporation and albedo of soil crop surface paredes et al 2018 pereira et al 2021 the k c values at three growth stages i e the initial middle and end of the late season are generally derived from the tabulated values in fao 56 and modified based on the local climate condition allen et al 1998 however the daily k c values from the initial to the middle stage and from the middle to the end of the late stage result from a linear interpolation hence the original fao 56 k c procedure cannot capture the non linear variation of daily actual k c values which in turn affect the accuracy to estimate et c furthermore the plant temperature constraint can also affect the stomatal aperture thus limiting the transpiration rate fisher et al 2008 and the leaf senescence during the late stage can affect the stomatal opening leading to a low transpiration rate steduto et al 2009 ding et al 2013a 2015 hence it is essential to develop a non linear dynamic k c model taking into account the effects of plant temperature constraint and leaf senescence for dynamic calculation of daily k c and thus accurate estimation of et c the aim of this study was to quantify the dynamic variations of et c and k c in a rotated rice winter wheat system based on et c measurements by the bowen ratio energy balance method from 2016 to 2020 furthermore this study assesses the performance of a dynamic k c model to estimate et c by introducing a density coefficient and taking into account the effects of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental detail and plant materials the experiment was carried out at the agro meteorology research

flooded rice winter wheat rotation system is the leading planting pattern in this region the detailed crop and management properties from 2016 to 2020 are summarized in table 1 as a result of heavy and frequent precipitation during nov and dec 2018 winter wheat was not planted in the 2018 2019 season at the station ii the field management such as pest control irrigation and fertilization was operated by local farmers the wind frequency and wind speed roses for each growth season are shown in fig a1 2 2 measurements and the bowen ratio energy balance method the et c was measured by a bowen

study the detailed information for et c data quality control and interpolation procedures are shown in our previous study qiu et al 2019 we also shared the code for data quality control and gap

agricultural research https www6 paca inrae fr can eye was employed to analyze the images the value of f c for each image was calculated as the ratio of vegetation pixels to the whole image pixels liu et al 2013 the heights h c of rice and winter wheat plants were measured by a steel tape measure every 7 15 days the daily values of f c and h c were interpolated with the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method by using the matlab software mathworks inc natick ma usa 2 3 the modified k c model in fao 56 the local k c is calculated as 3 k c e t c e t o when considering the

since paddy rice field is generally submerged the method for calculating k s of rice k s r 0 1 is different from the method for that of winter wheat and other crops which is based on the relative soil

of t opt in eq 9 to calculate f t were taken as 27 6 c for rice s√°nchez et al 2014 and 11 7 c for winter wheat during the initial and crop development stages and 22 1 c during the middle and late season farooq et al 2011 the soil data consist of taw and raw where the value of p in eq 15 to calculated raw of winter wheat was set to 0 55 allen et al 1998 the irrigation data include irrigation date and amount table 1 crop variables consist of crop development stages z h c f c and f s the detailed start end dates of each growth stage are specified in table 3 values of c d to calculate f s in eq 8 were taken as 0 07 for rice and 0 09 for winter wheat qiu et al 2019 values of m c to calculate k d in eq 10 was taken as 1 5 for rice and winter wheat in this study since variation of m c from 1 5 to 2 0 has little effect on k d when h c 1 0 m allen and pereira 2009 ding et al 2013a the calibration of the modified k c model was performed by minimizing the differences between estimated and measured et c by using the bowen ratio energy balance method for rice in the 2018 season and winter wheat in the 2016 2017 season the initial value of k soil was set as 1 2 for rice and 0 1 for winter wheat the calibrated value of k soil was 0 8 for rice as a result of some days of water draining the calibrated value of k soil was 0 6 at the initial stage of winter wheat because of relative moist soil surface and was 0 3 for the other stages using the calibrated model parameters model estimation was performed for other growing seasons the model was not performed for rice in the 2016 and 2017 seasons at station i because of suffering from medium to heavy advection in jul and aug and all models perform well with minimum advection effect sumner and jacobs 2005 2 5 statistic indicators four goodness of fit indicators were employed to determine the accuracy of model estimation the regression coefficient b and the coefficient of determination r2 of the linear regression forced through the

and rmse 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 microclimate conditions and crop canopy variations fig 1 shows the dynamics of daily microclimate conditions i e t a rh u 2 and et o during the growing period of the rotated rice winter wheat system from 2016 to 2020 the daily u 2 ranged from 0 18 to 4 11 m s 1 mean 1 10 m s 1 during the growing season of flooded rice and from 0 to 3 81 m s 1 mean 1 38 m s 1 during the growth period of winter wheat generally the average u 2 was high at the late stage of rice in the 2016 and 2017 seasons at the initial or the crop development stage of rice in the 2018 2020 seasons and at the crop development stage of winter wheat table 3 daily t a for flooded rice plants ranged from 7 9 to 34 0 c with a mean value of 24 8 c which is much higher than that for winter wheat plants mean value of 11 2 c flooded rice plants were grown in more humid condition mean daily rh of 78 3 compared to winter wheat mean daily rh of 71 2 the average daily rh min at different growth stages varied from 48 8 to 80 8 for flooded rice and from 39 4 to 57 8 for winter wheat table 3 the mean daily value of et o during growth period of rice plants was 3 4 mm d 1 varied from 0 5 to 7 3 mm d 1 which was 37 greater than that of winter wheat plants varied from 0 4 to 7 0 mm d 1 the total seasonal et o was 402 7 569 9 mm for rice and 376 6 418 1 mm for winter wheat table 3 hence the flooded rice plants were grown in more humid and hotter environment and had a higher evaporation demand than winter wheat plants the f c and h c of flooded rice increased rapidly since transplanting or sowing reached the maximum during the middle season and slightly decreased for f c or remained constant for h c in the late stage fig 2a c conversely the f c and h c of winter wheat increased slowly during the winter season increased rapidly after 90 days from sowing reached the maximum during the middle season and then gradually decreased for f c or kept stable for h c during the late stage fig 2b d the different variation of f c and h c between flooded rice and winter wheat was mainly due to differences in physiology phenology and growth condition especially meteorology the maximum h c of flooded rice was 1 06 m which was 30 2 greater than that of winter wheat the heat stress adversely affected plant growth of flooded rice as evidenced by the low growth rate of h c during a certain time of jul and aug fig 2c when the hourly t a was higher than 35 c from near noon to 16 00 17 00 3 2 variations of et c and local k c for rice and winter wheat fig 3 shows that the diurnal variation of hourly et c for flooded rice and winter wheat over entire growing season exhibited bell shaped curves starting to increase at 6 00 7 00 am peaking around noon and then decreasing by sunset at night there still existed a low et c rate as a result of incomplete stomatal closure this phenomenon was also observed for other crops such as tomato and hot pepper snyder et al 2003 caird et al 2007 fig 3 also shows that mean hourly et c rate near noon 10 00 14 00 over the whole growth season of winter wheat was 49 of that of rice which may be attributed to dryer soil surface and lower evaporation demand in winter wheat field fig 1 during jul and aug in this region heat stress 35 c frequently occurs from near noon xiong et al 2017 which has adverse effect on et c of flooded rice with the similar r n the mean hourly et c during the heat stress period 11 00 16 00 on jul 14 and jul 20 2018 decreased by 12 when compared to that on jul 12 2018 without stress fig 4 during jul and aug transpiration was the dominant proportion of et c as a result of high f c fig 2 see also in qiu et al 2019 when suffering from heat stress plants may reduce stomatal opening or partially close stomata which inhibits transpiration and reduces et c hermann and gabriel 2013 this may be evident from that the canopy conductance calculated by inverting penman monteith method monteith and unsworth 2008 in this study have shown to be decreased by 25 8 37 8 from 18 01 to 11 20 13 35 mm s 1 under heat stress period in addition heat stress may inhibit growth of roots which ultimately limit root water uptake fahad et al 2017 and affect et c the inhibited et c by heat stress can be also partly proved by the adverse effect of heat stress on h c fig 2c as plant growth is highly linked to transpiration these results can provide a basis for considering f t in the modified k c model generally consumption of total et c was mainly during the crop development and middle stages 65 86 of total for flooded rice and during the middle and late stages for winter wheat 53 67 of total table 3 when the atmospheric demand was high fig 1 the total et c of flooded rice over the whole growing season was 500 2 62 5 mm table 3 which was within the range of water consumption 324 889 mm for flooded paddy rice reported in literature linquist et al 2015 ikawa et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the et c over the entire growing season of winter wheat was 298 6 28 3 mm which was lower than those shown in most studies for well watered winter wheat e g 347 437 mm in north china zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 and 483 590 mm in usa ko et al 2009 xue et al 2014 possible reasons may be attributed to the reduced evaporation demand low planting density and delayed planting date of winter wheat due to potentially frequent and heavy precipitation during harvest period of rice at the initial crop development middle and late season the local k c values were 0 65 1 04 0 91 1 29 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 respectively for flooded rice and 0 66 0 80 0 58 0 78 0 82 0 93 and 0 67 0 81 respectively for winter wheat table 3 many studies reported k c values for rice and winter wheat in various locations as summarized in a recently published review article pereira et al 2021 which show large discrepancies however it is necessary to assess whether local k c values in this study are comparable with the expected ranges the k c value at the initial stage of flooded rice was close to the values reported by alberto et al 2014 and yan et al 2017 but lower than those reported in most of the studies 0 97 1 16 as summarized in pereira et al 2021 except for the 2017 season the k c value at the middle stage of flooded rice 1 11 0 06 in this study was comparable with those reported in the literature pereira et al 2021 the k c value at the late stage of flooded rice 0 99 0 15 was generally within the range of the reported values in literature 0 94 1 22 derived with data in table 9 for flooded paddy rice in pereira et al 2021 using mean values of k c at the middle stage and the end of the late stage for winter wheat the k c value at the initial stage was generally higher than those reported in many studies bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 gao et al 2009 ko et al 2009 because of moist soil surface at initial stage but was close to the results by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 and allen et al 1998 the k c value at the middle stage of winter wheat 0 86 0 06 was lower than the reported values in previous studies 1 00 1 29 as summarized in pereira et al 2021 which may be attributed to the low u 2 table 3 and low planting density low emergence rate due to very wet soil surface allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 the k c value at the late stage of winter wheat in this study was higher than 0 65 which was comparable with the mean values of the three decades from 1979 to 2009 in north china plain reported by zhang et al 2011a the discrepant local k c values at the initial middle and late stages in varying locations also indicate that the tabulated values in fao 56 needs modification based on local climate and canopy development 3 3 assessing the modified k c model to estimate et c the dynamic k c model for estimating et c considering the effects of f s f t and k s was evaluated generally there was slight water stress during the late crop development stage and near the end of growth season when flooding water was absent fig 5a c according to the local management practice a 5 10 day soil drying water is drained was adopted in the late development stage to induce a deeper growth of the root starting 20 days before harvest the flooding water was absent to prevent lodging and facilitate harvest and planting of winter wheat this practice may lead to slight water deficit of rice plants if there is no precipitation however for winter wheat no water stress was found during the three growing seasons in this study fig 5d e indicating that the precipitation was sufficient to meet the water consumption demand of winter wheat the precipitation over the whole growing season of winter wheat was 313 0 423 6 and 386 4 mm respectively for the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 seasons which was higher than the respective total seasonal et c of winter wheat table 3 in this region the long term precipitation 67 years data from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn during the growth period of winter wheat nov to next may varied from 155 0 to 698 3 mm mean 413 4 mm showing that irrigation was unnecessary during most years this is different than that in arid or semi arid regions of northern china where 3 5 times irrigation events mainly border irrigation are required to meet the water demand of winter wheat sun et al 2006 gao et al 2009 jia et al 2021 however there were 5 years 7 5 of total in which precipitation was lower than 280 mm especially in 2011 150 mm indicating that the rainfed winter wheat may suffer from water deficit in these years the f t was high and varied slightly because of t a higher than t opt during transplanting or sowing to the late of the middle stage of rice and then largely varied during the late stage when t a was lower than t opt fig 5a c for winter wheat t a was deviated considerably from the t opt before the middle stages fig 1 leading to low values of f t and large variation during these stages fig 5d f especially in the 2017 2018 season during the middle and late stages of winter wheat the t a was close to the t opt resulting in high values of f t the f t had little effect on k cm at the initial stage of rice and winter wheat because the soil or water evaporation was the dominant proportion of et c due to low f c fig 2 see also in qiu et al 2019 as f c increased the variation of k cm was highly linked to the dynamics of f t fig 5 eq 6 the estimated k cm of rice increased from transplanting or sowing reached the maximum during the middle stage and decreased during the late stage fig 5a c for winter wheat the calculated k cm was relatively constant at the initial stage reached the maximum during the middle stage and declined until the end of the season fig 5d f the estimated values of k cm in the flooded rice and winter wheat rotation system were generally lower than those of tabulated values reported in the fao 56 after adjustment based on local climate and h c fig 5 table 3 except for at the late stage for winter wheat with the calculated k cm k s and et o the modified k c model for estimating et c was evaluated fig 6b d table 4 daily et c predictions by the fao 56 k c model using tabulated values after adjustment based on the local climate are also shown in fig 6a c where the values of k cm adj are shown in table 3 overall the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model overestimated the et c by 7 for rice and by 12 for winter wheat the r2 rmse and ef between measured et c and estimated by the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model were 0 88 0 67 mm d 1 and 0 83 respectively for flooded rice and 0 82 0 70 mm d 1 and 0 71 respectively for winter wheat fig 6a c these overestimations are attributed to the fact that the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model did not account for the effects of f t and f s on k cm leaf senescence could lead to the reduction of physiological function or stomatal opening which in turn limits transpiration steduto et al 2009 former studies also showed that the k c model considering leaf senescence factor can reasonably estimate et c of maize ding et al 2013b 2015 in addition transpiration rate is highly linked to stomatal aperture which shows a non linear response to t a jarvis 1976 houshmandfar et al 2015 xu et al 2017 hence the f t introduced here can assess the temperature constraint for stomatal conductance yuan et al 2010 which may also permit to assess the global warming effect on et c using the modified k c model furthermore the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model adopted a linear interpolation to calculate daily k cm without consideration of the actual non linear variation of k cm as a result of variation in canopy cover pereira et al 2020b the density coefficient k d used here can describe the variation in k cm with varying amount of vegetation which permits to estimate non linear et c dynamic allen and pereira 2009 when using the modified k c model the b was 0 92 1 03 for flooded rice and 1 02 1 06 for winter wheat table 4 showing that the estimated et c are statistically close to the measured ones the r2 was 0 87 0 91 for rice and 0 85 0 86 for winter wheat indicating that the modified k c model can explain most of the total variation of measured et c the rmse characterizing the variance of the errors was 0 52 0 60 mm d 1 for flooded rice and 0 53 0 59 for winter wheat high values of ef 0 80 show that mean square error is lower than the variance of measured et c by using the bowen ratio energy balance method all in all these indicators suggest that the modified k c model improved the accuracy in respect to the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model and could reasonably estimate et c for the rotated rice winter wheat field although the number of parameters used was increased through introducing f t f s and k d the model may be further used to predict et c using public weather forecast data li et al 2018 where data of et o could be well forecasted luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019 4 conclusions in this study the variations of evapotranspiration et c and local crop coefficient k c in a rice winter wheat rotation system were investigated a modified k c model for estimating et c was evaluated by introducing the density coefficient and incorporating the effects of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress the mean hourly et c rate near noon over the entire growth season of winter wheat was 49 of the value of that for rice the et c of rice was adversely affected by heat stress the water supply was sufficient over the entire season of the rice winter wheat rotation system except for some days when water was drained for paddy rice field the total et c over the whole growth stage of flooded rice was 500 2 62 5 mm which was 40 3 greater than that of winter wheat the values of local k c at the initial middle and late stages were 0 65 1 04 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 respectively for flooded rice and 0 66 0 80 0 82 0 93 and 0 67 0 81 respectively for winter wheat the modified k c model could reasonably estimate et c in the rotated rice winter wheat system and its accuracy was superior to that of the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model it is expected to serve as a practical tool for enhancing irrigation water management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9603,understanding the process of crop evapotranspiration et c and developing models for estimating et c are crucial to efficiently schedule irrigation and enhance efficient water use here we investigated variations of et c and local crop coefficient k c et c et o where et o is the reference evapotranspiration in a rotated flooded rice winter wheat system using et c data based on the bowen ratio energy balance method from 2016 to 2020 we propose a modified k c model for estimating daily et c which includes a density coefficient a function of fraction of canopy cover and incorporates the effect of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress on et c results indicated that the total et c over whole growth stage for flooded rice and winter wheat field was 500 2 62 5 and 298 6 28 3 mm means standard deviation respectively the values of local k c at the initial middle and late stages were 0 83 0 14 1 11 0 06 and 0 99 0 15 respectively for flooded rice and 0 71 0 08 0 86 0 06 and 0 76 0 08 respectively for winter wheat there was no water stress over the entire season of the flooded rice winter wheat rotation system except for some days with water draining in paddy rice field heat stress in summer adversely affected the et c of rice the modified k c model can well reproduce the values of daily et c for both flooded rice and winter wheat and improved the accuracy by 6 9 compared to the fao 56 k c model using tabulated values after adjustment the regression coefficient coefficient of determination root mean squared error and modeling efficiency between measured

and evaporation rana and katerji 2000 et c plays an indispensable role in water and energy balance of agriculture as well as for crop production zhang et al 2011a ding et al 2013a furthermore et c is frequently used in hydrologic and water resources management models efficient irrigation scheduling in agriculture and climate change and weather forecasting models allen et al 2011a hence accurate measurement and estimation of et c at a variety of scales is critical for agronomists hydrologists meteorologists and ecologists nearly 70 of total water use in the world is consumed in agriculture kang et al 2017 with the increasing competition for water between agriculture and other sectors improving water productivity is vital for ensuring water safety and food security which requires accurate determination of et c kang et al 2017 paredes et al 2018 qiu et al 2021b the rice winter wheat rotation system has been widely adopted in southern china accounting for 10 of the arable land in china i e 9 13 million ha jing et al 2010 in this rotation system flooded rice is commonly grown during jun and oct nov while winter wheat from oct nov to next may huge water inputs precipitation plus irrigation for rice are required because rice paddy is generally flooded qiu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 while winter wheat is generally rainfed hence the water consumption for flooded rice and winter wheat should have a great difference although water resources are abundant in southern china the irregular spatial and temporal variation of precipitation requires accurate determination of et c of the rice winter wheat rotation system for improving water management and ensuring sustainable production many methods of et c measurement and estimation have been developed allen et al 2011b paredes et al 2018 to date the et c can be directly or indirectly measured from a wide range of measurement systems including soil water balance qiu et al 2015 rashid niaghi and jia 2019 pereira et al

vegetation indices methods allen et al 2011b among these methods the bowen ratio energy balance method is a relatively reliable and practical technology for measuring et c allen et al 2011b and has been widely used in a variety of field conditions inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 zhang et al 2008 rashid niaghi and jia 2019 because measurement of et c is costly and limited by temporal and spatial factors numerous mathematical models have been proposed to estimate et c among the proposed models a simple convenient and reproducible et c estimation model at the field scale is the fao 56 crop coefficient model allen et al 1998 olivera guerra et al 2018 pereira et al 2020b where the et c for a specified crop under standard conditions is estimated by reference evapotranspiration et o crop coefficient k c et o defined as evapotranspiration from a reference grass or alfalfa surface represents the atmospheric evaporation demand at a specific location independently of crop factors and can be calculated using only meteorological data allen et al 1998 paredes et al 2018 the k c is the ratio of et c to the et o hence representing the specific crop characteristics that distinguish the crop from the grass or alfalfa reference at different time scales such as canopy resistance crop height soil evaporation and albedo of soil crop surface paredes et al 2018 pereira et al 2021 the k c values at three growth stages i e the initial middle and end of the late season are generally derived from the tabulated values in fao 56 and modified based on the local climate condition allen et al 1998 however the daily k c values from the initial to the middle stage and from the middle to the end of the late stage result from a linear interpolation hence the original fao 56 k c procedure cannot capture the non linear variation of daily actual k c values which in turn affect the accuracy to estimate et c furthermore the plant temperature constraint can also affect the stomatal aperture thus limiting the transpiration rate fisher et al 2008 and the leaf senescence during the late stage can affect the stomatal opening leading to a low transpiration rate steduto et al 2009 ding et al 2013a 2015 hence it is essential to develop a non linear dynamic k c model taking into account the effects of plant temperature constraint and leaf senescence for dynamic calculation of daily k c and thus accurate estimation of et c the aim of this study was to quantify the dynamic variations of et c and k c in a rotated rice winter wheat system based on et c measurements by the bowen ratio energy balance method from 2016 to 2020 furthermore this study assesses the performance of a dynamic k c model to estimate et c by introducing a density coefficient and taking into account the effects of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental detail and plant materials the experiment was carried out at the agro meteorology research

eq 8 were taken as 0 07 for rice and 0 09 for winter wheat qiu et al 2019 values of m c to calculate k d in eq 10 was taken as 1 5 for rice and winter wheat in this study since variation of m c from 1

measured et c by using the bowen ratio energy balance method for rice in the 2018 season and winter wheat in the 2016 2017 season the initial value of k soil was set as 1 2 for rice and 0 1 for winter wheat the calibrated value of k soil was 0 8 for rice as a result of some days of water draining the calibrated value of k soil was 0 6 at the initial stage of winter wheat because of relative moist soil surface and was 0 3 for the other stages using the calibrated model parameters model estimation was performed for other growing seasons the model was not performed for rice in the 2016 and 2017

of the rotated rice winter wheat system from 2016 to 2020 the daily u 2 ranged from 0 18 to 4 11 m s 1 mean 1 10 m s 1 during the growing season of flooded rice and from 0 to 3 81 m s 1 mean 1 38 m s 1 during the growth period of winter wheat generally the average u 2 was high at the late stage of rice in the 2016 and 2017 seasons at the initial or the crop development stage of rice in the 2018 2020 seasons and at the crop development stage of winter wheat table 3 daily t a for flooded rice plants ranged from 7 9 to 34 0 c with a mean value of 24 8 c which is much higher than that for winter wheat plants mean value of 11 2 c flooded rice plants were grown in more humid condition mean daily rh of 78 3 compared to winter wheat mean daily rh of 71 2 the average daily rh min at different growth stages varied from 48 8 to 80 8 for flooded rice and from 39 4 to 57 8 for winter wheat table 3 the mean daily value of et o during growth period of rice plants was 3 4 mm d 1 varied from 0 5 to 7 3 mm d 1 which was 37 greater than that of winter wheat plants varied from 0 4 to 7 0 mm d 1 the total seasonal et o was 402 7 569 9 mm for rice and 376 6 418 1 mm for winter wheat table 3 hence the flooded rice plants were grown in more humid and hotter environment and had a higher evaporation demand than winter wheat plants the f c and h c of flooded rice increased rapidly since transplanting or sowing reached the maximum during the middle season and slightly decreased for f c or remained constant for h c in the late stage fig 2a c conversely the f c and h c of winter wheat increased slowly during the winter season increased rapidly after 90 days from sowing reached the maximum during the middle season and then gradually decreased for f c or kept stable for h c during the late stage fig 2b d the different variation of f c and h c between flooded rice and winter wheat was mainly due to differences in physiology phenology and growth condition especially meteorology the maximum h c of flooded rice was 1 06 m which was 30 2 greater than that of winter wheat the heat stress adversely affected plant growth of flooded rice as evidenced by the low growth rate of h c during a certain time of jul and aug fig 2c when the hourly t a was higher than 35 c from near noon to 16 00 17 00 3 2 variations of et c and local k c for rice and winter wheat fig 3 shows that the diurnal variation of hourly et c for flooded rice and winter wheat over entire growing season exhibited bell shaped curves starting to increase at 6 00 7 00 am peaking around noon and then decreasing by sunset at night there still existed a low et c rate as a result of incomplete stomatal closure this phenomenon was also observed for other crops such as tomato and hot pepper snyder et al 2003 caird et al 2007 fig 3 also shows that mean hourly et c rate near noon 10 00 14 00 over the whole growth season of winter wheat was 49 of that of rice which may be attributed to dryer soil surface and lower evaporation demand in winter wheat field fig 1 during jul and aug in this region heat stress 35 c frequently occurs from near noon xiong et al 2017 which has adverse effect on et c of flooded rice with the similar r n the mean hourly et c during the heat stress period 11 00 16 00 on jul 14 and jul 20 2018 decreased by 12 when compared to that on jul 12 2018 without stress fig 4 during jul and aug transpiration was the dominant proportion of et c as a result of high f c fig 2 see also in qiu et al 2019 when suffering from heat stress plants may reduce stomatal opening or partially close stomata which inhibits transpiration and reduces et c hermann and gabriel 2013 this may be evident from that the canopy conductance calculated by inverting penman monteith method monteith and unsworth 2008 in this study have shown to be decreased by 25 8 37 8 from 18 01 to 11 20 13 35 mm s 1 under heat stress period in addition heat stress may inhibit growth of roots which ultimately limit root water uptake fahad et al 2017 and affect et c the inhibited et c by heat stress can be also partly proved by the adverse effect of heat stress on h c fig 2c as plant growth is highly linked to transpiration these results can provide a basis for considering f t in the modified k c model generally consumption of total et c was mainly during the crop development and middle stages 65 86 of total for flooded rice and during the middle and late stages for winter wheat 53 67 of total table 3 when the atmospheric demand was high fig 1 the total et c of flooded rice over the whole growing season was 500 2 62 5 mm table 3 which was within the range of water consumption 324 889 mm for flooded paddy rice reported in literature linquist et al 2015 ikawa et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the et c over the entire growing season of winter wheat was 298 6 28 3 mm which was lower than those shown in most studies for well watered winter wheat e g 347 437 mm in north china zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 and 483 590 mm in usa ko et al 2009 xue et al 2014 possible reasons may be attributed to the reduced evaporation demand low planting density and delayed planting date of winter wheat due to potentially frequent and heavy precipitation during harvest period of rice at the initial crop development middle and late season the local k c values were 0 65 1 04 0 91 1 29 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 respectively for flooded rice and 0 66 0 80 0 58 0 78 0 82 0 93 and 0 67 0 81 respectively for winter wheat table 3 many studies reported k c values for rice and winter wheat in various locations as summarized in a recently published review article pereira et al 2021 which show large discrepancies however it is necessary to assess whether local k c values in this study are comparable with the expected ranges the k c value at the initial stage of flooded rice was close to the values reported by alberto et al 2014 and yan et al 2017 but lower than those reported in most of the studies 0 97 1 16 as summarized in pereira et al 2021 except for the 2017 season the k c value at the middle stage of flooded rice 1 11 0 06 in this study was comparable with those reported in the literature pereira et al 2021 the k c value at the late stage of flooded rice 0 99 0 15 was generally within the range of the reported values in literature 0 94 1 22 derived with data in table 9 for flooded paddy rice in pereira et al 2021 using mean values of k c at the middle stage and the end of the late stage for winter wheat the k c value at the initial stage was generally higher than those reported in many studies bandyopadhyay and mallick 2003 gao et al 2009 ko et al 2009 because of moist soil surface at initial stage but was close to the results by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 and allen et al 1998 the k c value at the middle stage of winter wheat 0 86 0 06 was lower than the reported values in previous studies 1 00 1 29 as summarized in pereira et al 2021 which may be attributed to the low u 2 table 3 and low planting density low emergence rate due to very wet soil surface allen et al 1998 kang et al 2003 the k c value at the late stage of winter wheat in this study was higher than 0 65 which was comparable with the mean values of the three decades from 1979 to 2009 in north china plain reported by zhang et al 2011a the discrepant local k c values at the initial middle and late stages in varying locations also indicate that the tabulated values in fao 56 needs modification based on local climate and canopy development 3 3 assessing the modified k c model to estimate et c the dynamic k c model for estimating et c considering the effects of f s f t and k s was evaluated generally there was slight water stress during the late crop development stage and near the end of growth season when flooding water was absent fig 5a c according to the local management practice a 5 10 day soil drying water is drained was adopted in the late development stage to induce a deeper growth of the root starting 20 days before harvest the flooding water was absent to prevent lodging and facilitate harvest and planting of winter wheat this practice may lead to slight water deficit of rice plants if there is no precipitation however for winter wheat no water stress was found during the three growing seasons in this study fig 5d e indicating that the precipitation was sufficient to meet the water consumption demand of winter wheat the precipitation over the whole growing season of winter wheat was 313 0 423 6 and 386 4 mm respectively for the 2016 2017 2017 2018 and 2019 2020 seasons which was higher than the respective total seasonal et c of winter wheat table 3 in this region the long term precipitation 67 years data from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn during the growth period of winter wheat nov to next may varied from 155 0 to 698 3 mm mean 413 4 mm showing that irrigation was unnecessary during most years this is different than that in arid or semi arid regions of northern china where 3 5 times irrigation events mainly border irrigation are required to meet the water demand of winter wheat sun et al 2006 gao et al 2009 jia et al 2021 however there were 5 years 7 5 of total in which precipitation was lower than 280 mm especially in 2011 150 mm indicating that the rainfed winter wheat may suffer from water deficit in these years the f t was high and varied slightly because of t a higher than t opt during transplanting or sowing to the late of the middle stage of rice and then largely varied during the late stage when t a was lower than t opt fig 5a c for winter wheat t a was deviated considerably from the t opt before the middle stages fig 1 leading to low values of f t and large variation during these stages fig 5d f especially in the 2017 2018 season during the middle and late stages of winter wheat the t a was close to the t opt resulting in high values of f t the f t had little effect on k cm at the initial stage of rice and winter wheat because the soil or water evaporation was the dominant proportion of et c due to low f c fig 2 see also in qiu et al 2019 as f c increased the variation of k cm was highly linked to the dynamics of f t fig 5 eq 6 the estimated k cm of rice increased from transplanting or sowing reached the maximum during the middle stage and decreased during the late stage fig 5a c for winter wheat the calculated k cm was relatively constant at the initial stage reached the maximum during the middle stage and declined until the end of the season fig 5d f the estimated values of k cm in the flooded rice and winter wheat rotation system were generally lower than those of tabulated values reported in the fao 56 after adjustment based on local climate and h c fig 5 table 3 except for at the late stage for winter wheat with the calculated k cm k s and et o the modified k c model for estimating et c was evaluated fig 6b d table 4 daily et c predictions by the fao 56 k c model using tabulated values after adjustment based on the local climate are also shown in fig 6a c where the values of k cm adj are shown in table 3 overall the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model overestimated the et c by 7 for rice and by 12 for winter wheat the r2 rmse and ef between measured et c and estimated by the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model were 0 88 0 67 mm d 1 and 0 83 respectively for flooded rice and 0 82 0 70 mm d 1 and 0 71 respectively for winter wheat fig 6a c these overestimations are attributed to the fact that the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model did not account for the effects of f t and f s on k cm leaf senescence could lead to the reduction of physiological function or stomatal opening which in turn limits transpiration steduto et al 2009 former studies also showed that the k c model considering leaf senescence factor can reasonably estimate et c of maize ding et al 2013b 2015 in addition transpiration rate is highly linked to stomatal aperture which shows a non linear response to t a jarvis 1976 houshmandfar et al 2015 xu et al 2017 hence the f t introduced here can assess the temperature constraint for stomatal conductance yuan et al 2010 which may also permit to assess the global warming effect on et c using the modified k c model furthermore the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model adopted a linear interpolation to calculate daily k cm without consideration of the actual non linear variation of k cm as a result of variation in canopy cover pereira et al 2020b the density coefficient k d used here can describe the variation in k cm with varying amount of vegetation which permits to estimate non linear et c dynamic allen and pereira 2009 when using the modified k c model the b was 0 92 1 03 for flooded rice and 1 02 1 06 for winter wheat table 4 showing that the estimated et c are statistically close to the measured ones the r2 was 0 87 0 91 for rice and 0 85 0 86 for winter wheat indicating that the modified k c model can explain most of the total variation of measured et c the rmse characterizing the variance of the errors was 0 52 0 60 mm d 1 for flooded rice and 0 53 0 59 for winter wheat high values of ef 0 80 show that mean square error is lower than the variance of measured et c by using the bowen ratio energy balance method all in all these indicators suggest that the modified k c model improved the accuracy in respect to the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model and could reasonably estimate et c for the rotated rice winter wheat field although the number of parameters used was increased through introducing f t f s and k d the model may be further used to predict et c using public weather forecast data li et al 2018 where data of et o could be well forecasted luo et al 2014 yang et al 2016 2019 4 conclusions in this study the variations of evapotranspiration et c and local crop coefficient k c in a rice winter wheat rotation system were investigated a modified k c model for estimating et c was evaluated by introducing the density coefficient and incorporating the effects of plant temperature constraint leaf senescence and water stress the mean hourly et c rate near noon over the entire growth season of winter wheat was 49 of the value of that for rice the et c of rice was adversely affected by heat stress the water supply was sufficient over the entire season of the rice winter wheat rotation system except for some days when water was drained for paddy rice field the total et c over the whole growth stage of flooded rice was 500 2 62 5 mm which was 40 3 greater than that of winter wheat the values of local k c at the initial middle and late stages were 0 65 1 04 1 02 1 18 and 0 89 1 22 respectively for flooded rice and 0 66 0 80 0 82 0 93 and 0 67 0 81 respectively for winter wheat the modified k c model could reasonably estimate et c in the rotated rice winter wheat system and its accuracy was superior to that of the fao 56 adjusted tabulated k c model it is expected to serve as a practical tool for enhancing irrigation water management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9604,agricultural expansion has been a hot topic in the northern territory nt of australia in recent years however insufficient information on available water resources and crop evapotranspiration is a bottleneck to this expansion towards closing this gap this study employs the newest global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 2 catchment products assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace hereafter called gldas da and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation to spatially evaluate the balance between water availability i e groundwater and effective rainfall and melons maize and citrus crop evapotranspiration water demand of three representative short medium season and perennial crop types over the nt for the 2010 2019 period specifically this balance is the estimated ratio of water availability and crop evapotranspiration representing the crop area that can be planted in each gldas da grid cell the larger the balance the greater the irrigated agriculture potential under the average 2010 2019 conditions our results show that the northern part of the nt has the highest irrigated agriculture potentials with the average balance of 9430 ha 15 7 5490 ha 9 1 and 3520 ha 5 8 for melons maize and citrus respectively excluding non agriculture areas irrigated agriculture in the central part of the nt shows less potential compared to the northern part of the nt with the average balance of 2780 ha 4 6 2000 ha 3 3 and 970 ha 1 6 for melons maize and citrus respectively excluding non agriculture areas the southern part of the nt shows an average balance below 1 of grid cell for all three crops suggesting that only small scale irrigated agriculture could be possible in addition the balance across most of the northern and central parts of the nt decreased by 50 or more during 2019 dry period drought risk management should therefore be a serious consideration when exploring further expansion of irrigated agriculture in the nt keywords agriculture australia balance crop water demand gldas da groundwater 1 introduction the australian northern territory nt covers around 18 of australia s continental area but is home to only around 1 of its population according to the australian bureau of statistics abs 2020 this vast land is thought to have agricultural potential that is waiting to be developed ash et al 2017 in 2015 a white paper issued by the australian government specifically stressed the importance of water resources in terms of agricultural development in northern australia csiro 2016 this renewed interest in agriculture stems from growing asian markets reardon and timmer 2014 and increasing global demand for food ash et al 2017 more importantly seeking development of irrigated agriculture in the nt is treated as a way to reverse its long term population decline csiro 2016 therefore relevant studies that address federal and state territory governments interests in evaluating and identifying the opportunities for irrigated agriculture may also facilitate regional economic development of the nt however one major concern raised by the nt government for expanding irrigated agriculture is the issue of sustainability since the available water for irrigation may not be able to meet the crop water demand thomas et al 2018 i e evapotranspiration in the nt groundwater is the major source of water supply e g for mining irrigation and domestic use contributing about 90 of the total water usage kinsela et al 2012 nevertheless information on groundwater such as its spatio temporal availability for irrigated agriculture is limited for the nt region as for crop water demand the estimation is rather complicated due to many factors involved e g crop type sowing time stage of growth local environmental conditions etc as a result there has been relatively little research directed towards irrigated agriculture in the nt ash et al 2017 in recent years considerable efforts have been made to assess the potential for irrigated agricultural expansion for example many technical reports and water monitoring plans for potential agricultural regions have been produced on the one hand ti tree water report 2009 oolloo water allocation plan 2010 northern territory government 2018 csiro 2016 ash et al 2018 on the other hand local experiments for crop water demand have also been done northern territory government 2007 bithell and smith 2011 macfarlane and fairfield 2017 these reports however are still insufficient to estimate the potential of irrigated agricultural expansion over the whole nt given that they are area specific e g mostly in water control districts fig 1 drafted by the nt government other studies on water related information and crop irrigation mainly focus on hydrological and environmental aspects e g jacobson et al 1988 calf et al 1991 erskine et al 2003 or concentrate on hydro chemical aspects only e g cresswell et al 1999 vanderzalm et al 2011 barry et al 2017 besides there is a lack of direct linkage between groundwater and crop irrigation research in the nt e g where crop water demand is studied groundwater availability for irrigation is not evaluated and compared therefore spatio temporal groundwater availability and crop water demand over the nt as well as the linkage between these are not well understood to address this lack of information this study uses the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment land surface model clsm that simulates groundwater storage in shallow aquifers li et al 2019a and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 to model groundwater availability and estimate crop evapotranspiration in the nt over the 2010 2019 period respectively the newest gldas v2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace hereafter called gldas da offers daily groundwater storage estimates from 2003 to present li et al 2019b at a 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution the evaluation of this product shows a relatively good regional scale correlation 0 65 with over 4000 globally distributed borehole data li et al 2019b in the nt the gldas da is employed to make up for the scarcity of borehole data outside the water control districts fig 1 the fao penman monteith equation is recommended as the sole standard method for calculating the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 i e crop water demand allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2015 this method is widely used in different locations and climates zhang et al 2010 yao et al 2014 zanotelli et al 2019 and is not constrained by data deficiency i e can be derived from remote sensing hydrological models or re analysis data zhang et al 2010 yao et al 2014 blankenau et al 2020 in australia both mcmahon et al 2013 and bithell and smith 2011 have indicated that the fao penman monteith equation is more accurate than other methods such as pan evaporation ahooghlandari et al 2016 2017 also used the fao penman monteith equation as the reference method when evaluating crop evapotranspiration at multiple locations in australia however these studies are area specific and the calculations are only based on point scale i e meteorological stations therefore in this study a spatio temporal analytical framework is used to evaluate groundwater availability crop water demand and the resultant potential for irrigated agriculture across the nt in particular the study i evaluates the spatial variability of monthly and annual groundwater availability at 0 25 0 25 resolution based on the average condition for the 2010 2019 period and the dry condition for the year 2019 respectively ii estimates the spatial variability of the monthly reference crop evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation based on two scenarios average dry as mentioned in i iii calculates the balance i e the ratio of water availability and crop evapotranspiration for per gldas da grid cell around 60 000 ha as well as highlight potential areas for irrigated agricultural expansion based on the two scenarios average dry as specified in i subsequently the results of balance are improved by excluding those areas that are obviously not suitable for agricultural use e g nature conservations areas that do not have suitable soil and areas that have salinity issues in groundwater 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater availability estimation here we assume that groundwater is the only source of irrigation in the nt since i surface water such as rivers are strongly seasonal and the locations of rivers are not always close to the irrigated land ash et al 2017 and ii in the central semi arid and southern arid parts of the nt see fig 1 groundwater is the only reliable water resource that can be used for irrigation mossad et al 2013 2 1 1 scenarios of average 2010 2019 and dry 2019 period considering the groundwater availability may be very different during different climatic conditions i e wet and dry it is therefore important to understand the range of groundwater availability under average and dry scenarios in order to enable a better groundwater risk management in this regard this study calculates the average groundwater availability based on the 2010 2019 period as well as the groundwater availability in the driest years 2019 which recorded the lowest annual rainfall since 1961 to prove the representativeness of these two periods we download the annual rainfall records of northern territory from bom http www bom gov au climate change for the past 120 years i e 1900 2019 and compared our average condition and dry condition to other periods specifically we use the percentile method to identify the years under wet above 90th percentile average 10th to 90th percentile and dry below 10th percentile climate condition a ten year running average 5 years is also calculated to present the long term variation of rainfall meanwhile the kolmogorov smirnov k s test marsaglia et al 2003 awange et al 2019 is employed to test whether the distribution of rainfall between 2010 and 2019 and 1900 2019 is the same according to fig 2 the average rainfall for the 2010 2019 period is 601 mm while the 10 year running average is stable above 600 mm since 1996 the k s test shows that the distribution of rainfall between 2010 and 2019 and 1900 2019 is the same at 95 confidence level with a score of 0 33 the smaller value is the more similar distribution therefore it can be safely said that our results are more or less representative at least for the last 25 years as for year the 2019 it is the driest year except 1961 and the rainfall value of 265 mm is below the 10th percentile line thus using 2019 as a showcase of dry year conditions is also representative besides one can see the 10 year running average seems to have a 30 years cycle of rainfall e g 1900 1930 1930 1960 1960 1990 1990 present considering the different behaviours of previous cycles as well as potential increasing rainfall for future scenario e g there is an obvious increasing rainfall in the most two recent cycles due to the increasing intensity of tropical cyclones hennessy et al 2004 it may requires a re estimation of results in future particularly when government is going to develop a long term land irrigation program 2 1 2 the 80 20 rules according to erskine et al 2003 and macfarlane and fairfield 2017 the 80 20 rules announced by the nt government allow only 20 of the annual groundwater recharge or discharge to be extracted for irrigation i e abstraction limit see fig 3 therefore the maximum annual groundwater availability for irrigation can either be derived from groundwater recharge 1 a a r s u m r e c h a r g e m o n t h l y 20 or groundwater discharge 2 a a d s u m d i s c h a r g e m o n t h l y 20 where the recharge monthly and discharge monthly are the monthly groundwater changes positive as recharge and negative as discharge to obtain these data the gldas da estimated groundwater storage in shallow aquifers up to 6 8 m depending on input geological profiles with 0 25 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolution li et al 2019b is employed for the 2010 2019 period the monthly groundwater changes are derived from the difference between groundwater storage records of the last day in the current month and the last day in the previous month since the gldas da has not been directly evaluated over the nt li et al 2019b borehole records mostly located in water control districts see figs 1d and 1e downloaded from the australian groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer and the watergap global hydrology model wghm werth and g√ºntner 2010 doll et al 2014 that is commonly used to compare with grace see e g werth et al 2009 are also employed to examine the performance of the gldas da over the nt the evaluation is presented in the supplementary material basically both borehole and wghm show that gldas da has a relative good performance in the northern part of the nt but may not be representative in the southern part of the nt thus the results in southern part of the nt in this study has to be carefully treated as the northern territory is largely covered by tropical climate most of the groundwater recharge occurs from november to march while discharge appears from april to october based on our examination 2010 2019 average condition different years could be slightly different normally the groundwater availability for the whole year can be estimated at the end of march i e a ar leading to the groundwater extraction plan which is adjusted according to the 20 of discharge monthly 80 20 rules in the following dry period note that the 20 of the monthly groundwater discharge is set as the monthly groundwater availability not mandatory because pumping a large amount of groundwater in a month may lead to unsustainable water use and environmental degradation in other months however this is only suitable for crops grown in the dry period for some crops e g perennial crops that have high water demand irrigation is still necessary during the wet period thus the distribution of the limited groundwater availability into 12 months remains questionable fig 4 here we firstly present the monthly 20 of groundwater changes fig 5 as well as a ar and a ad derived from wet november to march and dry april to october periods under the average condition of 2010 2019 fig 6 in order to offer the spatio temporal information of groundwater availability over the nt when the groundwater availability is compared to the specific crop water demands the dry period grown crops can use the monthly 20 of groundwater discharge for irrigation e g melons and maize in fig 8 as for perennial crops e g citrus in fig 8 we only compare the annual groundwater availability and crop water demand since a good distribution of annual groundwater availability in each month should be determined by the monthly weights of crop water demands 2 2 reference et 0 estimation the reference et 0 is defined as the evapotranspiration rate mm day from a reference surface with adequate water this reference surface is assumed by the food and agriculture organization fao expert consultation on the revision of fao methodologies for crop water demand as a hypothetical reference close to grass crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 in this study the methodology of calculating reference et 0 strictly follows the crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the major equation is shown below and the parameter derivations are listed in the supplementary material the fao penman monteith equation is expressed as 3 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g the soil heat flux mj m2 day t the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a the actual vapour pressure kpa Œ¥ the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c and Œ≥ the psychrometric constant kpa c to obtain above data the gldas noah land surface model with a 0 25 0 25 spatial and monthly temporal resolution is employed as such other studies did see e g park and choi 2015 and blankenau et al 2020 2 3 balance estimation the estimation of balance between target crop water demand and water availability is considered a key factor that determines crop demand and supply sides fig 3 crop water demand is estimated by applying target crop coefficients to reference et 0 see discussion below on the supply side water availability is estimated as the sum of effective rainfall and groundwater availability after applying irrigation efficiency see fig 3 the balance therefore denotes the parity disparity between the crop water demand and the water supply effective rainfall plus irrigation 2 3 1 crop water demand crop water demand can be either obtained from previous studies e g brouwer and heibloem 1986 and macfarlane and fairfield 2017 or calculated from the crop coefficient and et 0 as an example of a former study in macfarlane and fairfield 2017 table 1 illustrates some general crop water usages and growing periods in the nt however the crop water demand estimated from the crop coefficient and et 0 is more useful since it provides monthly estimates based on different local environmental conditions in this approach crop water demand e g on a monthly basis is expressed as 4 d m e t 0 d a y s k c r a i n e i e where d m is the monthly crop water demand for irrigation et 0 the reference crop evapotranspiration per day days the number of days in that calculated month rain e the monthly effective rainfall and ie the irrigation efficiency which usually takes 0 75 or 0 85 depending on irrigation methods used ash et al 2018 bithell and smith 2011 as for k c it is the crop coefficient which can be regarded as an empirical scale factor that converts et 0 into evapotranspiration of a specific crop normally k c varies depending on crop growth stages and crop types for illustration this study selects melons maize and citrus as representative of low short season medium medium season and high perennial water use crops to show the adapted monthly k c at different growth stages in table 2 since each of these crops represents a different level of water demand 2 3 2 effective rainfall estimation the effective rainfall is the rainfall that can be directly or indirectly be used for crop production the method proposed by dastane 1978 is employed here which is given as 5 r a i n e r a i n 125 0 2 r a i n 125 f o r r a i n 250 m m or 6 r a i n e 125 0 1 r a i n f o r r a i n 250 m m where rain e and rain are the effective rainfall and total monthly rainfall respectively this method has been employed by many studies see e g loukas et al 2007 and singh et al 2020 to obtain the monthly rainfall the bureau of meteorology bom rainfall product with a 0 05 0 05 spatial and monthly temporal resolution is employed downloaded from http www bom gov au climate maps rainfall before used the data are re scaled to 0 25 0 25 in order to match it with the spatial resolution of gldas models 2 3 3 parity disparity between water supply and crop water demand considering the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution of groundwater outputs in this study i e approximately 60 000 ha per grid cell at the latitude of 20 center of the nt the balance between groundwater supply and total crop water demand d i e sum of d m for a specific crop can be expressed as an area index 7 b a l a n c e a a d o r a a r 60 000 d where a ad ora ar 60 000 represents the total amount of useable groundwater for a grid cell under the 80 20 rules the balance theoretically indicates the number of hectares that crops can be potentially supplied by such amount of groundwater the larger the balance is the greater the crop areas that can be irrigated and as such the higher the potential for irrigated agriculture is 2 4 exclusion of non agriculture areas besides the water availability land use water salinity and soil types are also important consideration for agricultural activities for land use in the nt there are many areas that belong to nature conservations thus agricultural expansion in these regions is not permitted fig 4a illustrates those areas under environmental protection based on the land use map from abares 2015 groundwater salinity is an indicator of water quality that sums all dissolved constituents in the water usually called total dissolved solids tds unit mg l different plants and crops have different tolerance to saline water according to the general salinity classification table from the department of agriculture and food in western australia https www agric wa gov au water management water salinity and plant irrigation salinity below 1425 mg l is considered as moderately salty and is suitable for irrigation to a major range of crops fig 4b provides a general map of groundwater salinity 60 90 chance to have salinity over 1500 mg l over the nt harrington and cook 2014 soil types and properties have direct impacts on vegetation jyrkama and sykes 2007 fisher et al 2016 teng et al 2018 for the nt there are many types of soil including vertosols rudosols kandosols tenosols hydrosols etc soils of the northern territory 2016 teng et al 2018 in general rudosols and tenosols fig 4c are potentially not suitable for agriculture development due to their weak soil moisture holding ability nikles et al 2008 soils of the northern territory 2016 considering the fact that agricultural activities are absolutely not permitted in the areas of nature conservation such are excluded from our analysis the problem of soil and saline groundwater can be overcome to some extent e g better irrigation plan for specific soil type and by employing saline groundwater desalination techniques thus an area with either soil or groundwater salinity is here considered suitable for agriculture and as such not excluded however if both soil and groundwater salinity are not suitable for agriculture for a given area it is determined to be a non agricultural area fig 4d 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater availability estimate in order to capture spatio temporal details on groundwater availability the entire area of the nt is divided into three parts the northern latitude 10 s to 15 s central latitude 15 s to 20 s and southern latitude below 20 s parts as shown in figs 5 and 6 hereafter simply northern central and southern nt fig 5 presents the average 20 of monthly groundwater changes for the 2010 2019 period fig 5a as well as the difference between a dry year 2019 and the average condition fig 5b in general one can see from fig 5a that the nt s groundwater changes clearly follow the seasonal and regional variations of rainfall see rainfall maps from australia bureau of meteorology at http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages rainfall with recharge mostly occurring between november and march bach 2002 rieser et al 2010 kanniah et al 2011 awange et al 2011 2019 forootan et al 2011 in the northern nt groundwater is variable with the monthly 20 change 80 20 rules ranging from 35 to 66 mm in may and january respectively which is mostly due to the high sensitivity of groundwater recharge to the seasonal rainfall mccallum et al 2010 for example 95 of annual rainfall over 1000 mm falls from november to april in darwin see region in fig 1d and the groundwater level change during this period can reach 6 7 m knapton et al 2019 in the central and southern nt the ranges of the 20 change 80 20 rules are considerably narrower than those of the northern nt ranging from 17 to 26 mm and 2 5 to 10 mm respectively due to low rainfall in these regions harlock 2003 tickell 2008 for example crosbie et al 2010 indicate that groundwater recharge in the southern nt is episodic mostly occurring only after intense rainfall the high sensitivity of groundwater to rainfall is further evident in dry years for example during the 2019 dry period fig 5b groundwater monthly change of 20 declined by around 5 20 mm during january and march as well as december over most of the northern nt compared to the 2010 2019 average by contrast in the same year a substantial recharge maximum 17 mm occurred in the northeastern corner of the northern nt in january which was associated with regional above average rainfall see e g http www bom gov au climate current annual nt archive 2019 summary shtml similarly the groundwater in the central nt was impacted from reduced rainfall during january and march as well as december having around 5 20 mm less recharge in the southern nt groundwater barely changed with the variation mostly between 5 and 5 mm except in january with a maximum change of 10 mm in the northern parts of the southern nt annual groundwater availabilities derived from the recharge wet period november to march and the discharge dry period april to october are presented in fig 6 the annual groundwater availabilities between 2010 and 2019 derived from the recharge and the discharge seasons have very similar spatial patterns over the nt figs 6a and b indicating that the annual groundwater change was nearly balanced or had a relatively small increasing decreasing trend during the 2010 2019 period this is illustrated by fig 6c where the differences between figs 6a and b are mostly within 2 mm over the nt during the 2019 dry period both annual groundwater availabilities derived from the recharge and discharge seasons showed significant drops figs 6d and e i e a drop of about 50 for most areas e g in the northern nt there was a drop from 80 mm to 40 mm and in the central nt from 40 mm to 20 mm indicating a high sensitivity of groundwater change to drought mccallum et al 2010 the northern parts of the southern nt also had a decline from above 10 mm to less than 5 mm while the remaining parts of southern nt were nearly unaffected the groundwater recharge and discharge balance for the dry year of 2019 fig 6f showed qualitatively different patterns compared to the average condition of 2010 2019 fig 6c in the eastern parts of the northern nt and northeastern shoreline of the central nt there was a 15 20 mm groundwater decline in the remaining part of the central nt and eastern parts of the southern nt the groundwater increased around 5 10 mm 3 2 reference et 0 estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 derived by the fao penman monteith equation provides the spatio temporal distribution of crop water demand as shown in fig 7 under the averaged condition of 2010 2019 fig 7a the et 0 in the northern nt is low with maximum and minimum values of 220 mm and 111 mm in july and november respectively for the central nt et 0 gradually increases following the north south trend most of the time except for june and july where the et 0 is generally uniform with a minimum of 136 mm except for a narrow wavy band of region running approximately in the nw se direction that has an elevated level around 165 mm of et 0 after july the et 0 gradually increases to a maximum of 219 mm in november the et 0 in the southern nt is slightly different with a minimum et 0 in june of around 79 mm in the southern part of the southern nt and a maximum et 0 of 306 mm in the eastern parts of the southern nt by simply following the principle of the lower the et 0 the more the suitability for irrigated agriculture the northern nt with an average et 0 of 156 mm month ranks top for irrigated agriculture potential based on the 2010 2019 condition whereas the central and southern nt follow in that order with nearly the same average et 0 of 202 mm month and 209 mm month respectively while the above regional generalisations are apparent there are also subregional variations in particular in most parts of the northern nt et 0 is low around 150 mm month throughout the year in the southern parts of the northern nt e g katherine fig 1d et 0 can reach above 200 mm month from september to december besides the average monthly rainfall in the northern nt is usually over 200 mm month between january and march see rainfall maps from australia bureau of meteorology at http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages rainfall considering that high intensity of rainfall can pose a serious challenge when managing intense storms and soil erosion smith 2008 the sowing time would be better set to april confirmed by vegetable sowing calendar for darwin katherine regions available on https industry nt gov au therefore the optimum windows to avoid high et 0 and high rainfall periods is between april and august for annual crops particularly the northeastern corner of the northern nt has quite low et 0 around 110 mm month to 120 mm month between april and july for the central nt the best time for irrigated agriculture could be between january and august since the et 0 generally goes over 230 mm month for the southern parts of the central nt from september to december in terms of the southern nt the suitable time for irrigated agriculture would be between april and september where et 0 is below 220 mm month in most areas in june and july the et 0 in the southern nt is even lower than that of the northern nt however one issue that should be considered is the low temperature in the southern nt mostly desert which may not be suitable for some crops for example csiro 2018 indicated that alice springs has an average of 34 17 frosts days and near 30 chill time annually which is better suited to high chill fruit crops during the 2019 dry period fig 7b et 0 increased all over the nt for example the et 0 in the northern central and southern nt on average increased by 13 mm month 32 mm month and 22 mm month respectively indicating the possibility of irrigated agriculture being more vulnerable to drought in the central nt possibly this is one of the reasons why most water control districts drafted by the nt government are outside of the central nt in particular the major increase in et 0 in the central nt occurred from november to march with an average increase of 49 mm month such an increase in et 0 was mainly associated with increased wind speed as well as reduced relative humidity see fig s3 in the supplementary material 3 3 balance estimate here melons maize and citrus are used to illustrate the balance estimates i e an area index representing the agriculture potential per the gldas da pixel since these crops represent different levels of crop water demand i e a total water demand of 290 mm for melons i e sown in april and takes 80 90 days to mature 580 mm for maize sown in april and takes 140 150 days to mature and 900 mm for citrus perennial 5 years 50 canopy with active ground cover are required for irrigation during their entire growing period according to macfarlane and fairfield 2017 the irrigation efficiency is set as 0 85 throughout the nt as mentioned in section 2 3 1 with the above specifications fig 8 provides the spatio temporal distribution of the total irrigated water demand for each of the three crops above considering only one harvest a year and the balance estimates under the averaged condition of 2010 2019 as well as the dry year of 2019 the monthly irrigated water demand and balance estimates can be found in the supplementary figs s4 s6 the monthly balance of citrus is not provided since the distribution of annual groundwater availability in each month is determined by the monthly weights of crop water demands as mentioned in section 2 1 2 in other words the balance of citrus will be all the same from january to december as the annual balance if the annual groundwater availability is well distributed for each month our results show that the average total irrigated water demand under the 2010 2019 average condition as 231 mm 555 mm and 926 mm northern nt 387 mm 722 mm and 1663 mm central nt and 333 mm 552 mm and 1993 mm southern nt for melons maize and citrus respectively these results however differ from the estimates of macfarlane and fairfield 2017 particularly in the central and southern nt although macfarlane and fairfield 2017 claimed that the statistics in table 1 are not precise to a specific location these statistics collected from the measurement of water consumption and water licence still have spatial preference for example the current cropping and horticulture areas where those statistics were measured in the nt are very few and mostly located in the northern nt such as darwin and katherine as well as the southern nt such as ti tree and alice springs see cropping areas in the nt https www agriculture gov au abares research topics aboutmyregion nt regional overview therefore if we simply restrict our comparison of water demand estimates to these cropping and horticulture areas e g regions from darwin to katherine the average total irrigated water demand under the average condition is 273 mm for melons for example which is then very close to the estimates from macfarlane and fairfield 2017 for melons the upper half of the northern nt has more irrigated potentials than the lower half according to figs 8a and b for example the upper half of the northern nt generally has total irrigated water demand below 200 mm and the balance indicates that most areas here have a sufficient amount of groundwater to support growth area of melons for more than 15 000 ha particularly the region in the northeastern corner has a minimum total irrigated water demand of 97 mm and a maximum balance of 41 000 ha in the central nt the northeastern shoreline seems to be the best regions to grow melons with a minimum total irrigated water demand of 270 mm and a maximum balance of 9800 ha as for the southern nt although its lower parts have the lowest total irrigated water demand of 219 mm the groundwater availability determines the maximum balance in its upper parts i e 1000 ha during the 2019 dry period most areas of the nt had increased irrigated water demand and reduced balance due to reduced rainfall and groundwater availability in particular the northern nt was the most vulnerable to drought since most of its lower half had reduced balance by 50 e g from 10 000 ha to 5000 ha this is interesting and inconsistent with the conclusion arrived at in section 3 2 that the central nt was the most vulnerable to drought with the largest increased et 0 the most likely explanation is that the reduced groundwater availability had more significant effects on balance than increased et 0 in the northern nt besides another interesting phenomenon is that the northeastern corner of the northern nt had increased balance from around 40 000 60 000 ha during the drought probably due to the regional above average rainfall in april and may mentioned in section 3 1 for most areas of the central nt the balance was reduced by 1000 3000 ha e g northeastern shoreline from around 8000 ha to 6000 ha and the middle parts from around 2000 500 ha below as for the southern nt the balance was less affected generally falling between 100 500 ha compared to melons maize has a relatively long growing period i e from april to august in april during the initial growth stage maize can fully rely on rain fed irrigation in most of the northern nt see supplementary fig s5 since crop coefficient k c at this growth stage is only 0 3 similar to the spatial patterns of irrigated water demand and the balance for melons figs 8c and d the northeastern parts of the northern nt 400 500 mm total irrigated water demand and 8000 15 000 ha balance the northeastern shoreline of the central nt 580 610 mm total irrigated water demand and 4000 5 000 ha balance and the northern parts of the southern nt 500 800 ha balance could be the most suitable areas for growing maize in each region under the very dry year of 2019 the northeastern corner of the northern nt maintained largely the same balance 13 000 15000 ha as in the average conditions of 2010 2019 whilst in other regions the balance generally declined by 2000 4000 ha in the central nt the drought effects were widely seen albeit small in magnitude e g an average reduction in total balance of 1000 ha as for the southern nt still the total balance was relatively unaffected by the dry condition and generally changing by between 50 ha and 200 ha only citrus as a perennial crop requires irrigation every month except in december to march in the northern nt see fig s6 in supplementary material thus the total irrigated water demand of citrus is much higher than annual crops and could be very different in different regions as well as under drought conditions for example the northeastern corner of the northern nt has a minimum total irrigated water demand of 620 mm under 2010 2019 average conditions fig 8e while the maximum total irrigated water demand reached 2868 mm in the southern parts of the central nt in the 2019 dry period such a large difference in water demand could generate economical considerations i e whether it is worthwhile or cost effective to grow citrus in the central nt with water consumption 3 4 times higher than in the northern nt therefore the total irrigated water demand should also be taken into consideration when choosing suitable areas for growing citrus based on figs 8e and f the northern nt and the northeastern shoreline of the central nt seem to have good potentials for citrus with total irrigated water demand ranging from 620 mm to 1300 mm and balance from 3000 ha to 10 000 ha with the dry conditions of 2019 the balance significantly reduced by near 50 for the lower half of the northern nt and the total irrigated water demand increased by around 200 500 mm considering that citrus is a kind of crop that is vulnerable to drought and its production is significantly affected by irrigation melgar 2014 the economical balance among groundwater use production and risk management to drought have to be considered 3 4 exclusion of non agriculture areas based on the principle of suitability mentioned in section 2 4 approximately 54 of non agriculture areas constrained by physical conditions are excluded over the nt the excluded total irrigated water demand mm and balance estimates are now shown in fig 9 comparing figs 9 and 8 one can see those previous large agriculture potential areas e g the northeastern corner of the northern nt are excluded the balance index is largely reduced e g from maximum 40 000 ha down to 15 000 ha for melon 20 000 ha down to 8000 ha for maize and 10 000 ha down to 6000 ha for citrus in the northern nt under the average 2010 2019 condition therefore the average balance under the average 2010 2019 condition for melon maize citrus are around 9430 5490 3520 ha 15 7 9 1 5 8 area per gldas da pixel in the northern nt 2780 2000 970 ha 4 6 3 3 1 6 in the central nt and 400 390 110 ha 0 6 0 6 0 1 in the southern nt the most suitable crop regions in the northern nt in the central nt in the southern nt are near the darwin district the northeastern shoreline the eastern parts during dry period of 2019 balance is affected near the darwin districts e g reduced by about 1 3 from 15 000 ha to 10 000 ha for melons 9000 ha to 6000 ha for maize and 6000 ha to 4000 ha for citrus for other regions in the northern and central nt the drought effects on balance are more obvious with a reduction of about 50 or more in the southern nt the drought effects in 2019 are not obvious the balance for some regions in southeastern parts are even increased finally to clearly see the overall changes of balance for the northern central and southern parts of nt during average and dry period as well as before and after exclusion of non agriculture areas table 3 summarises the average balance below 3 5 limitations and suggestions despite the fact that this study infers irrigated agricultural potential through an areal balance index the results are established based on the data of simulated models i e groundwater from the gldas da and crop evapotranspiration from the gldas noah especially the gldas da only simulates groundwater in shallow aquifers the depth of groundwater extraction can reach hundreds of meters in the alice springs in other words the accuracy of the results can vary spatially and temporally based on the uncertainties of the parameters simulated by these models and the areal balance index may not be that accurate as represented in figs 8 and 9 most importantly for groundwater estimates in the central and southern nt our evaluations see supplementary material for the gldas da using borehole and wghm products show that the gldas da cannot accurately reflect the seasonality change in groundwater unfortunately we cannot overcome this problem since there are no better datasets that have such good spatio temporal coverage for the whole nt however considering that the groundwater storage changes in the central and southern nt are small fig s1 groundwater availabilities are even smaller when 80 20 rules are applied our results inferring a small potential of irrigated agriculture in these semi arid and arid regions could still be reliable another limitation of this study is the coarse spatial resolution of the datasets i e 0 25 0 25 which is approximately 60 000 ha per grid cell nevertheless such a size is still too large for farms from tens of hectares to thousands of hectares that mainly focus on irrigated agriculture for example in alice springs the groundwater extraction from the mereenie aquifer for agriculture is only used for areas of 48 ha northern territory government 2016 also in 2016 2017 the department of environment and environment and natural resources took an assessment for irrigated agriculture in the ti tree basin the total survey area is only 13 563 ha https depws nt gov au land resource management development opportunities projects ti tree thus our results can only be a guide to infer the irrigated agricultural potential over the nt extra local works e g field investigations for the selection of farm sites are still required in order to obtain more accurate estimates based on local environment conditions finally as the section 2 1 1 pointed out the results of this study are only more or less representative after 1995 considering the increasing trend of rainfall in the northern territory it may require a re estimation when calculating the balance for future scenario 4 conclusion the australian northern territory has a vast area with substantial potential for irrigated agriculture however the lack of wide scale water related information and irrigated agricultural studies contribute to limited agricultural expansion in the northern territory exemplified by melons maize and citrus crops this study therefore employed the newest global land data assimilation system version 2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and the fao penman monteith equation to evaluate the balance between groundwater availability and crop water demand over the northern territory based on the average 2010 2019 condition the results found that i the northern nt areas with latitude above s15 in comparison to other parts of the territory had the highest potential for irrigated agriculture since it had the highest annual groundwater availability 40 140 mm under the 80 20 rules and the lowest average total irrigated water demands of 231 mm 555 mm and 926 mm partly due to effective rainfall for melons maize and citrus respectively also the region had the highest average balance irrigable area index of 9500 ha 2700 ha and 400 ha for melons maize and citrus respectively after excluding non agriculture areas besides another advantage of the northern nt is that it is the only region that can rely on rain fed agriculture effective rainfall for e g perennial crop during december and march across the nt the most suitable crop regions in the northern nt are near the darwin district where the intensively irrigated agriculture may be considered ii in the central nt areas between latitude of s15 and 20 the annual average groundwater availability was around 20 60 mm under the 80 20 rules the average total irrigated water demands for melons 387 mm maize 722 mm and citrus 1633 mm were much higher than the respective figures for the northern nt the balance after excluding non agriculture areas were also low in general except for the northeastern shoreline where they reached a maximum of 7000 ha 5000 ha 3000 ha for melons maize and citrus respectively therefore the northeastern shoreline could be considered the best region for irrigated agriculture in the central nt however due to the fact that such a region is very close to the sea problems such as groundwater salinity and soil erosion should be seriously considered overall the intensively irrigated agriculture is not seen to be viable over the central nt iii the southern nt areas with latitude below s20 shows only a small area of irrigated agricultural potential due to the low annual groundwater availability around 5 15 mm under the 80 20 rules the low reference crop evapotranspiration between april and september indicates an opportunity for small scale irrigated agriculture during this time of the year however low temperature during this period may limit the crop types that can be grown iv irrigated agriculture in the nt is highly sensitive to dry climate e g with groundwater availability reduced by more than 50 in most of the northern and central nt in the dry year of 2019 the driest year in past 58 years this is important since we found that the decline of groundwater availability had more significant effects on balance estimates than the increased irrigated water demand v due to the coarse spatial resolution and uncertainty of the modelled products the areal balance index may not be that accurate as indicated and the results are suggested as a guide for inferring areas of irrigated agricultural potential across the nt meanwhile the balance results of this study are only representative for agricultural potential after 1995 for other periods or future scenario it may require a re estimation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9604,agricultural expansion has been a hot topic in the northern territory nt of australia in recent years however insufficient information on available water resources and crop evapotranspiration is a bottleneck to this expansion towards closing this gap this study employs the newest global land data assimilation system gldas version 2 2 catchment products assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace hereafter called gldas da and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation to spatially evaluate the balance between water availability i e groundwater and effective rainfall and melons maize and citrus crop evapotranspiration water demand of three representative short medium season and perennial crop types over the nt for the 2010 2019 period specifically this balance is the estimated ratio of water availability and crop evapotranspiration representing the crop area that can be planted in each gldas da grid cell the larger the balance the greater the irrigated agriculture potential under the average 2010 2019 conditions our results show that the northern part of the nt has the highest irrigated agriculture potentials with the average balance of 9430 ha 15 7 5490 ha 9 1 and 3520 ha 5 8 for melons maize and citrus respectively excluding non agriculture areas irrigated agriculture in the central part of the nt shows less potential compared to the northern part of the nt with the average balance of 2780 ha 4 6 2000 ha 3 3 and 970 ha 1 6 for melons maize and citrus respectively excluding non agriculture areas the southern part of the nt shows an average balance below 1 of grid cell for all three crops suggesting that only small scale irrigated agriculture could be possible in addition the balance across most of the northern and central parts of the nt decreased by 50 or more during 2019 dry period drought risk management should therefore be a serious consideration when exploring further expansion of irrigated agriculture in the nt keywords agriculture australia balance crop water demand gldas da groundwater 1 introduction the australian northern territory nt covers around 18 of australia s continental area but is home to only around 1 of its population according to the australian bureau of statistics abs 2020 this vast land is thought to have agricultural potential that is waiting to be developed ash et al 2017 in 2015 a white paper issued by the australian government specifically stressed the importance of water resources in terms of agricultural development in northern australia csiro 2016 this renewed interest in agriculture stems from growing asian markets reardon and timmer 2014 and increasing global demand for food ash et al 2017 more importantly seeking development of irrigated agriculture in the nt is treated as a way to reverse its long term population decline csiro 2016 therefore relevant studies that address federal and state territory governments interests in evaluating and identifying the opportunities for irrigated agriculture may also facilitate regional economic development of the nt however one major concern raised by the nt government for expanding irrigated agriculture is the issue of sustainability since the available water for irrigation may not be able to meet the crop water demand thomas et al 2018 i e evapotranspiration in the nt groundwater is the major source of water supply e g for mining irrigation and domestic use contributing about 90 of the total water usage kinsela et al 2012 nevertheless information on groundwater such as its spatio temporal availability for irrigated agriculture is limited for the nt region as for crop water demand the estimation is rather complicated due to many factors involved e g crop type sowing time stage of growth local environmental conditions etc as a result there has been relatively little research directed towards irrigated agriculture in the nt ash et al 2017 in recent years considerable efforts have been made to assess the potential for irrigated agricultural expansion for example many technical reports and water monitoring plans for potential agricultural regions have been produced on the one hand ti tree water report 2009 oolloo water allocation plan 2010 northern territory government 2018 csiro 2016 ash et al 2018 on the other hand local experiments for crop water demand have also been done northern territory government 2007 bithell and smith 2011 macfarlane and fairfield 2017 these reports however are still insufficient to estimate the potential of irrigated agricultural expansion over the whole nt given that they are area specific e g mostly in water control districts fig 1 drafted by the nt government other studies on water related information and crop irrigation mainly focus on hydrological and environmental aspects e g jacobson et al 1988 calf et al 1991 erskine et al 2003 or concentrate on hydro chemical aspects only e g cresswell et al 1999 vanderzalm et al 2011 barry et al 2017 besides there is a lack of direct linkage between groundwater and crop irrigation research in the nt e g where crop water demand is studied groundwater availability for irrigation is not evaluated and compared therefore spatio temporal groundwater availability and crop water demand over the nt as well as the linkage between these are not well understood to address this lack of information this study uses the global land data assimilation system gldas catchment land surface model clsm that simulates groundwater storage in shallow aquifers li et al 2019a and the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 to model groundwater availability and estimate crop evapotranspiration in the nt over the 2010 2019 period respectively the newest gldas v2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace hereafter called gldas da offers daily groundwater storage estimates from

2014 blankenau et al 2020 in australia both mcmahon et al 2013 and bithell and smith 2011 have indicated that the fao penman monteith equation is more accurate than other methods such as pan evaporation ahooghlandari et al 2016 2017 also used the fao penman monteith equation as the reference method when evaluating crop evapotranspiration at multiple locations in australia however these studies are area specific and the calculations are only based on point scale i e meteorological stations therefore in this study a spatio temporal analytical framework is used to evaluate groundwater availability crop water demand and the resultant potential for irrigated agriculture across the nt in particular the study i evaluates the spatial variability of monthly and annual groundwater availability at 0 25 0 25 resolution based on the average condition for the 2010 2019 period and the dry condition for the year 2019 respectively ii estimates the spatial variability of the monthly reference crop evapotranspiration using the penman monteith equation based on two scenarios average dry as mentioned in i iii calculates the balance i e the ratio of water availability and crop evapotranspiration for per gldas da grid cell around 60 000 ha as well as highlight potential areas for irrigated agricultural expansion based on the two scenarios average dry as specified in i subsequently the results of balance are improved by excluding those areas that are obviously not suitable for agricultural use e g nature conservations areas that do not have suitable soil and areas that have salinity issues in groundwater 2 data and methods 2 1 groundwater availability estimation here we assume that groundwater is the only source of irrigation in the nt since i surface water such as rivers are strongly seasonal and the locations of rivers are not always close to the irrigated land ash et al 2017 and ii in the central semi arid and southern arid parts of the nt see fig 1 groundwater is the only reliable water resource that can be used for irrigation mossad et al 2013 2 1 1 scenarios of average 2010 2019 and dry 2019 period considering the groundwater availability may be very different during different climatic conditions i e wet and dry it is therefore important to understand the range of groundwater availability under average and dry scenarios in order to enable a better groundwater risk management in this regard this study calculates the average groundwater availability based on the 2010 2019 period as well as the groundwater availability in the driest years 2019 which recorded the lowest annual rainfall since 1961 to prove the representativeness of these two periods we download the annual rainfall records of northern territory from bom http www bom gov au climate change for the past 120 years i e 1900 2019 and compared our average condition and dry condition to other periods specifically we use the percentile method to identify the years under wet above 90th percentile average 10th to 90th percentile and dry below 10th percentile climate condition a ten year running average 5 years is also calculated to present the long term variation of rainfall meanwhile the kolmogorov smirnov k s test marsaglia et al 2003 awange et al 2019 is employed to test whether the distribution of rainfall between 2010 and 2019 and 1900 2019 is the same according to fig 2 the average rainfall for the 2010 2019 period is 601 mm while the 10 year running average is stable above 600 mm since 1996 the k s test shows that the distribution of rainfall between 2010 and 2019 and 1900 2019 is the same at 95 confidence level with a score of 0 33 the smaller value is the more similar distribution therefore it can be safely said that our results are more or less representative at least for the last 25 years as for year the 2019 it is the driest year except 1961 and the rainfall value of 265 mm is below the 10th percentile line thus using 2019 as a showcase of dry year conditions is also representative besides one can see the 10 year running average seems to have a 30 years cycle of rainfall e g 1900 1930 1930 1960 1960 1990 1990 present considering the different behaviours of previous cycles as well as potential increasing rainfall for future scenario e g there is an obvious increasing rainfall in the most two recent cycles due to the increasing intensity of tropical cyclones hennessy et al 2004 it may requires a re estimation of results in future particularly when government is going to develop a long term land irrigation program 2 1 2 the 80 20 rules according to erskine et al 2003 and macfarlane and fairfield 2017 the 80 20 rules announced by the nt government allow only 20 of the annual groundwater recharge or discharge to be extracted for irrigation i e abstraction limit see fig 3 therefore the maximum annual groundwater availability for irrigation can either be derived from groundwater recharge 1 a a r s u m r e c h a r g e m o n t h l y 20 or groundwater discharge 2 a a d s u m d i s c h a r g e m o n t h l y 20 where the recharge monthly and discharge monthly are the monthly groundwater changes positive as recharge and negative as discharge to obtain these data the gldas da estimated groundwater storage in shallow aquifers up to 6 8 m depending on input geological profiles with 0 25 0 25 spatial and daily temporal resolution li et al 2019b is employed for the 2010 2019 period the monthly groundwater changes are derived from the difference between groundwater storage records of the last day in the current month and the last day in the previous month since the gldas da has not been directly evaluated over the nt li et al 2019b borehole records mostly located in water control districts see figs 1d and 1e downloaded from the australian groundwater explorer http www bom gov au water groundwater explorer and the watergap global hydrology model wghm werth and g√ºntner 2010 doll et al 2014 that is commonly used to compare with grace see e g werth et al 2009 are also employed to examine the performance of the gldas da over the nt the evaluation is presented in the supplementary material basically both borehole and wghm show that gldas da has a relative good performance in the northern part of the nt but may not be representative in the southern part of the nt thus the results in southern part of the nt in this study has to be carefully treated as the northern territory is largely covered by tropical climate most of the groundwater recharge occurs from november to march while discharge appears from april to october based on our examination 2010 2019 average condition different years could be slightly different normally the groundwater availability for the whole year can be estimated at the end of march i e a ar leading to the groundwater extraction plan which is adjusted according to the 20 of discharge monthly 80 20 rules in the following dry period note that the 20 of the monthly groundwater discharge is set as the monthly groundwater availability not mandatory because pumping a large amount of groundwater in a month may lead to unsustainable water use and environmental degradation in other months however this is only suitable for crops grown in the dry period for some crops e g perennial crops that have high water demand irrigation is still necessary during the wet period thus the distribution of the limited groundwater availability into 12 months remains questionable fig 4 here we firstly present the monthly 20 of groundwater changes fig 5 as well as a ar and a ad derived from wet november to march and dry april to october periods under the average condition of 2010 2019 fig 6 in order to offer the spatio temporal information of groundwater availability over the nt when the groundwater availability is compared to the specific crop water demands the dry period grown crops can use the monthly 20 of groundwater discharge for irrigation e g melons and maize in fig 8 as for perennial crops e g citrus in fig 8 we only compare the annual groundwater availability and crop water demand since a good distribution of annual groundwater availability in each month should be determined by the monthly weights of crop water demands 2 2 reference et 0 estimation the reference et 0 is defined as the evapotranspiration rate mm day from a reference surface with adequate water this reference surface is assumed by the food and agriculture organization fao expert consultation on the revision of fao methodologies for crop water demand as a hypothetical reference close to grass crop with an assumed crop height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 in this study the methodology of calculating reference et 0 strictly follows the crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the major equation is shown below and the parameter derivations are listed in the supplementary material the fao penman monteith equation is expressed as 3 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g the soil heat flux mj m2 day t the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 the wind speed at 2 m height m s e s the saturation vapour pressure kpa e a the actual vapour pressure kpa Œ¥ the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c and Œ≥ the psychrometric constant kpa c to obtain above data the gldas noah land surface model with a 0 25 0 25 spatial and monthly temporal resolution is employed as such other studies did see e g park and choi 2015 and blankenau et al 2020 2 3 balance estimation the estimation of balance between target crop water demand and water availability is considered a key factor that determines crop demand and supply sides fig 3 crop water demand is estimated by applying target crop coefficients to reference et 0 see discussion below on the supply side water availability is estimated as the sum of effective rainfall and groundwater availability after applying irrigation efficiency see fig 3 the balance therefore denotes the parity disparity between the crop water demand and the water supply effective rainfall plus irrigation 2 3 1 crop water demand crop water demand can be either obtained from previous studies e g brouwer and heibloem 1986 and macfarlane and fairfield 2017 or calculated from the crop coefficient and et 0 as an example of a former study in macfarlane and fairfield 2017 table 1 illustrates some general crop water usages and growing periods in the nt however the crop water demand estimated from the crop coefficient and et 0 is more useful since it provides monthly estimates based on different local environmental conditions in this approach crop water demand e g on a monthly basis is expressed as 4 d m e t 0 d a y s k c r a i n e i e where d m is the monthly crop water demand for irrigation et 0 the reference crop evapotranspiration per day days the number of days in that calculated month rain e the monthly effective rainfall and ie the irrigation efficiency which usually takes 0 75 or 0 85 depending on irrigation methods used ash et al 2018 bithell and smith 2011 as for k c it is the crop coefficient which can be regarded as an empirical scale factor that converts et 0 into evapotranspiration of a specific crop normally k c varies depending on crop growth stages and crop types for illustration this study selects melons maize and citrus as representative of low short season medium medium season and high perennial water use crops to show the adapted monthly k c at different growth stages in table 2 since each of these crops represents a different level of water demand 2 3 2 effective rainfall estimation the effective rainfall is the rainfall that can be directly or indirectly be used for crop production the method proposed by dastane 1978 is employed here which is given as 5 r a i n e r a i n 125 0 2 r a i n 125 f o r r a i n 250 m m or 6 r a i n e 125 0 1 r a i n f o r r a i n 250 m m where rain e and rain are the effective rainfall and total monthly rainfall respectively this method has been employed by many studies see e g loukas et al 2007 and singh et al 2020 to obtain the monthly rainfall the bureau of meteorology bom rainfall product with a 0 05 0 05 spatial and monthly temporal resolution is employed downloaded from http www bom gov au climate maps rainfall before used the data are re scaled to 0 25 0 25 in order to match it with the spatial resolution of gldas models 2 3 3 parity disparity between water supply and crop water demand considering the 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution of groundwater outputs in this study i e approximately 60 000 ha per grid cell at the latitude of 20 center of the nt the balance between groundwater supply and total crop water demand d i e sum of d m for a specific crop can be expressed as an area index 7 b a l a n c e a a d o r a a r 60 000 d where a ad ora ar 60 000 represents the total amount of useable groundwater for a grid cell under the 80 20 rules the balance theoretically indicates the number of hectares that crops can be potentially supplied by such amount of groundwater the larger the balance is the greater the crop areas that can be irrigated and as such the higher the potential for irrigated agriculture is 2 4 exclusion of non agriculture areas besides the water availability land use water salinity and soil types are also important consideration for agricultural activities for land use in the nt there are many areas that belong to nature conservations thus agricultural expansion in these regions is not permitted fig 4a illustrates those areas under environmental protection based on the land use map from abares 2015 groundwater salinity is an indicator of water quality that sums all dissolved constituents in the water usually called total dissolved solids tds unit mg l different plants and crops have different tolerance to saline water according to the general salinity classification table from the department of agriculture and food in western australia https www agric wa gov au water management water salinity and plant irrigation salinity below 1425 mg l is considered as moderately salty and is suitable for irrigation to a major range of crops fig 4b provides a general map of groundwater salinity 60 90 chance to have salinity over 1500 mg l over the nt harrington and cook 2014 soil types and properties have direct impacts on vegetation jyrkama and sykes 2007 fisher et al 2016 teng et al 2018 for the nt there are many types of soil including vertosols rudosols kandosols tenosols hydrosols etc soils of the northern territory 2016 teng et al 2018 in general rudosols and tenosols fig 4c are potentially not suitable for agriculture development due to their weak soil moisture holding ability nikles et al 2008 soils of the northern territory 2016 considering the fact that agricultural activities are absolutely not permitted in the areas of nature conservation such are excluded from our analysis the problem of soil and saline groundwater can be overcome to some extent e g better irrigation plan for specific soil type and by employing saline groundwater desalination techniques thus an area with either soil or groundwater salinity is here considered suitable for agriculture and as such not excluded however if both soil and groundwater salinity are not suitable for agriculture for a given area it is determined to be a non agricultural area fig 4d 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater availability estimate in order to capture spatio temporal details on groundwater availability the entire area of the nt is divided into three parts the northern latitude 10 s to 15 s central latitude 15 s to 20 s and southern latitude below 20 s parts as shown in figs 5 and 6 hereafter simply northern central and southern nt fig 5 presents the average 20 of monthly groundwater changes for the 2010 2019 period fig 5a as well as the difference between a dry year 2019 and the average condition fig 5b in general one can see from fig 5a that the nt s groundwater changes clearly follow the seasonal and regional variations of rainfall see rainfall maps from australia bureau of meteorology at http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages rainfall with recharge mostly occurring between november and march bach 2002 rieser et al 2010 kanniah et al 2011 awange et al 2011 2019 forootan et al 2011 in the northern nt groundwater is variable with the monthly 20 change 80 20 rules ranging from 35 to 66 mm in may and january respectively which is mostly due to the high sensitivity of groundwater recharge to the seasonal rainfall mccallum et al 2010 for example 95 of annual rainfall over 1000 mm falls from november to april in darwin see region in fig 1d and the groundwater level change during this period can reach 6 7 m knapton et al 2019 in the central and southern nt the ranges of the 20 change 80 20 rules are considerably narrower than those of the northern nt ranging from 17 to 26 mm and 2 5 to 10 mm respectively due to low rainfall in these regions harlock 2003 tickell 2008 for example crosbie et al 2010 indicate that groundwater recharge in the southern nt is episodic mostly occurring only after intense rainfall the high sensitivity of groundwater to rainfall is further evident in dry years for example during the 2019 dry period fig 5b groundwater monthly change of 20 declined by around 5 20 mm during january and march as well as december over most of the northern nt compared to the 2010 2019 average by contrast in the same year a substantial recharge maximum 17 mm occurred in the northeastern corner of the northern nt in january which was associated with regional above average rainfall see e g http www bom gov au climate current annual nt archive 2019 summary shtml similarly the groundwater in the central nt was impacted from reduced rainfall during january and march as well as december having around 5 20 mm less recharge in the southern nt groundwater barely changed with the variation mostly between 5 and 5 mm except in january with a maximum change of 10 mm in the northern parts of the southern nt annual groundwater availabilities derived from the recharge wet period november to march and the discharge dry period april to october are presented in fig 6 the annual groundwater availabilities between 2010 and 2019 derived from the recharge and the discharge seasons have very similar spatial patterns over the nt figs 6a and b indicating that the annual groundwater change was nearly balanced or had a relatively small increasing decreasing trend during the 2010 2019 period this is illustrated by fig 6c where the differences between figs 6a and b are mostly within 2 mm over the nt during the 2019 dry period both annual groundwater availabilities derived from the recharge and discharge seasons showed significant drops figs 6d and e i e a drop of about 50 for most areas e g in the northern nt there was a drop from 80 mm to 40 mm and in the central nt from 40 mm to 20 mm indicating a high sensitivity of groundwater change to drought mccallum et al 2010 the northern parts of the southern nt also had a decline from above 10 mm to less than 5 mm while the remaining parts of southern nt were nearly unaffected the groundwater recharge and discharge balance for the dry year of 2019 fig 6f showed qualitatively different patterns compared to the average condition of 2010 2019 fig 6c in the eastern parts of the northern nt and northeastern shoreline of the central nt there was a 15 20 mm groundwater decline in the remaining part of the central nt and eastern parts of the southern nt the groundwater increased around 5 10 mm 3 2 reference et 0 estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 derived by the fao penman monteith equation provides the spatio temporal distribution of crop water demand as shown in fig 7 under the averaged condition of 2010 2019 fig 7a the et 0 in the northern nt is low with maximum and minimum values of 220 mm and 111 mm in july and november respectively for the central nt et 0 gradually increases following the north south trend most of the time except for june and july where the et 0 is generally uniform with a minimum of 136 mm except for a narrow wavy band of region running approximately in the nw se direction that has an elevated level around 165 mm of et 0 after july the et 0 gradually increases to a maximum of 219 mm in november the et 0 in the southern nt is slightly different with a minimum et 0 in june of around 79 mm in the southern part of the southern nt and a maximum et 0 of 306 mm in the eastern parts of the southern nt by simply following the principle of the lower the et 0 the more the suitability for irrigated agriculture the northern nt with an average et 0 of 156 mm month ranks top for irrigated agriculture potential based on the 2010 2019 condition whereas the central and southern nt follow in that order with nearly the same average et 0 of 202 mm month and 209 mm month respectively while the above regional generalisations are apparent there are also subregional variations in particular in most parts of the northern nt et 0 is low around 150 mm month throughout the year in the southern parts of the northern nt e g katherine fig 1d et 0 can reach above 200 mm month from september to december besides the average monthly rainfall in the northern nt is usually over 200 mm month between january and march see rainfall maps from australia bureau of meteorology at http www bom gov au jsp ncc climate averages rainfall considering that high intensity of rainfall can pose a serious challenge when managing intense storms and soil erosion smith 2008 the sowing time would be better set to april confirmed by vegetable sowing calendar for darwin katherine regions available on https industry nt gov au therefore the optimum windows to avoid high et 0 and high rainfall periods is between april and august for annual crops particularly the northeastern corner of the northern nt has quite low et 0 around 110 mm month to 120 mm month between april and july for the central nt the best time for irrigated agriculture could be between january and august since the et 0 generally goes over 230 mm month for the southern parts of the central nt from september to december in terms of the southern nt the suitable time for irrigated agriculture would be between april and september where et 0 is below 220 mm month in most areas in june and july the et 0 in the southern nt is even lower than that of the northern nt however one issue that should be considered is the low temperature in the southern nt mostly desert which may not be suitable for some crops for example csiro 2018 indicated that alice springs has an average of 34 17 frosts days and near 30 chill time annually which is better suited to high chill fruit crops during the 2019 dry period fig 7b et 0 increased all over the nt for example the et 0 in the northern central and southern nt on average increased by 13 mm month 32 mm month and 22 mm month respectively indicating the possibility of irrigated agriculture being more vulnerable to drought in the central nt possibly this is one of the reasons why most water control districts drafted by the nt government are outside of the central nt in particular the major increase in et 0 in the central nt occurred from november to march with an average increase of 49 mm month such an increase in et 0 was mainly associated with increased wind speed as well as reduced relative humidity see fig s3 in the supplementary material 3 3 balance estimate here melons maize and citrus are used to illustrate the balance estimates i e an area index representing the agriculture potential per the gldas da pixel since these crops represent different levels of crop water demand i e a total water demand of 290 mm for melons i e sown in april and takes 80 90 days to mature 580 mm for maize sown in april and takes 140 150 days to mature and 900 mm for citrus perennial 5 years 50 canopy with active ground cover are required for irrigation during their entire growing period according to macfarlane and fairfield 2017 the irrigation efficiency is set as 0 85 throughout the nt as mentioned in section 2 3 1 with the above specifications fig 8 provides the spatio temporal distribution of the total irrigated water demand for each of the three crops above considering only one harvest a year and the balance estimates under the averaged condition of 2010 2019 as well as the dry year of 2019 the monthly irrigated water demand and balance estimates can be found in the supplementary figs s4 s6 the monthly balance of citrus is not provided since the distribution of annual groundwater availability in each month is determined by the monthly weights of crop water demands as mentioned in section 2 1 2 in other words the balance of citrus will be all the same from january to december as the annual balance if the annual groundwater availability is well distributed for each month our results show that the average total irrigated water demand under the 2010 2019 average condition as 231 mm 555 mm and 926 mm northern nt 387 mm 722 mm and 1663 mm central nt and 333 mm 552 mm and 1993 mm southern nt for melons maize and citrus respectively these results however differ from the estimates of macfarlane and fairfield 2017 particularly in the central and southern nt although macfarlane and fairfield 2017 claimed that the statistics in table 1 are not precise to a specific location these statistics collected from the measurement of water consumption and water licence still have spatial preference for example the current cropping and horticulture areas where those statistics were measured in the nt are very few and mostly located in the northern nt such as darwin and katherine as well as the southern nt such as ti tree and alice springs see cropping areas in the nt https www agriculture gov au abares research topics aboutmyregion nt regional overview therefore if we simply restrict our comparison of water demand estimates to these cropping and horticulture areas e g regions from darwin to katherine the average total irrigated water demand under the average condition is 273 mm for melons for example which is then very close to the estimates from macfarlane and fairfield 2017 for melons the upper half of the northern nt has more irrigated potentials than the lower half according to figs 8a and b for example the upper half of the northern nt generally has total irrigated water demand below 200 mm and the balance indicates that most areas here have a sufficient amount of groundwater to support growth area of melons for more than 15 000 ha particularly the region in the northeastern corner has a minimum total irrigated water demand of 97 mm and a maximum balance of 41 000 ha in the central nt the northeastern shoreline seems to be the best regions to grow melons with a minimum total irrigated water demand of 270 mm and a maximum balance of 9800 ha as for the southern nt although its lower parts have the lowest total irrigated water demand of 219 mm the groundwater availability determines the maximum balance in its upper parts i e 1000 ha during the 2019 dry period most areas of the nt had increased irrigated water demand and reduced balance due to reduced rainfall and groundwater availability in particular the northern nt was the most vulnerable to drought since most of its lower half had reduced balance by 50 e g from 10 000 ha to 5000 ha this is interesting and inconsistent with the conclusion arrived at in section 3 2 that the central nt was the most vulnerable to drought with the largest increased et 0 the most likely explanation is that the reduced groundwater availability had more significant effects on balance than increased et 0 in the northern nt besides another interesting phenomenon is that the northeastern corner of the northern nt had increased balance from around 40 000 60 000 ha during the drought probably due to the regional above average rainfall in april and may mentioned in section 3 1 for most areas of the central nt the balance was reduced by 1000 3000 ha e g northeastern shoreline from around 8000 ha to 6000 ha and the middle parts from around 2000 500 ha below as for the southern nt the balance was less affected generally falling between 100 500 ha compared to melons maize has a relatively long growing period i e from april to august in april during the initial growth stage maize can fully rely on rain fed irrigation in most of the northern nt see supplementary fig s5 since crop coefficient k c at this growth stage is only 0 3 similar to the spatial patterns of irrigated water demand and the balance for melons figs 8c and d the northeastern parts of the northern nt 400 500 mm total irrigated water demand and 8000 15 000 ha balance the northeastern shoreline of the central nt 580 610 mm total irrigated water demand and 4000 5 000 ha balance and the northern parts of the southern nt 500 800 ha balance could be the most suitable areas for growing maize in each region under the very dry year of 2019 the northeastern corner of the northern nt maintained largely the same balance 13 000 15000 ha as in the average conditions of 2010 2019 whilst in other regions the balance generally declined by 2000 4000 ha in the central nt the drought effects were widely seen albeit small in magnitude e g an average reduction in total balance of 1000 ha as for the southern nt still the total balance was relatively unaffected by the dry condition and generally changing by between 50 ha and 200 ha only citrus as a perennial crop requires irrigation every month except in december to march in the northern nt see fig s6 in supplementary material thus the total irrigated water demand of citrus is much higher than annual crops and could be very different in different regions as well as under drought conditions for example the northeastern corner of the northern nt has a minimum total irrigated water demand of 620 mm under 2010 2019 average conditions fig 8e while the maximum total irrigated water demand reached 2868 mm in the southern parts of the central nt in the 2019 dry period such a large difference in water demand could generate economical considerations i e whether it is worthwhile or cost effective to grow citrus in the central nt with water consumption 3 4 times higher than in the northern nt therefore the total irrigated water demand should also be taken into consideration when choosing suitable areas for growing citrus based on figs 8e and f the northern nt and the northeastern shoreline of the central nt seem to have good potentials for citrus with total irrigated water demand ranging from 620 mm to 1300 mm and balance from 3000 ha to 10 000 ha with the dry conditions of 2019 the balance significantly reduced by near 50 for the lower half of the northern nt and the total irrigated water demand increased by around 200 500 mm considering that citrus is a kind of crop that is vulnerable to drought and its production is significantly affected by irrigation melgar 2014 the economical balance among groundwater use production and risk management to drought have to be considered 3 4 exclusion of non agriculture areas based on the principle of suitability mentioned in section 2 4 approximately 54 of non agriculture areas constrained by physical conditions are excluded over the nt the excluded total irrigated water demand mm and balance estimates are now shown in fig 9 comparing figs 9 and 8 one can see those previous large agriculture potential areas e g the northeastern corner of the northern nt are excluded the balance index is largely reduced e g from maximum 40 000 ha down to 15 000 ha for melon 20 000 ha down to 8000 ha for maize and 10 000 ha down to 6000 ha for citrus in the northern nt under the average 2010 2019 condition therefore the average balance under the average 2010 2019 condition for melon maize citrus are around 9430 5490 3520 ha 15 7 9 1 5 8 area per gldas da pixel in the northern nt 2780 2000 970 ha 4 6 3 3 1 6 in the central nt and 400 390 110 ha 0 6 0 6 0 1 in the southern nt the most suitable crop regions in the northern nt in the central nt in the southern nt are near the darwin district the northeastern shoreline the eastern parts during dry period of 2019 balance is affected near the darwin districts e g reduced by about 1 3 from 15 000 ha to 10 000 ha for melons 9000 ha to 6000 ha for maize and 6000 ha to 4000 ha for citrus for other regions in the northern and central nt the drought effects on balance are more obvious with a reduction of about 50 or more in the southern nt the drought effects in 2019 are not obvious the balance for some regions in southeastern parts are even increased finally to clearly see the overall changes of balance for the northern central and southern parts of nt during average and dry period as well as before and after exclusion of non agriculture areas table 3 summarises the average balance below 3 5 limitations and suggestions despite the fact that this study infers irrigated agricultural potential through an areal balance index the results are established based on the data of simulated models i e groundwater from the gldas da and crop evapotranspiration from the gldas noah especially the gldas da only simulates groundwater in shallow aquifers the depth of groundwater extraction can reach hundreds of meters in the alice springs in other words the accuracy of the results can vary spatially and temporally based on the uncertainties of the parameters simulated by these models and the areal balance index may not be that accurate as represented in figs 8 and 9 most importantly for groundwater estimates in the central and southern nt our evaluations see supplementary material for the gldas da using borehole and wghm products show that the gldas da cannot accurately reflect the seasonality change in groundwater unfortunately we cannot overcome this problem since there are no better datasets that have such good spatio temporal coverage for the whole nt however considering that the groundwater storage changes in the central and southern nt are small fig s1 groundwater availabilities are even smaller when 80 20 rules are applied our results inferring a small potential of irrigated agriculture in these semi arid and arid regions could still be reliable another limitation of this study is the coarse spatial resolution of the datasets i e 0 25 0 25 which is approximately 60 000 ha per grid cell nevertheless such a size is still too large for farms from tens of hectares to thousands of hectares that mainly focus on irrigated agriculture for example in alice springs the groundwater extraction from the mereenie aquifer for agriculture is only used for areas of 48 ha northern territory government 2016 also in 2016 2017 the department of environment and environment and natural resources took an assessment for irrigated agriculture in the ti tree basin the total survey area is only 13 563 ha https depws nt gov au land resource management development opportunities projects ti tree thus our results can only be a guide to infer the irrigated agricultural potential over the nt extra local works e g field investigations for the selection of farm sites are still required in order to obtain more accurate estimates based on local environment conditions finally as the section 2 1 1 pointed out the results of this study are only more or less representative after 1995 considering the increasing trend of rainfall in the northern territory it may require a re estimation when calculating the balance for future scenario 4 conclusion the australian northern territory has a vast area with substantial potential for irrigated agriculture however the lack of wide scale water related information and irrigated agricultural studies contribute to limited agricultural expansion in the northern territory exemplified by melons maize and citrus crops this study therefore employed the newest global land data assimilation system version 2 2 with data assimilated from the gravity recovery and climate experiment and the fao penman monteith equation to evaluate the balance between groundwater availability and crop water demand over the northern territory based on the average 2010 2019 condition the results found that i the northern nt areas with latitude above s15 in comparison to other parts of the territory had the highest potential for irrigated agriculture since it had the highest annual groundwater availability 40 140 mm under the 80 20 rules and the lowest average total irrigated water demands of 231 mm 555 mm and 926 mm partly due to effective rainfall for melons maize and citrus respectively also the region had the highest average balance irrigable area index of 9500 ha 2700 ha and 400 ha for melons maize and citrus respectively after excluding non agriculture areas besides another advantage of the northern nt is that it is the only region that can rely on rain fed agriculture effective rainfall for e g perennial crop during december and march across the nt the most suitable crop regions in the northern nt are near the darwin district where the intensively irrigated agriculture may be considered ii in the central nt areas between latitude of s15 and 20 the annual average groundwater availability was around 20 60 mm under the 80 20 rules the average total irrigated water demands for melons 387 mm maize 722 mm and citrus 1633 mm were much higher than the respective figures for the northern nt the balance after excluding non agriculture areas were also low in general except for the northeastern shoreline where they reached a maximum of 7000 ha 5000 ha 3000 ha for melons maize and citrus respectively therefore the northeastern shoreline could be considered the best region for irrigated agriculture in the central nt however due to the fact that such a region is very close to the sea problems such as groundwater salinity and soil erosion should be seriously considered overall the intensively irrigated agriculture is not seen to be viable over the central nt iii the southern nt areas with latitude below s20 shows only a small area of irrigated agricultural potential due to the low annual groundwater availability around 5 15 mm under the 80 20 rules the low reference crop evapotranspiration between april and september indicates an opportunity for small scale irrigated agriculture during this time of the year however low temperature during this period may limit the crop types that can be grown iv irrigated agriculture in the nt is highly sensitive to dry climate e g with groundwater availability reduced by more than 50 in most of the northern and central nt in the dry year of 2019 the driest year in past 58 years this is important since we found that the decline of groundwater availability had more significant effects on balance estimates than the increased irrigated water demand v due to the coarse spatial resolution and uncertainty of the modelled products the areal balance index may not be that accurate as indicated and the results are suggested as a guide for inferring areas of irrigated agricultural potential across the nt meanwhile the balance results of this study are only representative for agricultural potential after 1995 for other periods or future scenario it may require a re estimation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
