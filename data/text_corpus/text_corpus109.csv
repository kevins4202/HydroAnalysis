545,examining the physical mechanisms through which large scale climate indicators e g el niño southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole affect hydroclimatic variables in the tropics and extratropics is a scientific challenge in this study climatic relationships between large scale climate indices cis and taiwan rainfall variability were examined not only leading patterns of observed monthly total and extreme rainfall were estimated through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection method eot but also correlation and regression analyses were performed for the leading rainfall patterns and various cis based on atmospheric ocean circulation dataset from the spatial structure of the leading eot patterns for total and extreme rainfall the north coast mode in the cold seasons and the middle inland mode for the warm seasons were detected the temporal cycle of the leading eot patterns indicates decreasing trends in the cold seasons and oscillations mainly on decadal timescales in the warm seasons the leading eot patterns of total rainfall showed more widespread coherent patterns than those of extreme rainfall with more variance in rainfall variability the findings from this study illustrate that tropical enso forcing has a coherent association with march and october november rainfall patterns while the indian ocean dipole is identified as a driver for rainfall variability during spring and fall the western north pacific monsoon activity has a negative positive correlation with march october and december rainfall variabilities and tropical cyclone indices also exhibit significant positive correlation with october rainfalls the leading patterns of the october and following year march rainfall time series are predictable at up to nine month lead time from the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures ssts keywords rainfall variability enso teleconnection 1 introduction rainfall in taiwan is influenced by the northeasterly monsoon in the cold season and the southwesterly monsoon in the warm season chen et al 1999 the rainfall regimes also can be categorized into five seasons such as winter december to february the spring transition march and april the mei yu season may to june the typhoon season july to august and the autumn september november wang et al 1984 taiwan experiences spatial and temporal rainfall variability in association with island geographic structure synoptic circulation and large scale teleconnection chen and yu 1988 yen and chen 2000 chen and chen 2003 chen et al 2007 chen et al 2008 kuo et al 2010 chen et al 2010 chen and chen 2010 indicated that the taiwan rainfall is generated by local rain showers related to geographic structure terrain or local winds or transient disturbances embedded in the prevailing monsoon flow the regional rainfall climate over taiwan shows large spatial and temporal variabilities with the change of the prevailing wind directions of the warm cold seasons the presence of the central mountain range and the various transient subsynoptic disturbances occurring in different seasons such as spring cold fronts summer mei yu fronts and typhoons fall cold fronts and winter cold surges taiwan is located in the subtropics off the asian continental and its climate is strongly affected by the east asian monsoons the central mountain range gives rise to large spatial variations in the island climate throughout the year since the island terrain is dominated by the almost north south orientated central mountain range with about 2 km high and 4 km long peaks the taiwan climate shows striking spatial variations in rainfall for better understanding the regional climate over taiwan it is necessary to study the climate systems from the planetary scale down to the island scale due to the presence of mountainous terrain meanwhile rainfall variation is related to fluctuations of various climate indices cis representing large scale climate phenomena including el niño la niña southern oscillation tropical cyclone and monsoon activity the large scale climate signals above have been widely studied on global and regional scales since the climatic impacts are associated with hydroclimatic extreme events i e floods droughts or abnormal heat wave throughout the world at various scales significant findings have been investigated for teleconnections of the large scale cis and hydrometeorological variables including rainfall streamflow and temperature kiladis and diaz 1989 douglas and englehart 1981 ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 kahya and dracup 1994 karabörk and kahya 2003 jin et al 2005 chandimala and zubair 2007 maity and kashid 2010 lee and julien 2015 2016 stephan et al 2017a 2017b the effects of the enso on precipitation variability on a global and regional scale have been widely documented since the first investigation of walker 1923 on the influence of the southern oscillation so on rainfall fluctuations in indian monsoon many recent global scale studies have documented climatic links between enso tropical ocean sea surface temperature variability and global precipitation anomaly patterns e g bradley et al 1987 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 showed statistically significant enso related climate signals by detecting the spatiotemporal scopes having a consistent and coherent impact of the extreme phases of enso phenomena on the precipitation and temperature pattern in the various areas all over the world a considerable body of the regional scale study correlating the enso phases to hydroclimatology over low and middle latitudes provided noticeable evidence of the statistically significant enso related precipitation signals douglas and englehart 1981 schonher and nicholson 1989 grimm et al 1998 price et al 1998 karabörk and kahya 2003 lanckriet et al 2014 in the mid latitude regions the enso related hydroclimatic teleconnection has been investigated by cayan and peterson 1989 and diaz and kiladis 1993 they emphasized the impacts of the atmospheric variability over the north pacific on the western united states hydrologic parameters also for extratropical teleconnections with the pacific sea surface temperatures ssts kahya and dracup 1994 carried out diagnostic investigations for the response of rainfall variability over the united states to the extreme enso events karabörk and kahya 2003 analyzed the remote forcing the enso phenomena to mid latitude rainfall patterns in turkey using harmonic and composite analyses and chiew et al 1994 identified consistent seasons and coherent regions in south east australia in which hydrologic variables are statistically correlated with the warm cold phases of enso events furthermore chandimala and zubair 2007 predicted seasonal rainfall variability over the kelani river sri lanka using empirical and statistical approaches including principal component analysis zhang et al 2007 demonstrated teleconnections between the extreme enso phenomena and maximum rainfall of yangtze river basin in china using cross wavelet analysis maity and kashid et al 2010 2011 used artificial intelligence ai tools with statistical techniques to investigate climatic response in mahanadi river india to large scale atmospheric circulation stephan et al 2018a 2018b objectively identify regions in china showing strong coherent interannual and intraseasonal variability in seasonal precipitation and examined the associated local and large scale atmospheric and coupled air sea processes using the empirical orthogonal teleconnection method monsoon related frontal systems and tropical cyclone tc activity can be considered as the major rain bearing systems in the conjunction regions between the asian continent and the western north pacific wnp monsoon rain bands climatologically first appear in the south china sea in may shift northward in june july in concurrence with the formation of the east asian monsoon frontal systems over china japan and korea and then move to the tropical wnp philippine sea region in august chen et al 2010 the monsoon activity could also be considered as a ci for precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries wang et al 2008 suggested a new index for monsoon activity using principal component analysis based on a comparative analysis on the various existing monsoon indices in east asian from the perspective of interannual variation of atmospheric circulation and rainfall they emphasized that the mei yu rainfall plays an essential role in quantifying monsoon intensity over east asia using observational analyses and numerical climate modeling through an agcm echam v4 6 and coupled model poem wang et al 2013 revealed that positive western pacific subtropical high wpsh ocean relationship can be used as potential sources of prediction skill for climate predictability and emphasized the critical role of subtropical circulation for predicting the monsoon and tropical storm activity several recent studies for the large scale climatic impacts on the hydro meteorological variabilities over taiwan have also been reported chen et al 2008 examined an asymmetry relationship between el niño event and seasonal rainfall over taiwan and the associated large scale dynamic processes through an observational study during 1950 2003 their analysis results disclosed four major enso rainfall relationship types such as el nino wet type en w la nina dry ln d el nino dry en d and la nina wet ln w and showed that the cause of the asymmetric enso impacts between the positive and negative correlation groups is attributed to a connection between enso and the indian ocean io ssta and associated large scale atmospheric circulation kuo et al 2010 analyzed the variability and oscillations of november january ndj and january march jfm rainfall 1974 2006 of taiwan and seasonal sea surface temperature sst of the pacific ocean using wavelet analysis also they demonstrated predictability of seasonal ndj and jfm rainfalls over taiwan at one season lead time using an artificial neural network ann calibrated by the genetic algorithm ga chen et al 2010 investigated the interannual variability of tropical cyclone induced rainfall ptc and monsoon induced rainfall psm in taiwan for the period 1950 2002 they found that ptc and psm accounts for 47 5 and 52 5 of total rainfall in taiwan respectively showing two dominant rainfall variability types namely enhanced ptc but suppressed psm and suppressed ptc but enhanced psm lin et al 2015 investigated impacts of canonical enso and enso modoki on rainfall over taiwan by monthly mean rainfall data using nino 3 4 index and enso modoki index their results showed that the winter spring summer autumn rainfall increases decreases during the canonical el nino episodes while the opposite is true for the enso modoki as described above the aforementioned studies mostly focused on seasonal mean precipitation thus there has been less attention paid to the climatic relationship between large scale climate fluctuations and monthly total and extreme rainfall patterns also the previous studies have stressed mostly on global scale remote cis as a climate signal of large scale atmospheric or air sea coupled circulations except for the studies by king et al 2014 klingaman et al 2013 and maity and kashid 2010 2011 king et al 2014 examined australian rainfall variability through eot decomposition analysis and indicated that the first eot modes of december rainfall show notable predictability up to several months one year in advance from the tropical pacific ocean indian ocean sst also in a diagnostic study to understand the physical mechanism of the climatic impacts of large scale climate indices on queensland rainfall patterns in australia klingaman et al 2013 identified remote and local drivers affecting the seasonal rainfall patterns using eot decomposition with inter annual and decadal variability they classified large scale climate indicator into two categories remote and local cis despite the aforementioned studies there has been less focus in the literature regarding the climatic far reaching effects of both remote and local cis on hydroclimatic variability maity and kashid 2010 2011 however climatic impacts on the hydro meteorological variables are not restricted to global scale indices hence it is necessary to identify how both remote and local cis have an effect on the total and extreme rainfall patterns over taiwan on a monthly basis the purposes of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variabilities of total and extreme rainfall anomalies over taiwan using empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot technique and to identify significant climatic impacts of remote and local climate indicators on mid latitude rainfall variability in addition predictability for total and extreme rainfall patterns is also examined through the regression of the sea surface temperatures ssts gridded data onto the leading eot patterns with varying lead times in terms of above and below normal rainfall conditions 2 data in this study the monthly rainfall gridded dataset was derived from station based observed rainfall data covering the taiwan island the source of the observational data is the monthly and daily rainfall records for the period of 1966 to 2016 at 30 stations from the data bank for atmospheric hydrologic research rainfall and temperature are monitored by central weather bureau with automatic gauge stations for estimating high resolution rainfall with a regular spaced grid the prism parameter elevation regression on independent slope model developed by daly et al 1994 2008 was used for the observational rainfall time series the prism technique is well suited to regions with mountainous terrain like taiwan because it incorporates a conceptual framework that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of orographic rainfall using geographic information of the distance elevation coastal proximity and topographic facet this method is an independent model for each target grid which can estimate target grid value by weighting each station differently based on the similarity in distance elevation coastal proximity and topographic facet between observational station and target grid using the prism model we produced the grid dataset with a gridded mesh of 102 points 20 km resolution of extreme and total precipitation on a monthly basis from 1966 to 2016 taking into account the spatiotemporal persistency as shown in fig 1 in addition extreme rainfall time series were generated as a follow up to the recommendation of climatic variability and predictability cci clivar the seasonal highest five consecutive daily rainfalls define the extreme rainfall dataset during the study period the monthly total and extreme rainfall time series were calculated for each grid point for comparative analysis on the cis related rainfall teleconnection various cis were used in this paper the oceanic niño index oni the multivariate enso index mei and the southern oscillation index soi were employed as indicators of extreme phase of enso phenomena considering atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations the oni time series are estimated using sst values in the niño 3 4 index area 120 170 w in this study the oni dataset was obtained from the climate prediction center cpc of the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa the mei is calculated using six atmospheric ocean variables over the tropical pacific i e surface air temperatures sea surface temperatures cloudiness fractions zonal and meridional surface winds and sea level pressures the source of the standardized bimonthly mei time series used in the present study was the climate diagnostic center cdc the soi a standardized index is estimated using mean sea lever pressure mslp values between darwin and tahiti in this study the soi time series were obtained from the noaa climate prediction center gridded dataset of reconstructed ssts were employed to investigate the teleconnection between rainfall eot patterns and the aforementioned cis the extended reconstructed sst ersst v4 was used as reconstructed sst dataset huang et al 2014 the ersst time series are provided on 2 0 2 0 grids from 1854 to the present as shown in fig 2 the monsoon index over western north pacific wnpmi was selected as an indicator of monsoon activity for investigating teleconnection with rainfall eot patterns wang and fan 1999 estimated the wnpmi values using 850 hpa zonal winds difference between southern and northern index areas in fig 2 u850 1 indicates the magnitude of the monsoon westerly in the area of indochina peninsula and the philippines and u850 2 represents the intensity of easterly wind across the southeastern region of subtropical anticyclone over western north pacific the other climate index for tropical cyclone activity namely tci was estimated using the tracks of tropical cyclone based on the observational dataset of the ibtracs knapp et al 2010 these tci time series were calculated by the number of typhoons passing through an index region near taiwan in fig 2 3 methodology fig 3 outlines the overall methodology used in this study the first step is to generate monthly based rainfall time series with respect to total and extreme rainfall the second step is to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of the total and extreme rainfall over taiwan using eot method the third step is to implement correlation analysis to investigate the cis related rainfall teleconnection the last step is to carry out lag regression analysis for leading eot rainfall patterns and tropical pacific sst gridded data with various lags for comparative interpretation on the opposite phases rainfall predictability empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot was employed rather than the conventional analysis by empirical orthogonal function eof to investigate spatio temporal patterns of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan the eot method decomposes rainfall dataset with spatio temporal variability to a set of orthogonal components van den dool et al 2000 the eot technique detects a set of spatial patterns extracts the temporal cycles and gives an index of the importance of each pattern the eot approach is orthogonal in either space or time as opposed to empirical orthogonal function eof orthogonal in both space and time thus the advantage of using the eot technique is that it allows the estimated patterns to be more intuitively interpreted the eot 1 spatial pattern of the rainfall time series is estimated by detecting a point showing the largest sum of explained variance for all other points van den dool et al 2000 designated this point as base point bp the corresponding rainfall time series of the first bp is assigned as eot 1 temporal pattern the second spatial pattern of rainfall eot time series are obtained by performing regression analysis for the rainfall time series of the first bp on to the residual points to remove the impacts of the bp upon the rainfall data set for the reduced rainfall time series the next bp is extracted by identifying the second point having the greatest amount of variance across the residual domain for extracting more eot patterns in the residual domain reduced by the previous decomposition process these reduction processes are successively repeated by finding the optimum numbers of spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall dataset the following mathematical expressions of eot procedure are based on van den dool et al 2000 after detecting the bp s b1 in space which explains the greatest amount of variance at the residual domain its associated spatial mode e 1 s is defined as the first eot the temporal mode α1 t associated with eot 1 is simply the original time series for its bp 1 e 1 s c o r s s b 1 s t d s s t d s b 1 2 α 1 t r s b 1 t cor s sb1 is the temporal correlation coefficient between rainfall time series r sb1 t at base point and r s t at all other points also std sb1 and std s stand for the temporal standard deviation of r sb1 t at the base point and r s t at all other points as follows 3 c o r s s b 1 1 n t t 1 n t r s t r s b 1 t s t d s b 1 s t d s 4 s t d s b 1 1 n t t 1 n t r s b 1 t 2 5 s t d s 1 n t t 1 n t r s t 2 after extracting eot 1 the data are split into a portion of which variance is explained re s t and a residual rr s t as follows 6 r e s t α 1 t e 1 s 7 r r s t r s t r e s t after dividing the data into explained and residual portions the procedure is repeated using the once reduced data the point in space which explains the most variance for all other points in rr s t becomes the base point for eot 2 the time series connected with eot 2 is represented by the series at its base point in the once reduced data after removing the variance explained by eot 2 from the data set the process is repeated again and so on until all of the domain variance in the original data is explained re s t grows at the expense of rr s t reordering the variance in the original data as eot modes the total variance tv in the data is expressed by 8 t v 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s r s t 2 where nt and ns is the numbers of points in time and space the amount of variance explained by a particular eot is related to the fraction of its explained variance ev to the total domain variance 9 e v 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s r e s t 2 t v as a result of the above procedure the eot 1 and eot 2 were obtained for monthly total and extreme rainfall time series from 1965 to 2016 for investigating various rainfall variabilities in different areas of taiwan for describing the results from the lead lag correlation and regression analyses between various cis and rainfall eot patterns correlation coefficients and regression maps were employed in this study to identify climatic impacts of various cis on total and extreme rainfall variability across taiwan each rainfall eot mode was correlated with several cis showing spatial and temporal fluctuation e g enso wnpmi and tci especially as a follow up to the statistical method by king et al 2014 spearman s approach was employed at the 95 confidence level even though spearman s rank test was carried out for calculating correlation coefficients the resultant values were generally in agreement with pearson s correlation coefficients also in order to examine predictability of monthly rainfall ersst gridded dataset over the tropical pacific were regressed on to eot time series with varying monthly lead the regression maps were plotted on 2 0 2 0 grids by calculating regression coefficients between leading eot time series and all gridded global sea surface temperature dataset in addition to examine what causes the anomalous rainfall over the taiwan island circulation anomalies associated with the extreme phases of the large scale climate phenomena is investigated using composite difference of circulation fields e g the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low event years 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability of rainfall eots correlation coefficients for each eot associated with the highest variance across the residual domain rainfall were mapped for each month the values are the correlation coefficients between the rainfall eots at the bps and the rainfall dataset at all other points each leading eot has the largest explained variance for total and extreme rainfall the second eot are also computed using the procedures discussed above fig 4 shows the spatiotemporal patterns for the leading two eots of march and october total and extreme rainfall spatial patterns of the eots for total and extreme rainfall vary with months fig 4 the bp s locations for total rainfall are similar to those for extreme rainfall in march august in the middle inland area in october february the bps of total eots shift northward this is particularly clear in march fig 4a and c and october fig 4b and d where the bps of the eots for rainfall are plotted at the middle inland and the north coastal areas respectively eight out of twelve pairs of leading patterns are in the same locations for the center of the total and extreme leading eots as shown in table 1 the locations of the bps indicate that out of 24 total extreme rainfall eots i e two eots for twelve months 10 8 exhibit north coast mode 9 8 middle inland mode and 5 8 south coast mode the spatial structure of the eots for total and extreme rainfall represents middle inland mode in the warm season march august and north coast mode in the cold season october february additionally there are nationwide spatial homogeneities in both total and extreme rainfall modes during the spring season than in other seasons with more widespread nationwide patterns while the only leading extreme rainfall shows nationwide spatial homogeneity in the winter season total spatio temporal variance associated with the first and second eots varies with seasons as shown in table 1 the values of explained variance for each total extreme eot are 0 52 0 51 to 0 79 0 76 for leading eots whereas those for the following eots decrease to about 0 10 0 11 at the second eots the explained variance by the eots for extreme rainfall is lower than those by the leading total eots in all seasons since extreme rainfall is likely to show inhomogeneities as opposed to total rainfall showing more consistent variation king et al 2014 fig 4 shows the temporal patterns for the leading eots of total and extreme rainfall based on 7 year running mean curve used by klingaman et al 2013 as shown in table 1 15 out of 24 total rainfall eots exhibit notable patterns such as increasing decreasing trends and decadal oscillations and temporal cycles of the extreme rainfall eots show also 13 notable temporal patterns the decreasing trends of these eots exhibit during the cold season while decadal variations of rainfall eots occur during the warm seasons as a general result many eots have total and extreme rainfall signals throughout taiwan with noticeable influence coverage 4 2 teleconnections between eots and various climate indices correlation coefficients of each eot with various cis are shown for total and extreme rainfall in table 2 additionally regression maps for reconstructed sst dataset were plotted depending on each eot pattern as shown in fig 5 the regression analyses demonstrate noticeable climatic links between the two datasets which show consistent patterns with the spatial structure documented commonly in the climate impacts papers investigated correlation coefficients were computed for the previously extracted eots and three enso indices oni mei soi table 2 indicates that the oni are positively correlated with eot 1 for total rainfall in march while the leading eot modes for october and november rainfall are negatively correlated with the tropical enso forcing the mei related eot correlations were similar to the results of the oni time series the soi time series exhibit negative correlations with eot 1 for total rainfall in march whereas the leading eot modes for october rainfall are positively correlated with the enso indices in january and february the enso related climate signals are weaker than those for other months this reflects the fact that far reaching effect of the warm and cold phases of enso events on regional climate variables is not significant in this time also the correlations are weaker in march may than in october november because the enso phase in march may is not mature or decay additionally the second eots exhibit significant correlations in middle inland and north coastal areas the results from the above correlation analyses imply that the extreme phases of enso forcing have an effect on the variability of the total rainfall anomaly in middle inland and north coastal areas the extreme rainfall eots also are significantly correlated with the tropical enso forcing the three enso indices exhibit slightly lower correlations with the extreme rainfall eots than those with the eot modes for total rainfall the iod is also associated with total and extreme rainfall variability in taiwan in table 2 the leading total rainfall eot modes are significantly correlated with the iod as quantified by the dmi index representing the anomalous sst gradient between the western and eastern tropical indian ocean the iod time series show a significant negative correlation with the leading eots for total rainfall in spring and fall seasons the extreme rainfall eot modes also demonstrate a similar correlation with the dmi climatic impacts of the enso forcing on the rainfall eots also detected in regression fields as shown in figs 5 highly regressed rainfall eots are modulated by the typical enso phase showing warmer than normal sst across the tropical pacific ocean warmer than normal signals for total and extreme rainfall eots present the typical sst patterns of enso phase these phases of the sst fluctuations which was defined as pacific east asian teleconnection pea by wang et al 2000 promotes variability of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan during the october of enso years correlation coefficients for eots and monsoon activity were computed using the wmpmi as shown in table 2 the eots are negatively positively correlated with the wmpmi time series in march october and december negative phase of the wnpmi modulates above normal rainfall anomaly over taiwan on the contrary the below normal rainfall anomaly is attributed to the positive wnpmi phase wang et al 2000 additionally some notable relationships between the monsoon variability and lower order eot time series were found in some months these overall results indicate that the monsoon activity modulates the total rainfall over taiwan by increasing or decreasing with respect to months the extreme rainfall eots also exhibit similar results of correlation analyses except for additional strong correlation between the monsoon index and the eot 2 in november monsoon variability shows higher correlation coefficients with the leading eots for total rainfall than extreme rainfall eots for monthly tropical cyclone variability the tci was estimated for the index area as shown in fig 2 correlation analyses were performed for the tci time series and the leading eots for total and extreme rainfall from spring to fall season table 2 shows that the tci has significant correlation with three total rainfall eots this indicates that increase and decrease of tropical cyclone events passing through the index area have an effect on the enhancement and suppression of total rainfall anomaly on the other hand two extreme rainfall eots are significantly correlation with the tci time series from the findings of correlation analysis there are three significant positive correlations between tci and total rainfall eots two of which exhibit in the middle inland area the leading eots for october rainfall show a strong positive correlation with the tci time series that is during fall season the leading eots in the norther area of taiwan are positively correlated with the tropical cyclone activity 4 3 predictability of monthly rainfall despite the fact that it is worthwhile to extend the understanding of the potential cis effects for rainfall variability it is also important to improve predictability of this variability the previously performed correlation analysis did not take into account any time lags between the eot time series for total and extreme rainfall and various cis if the various cis applied here have a significant impact on the rainfall anomalies over taiwan then it is worthwhile to quantify the degree of this influence by a cross correlation analysis between the two time series to provide not only an improved predictability of potential sources of prediction skill but also further understanding of the far reaching response of the cis to the mid latitude rainfall variability the lead lag correlation was quantified by correlating the seasonal eots for the total and extreme rainfall with different time lag cis that are set up from lag 0 to lag 17 on a monthly basis it was attempted to capture a signal period showing significant correlation of the rainfall eots with the cis along the entire preceding year of the events at which rainfall patterns cis and the time lag are substantially associated with each other the overall correlation coefficients are calculated at 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 significance levels for grid based analyses for better comparison cross correlation analyses were carried out for the leading eots and the aforementioned three enso indices oni mei soi with varying lead time as shown in table 3 and fig 6 the eot 1 for october total rainfall has a negative correlation with the oni from june to october whereas the june to december oni time series are positively correlated with the leading eots for total rainfall anomaly of the following march the results of the mei related eot cross correlation analyses were similar to those of the oni time series with the lagged signals up to six months in advance the soi time series from july to october are positively correlated with eot 1 for october total rainfall while the leading eot modes in the following march are negatively correlated with the soi time series from september to december as shown in table 3 significant correlation was not found in early summer this reflects that the enso related rainfall signal is not significant during early summer lagged correlation is stronger during fall season compared with other seasons because the enso phase is mature or fully developed during this season the findings from the above analyses imply that the teleconnection between enso forcing and total rainfall variability over taiwan is detectable with up to nine months lags in addition the extreme rainfall eots have significant lagged correlation with enso indices the three enso indices have slightly lower correlation coefficient values with the extreme eots than those with the total rainfall though the two results indicate a similar temporal pattern the lagged responses of the leading eots for extreme rainfall to the oni mei and soi indices similarly reflect those of the first eots for total rainfall for investigating potential sources of predictability of monthly rainfall anomaly the sst gridded dataset of ersst v4 were regressed on to the previously extracted eot patterns with varying lead months as shown in figs 7 and 8 the october lag 0 to lag 4 regression maps regressing june to october ssts on to october leading eots in fig 7 show potential predictability with negative signals which extend to months prior to june also the lag regression of the june to december ssts on to the march eots of the following year shows positive signals with lag 9 to lag 3 in fig 8 this implies that the leading march eots of the following year of the event have the sst related rainfall predictability up to nine months in advance with positive signals these signals exhibit until months prior to june and then diminish lag regression maps indicate coherent pacific ocean sst variability related to eots of taiwan rainfall 4 4 composite analysis the correlation pattern between the taiwan rainfall eot and the pacific ocean po indian ocean io sst shows noticeable differences between the two periods especially in october november the taiwan rainfall variability shows a significant negative correlation with the po io sst while positive correlation is true in march of the following year of the events these opposite correlation patterns are very similar to the positive and negative phases of enso and iod episodes implying that both extreme events have a close relationship with the taiwan rainfall variability why does the io po sst pattern negatively correlate with the taiwan rainfall in october november but positively correlate with the taiwan rainfall in march the tropical po io sea surface temperature can cause large anomalous circulation over the wnp hence one way by which the sst variation over the tropical po io has an effect on the taiwan rainfall is through the atmospheric circulation over the wnp for two periods the different responses of atmospheric circulation over east asia to distinct tropical po io sst variation may play a critical role in the different correlation patterns thus we focus on the influences of different po io sst patterns on the atmospheric circulation anomalies over east asia around the taiwan island to examine what causes the anomalous precipitation over the taiwan island circulation anomalies associated with enso forcing is investigated using composite difference of circulation fields e g the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low enso years as shown in fig 10 following the criteria suggested by ropelewski and halpert 1986 the years 1982 1987 1991 1997 2009 and 2015 are identified as extreme positive events while 1973 1975 1988 1999 2007 and 2011 are designated as extreme negative events in october there is a cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific as shown in fig 10a the cyclonic flow can be interpreted as rossby wave response to the equatorial pacific heating the northerlies prevailing over the taiwan island fig 10c is part of the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific this figure clearly describes the taiwan island under the influence of dominant northerly wind son et al 2014 suggested that the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific is a principal driver in teleconnection between enso forcing and the fall precipitation variability in east asia the corresponding northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards the taiwan island resulting in below normal rainfall activity in addition genesis and development of tropical cyclones play a crucial role in taiwan rainfall fluctuation during fall season thus it is plausible to seek some clue of the climatic far reaching effects of the tropical storms and typhoons on east asian climate chu 2004 revealed that during the warm enso event years the eastward shift of monsoon trough having anomalous cyclonic vorticity causes the mitigation of vertical wind shear over the wnp cha et al 1999 showed that the total number of typhoons generated throughout the western north pacific decreases in the warm event years furthermore decrease increase of occurrences of tropical cyclones in the wnp during the warm cold event years was examined by li 1990 consequently the apparent decline in october rainfall is caused by the depression of the fall season by reduction of the tropical storms and typhoons over east asia during the warm phase years while increase of rainfall in october of the cold phase years is in association with more frequent occurrences of tropical cyclones on the other hand in march of the following year of the events fig 10b a massive anomalous anticyclone is found over the wnp with two centers one located in the mid latitude region over the kuroshio extension and another located over the philippine sea wang et al 2000 suggested that the wnp anticyclone is an important driver that links the east asian monsoon and the central eastern pacific warming as shown in fig 10d anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over the taiwan island and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia monsoon or a warmer than normal in this period the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward the taiwan island this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over the taiwan island to investigate the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with the tropical indian ocean sst composite differences of the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low iod years are computed as shown in fig 11 following the criteria suggested by saji et al 1999 the years 1982 1983 1994 1997 2006 and 2012 are identified as extreme positive events while 1975 1989 1992 1996 1998 and 2010 are designated as extreme negative events the north pacific subtropical high shifts slightly north eastward from its normal position in october fig 11a this eastward shift of the npsh induces the eastward displacement of the southerly winds at the western edge of the npsh this results in the weakening of the cross equatorial flow over the wnp region which causes less moisture supply from the tropical pacific ocean to the taiwan island leading to subdued rainfall activity the anomalous anticyclone prevailing over the northern eurasia transports dry and cold air from the north to the taiwan island at its eastern edge moreover the weak cyclonic anomalies on the southern japan transport dry and cold air from north to south over the taiwan island at its western edge hence the taiwan island could be under the influence of anomalous northerlies inhibiting rainfall activity the composite differences of 850 hpa vector wind between the high and low iod episodes are shown in fig 11c consistent with the composite difference pattern for the geopotential field anticyclonic flow exists in the areas of positive geopotential anomalies while cyclonic flow is located in the areas of negative geopotential anomalies the figure clearly describes the taiwan island under the influence of distinct anomalous northerly wind kripalani et al 2010 suggested that the positive dipole mode of indian ocean favor heavy snow and lower surface temperature over the northern part of the taiwan island in eastern eurasia the northerly winds are anomalously strong over that region and bring dry and cold air from the high latitudes to the taiwan island thus the weak anomalous southerlies and the strong anomalous northerlies cut off the warm moisture supply towards the taiwan island causing below normal rainfall activity in contrast the npsh is slightly displaced north westward in march of the following year of the events fig 11b this westward displacement of the npsh induces the westward displacement of the anomalous southerly winds at the western edge of the npsh this results in the strengthening of the cross equatorial flow over the wnp region which causes more moisture supply from the tropical pacific ocean to the taiwan island leading to enhanced rainfall activity the corresponding wind difference pattern shows that the influence of significant anomalous southerly flow prevails over the taiwan island fig 11d these southerly winds bring warm and wet air from the equator to the taiwan island thus the strong anomalous southerlies will modulate the moisture supply towards the taiwan island leading to above normal rainfall activity the contrast of the relationship between the extreme enso iod phases and the anomalous circulation over the wnp indicates the strengthened inter link between the anomalous circulation over east asian and the extreme phases of the tropical po io in fall and spring seasons the change in the climatic linkage between the surface sea temperature over tropical po io and the anomalous circulation over the wnp shows that the influence of the tropical po io sst variation on the taiwan rainfall through the anomalous wnp circulation is different in october and march of the following year of the events these patterns of po io sst tend to modulate the intensification or suppression of the wnp circulation anomalies and would lead to a strong positive or negative rainfall anomaly 4 5 discussions the previous sections described empirical and statistical approaches for detecting a significant far reaching effect of the seasonal sst fluctuations on the leading eot patterns for total and extreme rainfall and showed that october rainfall eots are negatively correlated with the tropical pacific thermal forcing whereas march rainfall eots of the following year of the event show a positive response to the air sea coupled circulation variability over the pacific ocean that is drier than average rainfall anomalies are observed in october of the warm enso event years while wetter than average rainfall departures exhibit in the following march of the event year on the other hand in the cold enso event years october rainfall shows positive signals whereas march rainfall of the following year of the event exhibits a negative anomaly fig 9 describes the comparative interpretation for the opposite patterns above using the monthly rainfall time series over taiwan the symbols represent the standardized indices for drier wetter than average rainfall in october and wetter drier than average rainfall in march of the following year of the warm cold enso event years distribution of the scatterplots for warm event years is concentrated on the upper left part whereas in the cold event years the points are distributed on the lower right side this shows the opposite tendency of the above and below normal rainfall anomalies in october and march of the following year of the extreme event years what causes the anomalous rainfall over taiwan can be explained by circulation anomalies associated with the tropical thermal forcing based on composite difference of circulation fields northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards taiwan resulting in drier than average rainfall activity in addition the drier than average rainfall anomalies in october is attributed to suppression of rainfall events by decline of typhoons and the tropical storms over east asia in the warm phase years while wetter than average rainfall anomalies in the cold phase years is attributed to strengthening of rainfall events by more frequent tropical cyclones on the contrary in march of the following year of the event year anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over taiwan and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia monsoon the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward taiwan this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over taiwan the present findings from the empirical and statistical analyses are generally consistent with those from recent investigations for the climatic impacts of large scale cis on hydrometeorological variables over taiwan chen et al 2008 found that el niño demonstrates an asymmetric relationship with spring rainfall i e it can either enhance or suppress the spring rainfall in taiwan their analysis revealed that the asymmetric is attributed to enso and enso related sea surface temperature anomaly and the enso related spring rainfall teleconnection is dominated by the positive correlation also lin et al 2015 found below above normal rainfall anomalies in fall spring season during the warm phase of enso event years this finding is fairly consistent with the present result of the drier fall as the enso related rainfall signal season identified by the correlation and regression analyses for total and extreme rainfall anomalies thus the outcomes of the present analysis provide an additional confirmation for the previously reported climatic links between large scale cis and climate variation in taiwan which describe drier wetter october in the warm cold event years and wetter drier march of the following year of the extreme event years consequently in the light of the preceding discussions the overall outcomes from the present analyses provide further confirmative evidence of the significant climatic teleconnection between the large scale cis and hydroclimatic variability over midlatitude 5 summary and conclusions in this study an empirical approach by the eot decomposition technique was applied to total and extreme rainfall for identifying a climatic impact of large scale cis on rainfall over taiwan besides potential predictability for rainfall patterns from the monthly sst anomalies was demonstrated using correlation and regression analyses between the tropical thermal forcing and the leading eots through the eot process the spatio temporal features of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan represent the north coastal mode with decreasing trend during the cold seasons and the middle inland mode with decadal timescales in the warm seasons in addition there is nationwide spatial homogeneity in both leading total and extreme rainfall modes during the spring season than in other seasons with more widespread nationwide patterns while the only leading extreme rainfall shows nationwide spatial homogeneity in the winter season however the leading total eots explain more variance in rainfall variability than those of extreme rainfall from the correlation analysis the leading eots for total rainfall are positively correlated with the oni and mei time series in march whereas the leading eots for october and november are negatively correlated with the enso forcing the soi time series exhibit negative correlations with eot 1 for total rainfall in march while the leading eot modes for october rainfall are positively correlated with the enso indices the three enso indices exhibit slightly higher correlations with the total rainfall eots than those with the eot modes for extreme rainfall the western north pacific monsoon has a negative positive correlation with march october and december rainfall variabilities and tropical cyclone indices also exhibit significant positive correlation with october rainfalls as a general result from the empirical and statistical analyses the leading eots for october and march of the following year of the event year show the sst related rainfall predictability up to nine months in advance the methodological approaches described here do not take into account the type of tropical enso phenomena which is categorized into classical el niño and el niño modoki according to the location of peak sst anomalies further investigation for climatic responses of the two types of enso forcing on hydrometeorological variables in the tropics and extratropics needs to be performed in more detail the overall findings of this study stress the importance of extending the remote climatic impacts of the tropical thermal forcing to taiwan and motivate additional comparative analysis on how the two types of enso forcing may be influencing mid latitude rainfall variability declaration of competing interest there is no conflict

545,examining the physical mechanisms through which large scale climate indicators e g el niño southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole affect hydroclimatic variables in the tropics and extratropics is a scientific challenge in this study climatic relationships between large scale climate indices cis and taiwan rainfall variability were examined not only leading patterns of observed monthly total and extreme rainfall were estimated through an empirical orthogonal teleconnection method eot but also correlation and regression analyses were performed for the leading rainfall patterns and various cis based on atmospheric ocean circulation dataset from the spatial structure of the leading eot patterns for total and extreme rainfall the north coast mode in the cold seasons and the middle inland mode for the warm seasons were detected the temporal cycle of the leading eot patterns indicates decreasing trends in the cold seasons and oscillations mainly on decadal timescales in the warm seasons the leading eot patterns of total rainfall showed more widespread coherent patterns than those of extreme rainfall with more variance in rainfall variability the findings from this study illustrate that tropical enso forcing has a coherent association with march and october november rainfall patterns while the indian ocean dipole is identified as a driver for rainfall variability during spring and fall the western north pacific monsoon activity has a negative positive correlation with march october and december rainfall variabilities and tropical cyclone indices also exhibit significant positive correlation with october rainfalls the leading patterns of the october and following year march rainfall time series are predictable at up to nine month lead time from the tropical pacific sea surface temperatures ssts keywords rainfall variability enso teleconnection 1 introduction rainfall in taiwan is influenced by the northeasterly monsoon in the cold season and the southwesterly monsoon in the warm season chen et al 1999 the rainfall regimes also can be categorized into five seasons such as winter december to february the spring transition march and april the mei yu season may to june the typhoon season july to august and the autumn september november wang et al 1984 taiwan experiences spatial and temporal rainfall variability in association with island geographic structure synoptic circulation and large scale teleconnection chen and yu 1988 yen and chen 2000 chen and chen 2003 chen et al 2007 chen et al 2008 kuo et al 2010 chen et al 2010 chen and chen 2010 indicated that the taiwan rainfall is generated by local rain showers related to geographic structure terrain or local winds or transient disturbances embedded in the prevailing monsoon flow the regional rainfall climate over taiwan shows large spatial and temporal variabilities with the change of the prevailing wind directions of the warm cold seasons the presence of the central mountain range and the various transient subsynoptic disturbances occurring in different seasons such as spring cold fronts summer mei yu fronts and typhoons fall cold fronts and winter cold surges taiwan is located in the subtropics off the asian continental and its climate is strongly affected by the east asian monsoons the central mountain range gives rise to large spatial variations in the island climate throughout the year since the island terrain is dominated by the almost north south orientated central mountain range with about 2 km high and 4 km long peaks the taiwan climate shows striking spatial variations in rainfall for better understanding the regional climate over taiwan it is necessary to study the climate systems from the planetary scale down to the island scale due to the presence of mountainous terrain meanwhile rainfall variation is related to fluctuations of various climate indices cis representing large scale climate phenomena including el niño la niña southern oscillation tropical cyclone and monsoon activity the large scale climate signals above have been widely studied on global and regional scales since the climatic impacts are associated with hydroclimatic extreme events i e floods droughts or abnormal heat wave throughout the world at various scales significant findings have been investigated for teleconnections of the large scale cis and hydrometeorological variables including rainfall streamflow and temperature kiladis and diaz 1989 douglas and englehart 1981 ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 kahya and dracup 1994

global and regional scale have been widely documented since the first investigation of walker 1923 on the influence of the southern oscillation so on rainfall fluctuations in indian monsoon many recent global scale studies have documented climatic links between enso tropical ocean sea surface temperature variability and global precipitation anomaly patterns e g bradley et al 1987 kiladis and diaz 1989 ropelewski and halpert 1986 1989 showed statistically significant enso related climate signals by detecting the spatiotemporal scopes having a consistent and coherent impact of the extreme phases of enso phenomena on the precipitation and temperature pattern in the various areas all over the world a considerable body of the regional scale study correlating the enso phases to hydroclimatology over low and middle latitudes provided noticeable evidence of the statistically significant enso related precipitation signals douglas and englehart 1981 schonher and nicholson 1989 grimm et al 1998 price et al 1998 karabörk and kahya 2003 lanckriet et al 2014 in the mid latitude regions the enso related hydroclimatic teleconnection has been investigated by cayan and peterson 1989 and diaz and kiladis 1993 they emphasized the impacts of the atmospheric variability over the north pacific on the western united states hydrologic parameters also for extratropical teleconnections with the pacific sea surface temperatures ssts kahya and dracup 1994 carried out diagnostic investigations for the response of rainfall variability over the united states to the extreme enso events karabörk and kahya 2003 analyzed the remote forcing the enso phenomena to mid latitude rainfall patterns in turkey using harmonic and composite analyses and chiew et al 1994 identified consistent seasons and coherent regions in south east australia in which hydrologic variables are statistically correlated with the warm cold phases of enso events furthermore chandimala and zubair 2007 predicted seasonal rainfall variability over the kelani river sri lanka using empirical and statistical approaches including principal component analysis zhang et al 2007 demonstrated teleconnections between the extreme enso phenomena and maximum rainfall of yangtze river basin in china using cross wavelet analysis maity and kashid et al 2010 2011 used artificial intelligence ai tools with statistical techniques to investigate climatic response in mahanadi river india to large scale atmospheric circulation stephan et al 2018a 2018b objectively identify regions in china showing strong coherent interannual and intraseasonal variability in seasonal precipitation and examined the associated local and large scale atmospheric and coupled air sea processes using the empirical orthogonal teleconnection method monsoon related frontal systems and tropical cyclone tc activity can be considered as the major rain bearing systems in the conjunction regions between the asian continent and the western north pacific wnp monsoon rain bands climatologically first appear in the south china sea in may shift northward in june july in concurrence with the formation of the east asian monsoon frontal systems over china japan and korea and then move to the tropical wnp philippine sea region in august chen et al 2010 the monsoon activity could also be considered as a ci for precipitation variability in the indian and pacific rim countries wang et al 2008 suggested a new index for monsoon activity using principal component analysis based on a comparative analysis on the various existing monsoon indices in east asian from the perspective of interannual variation of atmospheric circulation and rainfall they emphasized that the mei yu rainfall plays an essential role in quantifying monsoon intensity over east asia using observational analyses and numerical climate modeling through an agcm echam v4 6 and coupled model poem wang et al 2013 revealed that positive western pacific subtropical high wpsh ocean relationship can be used as potential sources of prediction skill for climate predictability and emphasized the critical role of subtropical circulation for predicting the monsoon and tropical storm activity several recent studies for the large scale climatic impacts on the hydro meteorological variabilities over taiwan have also been reported chen et al 2008 examined an asymmetry relationship between el niño event and seasonal rainfall over taiwan and the associated large scale dynamic processes through an observational study during 1950 2003 their analysis results disclosed four major enso rainfall relationship types such as el nino wet type en w la nina dry ln d el nino dry en d and la nina wet ln w and showed that the cause of the asymmetric enso impacts between the positive and negative correlation groups is attributed to a connection between enso and the indian ocean io ssta and associated large scale atmospheric circulation kuo et al 2010 analyzed the variability and oscillations of november january ndj and january march jfm rainfall 1974 2006 of taiwan and seasonal sea surface temperature sst of the pacific ocean using wavelet analysis also they demonstrated predictability of seasonal ndj and jfm rainfalls over taiwan at one season lead time using an artificial neural network ann calibrated by the genetic algorithm ga chen et al 2010 investigated the interannual variability of tropical cyclone induced rainfall ptc and monsoon induced rainfall psm in taiwan for the period 1950 2002 they found that ptc and psm accounts for 47 5 and 52 5 of total rainfall in taiwan respectively showing two dominant rainfall variability types namely enhanced ptc but suppressed psm and suppressed ptc but enhanced psm lin et al 2015 investigated impacts of canonical enso and enso modoki on rainfall over taiwan by monthly mean rainfall data using nino 3 4 index and enso modoki index their results showed that the winter spring summer autumn rainfall increases decreases during the canonical el nino episodes while the opposite is true for the enso modoki as described above the aforementioned studies mostly focused on seasonal mean precipitation thus there has been less attention paid to the climatic relationship between large scale climate fluctuations and monthly total and extreme rainfall patterns also the previous studies have stressed mostly on global scale remote cis as a climate signal of large scale atmospheric or air sea coupled circulations except for the studies by king et al 2014 klingaman et al 2013 and maity and kashid 2010 2011 king et al 2014 examined australian rainfall variability through eot decomposition analysis and indicated that the first eot modes of december rainfall show notable predictability up to several months one year in advance from the tropical pacific ocean indian ocean sst also in a diagnostic study to understand the physical mechanism of the climatic impacts of large scale climate indices on queensland rainfall patterns in australia klingaman et al 2013 identified remote and local drivers affecting the seasonal rainfall patterns using eot decomposition with inter annual and decadal variability they classified large scale climate indicator into two categories remote and local cis despite the aforementioned studies there has been less focus in the literature regarding the climatic far reaching effects of both remote and local cis on hydroclimatic variability maity and kashid 2010 2011 however climatic impacts on the hydro meteorological variables are not restricted to global scale indices hence it is necessary to identify how both remote and local cis have an effect on the total and extreme rainfall patterns over taiwan on a monthly basis the purposes of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal variabilities of total and extreme rainfall anomalies over taiwan using empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot technique and to identify significant climatic impacts of remote and local climate indicators on mid latitude rainfall variability in addition predictability for total and extreme rainfall patterns is also examined through the regression of the sea surface temperatures ssts gridded data onto the leading eot patterns with varying lead times in terms of above and below normal rainfall conditions 2 data in this study the monthly rainfall gridded dataset was derived from station based observed rainfall data covering the taiwan island the source of the observational data is the monthly and daily rainfall records for the period of 1966 to 2016 at 30 stations from the data bank for atmospheric hydrologic research rainfall and temperature are monitored by central weather bureau with automatic gauge stations for estimating high resolution rainfall with a regular spaced grid the prism parameter elevation regression on independent slope model developed by daly et al 1994 2008 was used for the observational rainfall time series the prism technique is well suited to regions with mountainous terrain like taiwan because it incorporates a conceptual framework that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of orographic rainfall using geographic information of the distance elevation coastal proximity and topographic facet this method is an independent model for each target grid which can estimate target grid value by weighting each station differently based on the similarity in distance elevation coastal proximity and topographic facet between observational station and target grid using the prism model we produced the grid dataset with a gridded mesh of 102 points 20 km resolution of extreme and total precipitation on a monthly basis from 1966 to 2016 taking into account the spatiotemporal persistency as shown in fig 1 in addition extreme rainfall time series were generated as a follow up to the recommendation of climatic variability and predictability cci clivar the seasonal highest five consecutive daily rainfalls define the extreme rainfall dataset during the study period the monthly total and extreme rainfall time series were calculated for each grid point for comparative analysis on the cis related rainfall teleconnection various cis were used in this paper the oceanic niño index oni the multivariate enso index mei and the southern oscillation index soi were employed as indicators of extreme phase of enso phenomena considering atmospheric and oceanic fluctuations the oni time series are estimated using sst values in the niño 3 4 index area 120 170 w in this study the oni dataset was obtained from the climate prediction center cpc of the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa the mei is calculated using six atmospheric ocean variables over the tropical pacific i e surface air temperatures sea surface temperatures cloudiness fractions zonal and meridional surface winds and sea level pressures the source of the standardized bimonthly mei time series used in the present study was the climate diagnostic center cdc the soi a standardized index is estimated using mean sea lever pressure mslp values between darwin and tahiti in this study the soi time series were obtained from the noaa climate prediction center gridded dataset of reconstructed ssts were employed to investigate the teleconnection between rainfall eot patterns and the aforementioned cis the extended reconstructed sst ersst v4 was used as reconstructed sst dataset huang et al 2014 the ersst time series are provided on 2 0 2 0 grids from 1854 to the present as shown in fig 2 the monsoon index over western north pacific wnpmi was selected as an indicator of monsoon activity for investigating teleconnection with rainfall eot patterns wang and fan 1999 estimated the wnpmi values using 850 hpa zonal winds difference between southern and northern index areas in fig 2 u850 1 indicates the magnitude of the monsoon westerly in the area of indochina peninsula and the philippines and u850 2 represents the intensity of easterly wind across the southeastern region of subtropical anticyclone over western north pacific the other climate index for tropical cyclone activity namely tci was estimated using the tracks of tropical cyclone based on the observational dataset of the ibtracs knapp et al 2010 these tci time series were calculated by the number of typhoons passing through an index region near taiwan in fig 2 3 methodology fig 3 outlines the overall methodology used in this study the first step is to generate monthly based rainfall time series with respect to total and extreme rainfall the second step is to identify the spatial and temporal patterns of the total and extreme rainfall over taiwan using eot method the third step is to implement correlation analysis to investigate the cis related rainfall teleconnection the last step is to carry out lag regression analysis for leading eot rainfall patterns and tropical pacific sst gridded data with various lags for comparative interpretation on the opposite phases rainfall predictability empirical orthogonal teleconnection eot was employed rather than the conventional analysis by empirical orthogonal function eof to investigate spatio temporal patterns of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan the eot method decomposes rainfall dataset with spatio temporal variability to a set of orthogonal components van den dool et al 2000 the eot technique detects a set of spatial patterns extracts the temporal cycles and gives an index of the importance of each pattern the eot approach is orthogonal in either space or time as opposed to empirical orthogonal function eof orthogonal in both space and time thus the advantage of using the eot technique is that it allows the estimated patterns to be more intuitively interpreted the eot 1 spatial pattern of the rainfall time series is estimated by detecting a point showing the largest sum of explained variance for all other points van den dool et al 2000 designated this point as base point bp the corresponding rainfall time series of the first bp is assigned as eot 1 temporal pattern the second spatial pattern of rainfall eot time series are obtained by performing regression analysis for the rainfall time series of the first bp on to the residual points to remove the impacts of the bp upon the rainfall data set for the reduced rainfall time series the next bp is extracted by identifying the second point having the greatest amount of variance across the residual domain for extracting more eot patterns in the residual domain reduced by the previous decomposition process these reduction processes are successively repeated by finding the optimum numbers of spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall dataset the following mathematical expressions of eot procedure are based on van den dool et al 2000 after detecting the bp s b1 in space which explains the greatest amount of variance at the residual domain its associated spatial mode e 1 s is defined as the first eot the temporal mode α1 t associated with eot 1 is simply the original time series for its bp 1 e 1 s c o r s s b 1 s t d s s t d s b 1 2 α 1 t r s b 1 t cor s sb1 is the temporal correlation coefficient between rainfall time series r sb1 t at base point and r s t at all other points also std sb1 and std s stand for the temporal standard deviation of r sb1 t at the base point and r s t at all other points as follows 3 c o r s s b 1 1 n t t 1 n t r s t r s b 1 t s t d s b 1 s t d s 4 s t d s b 1 1 n t t 1 n t r s b 1 t 2 5 s t d s 1 n t t 1 n t r s t 2 after extracting eot 1 the data are split into a portion of which variance is explained re s t and a residual rr s t as follows 6 r e s t α 1 t e 1 s 7 r r s t r s t r e s t after dividing the data into explained and residual portions the procedure is repeated using the once reduced data the point in space which explains the most variance for all other points in rr s t becomes the base point for eot 2 the time series connected with eot 2 is represented by the series at its base point in the once reduced data after removing the variance explained by eot 2 from the data set the process is repeated again and so on until all of the domain variance in the original data is explained re s t grows at the expense of rr s t reordering the variance in the original data as eot modes the total variance tv in the data is expressed by 8 t v 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s r s t 2 where nt and ns is the numbers of points in time and space the amount of variance explained by a particular eot is related to the fraction of its explained variance ev to the total domain variance 9 e v 1 n t n s t 1 n t s 1 n s r e s t 2 t v as a result of the above procedure the eot 1 and eot 2 were obtained for monthly total and extreme rainfall time series from 1965 to 2016 for investigating various rainfall variabilities in different areas of taiwan for describing the results from the lead lag correlation and regression analyses between various cis and rainfall eot patterns correlation coefficients and regression maps were employed in this study to identify climatic impacts of various cis on total and extreme rainfall variability across taiwan each rainfall eot mode was correlated with several cis showing spatial and temporal fluctuation e g enso wnpmi and tci especially as a follow up to the statistical method by king et al 2014 spearman s approach was employed at the 95 confidence level even though spearman s rank test was carried out for calculating correlation coefficients the resultant values were generally in agreement with pearson s correlation coefficients also in order to examine predictability of monthly rainfall ersst gridded dataset over the tropical pacific were regressed on to eot time series with varying monthly lead the regression maps were plotted on 2 0 2 0 grids by calculating regression coefficients between leading eot time series and all gridded global sea surface temperature dataset in addition to examine what causes the anomalous rainfall over the taiwan island circulation anomalies associated with the extreme phases of the large scale climate phenomena is investigated using composite difference of circulation fields e g the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low event years 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variability of rainfall eots correlation coefficients for each eot associated with the highest variance across the residual domain rainfall were mapped for each month the values are the correlation coefficients between the rainfall eots at the bps and the rainfall dataset at all other points each leading eot has the largest explained variance for total and extreme rainfall the second eot are also computed using the procedures discussed above fig 4 shows the spatiotemporal patterns for the leading two eots of march and october total and extreme rainfall spatial patterns of the eots for total and extreme rainfall vary with months fig 4 the bp s locations for total rainfall are similar to those for extreme rainfall in march august in the middle inland area in october february the bps of total eots shift northward this is particularly clear in march fig 4a and c and october fig 4b and d where the bps of the eots for rainfall are plotted at the middle inland and the north coastal areas respectively eight out of twelve pairs of leading patterns are in the same locations for the center of the total and extreme leading eots as shown in table 1 the locations of the bps indicate that out of 24 total extreme rainfall eots i e two eots for twelve months 10 8 exhibit north coast mode 9 8 middle inland mode and 5 8 south coast mode the spatial structure of the eots for total and extreme rainfall represents middle inland mode in the warm season march august and north coast mode in the cold season october february additionally there are nationwide spatial homogeneities in both total and extreme rainfall modes during the spring season than in other seasons with more widespread nationwide patterns while the only leading extreme rainfall shows nationwide spatial homogeneity in the winter season total spatio temporal variance associated with the first and second eots varies with seasons as shown in table 1 the values of explained variance for each total extreme eot are 0 52 0 51 to 0 79 0 76 for leading eots whereas those for the following eots decrease to about 0 10 0 11 at the second eots the explained variance by the eots for extreme rainfall is lower than those by the leading total eots in all seasons since extreme rainfall is likely to show inhomogeneities as opposed to total rainfall showing more consistent variation king et al 2014 fig 4 shows the temporal patterns for the leading eots of total and extreme rainfall based on 7 year running mean curve used by klingaman et al 2013 as shown in table 1 15 out of 24 total rainfall eots exhibit notable patterns such as increasing decreasing trends and decadal oscillations and temporal cycles of the extreme rainfall eots show also 13 notable temporal patterns the decreasing trends of these eots exhibit during the cold season while decadal variations of rainfall eots occur during the warm seasons as a general result many eots have total and extreme rainfall signals throughout taiwan with noticeable influence coverage 4 2 teleconnections between eots and various climate indices correlation coefficients of each eot with various cis are shown for total and extreme rainfall in table 2 additionally regression maps for reconstructed sst dataset were plotted depending on each eot pattern as shown in fig 5 the regression analyses demonstrate noticeable climatic links between the two datasets which show consistent patterns with the spatial structure documented commonly in the climate impacts papers investigated correlation coefficients were computed for the previously extracted eots and three enso indices oni mei soi table 2 indicates that the oni are positively correlated with eot 1 for total rainfall in march while the leading eot modes for october and november rainfall are negatively correlated with the tropical enso forcing the mei related eot correlations were similar to the results of the oni time series the soi time series exhibit negative correlations with eot 1 for total rainfall in march whereas the leading eot modes for october rainfall are positively correlated with the enso indices in january and february the enso related climate signals are weaker than those for other months this reflects the fact that far reaching effect of the warm and cold phases of enso events on regional climate variables is not significant in this time also the correlations are weaker in march may than in october november because the enso phase in march may is not mature or decay additionally the second eots exhibit significant correlations in middle inland and north coastal areas the results from the above correlation analyses imply that the extreme phases of enso forcing have an effect on the variability of the total rainfall anomaly in middle inland and north coastal areas the extreme rainfall eots also are significantly correlated with the tropical enso forcing the three enso indices exhibit slightly lower correlations with the extreme rainfall eots than those with the eot modes for total rainfall the iod is also associated with total and extreme rainfall variability in taiwan in table 2 the leading total rainfall eot modes are significantly correlated with the iod as quantified by the dmi index representing the anomalous sst gradient between the western and eastern tropical indian ocean the iod time series show a significant negative correlation with the leading eots for total rainfall in spring and fall seasons the extreme rainfall eot modes also demonstrate a similar correlation with the dmi climatic impacts of the enso forcing on the rainfall eots also detected in regression fields as shown in figs 5 highly regressed rainfall eots are modulated by the typical enso phase showing warmer than normal sst across the tropical pacific ocean warmer than normal signals for total and extreme rainfall eots present the typical sst patterns of enso phase these phases of the sst fluctuations which was defined as pacific east asian teleconnection pea by wang et al 2000 promotes variability of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan during the october of enso years correlation coefficients for eots and monsoon activity were computed using the wmpmi as shown in table 2 the eots are negatively positively correlated with the wmpmi time series in march october and december negative phase of the wnpmi modulates above normal rainfall anomaly over taiwan on the contrary the below normal rainfall anomaly is attributed to the positive wnpmi phase wang et al 2000 additionally some notable relationships between the monsoon variability and lower order eot time series were found in some months these overall results indicate that the monsoon activity modulates the total rainfall over taiwan by increasing or decreasing with respect to months the extreme rainfall eots also exhibit similar results of correlation analyses except for additional strong correlation between the monsoon index and the eot 2 in november monsoon variability shows higher correlation coefficients with the leading eots for total rainfall than extreme rainfall eots for monthly tropical cyclone variability the tci was estimated for the index area as shown in fig 2 correlation analyses were performed for the tci time series and the leading eots for total and extreme rainfall from spring to fall season table 2 shows that the tci has significant correlation with three total rainfall eots this indicates that increase and decrease of tropical cyclone events passing through the index area have an effect on the enhancement and suppression of total rainfall anomaly on the other hand two extreme rainfall eots are significantly correlation with the tci time series from the findings of correlation analysis there are three significant positive correlations between tci and total rainfall eots two of which exhibit in the middle inland area the leading eots for october rainfall show a strong positive correlation with the tci time series that is during fall season the leading eots in the norther area of taiwan are positively correlated with the tropical cyclone activity 4 3 predictability of monthly rainfall despite the fact that it is worthwhile to extend the understanding of the potential cis effects for rainfall variability it is also important to improve predictability of this variability the previously performed correlation analysis did not take into account any time lags between the eot time series for total and extreme rainfall and various cis if the various cis applied here have a significant impact on the rainfall anomalies over taiwan then it is worthwhile to quantify the degree of this influence by a cross correlation analysis between the two time series to provide not only an improved predictability of potential sources of prediction skill but also further understanding of the far reaching response of the cis to the mid latitude rainfall variability the lead lag correlation was quantified by correlating the seasonal eots for the total and extreme rainfall with different time lag cis that are set up from lag 0 to lag 17 on a monthly basis it was attempted to capture a signal period showing significant correlation of the rainfall eots with the cis along the entire preceding year of the events at which rainfall patterns cis and the time lag are substantially associated with each other the overall correlation coefficients are calculated at 0 01 0 05 and 0 10 significance levels for grid based analyses for better comparison cross correlation analyses were carried out for the leading eots and the aforementioned three enso indices oni mei soi with varying lead time as shown in table 3 and fig 6 the eot 1 for october total rainfall has a negative correlation with the oni from june to october whereas the june to december oni time series are positively correlated with the leading eots for total rainfall anomaly of the following march the results of the mei related eot cross correlation analyses were similar to those of the oni time series with the lagged signals up to six months in advance the soi time series from july to october are positively correlated with eot 1 for october total rainfall while the leading eot modes in the following march are negatively correlated with the soi time series from september to december as shown in table 3 significant correlation was not found in early summer this reflects that the enso related rainfall signal is not significant during early summer lagged correlation is stronger during fall season compared with other seasons because the enso phase is mature or fully developed during this season the findings from the above analyses imply that the teleconnection between enso forcing and total rainfall variability over taiwan is detectable with up to nine months lags in addition the extreme rainfall eots have significant lagged correlation with enso indices the three enso indices have slightly lower correlation coefficient values with the extreme eots than those with the total rainfall though the two results indicate a similar temporal pattern the lagged responses of the leading eots for extreme rainfall to the oni mei and soi indices similarly reflect those of the first eots for total rainfall for investigating potential sources of predictability of monthly rainfall anomaly the sst gridded dataset of ersst v4 were regressed on to the previously extracted eot patterns with varying lead months as shown in figs 7 and 8 the october lag 0 to lag 4 regression maps regressing june to october ssts on to october leading eots in fig 7 show potential predictability with negative signals which extend to months prior to june also the lag regression of the june to december ssts on to the march eots of the following year shows positive signals with lag 9 to lag 3 in fig 8 this implies that the leading march eots of the following year of the event have the sst related rainfall predictability up to nine months in advance with positive signals these signals exhibit until months prior to june and then diminish lag regression maps indicate coherent pacific ocean sst variability related to eots of taiwan rainfall 4 4 composite analysis the correlation pattern between the taiwan rainfall eot and the pacific ocean po indian ocean io sst shows noticeable differences between the two periods especially in october november the taiwan rainfall variability shows a significant negative correlation with the po io sst while positive correlation is true in march of the following year of the events these opposite correlation patterns are very similar to the positive and negative phases of enso and iod episodes implying that both extreme events have a close relationship with the taiwan rainfall variability why does the io po sst pattern negatively correlate with the taiwan rainfall in october november but positively correlate with the taiwan rainfall in march the tropical po io sea surface temperature can cause large anomalous circulation over the wnp hence one way by which the sst variation over the tropical po io has an effect on the taiwan rainfall is through the atmospheric circulation over the wnp for two periods the different responses of atmospheric circulation over east asia to distinct tropical po io sst variation may play a critical role in the different correlation patterns thus we focus on the influences of different po io sst patterns on the atmospheric circulation anomalies over east asia around the taiwan island to examine what causes the anomalous precipitation over the taiwan island circulation anomalies associated with enso forcing is investigated using composite difference of circulation fields e g the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low enso years as shown in fig 10 following the criteria suggested by ropelewski and halpert 1986 the years 1982 1987 1991 1997 2009 and 2015 are identified as extreme positive events while 1973 1975 1988 1999 2007 and 2011 are designated as extreme negative events in october there is a cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific as shown in fig 10a the cyclonic flow can be interpreted as rossby wave response to the equatorial pacific heating the northerlies prevailing over the taiwan island fig 10c is part of the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific this figure clearly describes the taiwan island under the influence of dominant northerly wind son et al 2014 suggested that the anomalous cyclonic circulation over the subtropical north pacific is a principal driver in teleconnection between enso forcing and the fall precipitation variability in east asia the corresponding northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards the taiwan island resulting in below normal rainfall activity in addition genesis and development of tropical cyclones play a crucial role in taiwan rainfall fluctuation during fall season thus it is plausible to seek some clue of the climatic far reaching effects of the tropical storms and typhoons on east asian climate chu 2004 revealed that during the warm enso event years the eastward shift of monsoon trough having anomalous cyclonic vorticity causes the mitigation of vertical wind shear over the wnp cha et al 1999 showed that the total number of typhoons generated throughout the western north pacific decreases in the warm event years furthermore decrease increase of occurrences of tropical cyclones in the wnp during the warm cold event years was examined by li 1990 consequently the apparent decline in october rainfall is caused by the depression of the fall season by reduction of the tropical storms and typhoons over east asia during the warm phase years while increase of rainfall in october of the cold phase years is in association with more frequent occurrences of tropical cyclones on the other hand in march of the following year of the events fig 10b a massive anomalous anticyclone is found over the wnp with two centers one located in the mid latitude region over the kuroshio extension and another located over the philippine sea wang et al 2000 suggested that the wnp anticyclone is an important driver that links the east asian monsoon and the central eastern pacific warming as shown in fig 10d anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over the taiwan island and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia monsoon or a warmer than normal in this period the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward the taiwan island this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over the taiwan island to investigate the atmospheric circulation patterns associated with the tropical indian ocean sst composite differences of the 500 hpa geopotential height and 850 hpa vector winds between high and low iod years are computed as shown in fig 11 following the criteria suggested by saji et al 1999 the years 1982 1983 1994 1997 2006 and 2012 are identified as extreme positive events while 1975 1989 1992 1996 1998 and 2010 are designated as extreme negative events the north pacific subtropical high shifts slightly north eastward from its normal position in october fig 11a this eastward shift of the npsh induces the eastward displacement of the southerly winds at the western edge of the npsh this results in the weakening of the cross equatorial flow over the wnp region which causes less moisture supply from the tropical pacific ocean to the taiwan island leading to subdued rainfall activity the anomalous anticyclone prevailing over the northern eurasia transports dry and cold air from the north to the taiwan island at its eastern edge moreover the weak cyclonic anomalies on the southern japan transport dry and cold air from north to south over the taiwan island at its western edge hence the taiwan island could be under the influence of anomalous northerlies inhibiting rainfall activity the composite differences of 850 hpa vector wind between the high and low iod episodes are shown in fig 11c consistent with the composite difference pattern for the geopotential field anticyclonic flow exists in the areas of positive geopotential anomalies while cyclonic flow is located in the areas of negative geopotential anomalies the figure clearly describes the taiwan island under the influence of distinct anomalous northerly wind kripalani et al 2010 suggested that the positive dipole mode of indian ocean favor heavy snow and lower surface temperature over the northern part of the taiwan island in eastern eurasia the northerly winds are anomalously strong over that region and bring dry and cold air from the high latitudes to the taiwan island thus the weak anomalous southerlies and the strong anomalous northerlies cut off the warm moisture supply towards the taiwan island causing below normal rainfall activity in contrast the npsh is slightly displaced north westward in march of the following year of the events fig 11b this westward displacement of the npsh induces the westward displacement of the anomalous southerly winds at the western edge of the npsh this results in the strengthening of the cross equatorial flow over the wnp region which causes more moisture supply from the tropical pacific ocean to the taiwan island leading to enhanced rainfall activity the corresponding wind difference pattern shows that the influence of significant anomalous southerly flow prevails over the taiwan island fig 11d these southerly winds bring warm and wet air from the equator to the taiwan island thus the strong anomalous southerlies will modulate the moisture supply towards the taiwan island leading to above normal rainfall activity the contrast of the relationship between the extreme enso iod phases and the anomalous circulation over the wnp indicates the strengthened inter link between the anomalous circulation over east asian and the extreme phases of the tropical po io in fall and spring seasons the change in the climatic linkage between the surface sea temperature over tropical po io and the anomalous circulation over the wnp shows that the influence of the tropical po io sst variation on the taiwan rainfall through the anomalous wnp circulation is different in october and march of the following year of the events these patterns of po io sst tend to modulate the intensification or suppression of the wnp circulation anomalies and would lead to a strong positive or negative rainfall anomaly 4 5 discussions the previous sections described empirical and statistical approaches for detecting a significant far reaching effect of the seasonal sst fluctuations on the leading eot patterns for total and extreme rainfall and showed that october rainfall eots are negatively correlated with the tropical pacific thermal forcing whereas march rainfall eots of the following year of the event show a positive response to the air sea coupled circulation variability over the pacific ocean that is drier than average rainfall anomalies are observed in october of the warm enso event years while wetter than average rainfall departures exhibit in the following march of the event year on the other hand in the cold enso event years october rainfall shows positive signals whereas march rainfall of the following year of the event exhibits a negative anomaly fig 9 describes the comparative interpretation for the opposite patterns above using the monthly rainfall time series over taiwan the symbols represent the standardized indices for drier wetter than average rainfall in october and wetter drier than average rainfall in march of the following year of the warm cold enso event years distribution of the scatterplots for warm event years is concentrated on the upper left part whereas in the cold event years the points are distributed on the lower right side this shows the opposite tendency of the above and below normal rainfall anomalies in october and march of the following year of the extreme event years what causes the anomalous rainfall over taiwan can be explained by circulation anomalies associated with the tropical thermal forcing based on composite difference of circulation fields northerly wind cut off the moisture supply from equator towards taiwan resulting in drier than average rainfall activity in addition the drier than average rainfall anomalies in october is attributed to suppression of rainfall events by decline of typhoons and the tropical storms over east asia in the warm phase years while wetter than average rainfall anomalies in the cold phase years is attributed to strengthening of rainfall events by more frequent tropical cyclones on the contrary in march of the following year of the event year anomalous southwesterly wind prevails over taiwan and the northwestern part of the philippine sea anticyclone reflecting damping phases of east asia monsoon the anomalous southerly wind transports moist and warm air toward taiwan this northward transport is attributed to a wetter than normal climate over taiwan the present findings from the empirical and statistical analyses are generally consistent with those from recent investigations for the climatic impacts of large scale cis on hydrometeorological variables over taiwan chen et al 2008 found that el niño demonstrates an asymmetric relationship with spring rainfall i e it can either enhance or suppress the spring rainfall in taiwan their analysis revealed that the asymmetric is attributed to enso and enso related sea surface temperature anomaly and the enso related spring rainfall teleconnection is dominated by the positive correlation also lin et al 2015 found below above normal rainfall anomalies in fall spring season during the warm phase of enso event years this finding is fairly consistent with the present result of the drier fall as the enso related rainfall signal season identified by the correlation and regression analyses for total and extreme rainfall anomalies thus the outcomes of the present analysis provide an additional confirmation for the previously reported climatic links between large scale cis and climate variation in taiwan which describe drier wetter october in the warm cold event years and wetter drier march of the following year of the extreme event years consequently in the light of the preceding discussions the overall outcomes from the present analyses provide further confirmative evidence of the significant climatic teleconnection between the large scale cis and hydroclimatic variability over midlatitude 5 summary and conclusions in this study an empirical approach by the eot decomposition technique was applied to total and extreme rainfall for identifying a climatic impact of large scale cis on rainfall over taiwan besides potential predictability for rainfall patterns from the monthly sst anomalies was demonstrated using correlation and regression analyses between the tropical thermal forcing and the leading eots through the eot process the spatio temporal features of total and extreme rainfall over taiwan represent the north coastal mode with decreasing trend during the cold seasons and the middle inland mode with decadal timescales in the warm seasons in addition there is nationwide spatial homogeneity in both leading total and extreme rainfall modes during the spring season than in other seasons with more widespread nationwide patterns while the only leading extreme rainfall shows nationwide spatial homogeneity in the winter season however the leading total eots explain more variance in rainfall variability than those of extreme rainfall from the correlation analysis the leading eots for total rainfall are positively correlated with the oni and mei time series in march whereas the leading eots for october and november are negatively correlated with the enso forcing the soi time series exhibit negative correlations with eot 1 for total rainfall in march while the leading eot modes for october rainfall are positively correlated with the enso indices the three enso indices exhibit slightly higher correlations with the total rainfall eots than those with the eot modes for extreme rainfall the western north pacific monsoon has a negative positive correlation with march october and december rainfall variabilities and tropical cyclone indices also exhibit significant positive correlation with october rainfalls as a general result from the empirical and statistical analyses the leading eots for october and march of the following year of the event year show the sst related rainfall predictability up to nine months in advance the methodological approaches described here do not take into account the type of tropical enso phenomena which is categorized into classical el niño and el niño modoki according to the location of peak sst anomalies further investigation for climatic responses of the two types of enso forcing on hydrometeorological variables in the tropics and extratropics needs to be performed in more detail the overall findings of this study stress the importance of extending the remote climatic impacts of the tropical thermal forcing to taiwan and motivate additional comparative analysis on how the two types of enso forcing may be influencing mid latitude rainfall variability declaration of competing interest there is no conflict

546,the use of the active subspace method was recently proposed to reduce the dimension of complex hydrological models perform sensitivity analysis of model parameters and quantify the uncertainty affecting model parameters although this inversion method is highly promising in terms of computational performance a clear hydrological interpretation of the meaning of the active subspace that it identifies is missing in this work we infer how the active subspace changes in dimension and feature depending on geometrical and hydrological properties of the karst aquifer model lukars we find that both the hydrotope area coverage and model parameters describing the catchment characteristics here water storage and discharge properties of the hydrotopes have major impacts on the active subspace our results show that the active subspace method can be used to investigate the relation between the model structure the area of a hydrotope and the simulated spring discharge keywords rainfall discharge modeling karst hydrology sensitivity analysis active subspaces dimension reduction 1 introduction hydrologists typically apply mathematical models to address questions related to the quantity and quality of water resources srinivasan and arnold 1994 arnold et al 1998 bronstert et al 2002 brath et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 guse et al 2015 distributed models can provide reasonable physical representations of hydrological processes in a catchment but require detailed information about surface and subsurface properties henson et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in the particular case of karst aquifers that information often cannot be obtained due to their highly complex and heterogeneous subsurface structure jukić and denić jukić 2009 ladouche et al 2014 this lack of spatially distributed data about subsurface flow makes conceptual rainfall discharge models suitable tools to predict the discharge of a karst system conceptual models allow to drastically simplify the description of the functioning of the subsurface system mazzilli et al 2013 hosseini et al 2017 mudarra et al 2019 ollivier et al 2019 however finding an acceptable conceptual model representation for complex hydrological systems is difficult hollaway et al 2018 once a conceptual model is considered apprioriate for a catchment the next step is to identify if its parameters can be reasonably estimated considering the available observations the general trade off is two fold jehn et al 2019 quite often model complexity can be characterized by its number of parameters a low dimensional parameter space i e 4 to 6 parameters jakeman and hornberger 1993 can help to reduce parameter uncertainty but does not necessarily avoid the occurence of equifinality hartmann et al 2017 also a low dimensional parameter space does not guarantee model adequacy more precisely dominant hydrological processes such as matrix infiltration or conduit flow may not be predicted in a proper way in case of a high dimensional parameter space it is much easier to represent these processes in a complex karst system than with a small number of parameters hartmann 2018 however models requiring a large number of calibration parameters can suffer from overparametrization and parameters can lose their identifiability hartmann et al 2014 constantine et al 2014 proposed the active subspace method to reduce the dimensions of a model s parameter space to perform global sensitivity analysis and to quantify the parameter uncertainties in this work we focus on the use of the active subspace method to perform a global sensitivity analyisis for a lumped karst parameter model when we talk about sensitivity analysis performed in an active subspace framework we do not talk about the sensitivity of single physical parameters instead we investigate the most relevant linear combinations of physical parameters in other words working in the active subspace framework naturally leads to the definition of the sensitivity of single parameters in relation to the values of other parameters we call these linear combinations of parameters informed if the objective function measuring deviation from observed data is sensitive to it so far the active subspace method was used in different hydrological research studies jefferson et al 2015 erdal and cirpka 2019 teixeira parente et al 2019 including an application to a karst hydrologic model in which teixeira parente et al 2019 effectively reduced the dimensions of the model s parameter space and quantified the uncertainties affecting the model parameters although these works clearly showed the advantages of using the active supspace method for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in a bayesian framework a detailed hydrological interpretation of what an identified active subspace means is still lacking in this work we exploit the active subspace method to infer which geometrical and hydrological model parameters influence the feature and dimension of the active subspace we take as an illustrative example the recently proposed lukars land use change modeling in karst systems model bittner et al 2018 the lukars model is based on the implementation of hydrotopes i e distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types arnold et al 1998 and was developed to simulate the hydrological impacts of land use changes in a karst aquifer we investigate a total of 3 synthetic test cases tc each consisting of 7 scenarios modified after the lukars model of the kerschbaum spring recharge area in waidhofen a d ybbs austria the lukars model of the kerschbaum spring consists of 4 hydrotopes 3 calibration hydrotopes each having 7 calibration parameters and 1 hydrotope representing a dolomite quarry our research hypothesis is that we can identify a clear pattern that can relate the dimension and the feature of the active subspace with underlying geometrical and hydrological model parameters used to describe different hydrological properties of a chatchment this is of practical relevance because it is beneficial for modelers to know if it is worth characterizing all catchment properties in each hydrotope or if there is the possibility for assigning a priority for field investigations to test the hypothesis our particular research objectives are i to investigate which geometrical properties and ii which hydrological properties of a hydrotope mostly affect the dimension and the feature of an identified active subspace in the following we provide a description of the active subspace method in section 2 then in section 3 we describe how we intgrated the lukars model in the active subspace framework the results and discussion will be shown in section 4 finally we conclude our findings in section 5 2 methodology in this section we provide an abstract framework for our dimension reduction technique a step by step explanation of how we investigate dependencies between active subspaces and catchment properties and which relevant information can be derived for hydrological modeling is given 2 1 definition of parameter ranges the first step is to define reliable parameter ranges for all parameters of a model to be investigated in case of lumped conceptual models these ranges should be chosen large enough to contain plausible parameter values 2 2 define independent model parameters and distributions a basic property of hydrologic models is that their model parameters are not necessarily independent from a statistical point of view bárdossy 2006 however the active subspace framework prefers independent parameters thus based on the real model parameters now called physical parameters new synthetic parameters called calibration parameters need to be introduced to get statistical independency the parameter ranges defined for the physical parameters need to be translated into the admissible parameter ranges of the calibration parameters for that it is essential that the relationships between the physical parameters and thus also the calibration parameters are known for the calibration parameters we need to assume a theoretical density distribution ρ e g uniform or a truncated gaussian eventually the ranges of the calibration parameters are mapped to the range of 1 1 2 3 parameter sampling and measuring uncertainties the active subspace method identifies directions in the calibration parameter space in which a preselected objective evaluation function changes most on average constantine et al 2014 for a hydrologic model the objective is to simulate a discharge time series that matches an observation set d the chosen model with a given set of input parameters x is represented by the map g for each parameter in x we take n samples from ρ given that measured discharge time series are affected by measuring errors we also need to consider these errors as uncertainties in the proposed methodology therefore assuming that g is a perfect model we take η n 0 γ as a zero centered gaussian noise with covariance matrix γ such that 1 d g x η 2 4 select objective evaluation function and approximate gradient to identify the quality of a fit between a modeled and observed discharge time series an objective evaluation function needs to be selected in the framework of the active subspace method teixeira parente et al 2019 used the data misfit function for the application of a hydrologic model here the data misfit function is denoted by f d 2 f d x 1 2 d g x γ 2 1 2 γ 1 2 d g x 2 2 it is important to state that the results obtained with the data misfit function are different from results obtained with the nash sutcliffe efficency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 since the nse is a nonweighting squared error function it is focusing high flow conditions gupta et al 2009 the data misfit function in contrast is a weighting squared error function that gives a relative error between model results and observations and does not favor low or high flow conditions to identify important directions of f f d one looks at eigenpairs of the symmetric positive semi definite n n matrix 3 c f x f x ρ x d x w λ w where ρ indicates the density of the distribution of the calibration parameters thus we only have to assume that f has partial derivatives which are square integrable with respect to ρ we emphasize that this is a rather weak assumption since it is satisfied for almost all types of discontinuities only functions that are nowhere differentiable or have non integrable singularities which are rare and degenerated cases do not fit in this context the matrix w w 1 w n contains the eigenvectors w i of c and the matrix λ diag λ 1 λ n is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal the eigenvalues of c which contain all calibration parameters provide information about the average sensitivity of f in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector since it holds that 4 λ i w i c w i w i f x 2 ρ x d x in practice c can be approximated by a finite monte carlo sum i e 5 c 1 n j 1 n f x j f x j w λ w for n n and parameter samples x j taken from the defined parameter distribution ρ given that we approximate the matrix c using a finite monte carlo sum the matrices w w 1 w n and λ diag λ 1 λ n denote perturbations to their exact counterpart from eq 3 2 5 active subspace identification and sensitivity analysis if the eigenvalues decay quickly there are directions in the parameter space where f varies much more on average than other directions i e these directions are significantly more informed by the data d an eigenvalue associated to an eigenvector in the parameter space depends on the entire set of calibration parameters therefore the analysis of each eigenvector eigenvalue inform us about the behavior of the entire set of calibration parameters and their interaction we decide to choose a k dimensional subspace i e we truncate after k eigenvalues vectors such that the k 1 th eigenvalue is the first eigenvalue whose difference to the largest eigenvalue is bigger than one order of magnitude step 1 in fig 1 another alternative would be to base the truncation on the ratio between the sum of the remaining n k eigenvalues and the total sum the two strategies would differ if there was a spectral plateau after one or two eigenvalues i e n 1 or n 2 eigenvalues of the same or similar size however since this is generally not the case in our results both strategies give similar decisions and our results in section 4 do not strongly depend on a particular strategy the span of the eigenvectors associated with significant eigenvalues is called the active subspace step 2 in fig 1 at this point of the proposed methodology the active subspace is exploited to investigate the relation between a measured discharge and specific catchment properties the particular objective is to see if a physical explanation for the parameter sensitivities can be found in active subspaces therefore the approximated eigenpairs w i λ i are used to compute global sensitivity metrics step 3 in fig 1 constantine and diaz 2017 the components of the vector s consisting of the sensitivity values are defined as 6 s i j 1 n λ j w j i 2 i 1 n based on the identified active subspace the model s parameter space can effectively be reduced for inversion teixeira parente et al 2019 however this topic was already illustrated in other works erdal and cirpka 2019 teixeira parente et al 2019 and will not be further discussed 3 application of the methodology to the lukars model the proposed active subspace methodology is applied to the lukars model which was developed by bittner et al 2018 lukars is a semi distributed lumped parameter model that was developed to simulate the hydrological impacts of land use changes in a karstic system the model consists of different buckets that represent the dominant hydrotopes in a regarded recharge area see fig 2 a lukars was set up for the kerschbaum springshed 2 5 km2 in waidhofen a d ybbs in austria fig 2b which we use to create synthetic tc s with a mean annual discharge of 34 ls 1 the kerschbaum karst spring is part of the regional water supply system of waidhofen a d ybbs the small scale recharge area is predominantly covered by beech forests and parts of it are used for mining activities fig 2b a detailed description of the study area can be found in narany et al 2019 in the following we provide a detailed explanation how we integrate the lukars model in the framework of the active subspace method a detailed description of lukars and its equations is provided in appendix a 3 1 lukars implementation in the framework of the active subspace method based on our experiences from previous analyses we derived a set of ranges for each parameter that is applied for the step described in section 2 1 in the particular case of the minimum and maxium storage values of a hydrotope i e e min and e max data driven ranges were obtained using the methodology of dwa 2018 the ranges of all other parameters were chosen large enough so that they contain reliable values table 1 lists these parameter ranges used in the active subspace method applied to lukars each hydrotope in lukars has characteristic hydrological responses to precipitation events determined by its soil and land use properties to what extent one particular hydrotope response contributes to the total catchment response depends on both the hydrotope s area and the parameters that control its discharge variability on the one hand hydrotopes having coarse grained and shallow soils should have a high contribution to the quickflow and groundwater recharge moreover the possibility that these hydrotopes become dry after a long period without any precipitation should be allowed on the other hand the parametrization of hydrotopes with more fine textured and deep soils should allow to show slow and minor contributions to the quickflow and the groundwater recharge but be able to store a certain water volume this means that a given parameter set of a hydrotope with a small storage volume e g a shallow coarse grained soil needs to be interpreted in relation to the parameters applied to a second hydrotope with a higher storage volume e g a thicker more fine grained soil these physical constraints have to be met to accept a set of hydrotope parameters in lukars for the kerschbaum spring recharge area the lukars model has 4 hydrotopes each of them covering a defined percentage area hyd 1 has shallow and coarse grained soils hyd 2 has more fine grained soils with moderate thicknesses hyd 3 has mostly loam textured soils with more elevated thicknesses and hyd q represents the dolomite quarries the dominant vegetation type for hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 are beech forests for this concrete example of the kerschbaum spring model hyd q is not included in the process of model calibration since by law the quarries drain all water on the surface outside the catchment bittner et al 2018 thus the kerschbaum model has a total of 3 hydrotopes and a total of 21 model parameters that need to be calibrated for these 21 model parameters the following physical constraints are met 7 k hyd 1 k hyd 2 k hyd 3 e min 1 e min 2 e min 3 e max 1 e max 2 e max 3 α 1 α 2 α 3 k is 1 k is 2 k is 3 k sec 1 k sec 2 k sec 3 e sec 1 e sec 2 e sec 3 as justified by teixeira parente et al 2019 the condition introduced for α values is not strictly necessary but was implemented to amplify the quick response of hydrotopes with low storage capacities i e those displaying a small difference between e min i and e max i and a low value of e max i since the model parameters for each hydrotope have to meet the constraints shown in eq 7 they are not independent from a statistical point of view following the second step in our methodology section 2 2 we need to introduce three types of non normalized calibration parameters with a defined density ρ we assumed a logarithmic distribution ρ of the parameter ranges of the hydrotope specific discharge parameters k hyd k is and k sec hereafter summarized as k parameters all other calibration parameters have a uniform prior distribution 1 given the log distribution of the k we define 8 k log log k for each k k hyd i k is i k sec i i 1 2 3 2 for i 1 2 3 since e min i e max i parameter samples for e max i would be dependent on samples e min i hence we write e max i e min i δ e i we define therefore new non normalized calibration parameters δei this means that the parameter e max i is replaced by δei which is independent of e min i 3 similar to point 2 the physical constraints from eq 7 lead to the introduction of new non normalized calibration parameters that mimic the difference between values of two successive hydrotopes 4 the parameters with a δ are new calibration parameters taking values in 0 1 and replacing corresponding model parameters on the left hand side of the equal sign we make sure that these constraints are met and that values are chosen such that the corresponding model parameters lie in the respective specified intervals from table 1 in particular we write for i 2 3 9 k hyd i log k hyd i lb log δ k hyd i 1 i log min k hyd i ub log k hyd i 1

of the kerschbaum spring lukars model using the physical relations of the lumped hydrotope parameters eq 7 we want to investigate how much the spring discharge generated using the lukars model for different tc s depends on the model representation of specific catchment characteristics here hydrotope properties therefore we aim to explore how changing hydrological conditions may affect the active subspaces and to see if this variability is reflected in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues in particular under the assumption that the model properly represents the hydrology of the area we want to see if we can identify a dependence of the spring discharge on different catchment properties i e the discharge variability a hydrotope displays and the area it covers for this purpose we create three different synthetic tc s each consisting of seven scenarios summarized in table 2 tc 1 in tc 1 we assume that the recharge area of the kerschbaum spring is homogeneous in terms of hydrotope properties therefore we say that all hydrotopes hyd 2 1 hyd 2 2 and hyd 2 3 have the same range of parameter values as indicated in table 1 in the different scenarios we vary the area covered by hyd 2 1 hyd 2 2 and hyd 2 3 as shown in fig 3 a this tc reflects catchments with quite homogeneous properties in tc 1 we investigate the dependence of spring discharge on the area covered by a hydrotope tc 2 in tc 2 we assume that all hydrotopes cover the same area in the catchment fig 3b we increase the discharge variability of the quickflow originating from hyd 1 while maintaining constant properties of the other two hydrotopes table 1 with this tc we represent catchments with different magnitudes of contrasting hydrological properties tc 3 finally in tc 3 we use three different hydrotopes hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 and assume different hydrotope areas following the distributions shown in fig 3c in this tc we simulate recharge areas with a complex set up of contrasting hydrological properties with changing impacts on the catchment response in order to better follow all different scenarios with varying hydrotope properties the following naming scheme was applied the scenario indices are composed of the number of the tc and the number of the scenario e g scenario 2 and 4 of tc 1 are named scenario 1 2 and scenario 1 4 in those cases where the properties of one specific hydrotope were modified we renamed the respective hydrotope by putting a number behind the hydrotope name e g a modification of hyd 1 is named hyd 1 1 hyd 1 2 and so forth in all tc s we maintain the 4 dolomite quarries the hydrotopes considered in the different tc s are also summarized in table 1 since all tc scenarios represent hypothetical cases we had to create synthetic discharge time series as observations for the data misfit function eq 2 those time series were created with the lukars model using the parameter set reported in table 3 and assuming a noise level of 5 as communicated by the water works waidhofen a d ybbs for the original measured discharge time series of the kerschbaum spring in a next step we investigate how the mean sensitivities of each hydrotope change with varying hydrotope areas when considering homogeneous catchment conditions tc 1 when changing hydrotope properties tc 2 and when considering the real properties of the kerschbaum spring hydrotopes with changing areas tc 3 mean hydrotope sensitivities represent the proportion of the sum of parameter sensitivities of one hydrotope to the sum of sensitivities of the entire parameter space then we compare the global sensitivity metrices with the parameters showing up in the active subspaces of each scenario of the tc s here we investigate if in the computed active subspaces we can identify the catchment properties decisive for modeling the spring discharge finally we use the active subspaces to identify the catchment properties of the kerschbaum recharge area which are relevant for the spring discharge 4 results and discussion we want to emphasize that for the following results we consider a maximum of four significant eigenvalues this means that if the eigenvalue decay over one order of magnitude contains more than four eigenvalues the decay is not considered as significant enough to identify an active subspace further we want to stress that the following results comprising parameter sensitivities are computed with respect to the normalized calibration parameters without any loss of generality for the interpretation of the results in the physical parameter space given the mapping through eq 7 to cut through the complexity of all scenarios of tc 1 2 and 3 in the following we will show the eigendecomposition only for two scenarios in each tc for the sake of completeness however we provide the illustrated results of all other simulations in the supplementary material 4 1 test case 1 with tc 1 our specific objective was to investigate the dependence of a spring dicharge on the area coverage of the catchment s hydrotopes in particular we wanted to see if this dependence can be identified in the active subspace of an investigated scenario fig 4 a displays the average sensitivity of each hydrotope for each scenario in tc 1 considering different hydrotope area distributions the plot shows that with increasing area covered by hyd 2 2 its sensitivity increases too also the sensitivities of hyd 2 1 and hyd 2 3 decrease with decreasing area when hyd 2 2 covers an area larger than 60 it practically becomes the only sensitive hydrotpe we can further observe that all hydrotopes have almost the same sensitivity in scenario 1 2 where all hydrotopes cover the same area more precisely hyd 2 1 and hyd 2 3 cover the same area in all scenarios of tc 1 with mostly the same sensitivities small differences between their sensitivities only occur in those scenarios where both hydrotopes together cover more than 50 of the assumed recharge areas scenario 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 this minor difference of sensitivities can be related to the mean distance to the spring of both hydrotopes lhyd since hyd 2 1 is farther away from the spring than hyd 2 3 table 3 it is less sensitive than hyd 2 3 thus we can identify a clear dependence of the mean sensitivity of a hydrotope on the area it covers this finding is of particular relevance since the exact extent of karst recharge areas often is unknown the decay of the eigenvalues for each investigated scenario in tc 1 normalized to the maximum eigenvalue of the respective scenario are shown in fig 5 a we can observe a correlation between the decrease in the active subspace dimension and the increase in the catchment area of hyd 2 2 however the relation is not always monotonic comparing the decays over the first 9 eigenvalues shown in fig 5a we can observe the lowest decay for scenario 1 2 and the highest decay for scenario 1 6 the active subspace dimension ranges from 1 dimension scenario 1 6 to 8 dimensions scenario 1 2 the results suggest that the more the hydrotopes differ in terms of area coverage the faster the decay of the eigenvalues in other words the more a catchment area is dominated by one hydrotope the lower the dimension of the active subspace comparable to the results of the global sensitivity analysis fig 4a we found that the dependence between spring discharge and the hydrotope area distribution is also reflected in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues we show this for scenario 1 2 and 1 6 when looking at eigenvector 1 of scenario 1 2 fig 6 a in which all hydrotopes cover the same area we recognize that the contributions of all 7 hydrotope parameters are also similar between all hydrotopes further the same parameters of each hydrotope have approximately equal contributions in particular to the first eigenvector these are the discharge parameters of the different flow components k hyd k is and k sec having similarly high loadings and the storage parameters e min and e max having similarly low loadings from eigenvalue 2 to 4 almost no decay happens fig 5a meaning that the eigenvectors of these eigenvalues have the same relevance we argue that these similarities between the different hydrotope contributions are due to the fact that they all have similar properties in terms of their physical characteristics as well as their area coverage given this similarity there are no hydrological reasons why the parameters of one hydrotope should be more informed than others this feature is correctly captured by both the active subspace behavior as well as by the sensitivity analysis performed through the eigenvector decomposition of the active subspaces hence the area covered by each hydrotope directly affects how discharge data informs the parameter space of lukars for scenario 1 6 we can notice a considerable eigenvalue decay from the first to the second eigenvalue fig 5a pointing towards the existence of a 1 dimensional active subspace fig 6b although the decay suggests the presence of a 1 dimensional subspace we also show eigenvector 2 to see by which parameters it is dominated looking at these two eigenvectors the parameters of hyd 2 2 clearly dominate these two dimensions thus reflecting the results of the global sensitivity analysis shown as average hydrotope sensitivities in fig 4a here the discharge parameter of the recharge k is is most sensitive as it is the dominant parameter in the first eigenvector eigenvector 2 is also dominated by hyd 2 2 parameters with a high contribution of the discharge parameters controlling the quickflow k hyd and secondary spring discharge k sec this shows that the model is mainly sensitive to the parameters constraining the amount as well as the variability of the three types of hydrotope discharges represented in the conceptual model q hyd q is and q sec see also fig 2 when further taking into account all other analyzed scenarios of tc 1 supplementary material we can state that the higher the relative area covered by hyd 2 2 the more pronounced gets its contribution to the eigenvectors with significant eigenvalues in all scenarios the most sensitive parameters are the discharge parameters k hyd k is and k sec in summary the results of tc 1 highlight that we can identify the impact of the area covered by a hydrotope on the spring discharge in an active subspace 4 2 test case 2 our aim when creating tc 2 was to investigate if in an active subspace we can identify the relevance of the hydrological variability a hydrotope displays independently from its area for this purpose we created seven different scenarios considering equal areas of all hydrotopes i e 32 for hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 and varying quickflow properties in one of the hydrotopes displayed by hyd 1 hyd 1 1 hyd 1 2 hyd 1 3 hyd 1 4 hyd 1 5 and hyd 1 6 scenarios 2 1 2 7 see fig 3b fig 4 b shows the mean parameter sensitivities summed for all hydrotopes and for each of the investigated scenarios it highlights that the parameter sensitivities of hyd 1 increase when increasing the quickflow contribution considering the constant area covered by each hydrotope in all tc 2 scenarios fig 3b we show that the discharge variability displayed by a hydrotope here qhyd can fully explain the differences in the mean sensitivities of different hydrotopes when considering the eigenvalue decays in tc 2 fig 5b we can observe that the eigenvalue decay is highest in scenario 2 7 and lowest in scenario 2 2 thus the variations in hydrological variability of the hydrotopes lead to differences in active subspace dimensions i e with increasing hydrological variability the eigenvalue decay increases the active subspace dimension ranges from 1 dimension scenario 2 6 and 2 7 to 5 dimensions scenario 2 2 we can observe a correlation between the decrease in the active subspace dimension and the increase in k hyd value however also in this case the relation is not always monotonic and it depends on the cut off value that we chose for the eigenvalues to be considered relevant for the active subspace we show the results of the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues for two example scenarios in fig 7 i e scenario 2 2 and 2 7 to what extent the quickflow contribution increases between the scenarios is displayed in the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of qhyd shown in the supplementary material as for tc 1 the results of all other scenarios from tc 2 are provided in the supplementary material for scenario 2 2 the decay of the eigenvalues shown in fig 5b is slow and without spectral gaps that span at least one order of magnitude in the eigenvectors of the first four eigenvalues fig 7a we recognize a dominant contribution of the first hydrotope s parameters hyd 1 1 it can be observed that all parameters of hyd 1 1 are present with a noticable contribution in the shown eigenvectors while the contributions from hyd 2 and hyd 3 are primarily related to their respective discharge parameter of the recharge kis in eigenvector 1 the dominant contributions are related to the parameters controlling the quickflow of hyd 1 1 k hyd e max and α in particular all discharge parameters of hyd 1 1 have high scores in the shown eigenvectors eigenvector 2 is dominated by high loadings of the discharge parameters of the recharge kis with decreasing order from hyd 2 to hyd 1 1 to hyd 3 eigenvector 3 behaves similarly to eigenvector 2 while eigenvector 4 is similar to eigenvector 1 in scenario 2 7 the strong eigenvalue decay from eigenvalue 1 to eigenvalue 2 suggests the presence of a 1 dimensional active subspace fig 5b however similar as we did for scenario 1 6 we also show eigenvector 2 to see by which parameters it is dominated the eigenvectors shown in fig 7b again highlight a clear dominance of the parameters controlling the quickflow of hyd 1 6 k hyd e max and α eigenvector 2 is dominated by the discharge parameter of the recharge k is with still considerably high loadings of all other parameters of hyd 1 6 looking at the ensemble of all tc 2 scenarios supplementary material the parameters which determine the variability of the quickflow component qhyd have increasing contributions with increasing discharge variability e g fig 7a and b this shows that the active subspace method identifies the specific impact of the quickflow component of the first hydrotope on the spring discharge which is increasing from scenario 2 1 to 2 7 we further identify that the discharge parameters controlling the recharge k is in hyd 2 and hyd 3 play a more significant role in the tc 2 scenarios than their respective quickflow discharge parameters k hyd this highlights that in contrast to the more pronounced quickflow contribution from the first hydrotope the recharge qis originating from hyd 2 and hyd 3 is more important than the quickflow in these two hydrotopes thus the results of tc 2 highlight that the active subspace method identifies the dominant discharge components in different hydrotopes 4 3 test case 3 tc 3 was created to investigate how the feature and dimension of the active subspace behave when both the area and the hydrological properties of the hydrotopes vary in a catchment in fig 4c we show the mean parameter sensitivities summed for all hydrotopes and for each of the investigated scenarios we can see that the parameter sensitivities of hyd 1 increase when increasing its relative area coverage in the catchment however this occurs at a smaller rate than in tc 1 simultaneously when decreasing the areas of hyd 2 and hyd 3 their parameter sensitivities decrease too however we can observe that the sensitivity of hyd 1 parameters is not uniquely dependent on the hydrotope area for instance when focusing on the sensitivities in scenario 3 4 fig 4c it can be seen that the parameters of hyd 1 are most sensitive although hyd 2 and hyd 3 cover almost double the area of hyd 1 thus we argue that the hydrotope s discharge variability and its area together lead to a more complex pattern of mean sensitivities as compared to tc 1 and tc 2 the question that arises is why the sensitivity of hyd 1 is higher in scenario 3 4 3 5 3 6 and 3 7 although in most of these scenarios its area is smaller than those of hyd 2 and hyd 3 the answer to this questions can be found when comparing the mean hydrotope sensitivities of tc 3 fig 4c with the variability of the two hydrotope discharge components quickflow qhyd and groundwater recharge qis we show this as an example for scenario 3 1 and 3 7 in the supplementary material for hyd 1 we can observe that the variability of qhyd and qis increases with increasing area coverage the same relationship holds for hyd 2 but in reverse order meaning that the variability of both flow components decreases with decreasing area covered by hyd 2 nevertheless no pronounced change of discharge variability can be observed for hyd 3 neither for qhyd nor qis this shows that the impact of changing hydrotope areas on the discharge variability is higher in hydrotopes with low storage capacities than in those with high ones since the areas of hyd 2 and hyd 3 are similar in all scenarios but the magnitude of the discharge parameters is higher in hyd 2 the discharge variability explains the difference in the mean hydrotope sensitivities this finding can further be validated when comparing the hydrotope sensitivities fig 4c with the ecdf s of scenarios 3 7 supplementary material it shows that in case the largest hydrotope also displays the highest discharge variability here hyd 1 we can observe a high impact on the mean hydrotope sensitivities further we can observe that the eigenvalue decay over the first 9 eigenvalues is highest in scenario 3 1 and lowest in scenario 3 7 fig 5c however the differences in the eigenvalue decays of all tc 3 scenarios are not as substantial as compared to those observed for tc 1 and 2 in fact the active subspace dimension in tc 3 ranges from 3 dimensions scenario 3 1 to 5 dimensions scenario 3 6 hence we also learn that the complex interplay of changing areas and different hydrological variabilities of the hydrotopes do not lead to pronounced differences in active subspace dimensions therefore the hydrological properties of a hydrotope may compensate for a smaller hydrotope area the discovered relationship between the hydrological variability of a hydrotope and the mean hydrotope sensitivity is also displayed in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues shown as examples for scenario 3 1 and 3 7 in fig 8 a and b respectively in scenario 3 1 fig 8a where the area coverage of hyd 1 is significantly smaller than hyd 2 and hyd 3 we can recognize a dominant contribution of hyd 2 in eigenvector 1 hyd 3 in eigenvector 2 and hyd 1 in eigenvector 3 in particular we can observe a dominant contribution in all three hydrotopes of the discharge parameter controlling the recharge k is further we can identify a similar eigenvector contribution of hyd 1 and hyd 3 parameters also reflecting their similar mean sensitivities shown in fig 4c this can be explained by the fact that the groundwater recharge is linear proportional to the baseflow see eq a 6 making the discharge coefficients controlling the amount and variability of qis more sensitive than those of qhyd looking at the eigenvectors of the four most significant eigenvalues of scenario 3 7 fig 8b we can see that the discharge parameters of the recharge k is again are the most important parameters of hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 respectively different to scenario 3 1 almost all parameters of hyd 1 have a noteworthy contribution in the most important eigenvectors 1 and 2 interestingly the contribution of the discharge parameter controlling the quickflow k hyd appears to be similar potentially even more dominant than the contribution of the discharge parameter of the recharge k is in the first 2 eigenvectors this can be related to the fact that qhyd has a much faster contribution to the spring discharge than qis passing through the groundwater storage and becoming baseflow hence although qhyd is about 4 times lower than qis see range of the discharge components in the ecdf s in supplementary material in the active subspace we identify that their respective discharge coefficients are similarly informed 5 conclusion in this work we applied the active subspace method to the lukars rainfall discharge model for three test cases to investigate how the active subspace changes in dimension and feature depending on geometrical properties i e the area a hydrotope covers and hydrological properties i e the discharge variability a hydrotope displays therefore we provided a framework in which we adapt the physical model parameters of lukars to make the active subspace method applicable for the model while maintaining the physical constraints between each hydrotope our aim was to investigate how much each parameter of the model is informed by the discharge data and how different model setups affect the results of the active subspace analysis model parameters that are not sensitive to discharge observations should be then constrained using other data although this may be non trivial in karst systems the main findings of each test case are the following tc 1 for catchments with rather homogeneous hydrological properties we showed that we can identify the impact of varying hydrotope areas in an active subspace we also show that if a hydrotope covers more than 60 of the area then discharge data are informative only for model parameters belonging to that hydrotope this may guide tailored field investigation on a specific part of the catchment tc 2 for catchments with contrasting hydrological properties but similiar hydrotope areas we highlighted that in an active subspace we can identify the impacts of individual hydrological processes on the catchment response in particular discharge data will inform model parameters belonging to the hydrotope mostly responsible for quickflow to inform other model parameters and in particular to better constrain model parameters representing the other hydrotopes we suggest to integrate in model calibration measured time series of other hydrological variables e g soil moisture tc 3 for catchments with heterogeneous hydrological properties and varying hydrotope areas we found that both features show a complex interplay in informing model parameters the relationship between hydrological properties of a hydrotope and its area is strongly related to how much the spring discharge depends on the discharge variability for those complex catchment setups we provide evidence that in an active subspace we can identify if the area covered by a hydrotope plays a more important role than its hydrological properties in case the area is the most relevant feature then its characterization using appropriate experimental methods e g tracer tests will be prioritiezed in case other model parameters are more sensitive to discharge observations it is worth measuring other hydrological variables to better constrain the model parameters which are not informed by discharge observations with our results we highlight that the active subspace method can be used to guide modelers in obtaining field data relevant for their respective modeling purposes this is possible because the eigenvectors of the relevant eigenvalues in an active subspace provide information about informed linear directions in the parameter space depending on how pronounced the parameters appear in those directions we can learn about the importance of individual catchment features thus we consider the information provided in these informed parameter directions as the main strength of the active subspace method which cannot be derived from other global sensitivity analysis methods typically applied in hydrology e g sobol 2001 in total we highlight that the area a hydrotope covers has a more significant impact on the dimension of an active subspace than the discharge dynamics a hydrotope displays we found that the discharge coefficients k parameters were the most sensitive parameters in all scenarios for future works our methodology can be used to hydrologically interpret the results obtained from the active subspace method when applied to other hydrologic models in our case the information about the relevant catchment properties were constrained solely by discharge data we argue that the information about relevant properties of an investigated aquifer system can be better constrained when calibrating a model using more than one data source using hydrochemical and discharge data in a multi objective calibration approach similar to hartmann et al 2017 can be valuable to identify catchment properties which are relvant for both hydrological and hydrochemical fluxes moreover using the active subspace method in a framework of a multi temporal scale calibration e g schaefli and zehe 2009 can help to identify those model parameters which are sensitive for the high frequency components of a measured discharge credit authorship contribution statement daniel bittner

546,the use of the active subspace method was recently proposed to reduce the dimension of complex hydrological models perform sensitivity analysis of model parameters and quantify the uncertainty affecting model parameters although this inversion method is highly promising in terms of computational performance a clear hydrological interpretation of the meaning of the active subspace that it identifies is missing in this work we infer how the active subspace changes in dimension and feature depending on geometrical and hydrological properties of the karst aquifer model lukars we find that both the hydrotope area coverage and model parameters describing the catchment characteristics here water storage and discharge properties of the hydrotopes have major impacts on the active subspace our results show that the active subspace method can be used to investigate the relation between the model structure the area of a hydrotope and the simulated spring discharge keywords rainfall discharge modeling karst hydrology sensitivity analysis active subspaces dimension reduction 1 introduction hydrologists typically apply mathematical models to address questions related to the quantity and quality of water resources srinivasan and arnold 1994 arnold et al 1998 bronstert et al 2002 brath et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2008 guse et al 2015 distributed models can provide reasonable physical representations of hydrological processes in a catchment but require detailed information about surface and subsurface properties henson et al 2018 chen et al 2018 in the particular case of karst aquifers that information often cannot be obtained due to their highly complex and heterogeneous subsurface structure jukić and denić jukić 2009 ladouche et al 2014 this lack of spatially distributed data about subsurface flow makes conceptual rainfall discharge models suitable tools to predict the discharge of a karst system conceptual models allow to drastically simplify the description of the functioning of the subsurface system mazzilli et al 2013 hosseini et al 2017 mudarra et al 2019 ollivier et al 2019 however finding an acceptable conceptual model representation for complex hydrological systems is difficult hollaway et al 2018 once a conceptual model is considered apprioriate for a catchment the next step is to identify if its parameters can be reasonably estimated considering the available observations the general trade off is two fold jehn et al 2019 quite often model complexity can be characterized by its number of parameters a low dimensional parameter space i e 4 to 6 parameters jakeman and hornberger 1993 can help to reduce parameter uncertainty but does not necessarily avoid the occurence of equifinality hartmann et al 2017 also a low dimensional parameter space does not guarantee model adequacy more precisely dominant hydrological processes such as matrix infiltration or conduit flow may not be predicted in a proper way in case of a high dimensional parameter space it is much easier to represent these processes in a complex karst system than with a small number of parameters hartmann 2018 however models requiring a large number of calibration parameters can suffer from overparametrization and parameters can lose their identifiability hartmann et al 2014 constantine et al 2014 proposed the active subspace method to reduce the dimensions of a model s parameter space to perform global sensitivity analysis and to quantify the parameter uncertainties in this work we focus on the use of the active subspace method to perform a global sensitivity analyisis for a lumped karst parameter model when we talk about sensitivity analysis performed in an active subspace framework we do not talk about the sensitivity of single physical parameters instead we investigate the most relevant linear combinations of physical parameters in other words working in the active subspace framework naturally leads to the definition of the sensitivity of single parameters in relation to the values of other parameters we call these linear combinations of parameters informed if the objective function measuring deviation from observed data is sensitive to it so far the active subspace method was used in different hydrological research studies jefferson et al 2015 erdal and cirpka 2019 teixeira parente et al 2019 including an application to a karst hydrologic model in which teixeira parente et al 2019 effectively reduced the dimensions of the model s parameter space and quantified the uncertainties affecting the model parameters although these works clearly showed the advantages of using the active supspace method for inverse modeling and uncertainty quantification in a bayesian framework a detailed hydrological interpretation of what an identified active subspace means is still lacking in this work we exploit the active subspace method to infer which geometrical and hydrological model parameters influence the feature and dimension of the active subspace we take as an illustrative example the recently proposed lukars land use change modeling in karst systems model bittner et al 2018 the lukars model is based on the implementation of hydrotopes i e distinct landscape units characterized by homogeneous hydrological properties as a result of similar land use and soil types arnold et al 1998 and was developed to simulate the hydrological impacts of land use changes in a karst aquifer we investigate a total of 3 synthetic test cases tc each consisting of 7 scenarios modified after the lukars model of the kerschbaum spring recharge area in waidhofen a d ybbs austria the lukars model of the kerschbaum spring consists of 4 hydrotopes 3 calibration hydrotopes each having 7 calibration parameters and 1 hydrotope representing a dolomite quarry our research hypothesis is that we can identify a clear pattern that can relate the dimension and the feature of the active subspace with underlying geometrical and hydrological model parameters used to describe different hydrological properties of a chatchment this is of practical relevance because it is beneficial for modelers to know if it is worth characterizing all catchment properties in each hydrotope or if there is the possibility for assigning a priority for field investigations to test the hypothesis our particular research objectives are i to investigate which geometrical properties and ii which hydrological properties of a hydrotope mostly affect the dimension and the feature of an identified active subspace in the following we provide a description of the active subspace method in section 2 then in section 3 we describe how we intgrated the lukars model in the active subspace framework the results and discussion will be shown in section 4 finally we conclude our findings in section 5 2 methodology in this section we provide an abstract framework for our dimension reduction technique a step by step explanation of how we investigate dependencies between active subspaces and catchment properties and which relevant information can be derived for hydrological modeling is given 2 1 definition of parameter ranges the first step is to define reliable parameter ranges for all parameters of a model to be investigated in case of lumped conceptual models these ranges should be chosen large enough to contain plausible parameter values 2 2 define independent model parameters and distributions a basic property of hydrologic models is that their model parameters are not necessarily independent from a statistical point of view bárdossy 2006 however the active subspace framework prefers independent parameters thus based on the real model parameters now called physical parameters new synthetic parameters called calibration parameters need to be introduced to get statistical independency the parameter ranges defined for the physical parameters need to be translated into the admissible parameter ranges of the calibration parameters for that it is essential that the relationships between the physical parameters and thus also the calibration parameters are known for the calibration parameters we need to assume a theoretical density distribution ρ e g uniform or a truncated gaussian eventually the ranges of the calibration parameters are mapped to the range of 1 1 2 3 parameter sampling and measuring uncertainties the active subspace method identifies directions in the calibration parameter space in which a preselected objective evaluation function changes most on average constantine et al 2014 for a hydrologic model the objective is to simulate a discharge time series that matches an observation set d the chosen model with a given set of input parameters x is represented by the map g for each parameter in x we take n samples from ρ given that measured discharge time series are affected by measuring errors we also need to consider these errors as uncertainties in the proposed methodology therefore assuming that g is a perfect model we take η n 0 γ as a zero centered gaussian noise with covariance matrix γ such that 1 d g x η 2 4 select objective evaluation function and approximate gradient to identify the quality of a fit between a modeled and observed discharge time series an objective evaluation function needs to be selected in the framework of the active subspace method teixeira parente et al 2019 used the data misfit function for the application of a hydrologic model here the data misfit function is denoted by f d 2 f d x 1 2 d g x γ 2 1 2 γ 1 2 d g x 2 2 it is important to state that the results obtained with the data misfit function are different from results obtained with the nash sutcliffe efficency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 since the nse is a nonweighting squared error function it is focusing high flow conditions gupta et al 2009 the data misfit function in contrast is a weighting squared error function that gives a relative error between model results and observations and does not favor low or high flow conditions to identify important directions of f f d one looks at eigenpairs of the symmetric positive semi definite n n matrix 3 c f x f x ρ x d x w λ w where ρ indicates the density of the distribution of the calibration parameters thus we only have to assume that f has partial derivatives which are square integrable with respect to ρ we emphasize that this is a rather weak assumption since it is satisfied for almost all types of discontinuities only functions that are nowhere differentiable or have non integrable singularities which are rare and degenerated cases do not fit in this context the matrix w w 1 w n contains the eigenvectors w i of c and the matrix λ diag λ 1 λ n is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues on the diagonal the eigenvalues of c which contain all calibration parameters provide information about the average sensitivity of f in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector since it holds that 4 λ i w i c w i w i f x 2 ρ x d x in practice c can be approximated by a finite monte carlo sum i e 5 c 1 n j 1 n f x j f x j w λ w for n n and parameter samples x j taken from the defined parameter distribution ρ given that we approximate the matrix c using a finite monte carlo sum the matrices w w 1 w n and λ diag λ 1 λ n denote perturbations to their exact counterpart from eq 3 2 5 active subspace identification and sensitivity analysis if the eigenvalues decay quickly there are directions in the parameter space where f varies much more on average than other directions i e these directions are significantly more informed by the data d an eigenvalue associated to an eigenvector in the parameter space depends on the entire set of calibration parameters therefore the analysis of each eigenvector eigenvalue inform us about the behavior of the entire set of calibration parameters and their interaction we decide to choose a k dimensional subspace i e we truncate after k eigenvalues vectors such that the k 1 th eigenvalue is the first eigenvalue whose difference to the largest eigenvalue is bigger than one order of magnitude step 1 in fig 1 another alternative would be to base the truncation on the ratio between the sum of the remaining n k eigenvalues and the total sum the two strategies would differ if there was a spectral plateau after one or two eigenvalues i e n 1 or n 2 eigenvalues of the same or similar size however since this is generally not the case in our results both strategies give similar decisions and our results in section 4 do not strongly depend on a particular strategy the span of the eigenvectors associated with significant eigenvalues is called the active subspace step 2 in fig 1 at this point of the proposed methodology the active subspace is exploited to investigate the relation between a measured discharge and specific catchment properties the particular objective is to see if a physical explanation for the parameter sensitivities can be found in active subspaces therefore the approximated eigenpairs w i λ i are used to compute global sensitivity metrics step 3 in fig 1 constantine and diaz 2017 the components of the vector s consisting of the sensitivity values are defined as 6 s i j 1 n λ j w j i 2 i 1 n based on the identified active subspace the model s parameter space can effectively be reduced for inversion teixeira parente et al 2019 however this topic was already illustrated in other works erdal and cirpka 2019 teixeira parente et al 2019 and will not be further discussed 3 application of the methodology to the lukars model the proposed active subspace methodology is applied to the lukars model which was developed by bittner et al 2018 lukars is a semi distributed lumped parameter model that was developed to simulate the hydrological impacts of land use changes in a karstic system the model consists of different buckets that represent the dominant hydrotopes in a regarded recharge area see fig 2 a lukars was set up for the kerschbaum springshed 2 5 km2 in waidhofen a d ybbs in austria fig 2b which we use to create synthetic tc s with a mean annual discharge of 34 ls 1 the kerschbaum karst spring is part of the regional water supply system of waidhofen a d ybbs the small scale recharge area is predominantly covered by beech forests and parts of it are used for mining activities fig 2b a detailed description of the study area can be found in narany et al 2019 in the following we provide a detailed explanation how we integrate the lukars model in the framework of the active subspace method a detailed description of lukars and its equations is provided in appendix a 3 1 lukars implementation in the framework of the active subspace method based on our experiences from previous analyses we derived a set of ranges for each parameter that is applied for the step described in section 2 1 in the particular case of the minimum and maxium storage values of a hydrotope i e e min and e max data driven ranges were obtained using the methodology of dwa 2018 the ranges of all other parameters were chosen large enough so that they contain reliable values table 1 lists these parameter ranges used in the active subspace method applied to lukars each hydrotope in lukars has characteristic hydrological responses to precipitation events determined by its soil and land use properties to what extent one particular hydrotope response contributes to the total catchment response depends on both the hydrotope s area and the parameters that control its discharge variability on the one hand hydrotopes having coarse grained and shallow soils should have a high contribution to the quickflow and groundwater recharge moreover the possibility that these hydrotopes become dry after a long period without any precipitation should be allowed on the other hand the parametrization of hydrotopes with more fine textured and deep soils should allow to show slow and minor contributions to the quickflow and the groundwater recharge but be able to store a certain water volume this means that a given parameter set of a hydrotope with a small storage volume e g a shallow coarse grained soil needs to be interpreted in relation to the parameters applied to a second hydrotope with a higher storage volume e g a thicker more fine grained soil these physical constraints have to be met to accept a set of hydrotope parameters in lukars for the kerschbaum spring recharge area the lukars model has 4 hydrotopes each of them covering a defined percentage area hyd 1 has shallow and coarse grained soils hyd 2 has more fine grained soils with moderate thicknesses hyd 3 has mostly loam textured soils with more elevated thicknesses and hyd q represents the dolomite quarries the dominant vegetation type for hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 are beech forests for this concrete example of the kerschbaum spring model hyd q is not included in the process of model calibration since by law the quarries drain all water on the surface outside the catchment bittner et al 2018 thus the kerschbaum model has a total of 3 hydrotopes and a total of 21 model parameters that need to be calibrated for these 21 model parameters the following physical constraints are met 7 k hyd 1 k hyd 2 k hyd 3 e min 1 e min 2 e min 3 e max 1 e max 2 e max 3 α 1 α 2 α 3 k is 1 k is 2 k is 3 k sec 1 k sec 2 k sec 3 e sec 1 e sec 2 e sec 3 as justified by teixeira parente et al 2019 the condition introduced for α values is not strictly necessary but was implemented to amplify the quick response of hydrotopes with low storage capacities i e those displaying a small difference between e min i and e max i and a low value of e max i since the model parameters for each hydrotope have to meet the constraints shown in eq 7 they are not independent from a statistical point of view following the second step in our methodology section 2 2 we need to introduce three types of non normalized calibration parameters with a defined density ρ we assumed a logarithmic distribution ρ of the parameter ranges of the hydrotope specific discharge parameters k hyd k is and k sec hereafter summarized as k parameters all other calibration parameters have a uniform prior distribution 1 given the log distribution of the k we define 8 k log log k for each k k hyd i k is i k sec i i 1 2 3 2 for i 1 2 3 since e min i e max i parameter samples for e max i would be dependent on samples e min i hence we write e max i e min i δ e i we define therefore new non normalized calibration parameters δei this means that the parameter e max i is replaced by δei which is independent of e min i 3 similar to point 2 the physical constraints from eq 7 lead to the introduction of new non normalized calibration parameters that mimic the difference between values of two successive hydrotopes 4 the parameters with a δ are new calibration parameters taking values in 0 1 and replacing corresponding model parameters on the left hand side of the equal sign we make sure that these constraints are met and that values are chosen such that the corresponding model parameters lie in the respective specified intervals from table 1 in particular we write for i 2 3 9 k hyd i log k hyd i lb log δ k hyd i 1 i log min k hyd i ub log k hyd i 1

synthetic parameters is only necessary for the other hydrotopes e g hyd 2 and 3 in teixeira parente et al 2019 eventually all non normalized calibration parameters are normalized i e they are mapped to the interval 1 1 the normalized parameters are denoted with a bar above their name and form the final 21 dimensional vector x of calibration parameters i e 10 x k hyd 1 log e min 1 δ e 1 α 1 k is 1

of the kerschbaum spring lukars model using the physical relations of the lumped hydrotope parameters eq 7 we want to investigate how much the spring discharge generated using the lukars model for different tc s depends on the model representation of specific catchment characteristics here hydrotope properties therefore we aim to explore how changing hydrological conditions may affect the active subspaces and to see if this variability is reflected in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues in particular under the assumption that the model properly represents the hydrology of the area we want to see if we can identify a dependence of the spring discharge on different catchment properties i e the discharge variability a hydrotope displays and the area it covers for this purpose we create three different synthetic tc s each consisting of seven scenarios summarized in table 2 tc 1 in tc 1 we assume that the recharge area of the kerschbaum spring is homogeneous in terms of hydrotope properties therefore we say that all hydrotopes hyd 2 1 hyd 2 2 and hyd 2 3 have the same range of parameter values as indicated in table 1 in the different scenarios we vary the area covered by hyd 2 1 hyd 2 2 and hyd 2 3 as shown in fig 3 a this tc reflects catchments with quite homogeneous properties in tc 1 we investigate the dependence of spring discharge on the area covered by a hydrotope tc 2 in tc 2 we assume that all hydrotopes cover the same area in the catchment fig 3b we increase the discharge variability of the quickflow originating from hyd 1 while maintaining constant properties of the other two hydrotopes table 1 with this tc we represent catchments with different magnitudes of contrasting hydrological properties tc 3 finally in tc 3 we use three different hydrotopes hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 and assume different hydrotope areas following the distributions shown in fig 3c in this tc we simulate recharge areas with a complex set up of contrasting hydrological properties with changing impacts on the catchment response in order to better follow all different scenarios with varying hydrotope properties the following naming scheme was applied the scenario indices are composed of the number of the tc and the number of the scenario e g scenario 2 and 4 of tc 1 are named scenario 1 2 and scenario 1 4 in those cases where the properties of one specific hydrotope were modified we renamed the respective hydrotope by putting a number behind the hydrotope name e g a modification of hyd 1 is named hyd 1 1 hyd 1 2 and so forth in all tc s we maintain the 4 dolomite quarries the hydrotopes considered in the different tc s are also summarized in table 1 since all tc scenarios represent hypothetical cases we had to create synthetic discharge time series as observations for the data misfit function eq 2 those time series were created with the lukars model using the parameter set reported in table 3 and assuming a noise level of 5 as communicated by the water works waidhofen a d ybbs for the original measured discharge time series of the kerschbaum spring in a next step we investigate how the mean sensitivities of each hydrotope change with varying hydrotope areas when considering homogeneous catchment conditions tc 1 when changing hydrotope properties tc 2 and when considering the real properties of the kerschbaum spring hydrotopes with changing areas tc 3 mean hydrotope sensitivities represent the proportion of the sum of parameter sensitivities of one hydrotope to the sum of sensitivities of the entire parameter space then we compare the global sensitivity metrices with the parameters showing up in the active subspaces of each scenario of the tc s here we investigate if in the computed active subspaces we can identify the catchment properties decisive for modeling the spring discharge finally we use the active subspaces to identify the catchment properties of the kerschbaum recharge area which are relevant for the spring discharge 4 results and discussion we want to emphasize that for the following results we consider a maximum of four significant eigenvalues this means that if the eigenvalue decay over one order of magnitude contains more than four eigenvalues the decay is not considered as significant enough to identify an active subspace further we want to stress that the following results comprising parameter sensitivities are computed with respect to the normalized calibration parameters without any loss of generality for the interpretation of the results in the physical parameter space given the mapping through eq 7 to cut through the complexity of all scenarios of tc 1 2 and 3 in the following we will show the eigendecomposition only for two scenarios in each tc for the sake of completeness however we provide the illustrated results of all other simulations in the supplementary material 4 1 test case 1 with tc 1 our specific objective was to investigate the dependence of a spring dicharge on the area coverage of the catchment s hydrotopes in particular we wanted to see if this dependence can be identified in the active subspace of an investigated scenario fig 4 a displays the average sensitivity of each hydrotope for each scenario in tc 1 considering different hydrotope area distributions the plot shows that with increasing area covered by hyd 2 2 its sensitivity increases too also the sensitivities of hyd 2 1 and hyd 2 3 decrease with decreasing area when hyd 2 2 covers an area larger than 60 it practically becomes the only sensitive hydrotpe we can further observe that all hydrotopes have almost the same sensitivity in scenario 1 2 where all hydrotopes cover the same area more precisely hyd 2 1 and hyd 2 3 cover the same area in all scenarios of tc 1 with mostly the same sensitivities small differences between their sensitivities only occur in those scenarios where both hydrotopes together cover more than 50 of the assumed recharge areas scenario 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 this minor difference of sensitivities can be related to the mean distance to the spring of both hydrotopes lhyd since hyd 2 1 is farther away from the spring than hyd 2 3 table 3 it is less sensitive than hyd 2 3 thus we can identify a clear dependence of the mean sensitivity of a hydrotope on the area it covers this finding is of particular relevance since the exact extent of karst recharge areas often is unknown the decay of the eigenvalues for each investigated scenario in tc 1 normalized to the maximum eigenvalue of the respective scenario are shown in fig 5 a we can observe a correlation between the decrease in the active subspace dimension and the increase in the catchment area of hyd 2 2 however the relation is not always monotonic comparing the decays over the first 9 eigenvalues shown in fig 5a we can observe the lowest decay for scenario 1 2 and the highest decay for scenario 1 6 the active subspace dimension ranges from 1 dimension scenario 1 6 to 8 dimensions scenario 1 2 the results suggest that the more the hydrotopes differ in terms of area coverage the faster the decay of the eigenvalues in other words the more a catchment area is dominated by one hydrotope the lower the dimension of the active subspace comparable to the results of the global sensitivity analysis fig 4a we found that the dependence between spring discharge and the hydrotope area distribution is also reflected in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues we show this for scenario 1 2 and 1 6 when looking at eigenvector 1 of scenario 1 2 fig 6 a in which all hydrotopes cover the same area we recognize that the contributions of all 7 hydrotope parameters are also similar between all hydrotopes further the same parameters of each hydrotope have approximately equal contributions in particular to the first eigenvector these are the discharge parameters of the different flow components k hyd k is and k sec having similarly high loadings and the storage parameters e min and e max having similarly low loadings from eigenvalue 2 to 4 almost no decay happens fig 5a meaning that the eigenvectors of these eigenvalues have the same relevance we argue that these similarities between the different hydrotope contributions are due to the fact that they all have similar properties in terms of their physical characteristics as well as their area coverage given this similarity there are no hydrological reasons why the parameters of one hydrotope should be more informed than others this feature is correctly captured by both the active subspace behavior as well as by the sensitivity analysis performed through the eigenvector decomposition of the active subspaces hence the area covered by each hydrotope directly affects how discharge data informs the parameter space of lukars for scenario 1 6 we can notice a considerable eigenvalue decay from the first to the second eigenvalue fig 5a pointing towards the existence of a 1 dimensional active subspace fig 6b although the decay suggests the presence of a 1 dimensional subspace we also show eigenvector 2 to see by which parameters it is dominated looking at these two eigenvectors the parameters of hyd 2 2 clearly dominate these two dimensions thus reflecting the results of the global sensitivity analysis shown as average hydrotope sensitivities in fig 4a here the discharge parameter of the recharge k is is most sensitive as it is the dominant parameter in the first eigenvector eigenvector 2 is also dominated by hyd 2 2 parameters with a high contribution of the discharge parameters controlling the quickflow k hyd and secondary spring discharge k sec this shows that the model is mainly sensitive to the parameters constraining the amount as well as the variability of the three types of hydrotope discharges represented in the conceptual model q hyd q is and q sec see also fig 2 when further taking into account all other analyzed scenarios of tc 1 supplementary material we can state that the higher the relative area covered by hyd 2 2 the more pronounced gets its contribution to the eigenvectors with significant eigenvalues in all scenarios the most sensitive parameters are the discharge parameters k hyd k is and k sec in summary the results of tc 1 highlight that we can identify the impact of the area covered by a hydrotope on the spring discharge in an active subspace 4 2 test case 2 our aim when creating tc 2 was to investigate if in an active subspace we can identify the relevance of the hydrological variability a hydrotope displays independently from its area for this purpose we created seven different scenarios considering equal areas of all hydrotopes i e 32 for hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 and varying quickflow properties in one of the hydrotopes displayed by hyd 1 hyd 1 1 hyd 1 2 hyd 1 3 hyd 1 4 hyd 1 5 and hyd 1 6 scenarios 2 1 2 7 see fig 3b fig 4 b shows the mean parameter sensitivities summed for all hydrotopes and for each of the investigated scenarios it highlights that the parameter sensitivities of hyd 1 increase when increasing the quickflow contribution considering the constant area covered by each hydrotope in all tc 2 scenarios fig 3b we show that the discharge variability displayed by a hydrotope here qhyd can fully explain the differences in the mean sensitivities of different hydrotopes when considering the eigenvalue decays in tc 2 fig 5b we can observe that the eigenvalue decay is highest in scenario 2 7 and lowest in scenario 2 2 thus the variations in hydrological variability of the hydrotopes lead to differences in active subspace dimensions i e with increasing hydrological variability the eigenvalue decay increases the active subspace dimension ranges from 1 dimension scenario 2 6 and 2 7 to 5 dimensions scenario 2 2 we can observe a correlation between the decrease in the active subspace dimension and the increase in k hyd value however also in this case the relation is not always monotonic and it depends on the cut off value that we chose for the eigenvalues to be considered relevant for the active subspace we show the results of the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues for two example scenarios in fig 7 i e scenario 2 2 and 2 7 to what extent the quickflow contribution increases between the scenarios is displayed in the empirical cumulative distribution function ecdf of qhyd shown in the supplementary material as for tc 1 the results of all other scenarios from tc 2 are provided in the supplementary material for scenario 2 2 the decay of the eigenvalues shown in fig 5b is slow and without spectral gaps that span at least one order of magnitude in the eigenvectors of the first four eigenvalues fig 7a we recognize a dominant contribution of the first hydrotope s parameters hyd 1 1 it can be observed that all parameters of hyd 1 1 are present with a noticable contribution in the shown eigenvectors while the contributions from hyd 2 and hyd 3 are primarily related to their respective discharge parameter of the recharge kis in eigenvector 1 the dominant contributions are related to the parameters controlling the quickflow of hyd 1 1 k hyd e max and α in particular all discharge parameters of hyd 1 1 have high scores in the shown eigenvectors eigenvector 2 is dominated by high loadings of the discharge parameters of the recharge kis with decreasing order from hyd 2 to hyd 1 1 to hyd 3 eigenvector 3 behaves similarly to eigenvector 2 while eigenvector 4 is similar to eigenvector 1 in scenario 2 7 the strong eigenvalue decay from eigenvalue 1 to eigenvalue 2 suggests the presence of a 1 dimensional active subspace fig 5b however similar as we did for scenario 1 6 we also show eigenvector 2 to see by which parameters it is dominated the eigenvectors shown in fig 7b again highlight a clear dominance of the parameters controlling the quickflow of hyd 1 6 k hyd e max and α eigenvector 2 is dominated by the discharge parameter of the recharge k is with still considerably high loadings of all other parameters of hyd 1 6 looking at the ensemble of all tc 2 scenarios supplementary material the parameters which determine the variability of the quickflow component qhyd have increasing contributions with increasing discharge variability e g fig 7a and b this shows that the active subspace method identifies the specific impact of the quickflow component of the first hydrotope on the spring discharge which is increasing from scenario 2 1 to 2 7 we further identify that the discharge parameters controlling the recharge k is in hyd 2 and hyd 3 play a more significant role in the tc 2 scenarios than their respective quickflow discharge parameters k hyd this highlights that in contrast to the more pronounced quickflow contribution from the first hydrotope the recharge qis originating from hyd 2 and hyd 3 is more important than the quickflow in these two hydrotopes thus the results of tc 2 highlight that the active subspace method identifies the dominant discharge components in different hydrotopes 4 3 test case 3 tc 3 was created to investigate how the feature and dimension of the active subspace behave when both the area and the hydrological properties of the hydrotopes vary in a catchment in fig 4c we show the mean parameter sensitivities summed for all hydrotopes and for each of the investigated scenarios we can see that the parameter sensitivities of hyd 1 increase when increasing its relative area coverage in the catchment however this occurs at a smaller rate than in tc 1 simultaneously when decreasing the areas of hyd 2 and hyd 3 their parameter sensitivities decrease too however we can observe that the sensitivity of hyd 1 parameters is not uniquely dependent on the hydrotope area for instance when focusing on the sensitivities in scenario 3 4 fig 4c it can be seen that the parameters of hyd 1 are most sensitive although hyd 2 and hyd 3 cover almost double the area of hyd 1 thus we argue that the hydrotope s discharge variability and its area together lead to a more complex pattern of mean sensitivities as compared to tc 1 and tc 2 the question that arises is why the sensitivity of hyd 1 is higher in scenario 3 4 3 5 3 6 and 3 7 although in most of these scenarios its area is smaller than those of hyd 2 and hyd 3 the answer to this questions can be found when comparing the mean hydrotope sensitivities of tc 3 fig 4c with the variability of the two hydrotope discharge components quickflow qhyd and groundwater recharge qis we show this as an example for scenario 3 1 and 3 7 in the supplementary material for hyd 1 we can observe that the variability of qhyd and qis increases with increasing area coverage the same relationship holds for hyd 2 but in reverse order meaning that the variability of both flow components decreases with decreasing area covered by hyd 2 nevertheless no pronounced change of discharge variability can be observed for hyd 3 neither for qhyd nor qis this shows that the impact of changing hydrotope areas on the discharge variability is higher in hydrotopes with low storage capacities than in those with high ones since the areas of hyd 2 and hyd 3 are similar in all scenarios but the magnitude of the discharge parameters is higher in hyd 2 the discharge variability explains the difference in the mean hydrotope sensitivities this finding can further be validated when comparing the hydrotope sensitivities fig 4c with the ecdf s of scenarios 3 7 supplementary material it shows that in case the largest hydrotope also displays the highest discharge variability here hyd 1 we can observe a high impact on the mean hydrotope sensitivities further we can observe that the eigenvalue decay over the first 9 eigenvalues is highest in scenario 3 1 and lowest in scenario 3 7 fig 5c however the differences in the eigenvalue decays of all tc 3 scenarios are not as substantial as compared to those observed for tc 1 and 2 in fact the active subspace dimension in tc 3 ranges from 3 dimensions scenario 3 1 to 5 dimensions scenario 3 6 hence we also learn that the complex interplay of changing areas and different hydrological variabilities of the hydrotopes do not lead to pronounced differences in active subspace dimensions therefore the hydrological properties of a hydrotope may compensate for a smaller hydrotope area the discovered relationship between the hydrological variability of a hydrotope and the mean hydrotope sensitivity is also displayed in the eigenvectors of the significant eigenvalues shown as examples for scenario 3 1 and 3 7 in fig 8 a and b respectively in scenario 3 1 fig 8a where the area coverage of hyd 1 is significantly smaller than hyd 2 and hyd 3 we can recognize a dominant contribution of hyd 2 in eigenvector 1 hyd 3 in eigenvector 2 and hyd 1 in eigenvector 3 in particular we can observe a dominant contribution in all three hydrotopes of the discharge parameter controlling the recharge k is further we can identify a similar eigenvector contribution of hyd 1 and hyd 3 parameters also reflecting their similar mean sensitivities shown in fig 4c this can be explained by the fact that the groundwater recharge is linear proportional to the baseflow see eq a 6 making the discharge coefficients controlling the amount and variability of qis more sensitive than those of qhyd looking at the eigenvectors of the four most significant eigenvalues of scenario 3 7 fig 8b we can see that the discharge parameters of the recharge k is again are the most important parameters of hyd 1 hyd 2 and hyd 3 respectively different to scenario 3 1 almost all parameters of hyd 1 have a noteworthy contribution in the most important eigenvectors 1 and 2 interestingly the contribution of the discharge parameter controlling the quickflow k hyd appears to be similar potentially even more dominant than the contribution of the discharge parameter of the recharge k is in the first 2 eigenvectors this can be related to the fact that qhyd has a much faster contribution to the spring discharge than qis passing through the groundwater storage and becoming baseflow hence although qhyd is about 4 times lower than qis see range of the discharge components in the ecdf s in supplementary material in the active subspace we identify that their respective discharge coefficients are similarly informed 5 conclusion in this work we applied the active subspace method to the lukars rainfall discharge model for three test cases to investigate how the active subspace changes in dimension and feature depending on geometrical properties i e the area a hydrotope covers and hydrological properties i e the discharge variability a hydrotope displays therefore we provided a framework in which we adapt the physical model parameters of lukars to make the active subspace method applicable for the model while maintaining the physical constraints between each hydrotope our aim was to investigate how much each parameter of the model is informed by the discharge data and how different model setups affect the results of the active subspace analysis model parameters that are not sensitive to discharge observations should be then constrained using other data although this may be non trivial in karst systems the main findings of each test case are the following tc 1 for catchments with rather homogeneous hydrological properties we showed that we can identify the impact of varying hydrotope areas in an active subspace we also show that if a hydrotope covers more than 60 of the area then discharge data are informative only for model parameters belonging to that hydrotope this may guide tailored field investigation on a specific part of the catchment tc 2 for catchments with contrasting hydrological properties but similiar hydrotope areas we highlighted that in an active subspace we can identify the impacts of individual hydrological processes on the catchment response in particular discharge data will inform model parameters belonging to the hydrotope mostly responsible for quickflow to inform other model parameters and in particular to better constrain model parameters representing the other hydrotopes we suggest to integrate in model calibration measured time series of other hydrological variables e g soil moisture tc 3 for catchments with heterogeneous hydrological properties and varying hydrotope areas we found that both features show a complex interplay in informing model parameters the relationship between hydrological properties of a hydrotope and its area is strongly related to how much the spring discharge depends on the discharge variability for those complex catchment setups we provide evidence that in an active subspace we can identify if the area covered by a hydrotope plays a more important role than its hydrological properties in case the area is the most relevant feature then its characterization using appropriate experimental methods e g tracer tests will be prioritiezed in case other model parameters are more sensitive to discharge observations it is worth measuring other hydrological variables to better constrain the model parameters which are not informed by discharge observations with our results we highlight that the active subspace method can be used to guide modelers in obtaining field data relevant for their respective modeling purposes this is possible because the eigenvectors of the relevant eigenvalues in an active subspace provide information about informed linear directions in the parameter space depending on how pronounced the parameters appear in those directions we can learn about the importance of individual catchment features thus we consider the information provided in these informed parameter directions as the main strength of the active subspace method which cannot be derived from other global sensitivity analysis methods typically applied in hydrology e g sobol 2001 in total we highlight that the area a hydrotope covers has a more significant impact on the dimension of an active subspace than the discharge dynamics a hydrotope displays we found that the discharge coefficients k parameters were the most sensitive parameters in all scenarios for future works our methodology can be used to hydrologically interpret the results obtained from the active subspace method when applied to other hydrologic models in our case the information about the relevant catchment properties were constrained solely by discharge data we argue that the information about relevant properties of an investigated aquifer system can be better constrained when calibrating a model using more than one data source using hydrochemical and discharge data in a multi objective calibration approach similar to hartmann et al 2017 can be valuable to

implemented as distinct hydrological response units called hydrotopes fig 2a land use change impact studies can be performed by changing the hydrotope infiltration area a hydrotope is analogous to a bucket that has three discharge components the quickflow component q hyd l3t 1 a secondary spring discharge q sec l3t 1 and the recharge q is l3t 1 q hyd is considered a hydrotope specific quickflow occurring in preferential flow paths e g subsurface conduits the quickflow bypasses the baseflow storage b and is directly transferred to the spring outlet the quickflow starts once a hydrotope specific storage threshold e max has been reached and stops after the hydrotope storage falls below a lower storage threshold e min q sec integrates all flow components that do not arrive at the simulated karst spring and that are transferred outside the regarded recharge area i e secondary spring discharge and overland flow tritz et al 2011 q is is the discharge from one hydrotope to the underlying baseflow storage b that represents the process of groundwater recharge each hydrotope has 7 physical parameters with length units l and time units t that are as follows k hyd l2t 1 is the

547,the hydrology of high elevation mountainous regions is poorly represented in earth systems models esms yet these ecosystems play an important role in the storage and land atmosphere exchange of water as much of the western united states water comes from water stored in the snowpack snow water equivalent swe model representation of these regions is important this study assesses how uncertainty in both model parameters and forcing affect simulated snow processes through sensitivity analysis active subspaces on model inputs meteorological forcing and model input parameters for a widely used snow model observations from an ameriflux tower at the niwot ridge research site are used to force an integrated single column hydrologic model parflow clm this study finds that trees can mute the effects of snow albedo causing the evergreen needleleaf scenarios to be sensitive primarily to hydrologic forcing while bare ground simulations are more sensitive to the snow parameters the bare ground scenarios are most sensitive overall both forcing and model input parameters are important for obtaining accurate hydrologic model results keywords hydrologic modeling sensitivity analysis snow water equivalent active subspaces 1 introduction approximately one sixth of the world s population lives in snowmelt dominated regions and rely on this melt for their water supply barnett et al 2005 snow provides seventy percent of the western united states water supply chang et al 1987 and eighty five percent of streamflow for the colorado river comes from snowmelt in the colorado headwaters region ikeda et al 2010 managing this resource relies not only on how much snow accumulates throughout the season but also how much water is in the snowpack quantified as snow water equivalent swe when it reaches its annual maximum or peak swe and how quickly it melts though snow is a vital piece of the hydrologic cycle most hydrologic models have a difficult time capturing snow accumulation and melt in highly heterogeneous mountain systems clark et al 2011 svoma 2016 this is largely due to coarse resolution models and metrological datasets that cannot accurately capture the differences in meteorological data across a spatially heterogeneous region lundquist et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 furthermore many snow models rely on simplified representations of snow processes often based solely on air temperature and do not accurately depict the complexity of real world processes more complicated hydrologic snow models provide better representations of snow characteristics and processes including snow density snow age snow albedo which indicates how well the snow surface reflects solar radiation vertical heat transfer in the snowpack and snow grain size calculations dickinson et al 1993 marks et al 1999 dai et al 2003 these calculations represent real world processes that control snow accumulation and melt which also depend on the meteorological inputs to the system such as radiation precipitation wind speed humidity temperature and pressure this type of complex model can help bridge the gap where spatially and temporally high resolution continuous data is unavailable in order to understand why a more complex model leads to a better representation of swe one must understand the relationship between modeled snow outputs and model inputs one way to better understand these complex snow models is through conducting a sensitivity analysis in hydrology sensitivity analyses often consider the uncertainty that is introduced during the process of collecting meteorological data or parameterizing models and extrapolating point data across a heterogeneous region it is important to understand how these uncertainties affect model output in order to understand why the model is producing a certain result along with determining the accuracy of that result in the context of this research sensitivity analysis allows us to understand which factors are most important to predicting swe and other snow processes studies that have conducted a sensitivity analysis on snow parameters in heterogeneous mountain regions find that the topographic characteristics and snow albedo parameterizations play a large role in determining the snow covered area and swe model outputs while the scale of forcing data also determines overall model accuracy engel et al 2017 houle et al 2017 winstral et al 2014 one study found that models with more complex albedo parameterizations soil models and those with multiple snow layers matched observations more accurately than the less complex models etchevers et al 2004 these studies argue that albedo parameters and snow ageing coefficients are the most important parameters for modeling swe and snow covered area independent of the model used engel et al 2017 etchevers et al 2004 houle et al 2017 also higher resolution meteorological forcing data produces more accurate snow model outputs as the model is able to better capture the heterogeneities of the mountain region winstral et al 2014 while the above referenced studies looked at the sensitivity of specific snow models to input parameters built into the model albedo parameters and those used to drive the model meteorological inputs they did not look at how the sensitivity of snow models may change as both types of inputs change simultaneously overall few studies have conducted any type of sensitivity analysis for equations relating to snow and snow parameterizations simultaneous with sensitivity analysis of meteorological model inputs though it is an important step for evaluating a hydrologic model chen et al 1996 chen et al 2014 etchevers et al 2004 essery et al 2013 the sensitivity of the snow component of the hydrologic model parflow clm to the albedo parameters and meteorological inputs has not yet been analyzed though studies have looked at the sensitivity of this model to other non snow model parameters constantine 2015 jefferson et al 2017 gilbert et al 2016 using the active subspaces approach this study examines the sensitivity of the snow processes in parflow clm to both the snow model inputs focusing on the albedo parameters and meteorological forcing inputs simultaneously comparing their overall importance metrics of importance for water management and used in this study to capture swe amounts and timing include monthly averaged swe peak swe assumed to be on april 1st by convention and time of total melt this sensitivity analysis allows for a better understanding of how uncertainty in different types of inputs affects both swe and swe timing in a process based hydrologic model which then allows for more accurate water availability predictions in these complex mountain regions 2 methods 2 1 snow in a land surface model pf clm parflow pf is a physically based hydrologic model that solves variably saturated subsurface flow using the three dimensional richards equation given meteorological forcing inputs parflow can be coupled to a land surface model in this study the land surface model is based on the common land model clm version 3 0 but incudes several modifications clm calculates overland flow using the kinematic wave equation and together with pf pf clm solves both subsurface and surface flow and is used to estimate water and energy fluxes that occur at a land surface subsurface conditions and meteorological forcing data are passed from pf to clm and clm returns the land surface water fluxes to pf fig 1 the energy and water fluxes are estimated through vegetation processes energy budget calculations and water balance calculations to estimate fluxes for locations where snow is present some or all of the year clm includes equations to account for snow processes modeled processes for estimating swe include thermal processes vegetation processes canopy interception and throughfall and snow age these processes estimate the amount of precipitation falling as snow how this snow interacts with the vegetation and then how this snow changes through time due to albedo decay snow compaction sublimation and melt here we describe the snow processes in pf clm for additional details regarding bare ground evaporation evapotranspiration and energy budget processes see jefferson and maxwell 2015 jefferson et al 2015 kollet et al 2009 and maxwell and condon 2016 2 1 1 thermal processes and surface fluxes pf clm requires meteorological variables including incoming shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation air temperature wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure and specific humidity these inputs vary in time but can also vary in space and provide the energy and water fluxes that interact with vegetation and surface properties to drive land surface water cycling feedbacks between soil moisture computed in pf and snow temperature computed in clm are accounted for in the energy budget thermal processes in pf clm are constrained by closing the energy

dickinson et al 1993 snow albedo for direct radiation is further corrected for solar zenith angle which describes the angle of the sun perpendicular to the surface for a given time latitude and longitude given by 4 cff 1 1 sl 1 cos ϕ 2 sl 1 sl where sl is the factor that controls albedo zenith dependence and ϕ degrees is the zenith angle soil albedo is also calculated separately for the direct and diffuse radiation of different wavebands and is a function of moisture content for a given soil color the combined surface albedo scales soil and surface albedos based on the fraction of snow covered area fsnow described in section 2 1 2 highly parameterized formulations of albedo as used in clm are commonly included in land surface models because albedo is challenging to model and measure pirazzini 2009 new albedo measurement techniques are an active research area skiles et al 2018 casey et al 2017 amaral et al 2017 and more work is needed to understand the important processes governing changes in albedo and the scale at which improved albedo formulations are needed for accurate hydrologic predictions from land surface models downward longwave radiation lwdown w m2 is the radiation below the canopy in vegetated areas or the incoming longwave radiation in non vegetated or snow buried areas scaled by the emissivity of the surface longwave radiation from ground snow or leaf surfaces lwup w m2 is based on the boltzmann relationship with snow soil and leaf temperatures calculated in clm jefferson et al 2015 soil moisture and snow temperature feedbacks are accounted for in the energy budget emissivity is assumed to be constant at 0 97 for snow and ice and 0 96 for non snow covered surfaces latent heat le w m2 is the link between the water and energy cycles by capturing the energy required to change the phase of water to or from vapor when snow layers are present the latent heat flux occurs as either sublimation condensation or frost sublimation is calculated using the same mass transfer approach as ground evaporation but without the soil moisture limitation and using the latent heat of sublimation rather than vaporization to convert the water flux to an energy flux jefferson and maxwell 2015 if atmospheric and surface properties result in a downward surface flux it is classified as condensation or frost depending on if the ground temperature is less than freezing sensible heat h w m2 at the snow surface is calculated as 5 h ρ a c p t gr t air r ah where the density of air ρa kg m3 is determined from forcing inputs using the ideal gas law the specific heat of dry air cp j k kg is constant the ground surface temperature is either the soil or snowpack surface tgr k the air temperature tair k is obtained from forcing inputs and the aerodynamic resistance factor rah accounts for atmospheric stability similar to latent heat flux jefferson and maxwell 2015 kollet et al 2009 the ground heat flux g w m2 is determined from closure of the energy budget eq 1 where the residual energy drives tgr changes ground heat flux provides the upper boundary condition for the vertical conduction equation used to calculate soil or snow temperature based on the mass specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of each phase liquid ice or soil present in a given layer the thermal conductivity for snow ksnow w m k is derived from the sntherm 89 formulation jordan 1991 6 k snow k a 7 75 x 10 5 ρ iw 1 105 x 10 6 ρ iw 2 k i k a where ka and ki are the thermal conductivity of air and ice assumed to be 0 023 w m k and 2 29 w m k respectively and ρiw kg m3 is the partial density of liquid water and ice in the snow layer which is calculated using the densities of liquid water and ice based on fraction of the snowpack that is liquid or ice 2 1 2 snow covered vegetation the vegetation properties important for the latent heat calculation are parameterized and computed for snow free and snow covered time periods the user specifies canopy properties including minimum and maximum leaf area index lai stem area index sai aerodynamic roughness height z0m m and displacement height d m for each vegetation type only one vegetation type can be assigned to each cell though users can adjust these vegetation parameters sai and lai are adjusted for the fraction of vegetation height that is buried by snow accumulation to determine the exposed leaf and stem are indices as 7 l a i e l a i 1 d s n o w 10 z 0 m 8 s a i e s a i 1 d s n o w 10 z 0 m where dsnow m is the depth of snow on the ground and the height of vegetation is assumed to be ten times z0m if the exposed vegetation area l ai e s ai e is less than 0 05 the vegetation is assumed to be buried and will not transpire the fraction of snow covered area

exceeds the canopy capacity distributed over the exposed vegetation area the remaining precipitation drips to the surface the default canopy capacity is 0 1 mm 2 1 3 snow present on the ground the properties of snow reaching the ground are based on the air temperature at the time of snowfall near freezing tfrz k the fraction of snowfall that is liquid flfall and therefore considered rain varies

used to determine the depth of newly fallen snow precipitation reaching the ground as snow is added to the existing snow depth and swe of the top snow layer if no snow is present a new snow layer is initialized with the associated swe mm when the snow depth dsnow m exceeds 0 01 m snow layers only form and age when snow falls and begins to accumulate on the ground the change in snow and soil temperature results in melting and freezing of snow and soil water by using the available energy to overcome the heat of fusion if adequate energy is available melting and freezing are calculated for each snow layer melt occurs if frozen water is present and the layer temperature exceeds freezing while freezing occurs if liquid water is available and the temperature is below freezing any energy that remains after accounting for phase change is used to adjust the final snow soil temperature and corresponding energy fluxes snowpack metamorphism how the snowpack structure changes through time is included in pf clm to account for changes in layer thicknesses from destructive overburden and melt processes in each layer destructive or equi temperature metamorphism results from vapor pressure gradients that drive redistribution of mass toward the center of snow grains this process is most prevalent in fresh snow with pronounced points causing low densities and when temperatures approach freezing with small vertical temperature gradients in the snowpack the pf clm formulation for the change in layer thickness from destructive metamorphism ddzdestructive m s is derived from sntherm 89 jordan 1991 and accounts for the temperature dependence of the process as 13 dd z dest ruct ive 2 777 x 10 6 e 0 04 t frz t gr c 3 c 4 where c3 decreases the rate of metamorphism based on the bulk density of ice snow ρ i kg m3 only when the density exceeds a critical threshold default ρss 100 kg m3 jordan et al 1999 according to 14 c 3 e 0 046 ρ i ρ ss by incorporating this cutoff destructive metamorphism is weighted toward lower densities approximating newer snow that will experience settling c4 is included when liquid water is present defined as exceeding 1 of the snow layer thickness and accelerates the rate of destructive metamorphism by a factor of 2 overburden metamorphism ddzoverburden m s results in the densification of snow from the weight of overlying snow layers wx kg the overburden metamorphism parameterization is derived from sntherm 89 jordan 1991 and accounts for the temperature and density dependence of viscosity as 15 dd z over burd en w x e 0 08 t frz t gr 0 021 ρ i η 0 where η0 is the viscosity coefficient at freezing as snow density approaches zero and is considered constant at 9e5 kg s m2 consistent with modifications in the sntherm 99 model jordan et al 1999 snow compaction from overburden does not occur if a snow layer is water saturated less than 0 1 void space or if the ice lens is too thin less than 0 1 mm of frozen water equivalent melt metamorphism occurs based on the available energy from the thermal processes described above and is taken as a ratio of snow ice fraction after and before melting after accounting for snowfall and metamorphism snow layers are combined and subdivided based on prescribed thicknesses the maximum thickness for the top snow layer is set to 0 02 m which allows surface layers to more accurately reflect the properties of new snow for age and albedo calculations the maximum number of snow layers is set to a default of 5 with the top 4 layer maximum thicknesses of 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 11 m 0 25 m respectively for computational efficiency if the layer thickness or the mass of frozen water is small the layer is combined with the layer below after updating the frozen and liquid water contents of each snow layer for melting freezing and surface fluxes sublimation evaporation frost dew snowmelt is redistributed in the snowpack meltwater in a given layer is available for gravity drainage assuming capillary forces are negligible if the liquid water content exceeds the holding capacity of snow the liquid water holding capacity is a user defined fraction of the effective snowpack porosity with a default value of 0 033 the effective porosity of snow is calculated as the non ice partial volume and must exceed a minimum user defined impervious threshold default is 0 05 in a given layer and underlying layer for water to percolate otherwise water ponds with no lateral flow within the snowpack meltwater out of the bottom snow layer is passed back to parflow and is available for infiltration 2 1 4 snow age non dimensional snow age τsnow is estimated by accounting for three processes that alter snow albedo first albedo depends on the change in grain size with vapor diffusion as the snowpack ripens approximating the vapor pressure using surface temperature tgr k as 16 a 1 e 5000 1 t frz 1 t gr a second process is associated with an increase in effective grain size near freezing and limited to less than or equal to unity approximated as 17 a 2 a 1 10 the third process accounts for the darkening of soil due to the deposition of soot or dirt a3 which is assumed to be 0 3 the change in snow age over a time step of dt δτsnow combines these three age effects 18 δ τ snow 10 6 δ t a 1 a 2 a 3 and is added to the current snow age to obtain the snow age for the next time step fresh snowfall of 0 01 m of swe is assumed to restore the snow albedo to that of new snow the updated snow age is scaled to account for time steps with inadequate new swe psnow mm to meet this

cons and conn respectively eqs 3a 3b and the factor that controls albedo zenith dependence sl eq 4 account for some of the important snow parameter values embedded in the model by understanding how modifying these input parameters affects the quantities of interest of this study output of peak swe monthly averaged swe and timing of total melt the pf clm inputs can be better constrained leading to more accurate model results that can be scaled to coarser resolution and larger scale models additionally running a sensitivity analysis on the snow and forcing parameters allows for a sensitivity comparison between values based on field data meteorological forcing and values embedded in the model snow parameters to better understand the relationships between the model outputs and eight forcing and six snow parameters this study employs the active subspaces method of sensitivity analysis active subspaces globally compares the relationships of the parflow clm input parameters and the forcing parameters with a selected quantity of interest model output this method identifies the important direction s in the 14 dimensional input space along which the output changes more than in the orthogonal directions the active subspace is a span of a set of directions composed of a set of weights defining a linear combination of the inputs the active subspace is usually derived by the gradient of the input parameters parflow clm however does not access this gradient and must substitute an algorithm to define the single most important direction in the input space since a finite difference approximation would be too computationally expensive therefore we chose to use a linear model to approximate these gradients the normalized gradient of the linear model gives the single most important direction in the fourteen dimensional input space the weights of the linear combination of the inputs reveal to which parameters the model is most sensitive input parameters with weights of larger magnitudes are more important because a change in these parameters causes a greater change in the output than a change in other input parameters a negative weight means an increase in the input parameter leads to a decrease in the output and a positive weight means an increase in the input parameter leads to an increase in the output jefferson and maxwell 2015 the sufficient summary plot ssp identifies the relationship between the quantity of interest and the combination of input parameters the active variable each point on the ssp corresponds to the inputs and output from one model realization the greater the slope of the sufficient summary plot the more sensitive the quantity of interest is to the changes in the input variable see constantine 2015 jefferson et al 2015 2017 and gilbert et al 2016 for more details on the active subspaces approach to apply the active subspaces approach in a computationally efficient manner a monte carlo method was used to select a multiplier for each forcing parameter based on the accuracy measurements from the manuals for the instruments used to collect the meteorological observations rm young 2000 vaisla 2016 campbell scientific 2011 cs105 each forcing parameter time step for water year 2014 was then multiplied by this randomly selected multiplier value from the ranges shown in table 1 this process was repeated 300 times this set of 300 forcing parameters was then used with both bare ground land cover and evergreen needleleaf land cover similarly a monte carlo method was used to randomly select a number based on the ranges of possible values from the literature surrounding snow parameters in hydrologic models hollinger and richardson 2005 warren and wiscombe 1980 warren 1982 grenfell et al 1994 dickinson et al 1993 bonan et al 2002 due to the relative simplicity of replacing the snow parameters in parflow clm these randomly selected values replaced the baseline snow parameter values in parflow clm so that active subspaces was performed directly on the snow parameter values whereas it was performed on the forcing multipliers this process was then repeated 300 times for the snow parameters this set of 300 snow parameters was then used with both bare ground land cover and evergreen needleleaf land cover these approaches resulted in 600 total model simulations where both the forcing and snow parameters were perturbed 300 simulations using bare ground land cover and 300 simulations using evergreen needleleaf land cover to isolate the model sensitivity to the snow parameters we ran an additional set of 300 simulations in this scenario the meteorological forcing was consistent with the baseline forcing and bare ground land cover was used only the snow input parameters are perturbed in this additional set of simulations the three sets of simulations using the model domain described in the following section are referred to as the evergreen needleleaf simulations the bare ground simulations and the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations table 2 2 3 model domain while sensitivity analyses have been performed using large scale three dimensional models it is computationally expensive because these three dimensional models can contain millions of parameters as each domain cell needs to be populated condon et al 2013 therefore this study uses a single column approach to understand the physics and constraints of some of the snow processes of pf clm mentioned above without the confounding influence of spatial variability in meteorological forcing topography and vegetation this single column approach decreases the number of input parameters as well as computational expense without sacrificing the legitimacy of the model as simplifying lateral flow has a negligible effect on land surface parameter sensitivities jefferson et al 2017 the domain of this study is a one meter cubed model with five subsurface layers ranging from 23 to 0 1 cm the model uses a one dimensional meteorological forcing comprised of incoming shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and specific humidity from the ameriflux tower at the niwot ridge research site for water year 2014 blanken 1998 the land cover at niwot ridge is classified as evergreen needleleaf and the area is located in the front range of the rocky mountains 25 miles northwest of boulder colorado making this a snow dominated site the precipitation data used in this study comes from the u s climate reference network uscrn boulder 14 w gage which is about one kilometer from the ameriflux site diamond et al 2013 meteorological data from water year 2014 was chosen for the baseline forcing as the modeled swe most accurately estimates the observed swe from the ameriflux site fig 2 the same baseline forcing was run using bare ground land cover to determine the sensitivity of parflow clm to land cover type fig 3 3 results and discussion after perturbing both the snow and forcing parameters and computing the active subspace for evergreen needleleaf bare ground and bare ground with baseline forcing we observed the relationships between the input parameters and quantities of interest monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt we found the model sensitivities vary with land cover and the modeled quantity of interest 3 1 monthly averaged swe august and july are excluded from the monthly averaged swe sensitivity analysis as swe is zero in these months for all simulations the results of the evergreen needleleaf simulations show parflow clm is most sensitive to changes in longwave radiation and air temperature throughout the water year as reflected by the consistently larger absolute active variable weights in fig 4 however some sensitivities vary with month humidity is an important parameter for all months except may june and september and has a positive relationship with swe meaning as humidity increases swe also increases this relationship could be due to the amount of moisture humid air can hold as opposed to dry air dry air can hold more moisture and thus encourages snowmelt since the air is moister in the summer months may june and september are less sensitive to changes in humidity than the other months snowmelt in these months are instead driven by radiation and air temperature longwave and shortwave radiation into the snowpack cause snow to melt and this results in an inverse relationship between radiation parameters and swe air temperature directly effects the snowpack both through partitioning precipitation into snow or rain and calculating the density of fresh snowfall eqs 11 and 12 the parflow clm evergreen needleleaf simulations are insensitive to the snow parameters for every month due to the trees dampening effect of the snow parameters clm attributes a fractional vegetation cover of 0 8 to evergreen needleleaf land cover this causes the model to become insensitive to snow albedo since much of the incoming shortwave radiation which drives albedo is blocked by the vegetation dickinson et al 1993 the months most sensitive to changes in input parameters as a whole are april may and june shown by the larger slopes on the ssp swe changes more in these months as the active variable changes these months span the dynamic melt season and may be more sensitive on the whole due to the greater weights of and thus greater sensitivity to longwave radiation and air temperature the results for the bare ground simulations reveal different sensitivity relationships month to month than the evergreen needleleaf fig 5 similar to the evergreen needleleaf simulations the bare ground simulations are sensitive to longwave radiation in every month however shortwave radiation is also an important parameter in every month except september radiation parameters seem to be the main driver of snowmelt in the bare ground scenarios while changes in air temperature and humidity are less important the bare ground simulations are also sensitive to the near infrared and visible albedo coefficients throughout the year this may be because year round the tree canopy is not blocking the shortwave radiation which drives the albedo as albedo increases swe increases since it reflects the incoming solar radiation and deters melting the months most sensitive to change of the input parameters are january february march april and may revealing that the bare ground simulations as a whole are more sensitive to change in the input parameters for the duration of snow presence fig 3 than the evergreen needleleaf simulations as there is more variation in modeled swe output within each month and more months showing noteworthy variation march and april are the most sensitive months indicating melt season is most sensitive with less shade more months become sensitive to changes in the input parameters also february shows a strong sensitivity to changes in the input parameters until the active variable reaches a threshold of about 0 1 this means there is a threshold after which the combination of changes in input no longer affect the monthly averaged swe the opposite can be seen in may and june when melt is occurring where the active variable reaches a threshold and monthly averaged swe becomes much more sensitive to changes in the input parameters fig 5 september has the lowest number of important parameters in both models revealing it to be the least sensitive month this may be due to september having the lowest average swe of the included months fig 6 shows the sensitivity results for the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations this focus on the snow parameters reveals the dependence of the model to forcing parameters versus snow parameters these results show the snow parameters have similar weights as the previous bare ground simulations however parameters snal0 and snal1 have much higher weights for every month with september exhibiting a higher inverse weight the albedo coefficients become more important without the added influence of the forcing perturbations furthermore the range of maximum swe for each month is smaller when only the snow parameters are perturbed than when both the forcing and snow parameters are perturbed this difference in range and parameter weights can then be attributed to the perturbation of the forcing parameters though the magnitude of monthly averaged swe decreases in this scenario the ssp shows similar monthly relationships to the bare ground scenarios where both forcing and snow parameters are perturbed 3 2 peak swe similar to the monthly averages of swe in the evergreen needleleaf simulations peak swe is most sensitive to humidity and longwave radiation as well as air temperature fig 7 peak swe is dependent upon snow accumulation and therefore will be more sensitive to humidity which influences sublimation and evaporation increases in longwave radiation and air temperature encourage melting and decrease the snowpack due to energy inputs resulting in a greater sensitivity of the model to these parameters peak swe ranges from 426 7 mm to 457 9 mm a difference of 31 2 mm in the bare ground scenarios pf clm is sensitive to both shortwave and longwave radiation as well as both the near infrared and visible albedo coefficients fig 8 again this may be due to the lack of tree cover and therefore ability of shortwave radiation to reach the snowpack and impact peak swe the lack of tree cover in the model allows for sensitivity to albedo coefficients as there is no leaf or steam area blocking energy fluxes peak swe for these runs varies from 151 3 mm to 471 5 mm a range of 320 2 mm the ranges of modeled peak swe are greater for the bare ground simulations than the evergreen needleleaf simulations revealing a greater sensitivity of the bare ground model to input parameters table 3 the least squares regression for the linear model in all simulations is 0 99 which means the variation in peak swe can be explained by the active variable peak swe for the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations are sensitive to the albedo coefficients fig 9 the range of peak swe for these simulations is 179 1 mm to 419 1 mm this is a smaller range than the bare ground runs that perturb all input parameters however it is not as small as the evergreen needleleaf runs table 3 this indicates the difference in ranges of these simulations could be attributed to the forcing parameters and land cover type 3 3 time of total melt here the time of total melt is the first time swe reaches zero millimeters after peak swe longwave radiation air temperature and shortwave radiation are the most important parameters for determining the time of total melt in the evergreen needleleaf scenarios fig 10 these parameters contribute most to the melting of the snowpack as this melt is dependent upon the energy into the system the time of total melt ranges from june 6 2014 17 00 to june 13 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 163 h the bare ground simulations show that radiation and the albedo coefficients are the most important parameters in total melt timing an increase in radiation causes an earlier time of total melt and an increase in albedo coefficients causes a later time of melt fig 11 these parameters interact resulting in a wider range of total melt times in the bare ground simulations than the evergreen needleleaf simulations time of total melt ranges from march 16 2014 15 00 to june 8 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 2013 h the greater variation in the bare ground scenarios shows a greater overall sensitivity to perturbations in the input parameters table 3 the range of time of total melt of the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations fig 12 falls between the ranges of the other sets of simulations from march 19 2014 11 00 to may 31 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 1753 h this reveals the change in ranges may be due to land cover type and perturbation of forcing parameters 3 4 overall trends the sensitivity of model parameters varies with both quantity of interest and land cover type this study shows that evergreen needleleaf trees dampen the effects of snow input parameters on modeled swe outputs making the model insensitive to changes in the snow model inputs but introducing additional parameters to characterize the vegetation this dampening effect results in greater overall sensitivity of the model to snow parameters when using bare ground than using evergreen needleleaf in the bare ground simulations the model is sensitive to both the meteorological inputs and the albedo coefficients the increase in modeled outputs ranges and decrease in albedo coefficient sensitivity between the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations and the bare ground simulations can be attributed to the influence of the forcing parameters this has broader implications for data collection and model parameterizations obtaining accurate meteorological inputs particularly radiation air temperature and humidity is essential for achieving proper model results if these meteorological inputs vary even by small amounts modeled results can become misleading model parameterizations also must be realistic small perturbations in the albedo coefficients can lead to larger output variations while a large fractional vegetation cover value for evergreen needleleaf land cover may result in the model being too insensitive to some model input parameters active subspaces is shown to be a useful sensitivity analysis method for complex hydrologic models such as parflow clm this method allows for the simultaneous perturbation of multiple model inputs without greatly increasing computational expense through the use of active subspaces we have a greater understanding about how the changes in meteorological inputs and snow model inputs affect monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt using two different land cover types 3 5 further study though this study is useful for understanding the sensitives of evergreen needleleaf and bare ground land cover types to changes in model forcing and snow parameters further work could be done to evaluate the way in which other land cover types respond to perturbations in these inputs as shown through this study the sensitivity of modeled outputs will change depending on land cover type the region and site chosen will also play a role in the simulation results a location with different seasonal patterns than niwot ridge may react differently to forcing and snow parameters potentially causing the snow parameters to be of more importance than the forcing parameters simulating other land cover types and locations was outside the scope of this study but could be useful for a deeper understanding of pf clm sensitivity analysis in the future we have shown active subspaces to be a useful tool for evaluating the sensitivity of model outputs to various input parameters of pf clm this method could be used with other modeling platforms to evaluate outputs sensitivity though depending on the configuration and equations used in other models the sensitivities of monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt to the input parameters may vary this reinforces the need for conducting sensitivity analysis on any modeling platform as the results may differ and we show it can be done effectively using the active subspaces method 4 conclusions in this study we examined the sensitivity of the pf clm snow module to both forcing and snow input parameters three quantities of interest monthly averaged swe peak swe time of total melt were evaluated and eight forcing parameters and six snow model input parameters were perturbed using active subspaces for two different land cover types the results show that the snow module in parflow clm is more sensitive to forcing parameters than snow input parameters especially when the land cover is evergreen needleleaf these findings show the importance of gathering and applying accurate meteorological forcing to the model as well as implementing correct albedo parameterizations for bare ground models land cover type affects both the input parameters to which the model is most sensitive and the range of outputs for each quantity of interest this has implications for model development in ensuring models are handling land cover properties such as leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover accurately bare ground land cover results in wider ranges of the quantity of interest than the evergreen land cover making those slight perturbations in input important for modeled output this study focused on two land cover types however conducting a similar sensitivity analysis on all parflow clm land cover types would lead to a better understanding of the role of land cover on snow processes in hydrologic models furthermore conducting a sensitivity analysis on more pieces of the model thermal processes energy process etc would lead to a deeper understanding of model physics and the sensitivity of all model parameters despite the challenge of observing or reconstructing meteorological and snow input parameters in these critical mountain systems it proves to be a necessary step toward estimating water availability credit authorship contribution statement anna ryken formal analysis investigation

547,the hydrology of high elevation mountainous regions is poorly represented in earth systems models esms yet these ecosystems play an important role in the storage and land atmosphere exchange of water as much of the western united states water comes from water stored in the snowpack snow water equivalent swe model representation of these regions is important this study assesses how uncertainty in both model parameters and forcing affect simulated snow processes through sensitivity analysis active subspaces on model inputs meteorological forcing and model input parameters for a widely used snow model observations from an ameriflux tower at the niwot ridge research site are used to force an integrated single column hydrologic model parflow clm this study finds that trees can mute the effects of snow albedo causing the evergreen needleleaf scenarios to be sensitive primarily to hydrologic forcing while bare ground simulations are more sensitive to the snow parameters the bare ground scenarios are most sensitive overall both forcing and model input parameters are important for obtaining accurate hydrologic model results keywords hydrologic modeling sensitivity analysis snow water equivalent active subspaces 1 introduction approximately one sixth of the world s population lives in snowmelt dominated regions and rely on this melt for their water supply barnett et al 2005 snow provides seventy percent of the western united states water supply chang et al 1987 and eighty five percent of streamflow for the colorado river comes from snowmelt in the colorado headwaters region ikeda et al 2010 managing this resource relies not only on how much snow accumulates throughout the season but also how much water is in the snowpack quantified as snow water equivalent swe when it reaches its annual maximum or peak swe and how quickly it melts though snow is a vital piece of the hydrologic cycle most hydrologic models have a difficult time capturing snow accumulation and melt in highly heterogeneous mountain systems clark et al 2011 svoma 2016 this is largely due to coarse resolution models and metrological datasets that cannot accurately capture the differences in meteorological data across a spatially heterogeneous region lundquist et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 furthermore many snow models rely on simplified representations of snow processes often based solely on air temperature and do not accurately depict the complexity of real world processes more complicated hydrologic snow models provide better representations of snow characteristics and processes including snow density snow age snow albedo which indicates how well the snow surface reflects solar radiation vertical heat transfer in the snowpack and snow grain size calculations dickinson et al 1993 marks et al 1999 dai et al 2003 these calculations represent real world processes that control snow accumulation and melt which also depend on the meteorological inputs to the system such as radiation precipitation wind speed humidity temperature and pressure this type of complex model can help bridge the gap where spatially and temporally high resolution continuous data is unavailable in order to understand why a more complex model leads to a better representation of swe one must understand the relationship between modeled snow outputs and model inputs one way to better understand these complex snow models is through conducting a sensitivity analysis in hydrology sensitivity analyses often consider the uncertainty that is introduced during the process of collecting meteorological data or parameterizing models and extrapolating point data across a heterogeneous region it is important to understand how these uncertainties affect model output in order to understand why the model is producing a certain result along with determining the accuracy of that result in the context of this research sensitivity analysis allows us to understand which factors are most important to predicting swe and other snow processes studies that have conducted a sensitivity analysis on snow parameters in heterogeneous mountain regions find that the topographic characteristics and snow albedo parameterizations play a large role in determining the snow covered area and swe model outputs while the scale of forcing data also determines overall model accuracy engel et al 2017 houle et al 2017 winstral et al 2014 one study found that models with more complex albedo parameterizations soil models and those with multiple snow layers matched observations more accurately than the less complex models etchevers et al 2004 these studies argue that albedo parameters and snow ageing coefficients are the most important parameters for modeling swe and snow covered area independent of the model used engel et al 2017 etchevers et al 2004 houle et al 2017 also higher resolution meteorological forcing data produces more accurate snow model outputs as the model is able to better capture the heterogeneities of the mountain region winstral et al 2014 while the above referenced studies looked at the sensitivity of specific snow models to input parameters built into the model albedo parameters and those used to drive the model meteorological inputs they did not look at how the sensitivity of snow models may change as both types of inputs change simultaneously overall few studies have conducted any type of sensitivity analysis for equations relating to snow and snow parameterizations simultaneous with sensitivity analysis of meteorological model inputs though it is an important step for evaluating a hydrologic model chen et al 1996 chen et al 2014 etchevers et al 2004 essery et al 2013 the sensitivity of the snow component of the hydrologic model parflow clm to the albedo parameters and meteorological inputs has not yet been analyzed though studies have looked at the sensitivity of this model to other non snow model parameters constantine 2015 jefferson et al 2017 gilbert et al 2016 using the active subspaces approach this study examines the sensitivity of the snow processes in parflow clm to both the snow model inputs focusing on the albedo parameters and meteorological forcing inputs simultaneously comparing their overall importance metrics of importance for water management and used in this study to capture swe amounts and timing include monthly averaged swe peak swe assumed to be on april 1st by convention and time of total melt this sensitivity analysis allows for a better understanding of how uncertainty in different types of inputs affects both swe and swe timing in a process based hydrologic model which then allows for more accurate water availability predictions in these complex mountain regions 2 methods 2 1 snow in a land surface model pf clm parflow pf is a physically based hydrologic model that solves variably saturated subsurface flow using the three dimensional richards equation given meteorological forcing inputs parflow can be coupled to a land surface model in this study the land surface model is based on the common land model clm version 3 0 but incudes several modifications clm calculates overland flow using the kinematic wave equation and together with pf pf clm solves both subsurface and surface flow and is used to estimate water and energy fluxes that occur at a land surface subsurface conditions and meteorological forcing data are passed from pf to clm and clm returns the land surface water fluxes to pf fig 1 the energy and water fluxes are estimated through vegetation processes energy budget calculations and water balance calculations to estimate fluxes for locations where snow is present some or all of the year clm includes equations to account for snow processes modeled processes for estimating swe include thermal processes vegetation processes canopy interception and throughfall and snow age these processes estimate the amount of precipitation falling as snow how this snow interacts with the vegetation and then how this snow changes through time due to albedo decay snow compaction sublimation and melt here we describe the snow processes in pf clm for additional details regarding bare ground evaporation evapotranspiration and energy budget processes see jefferson and maxwell 2015 jefferson et al 2015 kollet et al 2009 and maxwell and condon 2016 2 1 1 thermal processes and surface fluxes pf clm requires meteorological variables including incoming shortwave and longwave radiation precipitation air temperature wind speed and direction atmospheric pressure and specific humidity these inputs vary in time but can also vary in space and provide the energy and water fluxes that interact with vegetation and surface properties to drive land surface water cycling feedbacks between soil moisture computed in pf and snow temperature computed in clm are accounted for in the energy budget thermal processes in pf clm are constrained by closing the energy

dickinson et al 1993 snow albedo for direct radiation is further corrected for solar zenith angle which describes the angle of the sun perpendicular to the surface for a given time latitude and longitude given by 4 cff 1 1 sl 1 cos ϕ 2 sl 1 sl where sl is the factor that controls albedo zenith dependence and ϕ degrees is the zenith angle soil albedo is also calculated separately for the direct and diffuse radiation of different wavebands and is a function of moisture content for a given soil color the combined surface albedo scales soil and surface albedos based on the fraction of snow covered area fsnow described in section 2 1 2 highly parameterized formulations of albedo as used in clm are commonly included in land surface models because albedo is challenging to model and measure pirazzini 2009 new albedo measurement techniques are an active research area skiles et al 2018 casey et al 2017 amaral et al 2017 and more work is needed to understand the important processes governing changes in albedo and the scale at which improved albedo formulations are needed for accurate hydrologic predictions from land surface models downward longwave radiation lwdown w m2 is the radiation below the canopy in vegetated areas or the incoming longwave radiation in non vegetated or snow buried areas scaled by the emissivity of the surface longwave radiation from ground snow or leaf surfaces lwup w m2 is based on the boltzmann relationship with snow soil and leaf temperatures calculated in clm jefferson et al 2015 soil moisture and snow temperature feedbacks are accounted for in the energy budget emissivity is assumed to be constant at 0 97 for snow and ice and 0 96 for non snow covered surfaces latent heat le w m2 is the link between the water and energy cycles by capturing the energy required to change the phase of water to or from vapor when snow layers are present the latent heat flux occurs as either sublimation condensation or frost sublimation is calculated using the same mass transfer approach as ground evaporation but without the soil moisture limitation and using the latent heat of sublimation rather than vaporization to convert the water flux to an energy flux jefferson and maxwell 2015 if atmospheric and surface properties result in a downward surface flux it is classified as condensation or frost depending on if the ground temperature is less than freezing sensible heat h w m2 at the snow surface is calculated as 5 h ρ a c p t gr t air r ah where the density of air ρa kg m3 is determined from forcing inputs using the ideal gas law the specific heat of dry air cp j k kg is constant the ground surface temperature is either the soil or snowpack surface tgr k the air temperature tair k is obtained from forcing inputs and the aerodynamic resistance factor rah accounts for atmospheric stability similar to latent heat flux jefferson and maxwell 2015 kollet et al 2009 the ground heat flux g w m2 is determined from closure of the energy budget eq 1 where the residual energy drives tgr changes ground heat flux provides the upper boundary condition for the vertical conduction equation used to calculate soil or snow temperature based on the mass specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of each phase liquid ice or soil present in a given layer the thermal conductivity for snow ksnow w m k is derived from the sntherm 89 formulation jordan 1991 6 k snow k a 7 75 x 10 5 ρ iw 1 105 x 10 6 ρ iw 2 k i k a where ka and ki are the thermal conductivity of air and ice assumed to be 0 023 w m k and 2 29 w m k respectively and ρiw kg m3 is the partial density of liquid water and ice in the snow layer which is calculated using the densities of liquid water and ice based on fraction of the snowpack that is liquid or ice 2 1 2 snow covered vegetation the vegetation properties important for the latent heat calculation are parameterized and computed for snow free and snow covered time periods the user

used to determine the depth of newly fallen snow precipitation reaching the ground as snow is added to the existing snow depth and swe of the top snow layer if no snow is present a new snow layer is initialized with the associated swe mm when the snow depth dsnow m exceeds 0 01 m snow layers only form and age when snow falls and begins to accumulate on the ground the change in snow and soil temperature results in melting and freezing of snow and soil water by using the available energy to overcome the heat of fusion if adequate energy is available melting and freezing are calculated for each snow layer melt occurs if frozen water is present and the layer temperature exceeds freezing while freezing occurs if liquid water is available and the temperature is below freezing any energy that remains after accounting for phase change is used to adjust the final snow soil temperature and corresponding energy fluxes snowpack metamorphism how the snowpack structure changes through time is included in pf clm to account for changes in layer thicknesses from destructive overburden and melt processes in each layer destructive or equi temperature metamorphism results from vapor pressure gradients that drive redistribution of mass toward the center of snow grains this process is most prevalent in fresh snow with pronounced points causing low densities and when temperatures approach freezing with small vertical temperature gradients in the snowpack the pf clm formulation for the change in layer thickness from destructive metamorphism ddzdestructive m s is derived from sntherm 89 jordan 1991 and accounts for the temperature dependence of the process as 13 dd z dest ruct ive 2 777 x 10 6 e 0 04 t frz t gr c 3 c 4 where c3 decreases the rate of metamorphism based on the bulk

metamorphism is weighted toward lower densities approximating newer snow that will experience settling c4 is included when liquid water is present defined as exceeding 1 of the snow layer thickness and accelerates the rate of destructive metamorphism by a factor of 2 overburden metamorphism ddzoverburden m s results in the densification of snow from the weight of overlying snow layers wx kg the overburden metamorphism parameterization is derived from sntherm 89 jordan 1991 and accounts for the temperature and density dependence of viscosity as 15 dd z over burd en w x e 0 08 t frz t gr 0 021 ρ i η 0 where η0 is the viscosity coefficient at freezing as snow density approaches zero and is considered constant at 9e5 kg s m2 consistent with modifications in the sntherm 99 model jordan et al 1999 snow compaction from overburden does not occur if a snow layer is water saturated less than 0 1 void space or if the ice lens is too thin less than 0 1 mm of frozen water equivalent melt metamorphism occurs based on the available energy from the thermal processes described above and is taken as a ratio of snow ice fraction after and before melting after accounting for snowfall and metamorphism snow layers are combined and subdivided based on prescribed thicknesses the maximum thickness for the top snow layer is set to 0 02 m which allows surface layers to more accurately reflect the properties of new snow for age and albedo calculations the maximum number of snow layers is set to a default of 5 with the top 4 layer maximum thicknesses of 0 02 m 0 05 m 0 11 m 0 25 m respectively for computational efficiency if the layer thickness or the mass of frozen water is small the layer is combined with the layer below after updating the frozen and liquid water contents of each snow layer for melting freezing and surface fluxes sublimation evaporation frost dew snowmelt is redistributed in the snowpack meltwater in a given layer is available for gravity drainage assuming capillary forces are negligible if the liquid water content exceeds the holding capacity of snow the liquid water holding capacity is a user defined fraction of the effective snowpack porosity with a default value of 0 033 the effective porosity of snow is calculated as the non ice partial volume and must exceed a minimum user defined impervious threshold default is 0 05 in a given layer and underlying layer for water to percolate otherwise water ponds with no lateral flow within the snowpack meltwater out of the bottom snow layer is passed back to parflow and is available for infiltration 2 1 4 snow age non dimensional snow age τsnow is estimated by accounting for three processes that alter snow albedo first albedo depends on the change in grain size with vapor diffusion as the snowpack ripens approximating the vapor pressure using surface temperature tgr k as 16 a 1 e 5000 1 t frz 1 t gr a second process is associated with an increase in effective grain size near freezing and limited to less than or equal to unity approximated as 17 a 2 a 1 10 the third process accounts for the darkening of soil due to the deposition of soot or dirt a3 which is assumed to be 0

modifying these input parameters affects the quantities of interest of this study output of peak swe monthly averaged swe and timing of total melt the pf clm inputs can be better constrained leading to more accurate model results that can be scaled to coarser resolution and larger scale models additionally running a sensitivity analysis on the snow and forcing parameters allows for a sensitivity comparison between values based on field data meteorological forcing and values embedded in the model snow parameters to better understand the relationships between the model outputs and eight forcing and six snow parameters this study employs the active subspaces method of sensitivity analysis active subspaces globally compares the relationships of the parflow clm input parameters and the forcing parameters with a selected quantity of interest model output this method identifies the important direction s in the 14 dimensional input space along which the output changes more than in the orthogonal directions the active subspace is a span of a set of directions composed of a set of weights defining a linear combination of the inputs the active subspace is usually derived by the gradient of the input parameters parflow clm however does not access this gradient and must substitute an algorithm to define the single most important direction in the input space since a finite difference approximation would be too computationally expensive therefore we chose to use a linear model to approximate these gradients the normalized gradient of the linear model gives the single most important direction in the fourteen dimensional input space the weights of the linear combination of the inputs reveal to which parameters the model is most sensitive input parameters with weights of larger magnitudes are more important because a change in these parameters causes a greater change in the output than a change in other input parameters a negative weight means an increase in the input parameter leads to a decrease in the output and a positive weight means an increase in the input parameter leads to an increase in the output jefferson and maxwell 2015 the sufficient summary plot ssp identifies the relationship between the quantity of interest and the combination of input parameters the active variable each point on the ssp corresponds to the inputs and output from one model realization the greater the slope of the sufficient summary plot the more sensitive the quantity of interest is to the changes in the input variable see constantine 2015 jefferson et al 2015 2017 and gilbert et al 2016 for more details on the active subspaces approach to apply the active subspaces approach in a computationally efficient manner a monte carlo method was used to select a multiplier for each forcing parameter based on the accuracy measurements from the manuals for the instruments used to collect the meteorological observations rm young 2000 vaisla 2016 campbell scientific 2011 cs105 each forcing parameter time step for water year 2014 was then multiplied by this randomly selected multiplier value from the ranges shown in table 1 this process was repeated 300 times this set of 300 forcing parameters was then used with both bare ground land cover and evergreen needleleaf land cover similarly a monte carlo method was used to randomly select a number based on the ranges of possible values from the literature surrounding snow parameters in hydrologic models hollinger and richardson 2005 warren and wiscombe 1980 warren 1982 grenfell et al 1994 dickinson et al 1993 bonan et al 2002 due to the relative simplicity of replacing the snow parameters in parflow clm these randomly selected values replaced the baseline snow parameter values in parflow clm so that active subspaces was performed directly on the snow parameter values whereas it was performed on the forcing multipliers this process was then repeated 300 times for the snow parameters this set of 300 snow parameters was then used with both bare ground land cover and evergreen needleleaf land cover these approaches resulted in 600 total model simulations where both the forcing and snow parameters were perturbed 300 simulations using bare ground land cover and 300 simulations using evergreen needleleaf land cover to isolate the model sensitivity to the snow parameters we ran an additional set of 300 simulations in this scenario the meteorological forcing was consistent with the baseline forcing and bare ground land cover was used only the snow input parameters are perturbed in this additional set of simulations the three sets of simulations using the model domain described in the following section are referred to as the evergreen needleleaf simulations the bare ground simulations and the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations table 2 2 3 model domain while sensitivity analyses have been performed using large scale three dimensional models it is computationally expensive because these three dimensional models can contain millions of parameters as each domain cell needs to be populated condon et al 2013 therefore this study uses a single column approach to understand the physics and constraints of some of the snow processes of pf clm mentioned above without the confounding influence of spatial variability in meteorological forcing topography and vegetation this single column approach decreases the number of input parameters as well as computational expense without sacrificing the legitimacy of the model as simplifying lateral flow has a negligible effect on land surface parameter sensitivities jefferson et al 2017 the domain of this study is a one meter cubed model with five subsurface layers ranging from 23 to 0 1 cm the model uses a one dimensional meteorological forcing comprised of incoming shortwave and longwave radiation air temperature wind speed atmospheric pressure and specific humidity from the ameriflux tower at the niwot ridge research site for water year 2014 blanken 1998 the land cover at niwot ridge is classified as evergreen needleleaf and the area is located in the front range of the rocky mountains 25 miles northwest of boulder colorado making this a snow dominated site the precipitation data used in this study comes from the u s climate reference network uscrn boulder 14 w gage which is about one kilometer from the ameriflux site diamond et al 2013 meteorological data from water year 2014 was chosen for the baseline forcing as the modeled swe most accurately estimates the observed swe from the ameriflux site fig 2 the same baseline forcing was run using bare ground land cover to determine the sensitivity of parflow clm to land cover type fig 3 3 results and discussion after perturbing both the snow and forcing parameters and computing the active subspace for evergreen needleleaf bare ground and bare ground with baseline forcing we observed the relationships between the input parameters and quantities of interest monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt we found the model sensitivities vary with land cover and the modeled quantity of interest 3 1 monthly averaged swe august and july are excluded from the monthly averaged swe sensitivity analysis as swe is zero in these months for all simulations the results of the evergreen needleleaf simulations show parflow clm is most sensitive to changes in longwave radiation and air temperature throughout the water year as reflected by the consistently larger absolute active variable weights in fig 4 however some sensitivities vary with month humidity is an important parameter for all months except may june and september and has a positive relationship with swe meaning as humidity increases swe also increases this relationship could be due to the amount of moisture humid air can hold as opposed to dry air dry air can hold more moisture and thus encourages snowmelt since the air is moister in the summer months may june and september are less sensitive to changes in humidity than the other months snowmelt in these months are instead driven by radiation and air temperature longwave and shortwave radiation into the snowpack cause snow to melt and this results in an inverse relationship between radiation parameters and swe air temperature directly effects the snowpack both through partitioning precipitation into snow or rain and calculating the density of fresh snowfall eqs 11 and 12 the parflow clm evergreen needleleaf simulations are insensitive to the snow parameters for every month due to the trees dampening effect of the snow parameters clm attributes a fractional vegetation cover of 0 8 to evergreen needleleaf land cover this causes the model to become insensitive to snow albedo since much of the incoming shortwave radiation which drives albedo is blocked by the vegetation dickinson et al 1993 the months most sensitive to changes in input parameters as a whole are april may and june shown by the larger slopes on the ssp swe changes more in these months as the active variable changes these months span the dynamic melt season and may be more sensitive on the whole due to the greater weights of and thus greater sensitivity to longwave radiation and air temperature the results for the bare ground simulations reveal different sensitivity relationships month to month than the evergreen needleleaf fig 5 similar to the evergreen needleleaf simulations the bare ground simulations are sensitive to longwave radiation in every month however shortwave radiation is also an important parameter in every month except september radiation parameters seem to be the main driver of snowmelt in the bare ground scenarios while changes in air temperature and humidity are less important the bare ground simulations are also sensitive to the near infrared and visible albedo coefficients throughout the year this may be because year round the tree canopy is not blocking the shortwave radiation which drives the albedo as albedo increases swe increases since it reflects the incoming solar radiation and deters melting the months most sensitive to change of the input parameters are january february march april and may revealing that the bare ground simulations as a whole are more sensitive to change in the input parameters for the duration of snow presence fig 3 than the evergreen needleleaf simulations as there is more variation in modeled swe output within each month and more months showing noteworthy variation march and april are the most sensitive months indicating melt season is most sensitive with less shade more months become sensitive to changes in the input parameters also february shows a strong sensitivity to changes in the input parameters until the active variable reaches a threshold of about 0 1 this means there is a threshold after which the combination of changes in input no longer affect the monthly averaged swe the opposite can be seen in may and june when melt is occurring where the active variable reaches a threshold and monthly averaged swe becomes much more sensitive to changes in the input parameters fig 5 september has the lowest number of important parameters in both models revealing it to be the least sensitive month this may be due to september having the lowest average swe of the included months fig 6 shows the sensitivity results for the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations this focus on the snow parameters reveals the dependence of the model to forcing parameters versus snow parameters these results show the snow parameters have similar weights as the previous bare ground simulations however parameters snal0 and snal1 have much higher weights for every month with september exhibiting a higher inverse weight the albedo coefficients become more important without the added influence of the forcing perturbations furthermore the range of maximum swe for each month is smaller when only the snow parameters are perturbed than when both the forcing and snow parameters are perturbed this difference in range and parameter weights can then be attributed to the perturbation of the forcing parameters though the magnitude of monthly averaged swe decreases in this scenario the ssp shows similar monthly relationships to the bare ground scenarios where both forcing and snow parameters are perturbed 3 2 peak swe similar to the monthly averages of swe in the evergreen needleleaf simulations peak swe is most sensitive to humidity and longwave radiation as well as air temperature fig 7 peak swe is dependent upon snow accumulation and therefore will be more sensitive to humidity which influences sublimation and evaporation increases in longwave radiation and air temperature encourage melting and decrease the snowpack due to energy inputs resulting in a greater sensitivity of the model to these parameters peak swe ranges from 426 7 mm to 457 9 mm a difference of 31 2 mm in the bare ground scenarios pf clm is sensitive to both shortwave and longwave radiation as well as both the near infrared and visible albedo coefficients fig 8 again this may be due to the lack of tree cover and therefore ability of shortwave radiation to reach the snowpack and impact peak swe the lack of tree cover in the model allows for sensitivity to albedo coefficients as there is no leaf or steam area blocking energy fluxes peak swe for these runs varies from 151 3 mm to 471 5 mm a range of 320 2 mm the ranges of modeled peak swe are greater for the bare ground simulations than the evergreen needleleaf simulations revealing a greater sensitivity of the bare ground model to input parameters table 3 the least squares regression for the linear model in all simulations is 0 99 which means the variation in peak swe can be explained by the active variable peak swe for the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations are sensitive to the albedo coefficients fig 9 the range of peak swe for these simulations is 179 1 mm to 419 1 mm this is a smaller range than the bare ground runs that perturb all input parameters however it is not as small as the evergreen needleleaf runs table 3 this indicates the difference in ranges of these simulations could be attributed to the forcing parameters and land cover type 3 3 time of total melt here the time of total melt is the first time swe reaches zero millimeters after peak swe longwave radiation air temperature and shortwave radiation are the most important parameters for determining the time of total melt in the evergreen needleleaf scenarios fig 10 these parameters contribute most to the melting of the snowpack as this melt is dependent upon the energy into the system the time of total melt ranges from june 6 2014 17 00 to june 13 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 163 h the bare ground simulations show that radiation and the albedo coefficients are the most important parameters in total melt timing an increase in radiation causes an earlier time of total melt and an increase in albedo coefficients causes a later time of melt fig 11 these parameters interact resulting in a wider range of total melt times in the bare ground simulations than the evergreen needleleaf simulations time of total melt ranges from march 16 2014 15 00 to june 8 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 2013 h the greater variation in the bare ground scenarios shows a greater overall sensitivity to perturbations in the input parameters table 3 the range of time of total melt of the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations fig 12 falls between the ranges of the other sets of simulations from march 19 2014 11 00 to may 31 2014 12 00 mt a difference of 1753 h this reveals the change in ranges may be due to land cover type and perturbation of forcing parameters 3 4 overall trends the sensitivity of model parameters varies with both quantity of interest and land cover type this study shows that evergreen needleleaf trees dampen the effects of snow input parameters on modeled swe outputs making the model insensitive to changes in the snow model inputs but introducing additional parameters to characterize the vegetation this dampening effect results in greater overall sensitivity of the model to snow parameters when using bare ground than using evergreen needleleaf in the bare ground simulations the model is sensitive to both the meteorological inputs and the albedo coefficients the increase in modeled outputs ranges and decrease in albedo coefficient sensitivity between the bare ground with baseline forcing simulations and the bare ground simulations can be attributed to the influence of the forcing parameters this has broader implications for data collection and model parameterizations obtaining accurate meteorological inputs particularly radiation air temperature and humidity is essential for achieving proper model results if these meteorological inputs vary even by small amounts modeled results can become misleading model parameterizations also must be realistic small perturbations in the albedo coefficients can lead to larger output variations while a large fractional vegetation cover value for evergreen needleleaf land cover may result in the model being too insensitive to some model input parameters active subspaces is shown to be a useful sensitivity analysis method for complex hydrologic models such as parflow clm this method allows for the simultaneous perturbation of multiple model inputs without greatly increasing computational expense through the use of active subspaces we have a greater understanding about how the changes in meteorological inputs and snow model inputs affect monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt using two different land cover types 3 5 further study though this study is useful for understanding the sensitives of evergreen needleleaf and bare ground land cover types to changes in model forcing and snow parameters further work could be done to evaluate the way in which other land cover types respond to perturbations in these inputs as shown through this study the sensitivity of modeled outputs will change depending on land cover type the region and site chosen will also play a role in the simulation results a location with different seasonal patterns than niwot ridge may react differently to forcing and snow parameters potentially causing the snow parameters to be of more importance than the forcing parameters simulating other land cover types and locations was outside the scope of this study but could be useful for a deeper understanding of pf clm sensitivity analysis in the future we have shown active subspaces to be a useful tool for evaluating the sensitivity of model outputs to various input parameters of pf clm this method could be used with other modeling platforms to evaluate outputs sensitivity though depending on the configuration and equations used in other models the sensitivities of monthly averaged swe peak swe and time of total melt to the input parameters may vary this reinforces the need for conducting sensitivity analysis on any modeling platform as the results may differ and we show it can be done effectively using the active subspaces method 4 conclusions in this study we examined the sensitivity of the pf clm snow module to both forcing and snow input parameters three quantities of interest monthly averaged swe peak swe time of total melt were evaluated and eight forcing parameters and six snow model input parameters were perturbed using active subspaces for two different land cover types the results show that the snow module in parflow clm is more sensitive to forcing parameters than snow input parameters especially when the land cover is evergreen needleleaf these findings show the importance of gathering and applying accurate meteorological forcing to the model as well as implementing correct albedo parameterizations for bare ground models land cover type affects both the input parameters to which the model is most sensitive and the range of outputs for each quantity of interest this has implications for model development in ensuring models are handling land cover properties such as leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover accurately bare ground land cover results in wider ranges of the quantity of interest than the evergreen land cover making those slight perturbations in input important for modeled output this study focused on two land cover types however conducting a similar sensitivity analysis on all parflow clm land cover types would lead to a better understanding of the role of land cover on snow processes in hydrologic models furthermore conducting a sensitivity analysis on more pieces of the model thermal processes energy process etc would lead to a deeper understanding of model physics and the sensitivity of all model parameters despite the challenge of observing or reconstructing meteorological and snow input parameters in these critical mountain systems it proves to be a necessary step toward estimating water availability credit authorship contribution statement anna ryken formal analysis investigation

548,rainfall data are needed for water resource management and decision making and are obtained from rainfall networks these data are especially important for streamflow simulations and forecasting the occurrence of intense rainfall during the flood season therefore rainfall networks should be carefully designed and evaluated several methods are used for rainfall network design and information theory based methods have recently received significant attention this study focuses on the design of a rainfall network especially for streamflow simulation a multi objective design method is proposed and applied to the wei river basin in china we use the total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy and multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer information redundancy refers to the overlap of information between rainfall stations and information transfer refers to the rainfall runoff relationship the outlet streamflow station huaxian station in the wei river basin is used as the target station for the streamflow simulation a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was used for the multi objective optimization of the rainfall network design we compared the proposed multi objective design with two other methods using an artificial neural network ann model the optimized rainfall network from the proposed method led to reasonable outlet streamflow forecasts with a balance between network efficiency and streamflow simulation our results indicate that the multi objective strategy provides an effective design by which the rainfall network can consider the rainfall runoff process and benefit streamflow prediction on a catchment scale key words entropy multi objective optimization rainfall network artificial neural network streamflow simulation 1 introduction rainfall networks provide basic data for the study of hydrological systems and these data are fundamental for water resource planning and management the question of designing an optimal rainfall network has been discussed since the 1960s chacon hurtado et al 2017 and there are different design methods including geostatistical methods pardo igúzquiza 1998 cheng et al 2008 shafiei et al 2013 information theory based methods husain 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992 yang and burn 1994 ridolfi et al 2011 yeh et al 2017 methods based on expert recommendations bleasdale 1965 laize 2004 and other methods such as value of information and network theory alfonso and price 2012 halverson and fleming 2015 the design of a network is often site specific or case specific and may need to consider a multitude of factors to address practical needs thus it is difficult to develop a unified or one fits all methodology for rainfall network design behmel et al 2016 recently entropy theory has been applied to different watersheds with different monitoring goals chen et al 2008 barca et al 2008 chebbi et al 2011 keum et al 2017 rainfall network design usually aims at better rainfall estimations and achieving more information from the system on different spatial and temporal scales for this purpose some studies apply a geostatistical approach to minimize the variance in areal rainfall estimations chen et al 2008 adhikary et al 2015 entropy based methods are used to obtain most information from the rainfall network system from the perspective of information theory yeh et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 further compared data transfer models geostatistical approach and information transfer models entropy approach for rainfall network evaluation recently abbasnezhadi et al 2019 also mentioned the importance of hydro geostatistical network design or assessment because the estimation of rainfall input can influence the modelled streamflow at present most design methods have mainly focused on a single variable i e rainfall network design uses only rainfall observation data because network design can be case specific and hydrological variables can differ in their characteristics there have been few discussions on the methods to design rainfall networks for streamflow simulations keum and coulibaly 2017 proposed a multi objective optimization approach for simultaneously maximizing information minimizing redundancy of the hydrometric network and maximizing conditional entropy that indicates information contained in a streamflow network that cannot be obtained from the precipitation network previous studies have focused on different types of monitoring networks such as precipitation networks ridolfi et al 2011 wei et al 2014 streamflow and water level networks li et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 soil moisture and groundwater networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 mondal and singh 2011 and water quality networks lee 2013 however the integrated design of networks based on entropy had not received much attention until the work by keum and coulibaly 2017 was conducted as keum et al 2017 also mentioned in a recent review the practical application of a monitoring network e g rainfall network has seldom been evaluated in hydrological or other models since hydrological variables can be correlated and impact the environment simultaneously many studies have been conducted on their joint behavior song and singh 2010a song and singh 2010b ma et al 2013 in addition because hydrological variables are interconnected in the water cycle and can be affected interactively li et al 2014 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a 2015b 2018 it is necessary to explore network performance from a system perspective volkmann et al 2010 suggested that a multi criteria rain gage network design strategy could provide a sparse but accurate network for flash flood prediction using the kinematic runoff and erosion kineros2 model rainfall networks have also been designed for hydrological modelling using the lumped xinanjiang model and the distributed soil and water assessment tool swat model which is recognized as a multi criteria network design xu et al 2015 furthermore the effects of rainfall network density and distribution on streamflow simulations have been investigated using hydrological modeling bárdossy and das 2008 xu et al 2013 zeng et al 2018 abbasnezhadi et al 2019 however these design or optimization procedures still involve only one hydrological variable rainfall a multivariate network design was not discussed until keum and coulibaly 2017 developed an integrated design framework for streamflow and precipitation networks based on multi objective optimization the rainfall runoff process was still not completely represented as the results were not evaluated with hydrological or other models here we present a multi objective optimization approach for the design of a rainfall network to assist streamflow prediction and the optimization involves two hydrological variables rainfall and streamflow the method is generally based on multi objective optimization which provides a framework for designing a rainfall network using hydrometric information other than rainfall as well on the one hand this approach minimizes the information redundancy in the rainfall network alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b li et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 leach et al 2016 stosic et al 2017 which has become a widely and frequently accepted principle in network design on the other hand the correlation between the input rainfall and the output streamflow is maximized to improve model performance in such a case the design of a rainfall network simultaneously reduces the redundancy among the selected set of rainfall stations and increases the relevance between rainfall input and streamflow output therefore multi objective optimization connects rainfall network design and downstream streamflow forecasting from a theoretic information viewpoint in addition multi objective optimization also considers better rainfall estimations and uses another objective to achieve the minimum residual variance in the rainfall observation data the results of the optimization method were further examined using an artificial neural network ann model for streamflow simulation the method is also compared in different aspects with two other key methods keum and coulibaly 2017 xu et al 2015 using multi objective optimization the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the basic measures multi objective optimization and rainfall runoff forecast models used in this study and present the proposed method framework in section 3 we describe the study area including the background of the basins and dataset description in section 4 we discuss the results obtained from the case study finally in section 5 we provide conclusions and suggestions for rainfall network design 2 methodology 2 1 entropy measures the methods based on entropy theory shannon 1948 for designing hydrometric networks apply several concepts such as marginal entropy joint entropy conditional entropy mutual information partial mutual information total correlation and multivariate transinformation definitions of these measures are given as follows the marginal entropy h of a discrete variable x can be defined as 1 h x h p 1 p 2 p 3 p n i 1 n p i log p i where pi 0 pi 1 is the probability of occurrence xi i 1 2 n and pi 1 marginal entropy is often used as an index of the information content of a variable one station for the information content of several variables joint entropy is introduced as follows for a bivariate case x y with a joint probability of xi and yj denoted as p xi yj pij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m the joint entropy h x y between them can be defined as 2 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j and for multivariate case x 1 xn with joint probability p i 1 i n i 1 1 2 n 1 i 2 1 2 n 2 i n 1 2 n n the joint entropy can be defined as 3 h x 1 x n i 1 1 n 1 i 2 1 n 2 i n 1 n n p i 1 i n log p i 1 i n for conditional distribution conditional entropy h x y is obtained by 4 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j q j where qj j 1 2 m is the probability of occurrence mutual information i x y describes the amount of information transmitted or shared between two random variables which is represented as 5 i x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j p i p j where pi pj are the probabilities of occurrence of xi and y j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m mutual information can also be obtained as follows 6 i x y h x h y h x y partial mutual information is used for finer definitions of causality among variables i x y z denotes the information transfer from y to x excluding the effect of z the information transfer from y to x alone which can be obtained as 7 i x y z h x z h x y z with respect to the multivariate case total correlation tc is usually used to describe the amount of shared information between three or more variables 8 t c x 1 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x n multivariate transinformation mt is a measure of information transfer when three or more variables are considered in the system to understand multivariate transinformation more directly eq 9 expresses it with the chain rule and each partial piece of mutual information i xi y x 1 x i 1 denotes the information contribution of each variable xi to the targeted variable y under the given information from x 1 x 2 x i 1 9 m t x 1 x 2 x m y i 1 m i x i y x 1 x i 1 where m is the number of variables in addition multivariate transinformation can be obtained from joint entropy and marginal entropy as 10 m t x 1 x 2 x m y h x 1 x 2 x m h y h x 1 x 2 x m y a binning estimator is widely used for estimating mutual information for a bivariate case a contingency table with a fixed bin width or a fixed number of classes is often used to estimate the joint probability of bivariate variables however the choice of bin width class interval is not uniquely determined and estimation results are sensitive to bin width markus et al 2003 li et al 2012 alfonso et al 2014 fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017 wang et al 2018 we determined the class interval following sturges 1926 as follows 11 n c 1 lo g 2 n o b s where nc is the number of classes and nobs is the number of observations for the variable with the fixed bin size the probability p x for each bin is estimated by the corresponding relative frequency of the occurrence of sample values in the bin for bivariate variables a contingency table is often applied to compute the joint probability p x y entropy is calculated based on the logarithm function the logarithm base in this study is 2 and then the unit is bits the steps for implementing the binning estimator to calculate entropy are provided in the appendix for more details readers can also refer to li et al 2012 2 2 multi objective optimization previous studies on multi objective rainfall network design generally consider only rainfall data volkmann et al 2010 xu et al 2015 the first integrated network design framework proposed by keum and coulibaly 2017 related precipitation and streamflow while the objectives were all based on information measures to design a rainfall network for streamflow prediction we combine the previous criteria and promote a multi objective optimization framework that has two objectives based on entropy and one objective based on rainfall estimation performance the first objective is to minimize the overlapping information between different rainfall stations which helps obtain the least information redundancy for the selected station set the total correlation tc is used to quantify the information redundancy the second objective is to maximize the information transfer between input rainfall and output streamflow which intends to select the most relevant set of rainfall stations for the rainfall runoff model multivariate transinformation mt is used as a measure of information transfer from rainfall stations to hydrometric stations for the network design scheme the third objective is to minimize the residual variance compared to the measured data variance with the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc these three objectives are formulated as 12 m i n t c x 1 x 2 x n m a x m t x 1 x 2 x n q m a x n s c 1 t 1 t x t p t 2 t 1 t p t p 2 subject to n 1 2 n where i and j i 1 2 n j 1 2 n i j are the indices of rainfall stations n is the number of selected stations n is the total number of candidate rainfall stations t is the time index of the observed day t is the total length of the observed period xt is the estimated areal mean rainfall on the t th day pt is the true areal mean rainfall on the t th day p is the average of mean rainfall over the observation period and q is the targeted hydrometric station for prediction the method we proposed is referred to as wang s method for clarity here we also provide two multi objective optimization methods by xu et al 2015 referred to as xu s method and keum and coulibaly 2017 referred to as kc s method for comparison xu s method is described as 13 m i n i i 1 n 1 j i 1 n i x i x j c d 2 m i n p b i a s t 1 t x t p t t 1 t p t m a x n s c 1 t 1 t x t p t 2 t 1 t p t p 2 subject to n 1 2 n kc s method is described as 14 m a x h x 1 x 2 x n q m i n t c x 1 x 2 x n q m a x h q x 1 x 2 x n subject to n 1 2 n in general the multi objective optimization problem does not yield a unique solution that simultaneously optimizes each objective pareto 1964 instead it is necessary to obtain a pareto set of solutions that achieve a compromise between different objective functions having said that moving from one solution to another will result in the improvement of at least one objective while causing the loss in at least one other since it is not realistic to compare all combinations of rainfall stations e g there are 67 108 863 combinations of different numbers of stations from the 26 total stations the multi objective optimization is herein realized by a genetic algorithm ga the genetic algorithm is a global optimization technique that is inspired by the field of biology this technique has been widely used for optimization problems due to its easy implementation and flexibility in the organization of objectives the multi objective optimization problem is solved using an elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii by deb et al 2002 the convergence of the solutions is indicated with hypervolume bader and zitzler 2011 bode et al 2019 for more details on nsga ii the reader should refer to deb and agrawal 1994 and deb et al 2002 2 3 artificial neural network model artificial neural network ann models have been widely applied in the fields of hydrology and water resources hsu et al 1995 maier and dandy 2000 anctil et al 2006 a review by maier et al 2010 discussed the development of neural networks for the prediction of water resource variables and the results indicated that the vast majority of studies focused on flow prediction the advantage of an artificial neural network model lies in its powerful ability to address nonlinear problems in contrast to traditional hydrological models artificial neural network models have no need for detailed data to construct the model multilayer perceptrons mlp of neural networks are one of the most widely used artificial neural network approaches in hydrological forecasts maier et al 2010 in our study we used a three layer one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer mlp neural network using the backpropagation bp algorithm with hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as an activation function and the levenberg marquardt algorithm as a training function for model training and streamflow prediction input variables include mean areal rainfall from the selected set of rainfall stations and streamflow data from hydrometric stations and the one output variable is streamflow at the outlet station it is noted that time lag is considered in this study because the concentration time can be longer than one day therefore mutual information and correlation coefficients are used to determine the most suitable time lags and consequent rainfall and streamflow input for building the ann model two indices are adopted to evaluate model performance the first index is nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as 15 nse 1 t 1 n q o b s t q p r e d t 2 t 1 n q o b s t q o b s 2 where time step t 1 2 n qobs is the observed streamflow qpred is the predicted streamflow and q o b s is the mean value of observed streamflow during the study period nse is equal to 1 when a perfect fit between observed and predicted streamflow is reached the second index is root mean square error rmse with regard to its ability to maintain the water balance and a low rmse indicates a better prediction defined as 16 rmse 1 n t 1 n q o b s t q p r e d t 2 2 4 multi objective design of the rainfall network for streamflow prediction based on the theory and methods introduced above we propose a framework for the rainfall network design fig 1 the detailed description of the rainfall network design for streamflow forecasting using multi objective optimization and rainfall runoff model is as follows 1 perform multim objective optimization moo of the rainfall network using a genetic algorithm with kc s xu s and wang s methods 2 estimate the areal mean rainfall from the optimized combination of rainfall stations 3 obtain streamflow data from hydrometric stations 4 train an ann model for each moo solution with rainfall and streamflow data from 2 and 3 and use the model for streamflow simulation 5 evaluate streamflow simulation performance based on two indices nse and rmse in step 2 the temporal mean rainfall is calculated from the optimized combination of rainfall stations on a single day then we obtain the areal mean rainfall time series over a five year period therefore the rainfall and streamflow data used for the artificial neural network model are based on the daily scale and the concentration duration and time lag effect will be further discussed in sections 3 2 and 4 1 since an ann model is trained for a specific rainfall network station combination the ann model is re trained every time a new rainfall network is found 3 study area and data description 3 1 wei river basin the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and originates in weiyuan county of gansu province flowing through gansu ningxia shaanxi and other provinces from west to east the total length of the mainstream is 818 km and the total area of the wei river basin is 134 800 km2 accounting for 18 of the total area of the yellow river basin the seasonal variation in runoff is significant for the wei river with the largest runoff in autumn accounting for 38 40 of the annual runoff the inter annual variation in runoff for the mainstream of the wei river is relatively small and the variation coefficient is approximately 0 30 to 0 35 the outlet hydrometric station huaxian station sh is important for streamflow monitoring and flood forecasting fig 2 floods mainly come from the upstream of xianyang sx jing river and the tributaries between xianyang and huaxian floods usually occur from july to october every year and account for approximately 60 8 of the total annual runoff the upstream of xianyang the jing river and the tributaries between xianyang and huaxian contribute 61 8 18 2 and 20 respectively to the runoff at the huaxian station for this we also adopted streamflow from three stations the weijiabao station sw xianyang station sx and lintong station sl for streamflow prediction at the huaxian station sh table 1 provides the basic information and statistical properties of the four hydrometric stations 3 2 data description to obtain rainfall data for the mean areal rainfall estimate the chinese ground based 0 5 0 5 grid dataset v2 0 for daily precipitation was used to determine potential rainfall stations the data source consists of two parts one is daily precipitation data collected from national stations base stations and general stations by the national meteorological information center since 1961 and the other is digital elevation model dem data which are the resampling production of gtopo30 data with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 longitude and latitude by the thin plate spline tps interpolation method in anusplin software after extracting daily precipitation data mm from the grid dataset in the study area 26 potential rainfall stations inside the study area were chosen to constitute the rainfall network for the study area in the wei river basin as shown by green circles in fig 2 daily streamflow data m3 s from four stations sw sx sl sh from 2008 to 2012 were used for rainfall runoff model construction and streamflow prediction specifically daily rainfall and streamflow data from 2008 to 2011 were used for neural network training and data from 2011 to 2012 were used for validation streamflow prediction the mean maximum and minimum streamflow in lintong and huaxian were much larger than the streamflow at weijiabao and xianyang table 1 this result occurred because the jing river flows into the wei river in the upper reaches of the lin tong station and therefore brings more streamflow downstream due to the intense rainfall in the wei river basin three floods appeared between the weijiabao station and huaxian station in september 2011 the area between weijiabao and huaxian experienced three intense rainfall events september 5th 7th september 12th and september 16th 18th and the total amount of precipitation ranged from 230 to 432 mm the largest flood peak since 1981 5050 m3 s 19 12 september 20th 2011 occurred at the huaxian station which resulted in great risks to human life and property the water level also reached 342 7 m and the flood process duration was 33 2 h in total 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal correlation and dependence between stations to determine the concentration time for the hydrometric station we compared the correlations between three hydrometric stations sw sx sl and the huaxian station sh using correlation coefficients and mutual information according to the description of the three flood processes in 2011 we found that the flood propagation time lasted no more than three days therefore the time lag was chosen to vary from 0 to 3 days the highest values of the correlation coefficient and mutual information are marked in table 2 both the correlation coefficient and mutual information confirm that the best time lag for the weijiabao station was two days that for the xianyang station was one day and that for the lintong station was one day therefore the streamflow series for the specific hydrometric stations in further discussions were selected as two days ahead for sw and one day ahead for sx and sl similarly correlations with different time lags were investigated for the different rainfall stations and the huaxian station as shown in fig 3 the highest correlation coefficient appeared when the time lag was three days while mutual information did not show a clear pattern for the different candidate rainfall stations however the mutual information was still among or very close to the highest value when the time lag was three days since one of the inputs for the rainfall runoff model is the areal mean rainfall it is necessary to make it consistent for all stations to simplify the problem we chose a time lag of three days for the correlation between rainfall stations and hydrometric stations sh 4 2 comparison between different multi objective design methods for the multi objective design of the rainfall network the initial parameters of the genetic algorithm were set as 200 populations and 200 generations the hypervolume index under different generations is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the hypervolume tended to be stable for three multi objective optimization tasks before 50 generations which represented that the solutions for the following generations from the genetic algorithm were among the best known pareto approximation set the hypervolume indicates that the initial generation set is enough to be converged therefore the last generation after 200 nsga ii runs was obtained as the pareto solutions the frequencies of the selected numbers of stations from the three multi objective methods are provided in table 3 the sum of each column is 200 pareto solutions for the different optimization methods it is shown that under kc s and wang s method mostly 1 to 5 stations or 6 to 10 stations in the wei river basin were selected for the rainfall network combination while more stations were selected for xu s optimization because most combinations contained 16 to 20 stations or even more this result can be explained by the fact that xu s optimization objectives place more focus on the rainfall estimates in such cases more stations would be selected by xu s method because the rainfall estimation generally became more accurate with an increase in the rainfall network density furthermore the selection frequencies of the different rainfall stations under three multi objective frameworks in the wei river basin are shown in fig 5 the selection frequencies of the different rainfall stations were similar for kc s and wang methods fig 5a and c while xu s method showed a distinct pattern in the spatial distribution fig 5b a possible reason for this discrepancy is that the differences are related to the optimization objectives as mentioned before as two of the objectives in xu s method tend to achieve better estimates of areal mean rainfall a higher selection frequency was observed for most stations however kc s method and wang s method put more focus on the information efficiency resulting in sparser and more dispersed selected stations in addition certain stations located upstream no 2 midstream no 14 and downstream no 26 were frequently selected for the optimized networks from kc s method for the results of wang s method proposed in this study rainfall stations close to the huaxian station were more frequently selected no 24 and 26 as pareto solutions provide many possible configurations for network optimization the practical design generally calls for a single solution the spatial distribution of the frequency map indicates the most important stations and provides guidance for decision support 4 3 pareto solutions and optimal networks before discussing the pareto optimal networks we first investigated the variation trends of the three objectives wang s method with an increasing number of stations selected in the network fig 6 shows the trends of tc mt and nsc under 100 random combinations for different numbers of stations in the rainfall network the total correlation consistently increased with increasing numbers of stations added to the network fig 6a however multivariate transinformation increased before ten stations were added and then gradually stabilized fig 6b nsc showed a similar pattern with the saturated value achieved even when five or fewer stations were in the rainfall network fig 6c from the results the correlation between the three objectives and the number of stations in the rainfall network can be first explored the number of stations indeed affected the objective function values while the configuration impact should also not be ignored as seen in fig 6c a relatively wide range of trend lines reflected that even with only five or fewer stations in the network a very different nsc could be achieved with different station combinations the shape of the three dimensional pareto fronts is given in fig 7 a specifically four cases were chosen from the pareto solution sets to explore the individual objectives more closely case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 the first three cases each achieved the best values for the three optimization objectives minimize tc maximize mt and maximize nsc and the fourth case was around the median value for the three objectives the two dimensional projections of objective function pairs mt tc projection nsc mt projection and nsc tc projection are also shown in fig 7b 7c and 7d fig 7 shows that case 2 and case 3 were very close to and even overlapped each other while case 1 was far away from them this finding reflected that the second and third objectives may not conflict with each other as a result most of the solutions were located in the upper right corner of fig 7c the shapes of the other two objective function pairs followed the typical pareto fronts see fig 7b and 7d among all solutions case 4had considerable multivariate transinformation and nsc while the value of total correlation was much lower than that for case 2 and case 3 table 4 shows the details of four cases with the objective function values and number of stations it is confirmed that the values of multivariate transinformation and nsc were very similar for cases 2 and 3 case 1 yielded only 2 51 bits of total correlation which was much lower than that yielded by case 2 and case 3 in addition the multivariate transinformation for case 1 was almost half of that for the other cases meanwhile the selected number of stations was only three stations for case 1 which explained the low information redundancy and low information transfer in contrast cases 2 and 3 selected more stations 21 stations however case 4 selected only 8 stations while the information transfer achieved almost the same level as that for case 2 and case 3 this finding is also consistent with the results in fig 6 that the multivariate transinformation would gradually reach a stable value after a certain number of stations are included in the network meanwhile different spatial distributions of the network configuration under the four optimized cases are also shown in fig 8 we find that when fewer rainfall stations were selected most of them were distributed upstream and downstream of the wei river case 1 as the number of stations gradually increased more rainfall stations in the middle of the river may be included in the network 4 4 evaluation of optimal networks in rainfall runoff models to evaluate the performance of rainfall networks for accurate streamflow prediction we used the areal mean rainfall estimated by the optimized network as part of the input to the ann model the areal mean rainfall from three days ahead from different station combinations together with the streamflow records from the four hydrometric stations streamflow from two days ahead for sw streamflow from one day ahead for sx sl and sh were used in the ann model for streamflow simulation rainfall estimates of the optimized networks from kc s and xu s method were also adopted for streamflow prediction and the results were compared we used 200 pareto solutions of the network configurations from the different optimization methods and ran the ann model 10 times with the same data input and same ann structure and parameters for each solution to reduce the uncertainty in the ann training process therefore we obtained 2000 samples of simulation performance for the three methods in addition the four cases discussed in section 4 3 were also used as rainfall inputs for the ann model we ran the ann model separately 2000 times with each case rainfall input from the station combination of that case and streamflow records from four hydrometric stations and obtain the same sample number as three methods the median and mean values of nse and rmse for 2000 samples are shown in fig 9 although different multi objective optimization methods yielded different pareto solutions the results for the two indices were similar for the different optimization results nevertheless kc s method and case 4 led to a slightly worse performance for streamflow prediction with relatively low nse and high rmse kc s method selected fewer stations with worse performance while xu s method achieved the best simulation performance with more stations in the pareto solutions generally wang s method showed median nse and rmse performance compared with kc s method and xu s method the differences between kc s xu s and wang s method reveal that wang s method could achieve a balance between network efficiency number of stations and streamflow simulation performance it should also be noted that the median and mean nse and rmse were not necessarily relevant to the number of selected stations for instance only three stations were selected in case 1 but the median and mean values of nse and rmse were better than those for case 4 with eight stations included in the network to illustrate the streamflow prediction results we generated hydrographs using the ann model to visualize the streamflow simulation fig 10 the hydrograph only used the simulation results from four cases since we already provided the spatial configurations of the rainfall networks the peak flow usually occurred in september for the wei river basin which should be of great concern in the flash flood forecasts therefore we specifically present the streamflow prediction results from july 1st 2011 to october 31st 2011 as serious flood processes were recorded during this period different combinations showed no evident differences in the streamflow simulation results generally networks of different configurations from multi objective optimization can describe and capture the temporal variations in streamflow characteristics under a certain number of simulations fig 10a 10b 10c and 10d from the integrated results fig 10e the predicted peak streamflow can be well estimated for the different optimized networks compared with the observed streamflow as the observed streamflow was generally within the simulation bands however the simulation could either overestimate or underestimate the streamflow therefore it is a better choice to perform the simulation many times to obtain the uncertainty band and especially avoid the underestimation of the peak flow as the effect of averaging the rainfall estimate could smooth the variation in the different networks for streamflow simulation we did not expect significant differences between the four cases in fig 10 meanwhile the influence of the optimization method on streamflow prediction could be weakened since the rainfall runoff process is complex and many factors can influence the streamflow simulation models and results nevertheless the results provide guidance for streamflow prediction with respect to rainfall input when different numbers of rainfall stations are included in the rainfall network 5 conclusion we proposed a multi objective rainfall network design method based on information theory and applied it to the wei river basin in china the rainfall network design can be viewed as the input for a rainfall runoff model as it was intended to consider streamflow data at the outlet hydrometric station the method adopts total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer and nsc as an indicator of rainfall estimation performance meanwhile time lags between different stations both rainfall stations and hydrometric stations and target hydrometric stations were considered redundant information between rainfall stations varied significantly with the increasing number of stations while the information delivered from rainfall stations to the target hydrometric station gradually stabilized the streamflow simulations from the ann model were compared with different optimization methods generally the proposed method balanced the network efficiency and streamflow simulation performance with fewer selected stations than xu s method but better simulation results than kc s method the hydrographs during the flood process also confirmed the feasibility of the rainfall network for streamflow simulation to conclude the combination of rainfall network design with downstream streamflow simulations was shown to be promising meanwhile the design framework is flexible because other complicated rainfall runoff models can be adopted for more accurate outlet streamflow predictions the proposed design method can be further conducted on a smaller catchment scale with a tighter correlation between upstream rainfall and downstream streamflow user specific objectives can also be added to the network design process for model

548,rainfall data are needed for water resource management and decision making and are obtained from rainfall networks these data are especially important for streamflow simulations and forecasting the occurrence of intense rainfall during the flood season therefore rainfall networks should be carefully designed and evaluated several methods are used for rainfall network design and information theory based methods have recently received significant attention this study focuses on the design of a rainfall network especially for streamflow simulation a multi objective design method is proposed and applied to the wei river basin in china we use the total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy and multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer information redundancy refers to the overlap of information between rainfall stations and information transfer refers to the rainfall runoff relationship the outlet streamflow station huaxian station in the wei river basin is used as the target station for the streamflow simulation a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii was used for the multi objective optimization of the rainfall network design we compared the proposed multi objective design with two other methods using an artificial neural network ann model the optimized rainfall network from the proposed method led to reasonable outlet streamflow forecasts with a balance between network efficiency and streamflow simulation our results indicate that the multi objective strategy provides an effective design by which the rainfall network can consider the rainfall runoff process and benefit streamflow prediction on a catchment scale key words entropy multi objective optimization rainfall network artificial neural network streamflow simulation 1 introduction rainfall networks provide basic data for the study of hydrological systems and these data are fundamental for water resource planning and management the question of designing an optimal rainfall network has been discussed since the 1960s chacon hurtado et al 2017 and there are different design methods including geostatistical methods pardo igúzquiza 1998 cheng et al 2008 shafiei et al 2013 information theory based methods husain 1989 krstanovic and singh 1992 yang and burn 1994 ridolfi et al 2011 yeh et al 2017 methods based on expert recommendations bleasdale 1965 laize 2004 and other methods such as value of information and network theory alfonso and price 2012 halverson and fleming 2015 the design of a network is often site specific or case specific and may need to consider a multitude of factors to address practical needs thus it is difficult to develop a unified or one fits all methodology for rainfall network design behmel et al 2016 recently entropy theory has been applied to different watersheds with different monitoring goals chen et al 2008 barca et al 2008 chebbi et al 2011 keum et al 2017 rainfall network design usually aims at better rainfall estimations and achieving more information from the system on different spatial and temporal scales for this purpose some studies apply a geostatistical approach to minimize the variance in areal rainfall estimations chen et al 2008 adhikary et al 2015 entropy based methods are used to obtain most information from the rainfall network system from the perspective of information theory yeh et al 2017 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 further compared data transfer models geostatistical approach and information transfer models entropy approach for rainfall network evaluation recently abbasnezhadi et al 2019 also mentioned the importance of hydro geostatistical network design or assessment because the estimation of rainfall input can influence the modelled streamflow at present most design methods have mainly focused on a single variable i e rainfall network design uses only rainfall observation data because network design can be case specific and hydrological variables can differ in their characteristics there have been few discussions on the methods to design rainfall networks for streamflow simulations keum and coulibaly 2017 proposed a multi objective optimization approach for simultaneously maximizing information minimizing redundancy of the hydrometric network and maximizing conditional entropy that indicates information contained in a streamflow network that cannot be obtained from the precipitation network previous studies have focused on different types of monitoring networks such as precipitation networks ridolfi et al 2011 wei et al 2014 streamflow and water level networks li et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 soil moisture and groundwater networks kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 mondal and singh 2011 and water quality networks lee 2013 however the integrated design of networks based on entropy had not received much attention until the work by keum and coulibaly 2017 was conducted as keum et al 2017 also mentioned in a recent review the practical application of a monitoring network e g rainfall network has seldom been evaluated in hydrological or other models since hydrological variables can be correlated and impact the environment simultaneously many studies have been conducted on their joint behavior song and singh 2010a song and singh 2010b ma et al 2013 in addition because hydrological variables are interconnected in the water cycle and can be affected interactively li et al 2014 song et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a 2015b 2018 it is necessary to explore network performance from a system perspective volkmann et al 2010 suggested that a multi criteria rain gage network design strategy could provide a sparse but accurate network for flash flood prediction using the kinematic runoff and erosion kineros2 model rainfall networks have also been designed for hydrological modelling using the lumped xinanjiang model and the distributed soil and water assessment tool swat model which is recognized as a multi criteria network design xu et al 2015 furthermore the effects of rainfall network density and distribution on streamflow simulations have been investigated using hydrological modeling bárdossy and das 2008 xu et al 2013 zeng et al 2018 abbasnezhadi et al 2019 however these design or optimization procedures still involve only one hydrological variable rainfall a multivariate network design was not discussed until keum and coulibaly 2017 developed an integrated design framework for streamflow and precipitation networks based on multi objective optimization the rainfall runoff process was still not completely represented as the results were not evaluated with hydrological or other models here we present a multi objective optimization approach for the design of a rainfall network to assist streamflow prediction and the optimization involves two hydrological variables rainfall and streamflow the method is generally based on multi objective optimization which provides a framework for designing a rainfall network using hydrometric information other than rainfall as well on the one hand this approach minimizes the information redundancy in the rainfall network alfonso et al 2010a alfonso et al 2010b li et al 2012 fahle et al 2015 leach et al 2016 stosic et al 2017 which has become a widely and frequently accepted principle in network design on the other hand the correlation between the input rainfall and the output streamflow is maximized to improve model performance in such a case the design of a rainfall network simultaneously reduces the redundancy among the selected set of rainfall stations and increases the relevance between rainfall input and streamflow output therefore multi objective optimization connects rainfall network design and downstream streamflow forecasting from a theoretic information viewpoint in addition multi objective optimization also considers better rainfall estimations and uses another objective to achieve the minimum residual variance in the rainfall observation data the results of the optimization method were further examined using an artificial neural network ann model for streamflow simulation the method is also compared in different aspects with two other key methods keum and coulibaly 2017 xu et al 2015 using multi objective optimization the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the basic measures multi objective optimization and rainfall runoff forecast models used in this study and present the proposed method framework in section 3 we describe the study area including the background of the basins and dataset description in section 4 we discuss the results obtained from the case study finally in section 5 we provide conclusions and suggestions for rainfall network design 2 methodology 2 1 entropy measures the methods based on entropy theory shannon 1948 for designing hydrometric networks apply several concepts such as marginal entropy joint entropy conditional entropy mutual information partial mutual information total correlation and multivariate transinformation definitions of these measures are given as follows the marginal entropy h of a discrete variable x can be defined as 1 h x h p 1 p 2 p 3 p n i 1 n p i log p i where pi 0 pi 1 is the probability of occurrence xi i 1 2 n and pi 1 marginal entropy is often used as an index of the information content of a variable one station for the information content of several variables joint entropy is introduced as follows for a bivariate case x y with a joint probability of xi and yj denoted as p xi yj pij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m the joint entropy h x y between them can be defined as 2 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j and for multivariate case x 1 xn with joint probability p i 1 i n i 1 1 2 n 1 i 2 1 2 n 2 i n 1 2 n n the joint entropy can be defined as 3 h x 1 x n i 1 1 n 1 i 2 1 n 2 i n 1 n n p i 1 i n log p i 1 i n for conditional distribution conditional entropy h x y is obtained by 4 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j q j where qj j 1 2 m is the probability of occurrence mutual information i x y describes the amount of information transmitted or shared between two random variables which is represented as 5 i x y i 1 n j 1 m p i j log p i j p i p j where pi pj are the probabilities of occurrence of xi and y j i 1 2 n j 1 2 m mutual information can also be obtained as follows 6 i x y h x h y h x y partial mutual information is used for finer definitions of causality among variables i x y z denotes the information transfer from y to x excluding the effect of z the information transfer from y to x alone which can be obtained as 7 i x y z h x z h x y z with respect to the multivariate case total correlation tc is usually used to describe the amount of shared information between three or more variables 8 t c x 1 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x n multivariate transinformation mt is a measure of information transfer when three or more variables are considered in the system to understand multivariate transinformation more directly eq 9 expresses it with the chain rule and each partial piece of mutual information i xi y x 1 x i 1 denotes the information contribution of each variable xi to the targeted variable y under the given information from x 1 x 2 x i 1 9 m t x 1 x 2 x m y i 1 m i x i y x 1 x i 1 where m is the number of variables in addition multivariate transinformation can be obtained from joint entropy and marginal entropy as 10 m t x 1 x 2 x m y h x 1 x 2 x m h y h x 1 x 2 x m y a binning estimator is widely used for estimating mutual information for a bivariate case a contingency table with a fixed bin width or a fixed number of classes is often used to estimate the joint probability of bivariate variables however the choice of bin width class interval is not uniquely determined and estimation results are sensitive to bin width markus et al 2003 li et al 2012 alfonso et al 2014 fahle et al 2015 keum and coulibaly 2017 wang et al 2018 we determined the class interval following sturges 1926 as follows 11 n c 1 lo g 2 n o b s where nc is the number of classes and nobs is the number of observations for the variable with the fixed bin size the probability p x for each bin is estimated by the corresponding relative frequency of the occurrence of sample values in the bin for bivariate variables a contingency table is often applied to compute the joint probability p x y entropy is calculated based on the logarithm function the logarithm base in this study is 2 and then the unit is bits the steps for implementing the binning estimator to calculate entropy are provided in the appendix for more details readers can also refer to li et al 2012 2 2 multi objective optimization previous studies on multi objective rainfall network design generally consider only rainfall data volkmann et al 2010 xu et al 2015 the first integrated network design framework proposed by keum and coulibaly 2017 related precipitation and streamflow while the objectives were all based on information measures to design a rainfall network for streamflow prediction we combine the previous criteria and promote a multi objective optimization framework that has two objectives based on entropy and one objective based on rainfall estimation performance the first objective is to minimize the overlapping information between different rainfall stations which helps obtain the least information redundancy for the selected station set the total correlation tc is used to quantify the information redundancy the second objective is to maximize the information transfer between input rainfall and output streamflow which intends to select the most relevant set of rainfall stations for the rainfall runoff model multivariate transinformation mt is used as a measure of information transfer from rainfall stations to hydrometric stations for the network design scheme the third objective is to minimize the residual variance compared to the measured data variance with the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc these three objectives are formulated as 12 m i n t c x 1 x 2 x n m a x m t x 1 x 2 x n q m a x n s c 1 t 1 t x t p t 2 t 1 t p t p 2 subject to n 1 2 n where i and j i 1 2 n j 1 2 n i j are the indices of rainfall stations n is the number of selected stations n is the total number of candidate rainfall stations t is the time index of the observed day t is the total length of the observed period xt is the estimated areal mean rainfall on the t th day pt is the true areal mean rainfall on the t th day p is the average of mean rainfall over the observation period and q is the targeted hydrometric station for prediction the method we proposed is referred to as wang s method for clarity here we also provide two multi objective optimization methods by xu et al 2015 referred to as xu s method and keum and coulibaly 2017 referred to as kc s method for comparison xu s method is described as 13 m i n i i 1 n 1 j i 1 n i x i x j c d 2 m i n p b i a s t 1 t x t p t t 1 t p t m a x n s c 1 t 1 t x t p t 2 t 1 t p t p 2 subject to n 1 2 n kc s method is described as 14 m a x h x 1 x 2 x n q m i n t c x 1 x 2 x n q m a x h q x 1 x 2 x n subject to n 1 2 n in general the multi objective optimization problem does not yield a unique solution that simultaneously optimizes each objective pareto 1964 instead it is necessary to obtain a pareto set of solutions that achieve a compromise between different objective functions having said that moving from one solution to another will result in the improvement of at least one objective while causing the loss in at least one other since it is not realistic to compare all combinations of rainfall stations e g there are 67 108 863 combinations of different numbers of stations from the 26 total stations the multi objective optimization is herein realized by a genetic algorithm ga the genetic algorithm is a global optimization technique that is inspired by the field of biology this technique has been widely used for optimization problems due to its easy implementation and flexibility in the organization of objectives the multi objective optimization problem is solved using an elitist non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii by deb et al 2002 the convergence of the solutions is indicated with hypervolume bader and zitzler 2011 bode et al 2019 for more details on nsga ii the reader should refer to deb and agrawal 1994 and deb et al 2002 2 3 artificial neural network model artificial neural network ann models have been widely applied in the fields of hydrology and water resources hsu et al 1995 maier and dandy 2000 anctil et al 2006 a review by maier et al 2010 discussed the development of neural networks for the prediction of water resource variables and the results indicated that the vast majority of studies focused on flow prediction the advantage of an artificial neural network model lies in its powerful ability to address nonlinear problems in contrast to traditional hydrological models artificial neural network models have no need for detailed data to construct the model multilayer perceptrons mlp of neural networks are one of the most widely used artificial neural network approaches in hydrological forecasts maier et al 2010 in our study we used a three layer one input layer one hidden layer and one output layer mlp neural network using the backpropagation bp algorithm with hyperbolic tangent sigmoid as an activation function and the levenberg marquardt algorithm as a training function for model training and streamflow prediction input variables include mean areal rainfall from the selected set of rainfall stations and streamflow data from hydrometric stations and the one output variable is streamflow at the outlet station it is noted that time lag is considered in this study because the concentration time can be longer than one day therefore mutual information and correlation coefficients are used to determine the most suitable time lags and consequent rainfall and streamflow input for building the ann model two indices are adopted to evaluate model performance the first index is nash sutcliffe efficiency nse to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 defined as 15 nse 1 t 1 n q o b s t q p r e d t 2 t 1 n q o b s t q o b s 2 where time step t 1 2 n qobs is the observed streamflow qpred is the predicted streamflow and q o b s is the mean value of observed streamflow during the study period nse is equal to 1 when a perfect fit between observed and predicted streamflow is reached the second index is root mean square error rmse with regard to its ability to maintain the water balance and a low rmse indicates a better prediction defined as 16 rmse 1 n t 1 n q o b s t q p r e d t 2 2 4 multi objective design of the rainfall network

streamflow forecasting using multi objective optimization and rainfall runoff model is as follows 1 perform multim objective optimization moo of the rainfall network using a genetic algorithm with kc s xu s and wang s methods 2 estimate the areal mean rainfall from the optimized combination of rainfall stations 3 obtain streamflow data from hydrometric stations 4 train an ann model for each moo solution with rainfall and streamflow data from 2 and 3 and use the model for streamflow simulation 5 evaluate streamflow simulation performance based on two indices nse and rmse in step 2 the temporal mean rainfall is calculated from the optimized combination of rainfall stations on a single day then we obtain the areal mean rainfall time series over a five year period therefore the rainfall and streamflow data used for the artificial neural network model are based on the daily scale and the concentration duration and time lag effect will be further discussed in sections 3 2 and 4 1 since an ann model is trained for a specific rainfall network station combination the ann model is re trained every time a new rainfall network is found 3 study area and data description 3 1 wei river basin the wei river is the largest tributary of the yellow river and originates in weiyuan county of gansu province flowing through gansu ningxia shaanxi and other provinces from west to east the total length of the mainstream is 818 km and the total area of the wei river basin is 134 800 km2 accounting for 18 of the total area of the yellow river basin the seasonal variation in runoff is significant for the wei river with the largest runoff in autumn accounting for 38 40 of the annual runoff the inter annual variation in runoff for the mainstream of the wei river is relatively small and the variation coefficient is approximately 0 30 to 0 35 the outlet hydrometric station huaxian station sh is important for streamflow monitoring and flood forecasting fig 2 floods mainly come from the upstream of xianyang sx jing river and the tributaries between xianyang and huaxian floods usually occur from july to october every year and account for approximately 60 8 of the total annual runoff the upstream of xianyang the jing river and the tributaries between xianyang and huaxian contribute 61 8 18 2 and 20 respectively to the runoff at the huaxian station for this we also adopted streamflow from three stations the weijiabao station sw xianyang station sx and lintong station sl for streamflow prediction at the huaxian station sh table 1 provides the basic information and statistical properties of the four hydrometric stations 3 2 data description to obtain rainfall data for the mean areal rainfall estimate the chinese ground based 0 5 0 5 grid dataset v2 0 for daily precipitation was used to determine potential rainfall stations the data source consists of two parts one is daily precipitation data collected from national stations base stations and general stations by the national meteorological information center since 1961 and the other is digital elevation model dem data which are the resampling production of gtopo30 data with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 longitude and latitude by the thin plate spline tps interpolation method in anusplin software after extracting daily precipitation data mm from the grid dataset in the study area 26 potential rainfall stations inside the study area were chosen to constitute the rainfall network for the study area in the wei river basin as shown by green circles in fig 2 daily streamflow data m3 s from four stations sw sx sl sh from 2008 to 2012 were used for rainfall runoff model construction and streamflow prediction specifically daily rainfall and streamflow data from 2008 to 2011 were used for neural network training and data from 2011 to 2012 were used for validation streamflow prediction the mean maximum and minimum streamflow in lintong and huaxian were much larger than the streamflow at weijiabao and xianyang table 1 this result occurred because the jing river flows into the wei river in the upper reaches of the lin tong station and therefore brings more streamflow downstream due to the intense rainfall in the wei river basin three floods appeared between the weijiabao station and huaxian station in september 2011 the area between weijiabao and huaxian experienced three intense rainfall events september 5th 7th september 12th and september 16th 18th and the total amount of precipitation ranged from 230 to 432 mm the largest flood peak since 1981 5050 m3 s 19 12 september 20th 2011 occurred at the huaxian station which resulted in great risks to human life and property the water level also reached 342 7 m and the flood process duration was 33 2 h in total 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatio temporal correlation and dependence between stations to determine the concentration time for the hydrometric station we compared the correlations between three hydrometric stations sw sx sl and the huaxian station sh using correlation coefficients and mutual information according to the description of the three flood processes in 2011 we found that the flood propagation time lasted no more than three days therefore the time lag was chosen to vary from 0 to 3 days the highest values of the correlation coefficient and mutual information are marked in table 2 both the correlation coefficient and mutual information confirm that the best time lag for the weijiabao station was two days that for the xianyang station was one day and that for the lintong station was one day therefore the streamflow series for the specific hydrometric stations in further discussions were selected as two days ahead for sw and one day ahead for sx and sl similarly correlations with different time lags were investigated for the different rainfall stations and the huaxian station as shown in fig 3 the highest correlation coefficient appeared when the time lag was three days while mutual information did not show a clear pattern for the different candidate rainfall stations however the mutual information was still among or very close to the highest value when the time lag was three days since one of the inputs for the rainfall runoff model is the areal mean rainfall it is necessary to make it consistent for all stations to simplify the problem we chose a time lag of three days for the correlation between rainfall stations and hydrometric stations sh 4 2 comparison between different multi objective design methods for the multi objective design of the rainfall network the initial parameters of the genetic algorithm were set as 200 populations and 200 generations the hypervolume index under different generations is shown in fig 4 it can be observed that the hypervolume tended to be stable for three multi objective optimization tasks before 50 generations which represented that the solutions for the following generations from the genetic algorithm were among the best known pareto approximation set the hypervolume indicates that the initial generation set is enough to be converged therefore the last generation after 200 nsga ii runs was obtained as the pareto solutions the frequencies of the selected numbers of stations from the three multi objective methods are provided in table 3 the sum of each column is 200 pareto solutions for the different optimization methods it is shown that under kc s and wang s method mostly 1 to 5 stations or 6 to 10 stations in the wei river basin were selected for the rainfall network combination while more stations were selected for xu s optimization because most combinations contained 16 to 20 stations or even more this result can be explained by the fact that xu s optimization objectives place more focus on the rainfall estimates in such cases more stations would be selected by xu s method because the rainfall estimation generally became more accurate with an increase in the rainfall network density furthermore the selection frequencies of the different rainfall stations under three multi objective frameworks in the wei river basin are shown in fig 5 the selection frequencies of the different rainfall stations were similar for kc s and wang methods fig 5a and c while xu s method showed a distinct pattern in the spatial distribution fig 5b a possible reason for this discrepancy is that the differences are related to the optimization objectives as mentioned before as two of the objectives in xu s method tend to achieve better estimates of areal mean rainfall a higher selection frequency was observed for most stations however kc s method and wang s method put more focus on the information efficiency resulting in sparser and more dispersed selected stations in addition certain stations located upstream no 2 midstream no 14 and downstream no 26 were frequently selected for the optimized networks from kc s method for the results of wang s method proposed in this study rainfall stations close to the huaxian station were more frequently selected no 24 and 26 as pareto solutions provide many possible configurations for network optimization the practical design generally calls for a single solution the spatial distribution of the frequency map indicates the most important stations and provides guidance for decision support 4 3 pareto solutions and optimal networks before discussing the pareto optimal networks we first investigated the variation trends of the three objectives wang s method with an increasing number of stations selected in the network fig 6 shows the trends of tc mt and nsc under 100 random combinations for different numbers of stations in the rainfall network the total correlation consistently increased with increasing numbers of stations added to the network fig 6a however multivariate transinformation increased before ten stations were added and then gradually stabilized fig 6b nsc showed a similar pattern with the saturated value achieved even when five or fewer stations were in the rainfall network fig 6c from the results the correlation between the three objectives and the number of stations in the rainfall network can be first explored the number of stations indeed affected the objective function values while the configuration impact should also not be ignored as seen in fig 6c a relatively wide range of trend lines reflected that even with only five or fewer stations in the network a very different nsc could be achieved with different station combinations the shape of the three dimensional pareto fronts is given in fig 7 a specifically four cases were chosen from the pareto solution sets to explore the individual objectives more closely case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 the first three cases each achieved the best values for the three optimization objectives minimize tc maximize mt and maximize nsc and the fourth case was around the median value for the three objectives the two dimensional projections of objective function pairs mt tc projection nsc mt projection and nsc tc projection are also shown in fig 7b 7c and 7d fig 7 shows that case 2 and case 3 were very close to and even overlapped each other while case 1 was far away from them this finding reflected that the second and third objectives may not conflict with each other as a result most of the solutions were located in the upper right corner of fig 7c the shapes of the other two objective function pairs followed the typical pareto fronts see fig 7b and 7d among all solutions case 4had considerable multivariate transinformation and nsc while the value of total correlation was much lower than that for case 2 and case 3 table 4 shows the details of four cases with the objective function values and number of stations it is confirmed that the values of multivariate transinformation and nsc were very similar for cases 2 and 3 case 1 yielded only 2 51 bits of total correlation which was much lower than that yielded by case 2 and case 3 in addition the multivariate transinformation for case 1 was almost half of that for the other cases meanwhile the selected number of stations was only three stations for case 1 which explained the low information redundancy and low information transfer in contrast cases 2 and 3 selected more stations 21 stations however case 4 selected only 8 stations while the information transfer achieved almost the same level as that for case 2 and case 3 this finding is also consistent with the results in fig 6 that the multivariate transinformation would gradually reach a stable value after a certain number of stations are included in the network meanwhile different spatial distributions of the network configuration under the four optimized cases are also shown in fig 8 we find that when fewer rainfall stations were selected most of them were distributed upstream and downstream of the wei river case 1 as the number of stations gradually increased more rainfall stations in the middle of the river may be included in the network 4 4 evaluation of optimal networks in rainfall runoff models to evaluate the performance of rainfall networks for accurate streamflow prediction we used the areal mean rainfall estimated by the optimized network as part of the input to the ann model the areal mean rainfall from three days ahead from different station combinations together with the streamflow records from the four hydrometric stations streamflow from two days ahead for sw streamflow from one day ahead for sx sl and sh were used in the ann model for streamflow simulation rainfall estimates of the optimized networks from kc s and xu s method were also adopted for streamflow prediction and the results were compared we used 200 pareto solutions of the network configurations from the different optimization methods and ran the ann model 10 times with the same data input and same ann structure and parameters for each solution to reduce the uncertainty in the ann training process therefore we obtained 2000 samples of simulation performance for the three methods in addition the four cases discussed in section 4 3 were also used as rainfall inputs for the ann model we ran the ann model separately 2000 times with each case rainfall input from the station combination of that case and streamflow records from four hydrometric stations and obtain the same sample number as three methods the median and mean values of nse and rmse for 2000 samples are shown in fig 9 although different multi objective optimization methods yielded different pareto solutions the results for the two indices were similar for the different optimization results nevertheless kc s method and case 4 led to a slightly worse performance for streamflow prediction with relatively low nse and high rmse kc s method selected fewer stations with worse performance while xu s method achieved the best simulation performance with more stations in the pareto solutions generally wang s method showed median nse and rmse performance compared with kc s method and xu s method the differences between kc s xu s and wang s method reveal that wang s method could achieve a balance between network efficiency number of stations and streamflow simulation performance it should also be noted that the median and mean nse and rmse were not necessarily relevant to the number of selected stations for instance only three stations were selected in case 1 but the median and mean values of nse and rmse were better than those for case 4 with eight stations included in the network to illustrate the streamflow prediction results we generated hydrographs using the ann model to visualize the streamflow simulation fig 10 the hydrograph only used the simulation results from four cases since we already provided the spatial configurations of the rainfall networks the peak flow usually occurred in september for the wei river basin which should be of great concern in the flash flood forecasts therefore we specifically present the streamflow prediction results from july 1st 2011 to october 31st 2011 as serious flood processes were recorded during this period different combinations showed no evident differences in the streamflow simulation results generally networks of different configurations from multi objective optimization can describe and capture the temporal variations in streamflow characteristics under a certain number of simulations fig 10a 10b 10c and 10d from the integrated results fig 10e the predicted peak streamflow can be well estimated for the different optimized networks compared with the observed streamflow as the observed streamflow was generally within the simulation bands however the simulation could either overestimate or underestimate the streamflow therefore it is a better choice to perform the simulation many times to obtain the uncertainty band and especially avoid the underestimation of the peak flow as the effect of averaging the rainfall estimate could smooth the variation in the different networks for streamflow simulation we did not expect significant differences between the four cases in fig 10 meanwhile the influence of the optimization method on streamflow prediction could be weakened since the rainfall runoff process is complex and many factors can influence the streamflow simulation models and results nevertheless the results provide guidance for streamflow prediction with respect to rainfall input when different numbers of rainfall stations are included in the rainfall network 5 conclusion we proposed a multi objective rainfall network design method based on information theory and applied it to the wei river basin in china the rainfall network design can be viewed as the input for a rainfall runoff model as it was intended to consider streamflow data at the outlet hydrometric station the method adopts total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer and nsc as an indicator of rainfall estimation performance meanwhile time lags between different stations both rainfall stations and hydrometric stations and target hydrometric stations were considered redundant information between rainfall stations varied significantly with the increasing number of stations while the information delivered from rainfall stations to the target hydrometric station gradually stabilized the streamflow simulations from the ann model were compared with different optimization methods generally the proposed method balanced the network efficiency and streamflow simulation performance with fewer selected stations than xu s method but better simulation results than kc s method the hydrographs during the flood process also confirmed the feasibility of the rainfall network for streamflow simulation to conclude the combination of rainfall network design with downstream streamflow simulations was shown to be promising meanwhile the design framework is flexible because other complicated rainfall runoff models can be adopted for more accurate outlet streamflow predictions the proposed design method can be further conducted on a smaller catchment scale with a tighter correlation between upstream rainfall and downstream streamflow user specific objectives can also be added to the network design process for model

549,we investigate the interaction of strongly non linear internal solitary waves isws with boundaries having different slopes by means of high resolution 3d large eddy simulations les releasing a volume of fresh water into a stratified ambient fluid three different breaking mechanisms are produced plunging collapsing and surging breakers the different shoaling dynamics affect the isw evolution over the sloping boundary inducing different effects on the bottom in order to investigate the effects of the isw breaking on the inclined surface we calculate the bed shear stress and estimate the local flux of sediments entrained from the bed we analyze the relationship between the breaking criteria and the related effects on the sloping surface although plunging breakers are expected to induce significant effects within the fluid causing larger amount of mixing and fluid entrainment the effects on the bottom are totally opposite the collapsing breaker mechanism indeed generates boundary layer separation which in turn induces whirling instabilities results show that the isw interaction with the inclined surface occurs in its close proximity for collapsing breaker mechanism which explains why the largest bed shear stresses and sediment re suspension are predicted in the simulation where a collapsing breaker mechanism is observed keywords breaking solitary waves bed shear stress sediment entrainment potential numerical simulations laboratory experiments 1 introduction in density stratified lakes and the coastal ocean often schematized as a double layer fluid system with different uniform densities garrett 2003 internal solitary waves are commonly observed traveling hundreds of kilometers osborne and burch 1980 valerio et al 2012 guyennon et al 2014 they can slowly interact with a flat bottom into shallower waters or more quickly in presence of sloping topographies field observations numerical simulations and laboratory experiments showed that the interaction between isws and the continental or near shore slope may induce their shoaling and breaking alpers and salusti 1983 lemckert et al 2004 sutherland and ivey 2013 droghei et al 2016 producing mixing and bed material motion sutherland and ivey 2013 meyer et al 2015 la forgia et al 2018a 2018b in particular the interaction between isws with the near shore slope can cause their shoaling and then breaking those processes induce mixing and the friction velocities at the bottom which could cause bed material re suspension and re distribution bogucki et al 1997 quaresma et al 2007 the bottom shear stress induced by isws can be sufficient to mobilize sediment within the bottom boundary layer as occurring for other stratified flows zordan et al 2018 kyrousi et al 2018 cuthbertson et al 2011 la forgia et al 2019 however wave destabilization during shoaling and subsequent turbulence are required to efficiently let sediments cross the boundary layer and reach the water column boegman and ivey 2009 moreover turbulent vortices produced during shoaling could suspend and transport sediment up the slope as the boluses decay large particles may be deposited while finer particles may be advected offshore helfrich 1992 bourgault et al 2005 richards et al 2013 regardless of the particular breaking mechanism that could develop the shoaling and breaking evolution of an isw of depression over a uniform sloped surface is characterized by well defined successive events during the shoaling vigorous near bottom currents occur beneath the pycnocline while the isw becomes gradually asymmetric presenting a steeper rear face the bottom instability triggering the process is not necessary associated to the energy of wave induced current but rather to the increase of adverse pressure gradient in the bottom boundary layer caused by the wave steepening soontiens et al 2015 as the internal wave reaches the region in which the pycnocline intersects the sloping boundary the generation of upslope propagating bolus occurs it is composed by denser water and it has the potential to induce bottom boundary layer turbulence and re suspension sutherland and ivey 2013 the final phase of isw breaking consists of a jet of dense water flowing down slope in close proximity to the bottom this jet can produce shear instability and large overturning region an isw of depression interacting with sloped boundaries characterized by different inclinations undergoes different breaking dynamics plunging collapsing and surging breaker could develop depending on the

by different breaking mechanisms associated with shoaling isws has been widely investigated in the past michallet and ivey 1999 arthur and fringer 2014 la forgia et al 2018b moreover many authors analyzed the re suspension mechanism induced by shoaling isws however few authors investigate how the different breaking dynamics can affect the induced bed shear stress and the overall capacity of isws to entrain sediments from the bottom in the present work we extend the undrstanding of the isws breaking effects on the bottom we analyze 3 d les of differently breaking isws and we argued how different shoaling evolution may affect both the spatial and temporal bed friction velocity distribution and the potential capacity to entrain sediments from a loose bed the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model used to reproduce numerically the laboratory experiments on breaking internal solitary waves in section 3 we evaluate the shear stress induced at the sloping boundary by each breaker type in section 4 we quantify the associated sediment entrainment potential finally results discussion and concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem formulation and numerical model the breaking of lock exchange generated isws interacting with a uniform sloping boundary is investigated by 3 d large eddy simulations we analyzed three cases see table 1 characterized by different breaking mechanisms using the numerical results obtained by la forgia et al 2018b who reproduced numerically three laboratory experiments on differently breaking isws they assessed the reliability of the numerical model by comparing the results of the numerical simulations with those obtained from laboratory experiments performed as part of their research the laboratory experiments were performed in a 3 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 3 deep tank using the lock release method in a two layer stratified fluid system after the gate removal the light water confined in the lock slumped upward into the shallower fresh water ambient producing a hump shaped isw of depression the wave propagated downstream and it broke interacting with an inclined surface the domain considered in order to numerically reproduce the laboratory experiments is schematized in a horizontal vertical plane x y in fig 1 the dashed red line shows the initial pycnocline position at t 0 the ambient fluid on the left is composed by the upper layer having a uniform density ρ 1 and a thickness h 1 and a thicker lower layer with a uniform density ρ 2 ρ 1 a thicker upper layer is present on the right hand side of the domain for l x 0 x l in order to produce a displacement η 0 between the pycnoclines of the two regions a sloping boundary making an angle θ with the horizontal is present downstream to induce isw breaking in the present large eddy simulations the boussinesq approximation is employed to account for stratification effects in the present finite volume approach ooi et al 2009 borden et al 2012 the governing navier stokes and density transport equations are solved in non dimensional form the reduced gravity is g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where g 9 81 m2 is the gravitational acceleration ρ 1 ρ 2 and h 1 h 2 are respectively the initial densities and heights of the layers containing fresh water and salty water to nondimensionalize the governing equations we used the total water depth h as length scale eq 1 the normalized density ρ x y z t is given by eq 2 it ranges between 0 and 1 corresponding to the initial density of the light and salty layers respectively 1 h h 1 h 2 2 ρ x y z t ρ x y z t ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 the corresponding reynolds number is r e u b h ν where ν is the molecular viscosity and u b g h is the buoyancy velocity the conservative form of the navier stokes equations are integrated in time using a semi implicit iterative method and are discretized in space using second order central schemes this minimizes numerical dissipation and damping of the resolved eddies in the simulations which is critical for accurate results using les the pressure poisson equation is solved using multigrid the numerical algorithm is second order accurate in both space and time a conserved scalar equation is solved for the non dimensional density the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme is used to discretize the advective term in the equation for the nondimensional density the subgrid scale viscosity and the subgrid scale diffusivity are calculated using the dynamic smagorinsky model pierce and moin 2001 la forgia et al 2018b discusses in details the advantages of using the dynamic smagorinsky model for flows that contain regions of non turbulent flow e g bores propagating in still fluid it also contains validation for flows investigated in this paper for all three cases the numerical simulations predicted the formation of an isw with geometric and kinematic features i e amplitude wavelength and celerity very close to those observed in the corresponding experiments also the resulting reflected isws features are very close to those obtained experimentally we checked that both their celerity and their instantaneous location were similar with those measured from the experiments see for example fig 4 in la forgia et al 2018b this detail is crucial to assure that the amount of energy dissipated during each wave breaking event is in good agreement between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations additional validation and comparison with shallow water theory for flows e g bores intrusion currents developing into a multi layer stratified environment and for bottom propagating currents over a sloped surface are discussed in borden et al 2012 ooi et al 2007 tokyay and constantinescu 2015 steenhauer et al 2017 such simulations were used in several studies to discuss bed friction velocity distributions and capacity of the flow to entrain sediment tokyay et al 2011 2012 2014 the level of mesh refinement and physical reynolds numbers were comparable to those of the simulations discussed in the present paper the main geometrical variables are defined in fig 1 that shows the flow in a horizontal vertical x y plane before the lock gate is removed t 0 and the bore starts forming at t 0 the flow was assumed to be at rest and ρ was set equal to 1 in the region containing the saltier fluid and equal to 0 in the region containing ambient lighter fluid the domain is divided in two regions the ambient fluid for 0 x l x 0 and the lock region for l x 0 x x 0 la forgia et al 2018b proved that the transfer of vertical shear stress induced by the gate removal during the laboratory experiments can be considered negligible the solid boundaries including the sloped surface were treated as no slip surfaces while the free surface was treated as a shear free boundary in many theoretical studies the rigid lid approximation is typically used to impose the boundary condition on the free surface for flow respecting the boussinesq approximation e g helfrich and melville 2006 for a relatively small density difference as the one adopted for our cases the surface displacement is negligible and the resulting internal displacements are approximately equal to the ones modeled with the rigid lid approximation for this reason the internal displacements observed experimentally are very close to those predicted by less the flow is assumed to be homogeneous in the spanwise direction thus periodic boundary conditions were imposed in this direction a zero normal gradient boundary condition was used for the nondimensional density at all solid and shear free boundaries the molecular schmidt number was set to 100 corresponding to saline water about 70 million cells were used to discretize the computational domain the grid spacing in all three directions was around 0 008h a constant time step of 0 002h ub was used the solution for the analyzed cases was checked to be grid independent la forgia et al 2018b gives more details on how the simulations were set up grid resolution and the choice of the schmidt number given that the flow is homogeneous in the spanwise direction for each variable one can define the spanwise averaged value which is denoted as from numerical results we estimated the isw main features fig 1 the wave amplitude aw the wavelength lw and the wave celerity cw i e the first derivative of the trough s position we also evaluated the wave surface sw and the characteristic wavelength λw defined as 3 λ w 1 a w η x d x s w a w where η x is the vertical displacement of the pycnocline compared to its initial position in the present study we discuss three experiments for which a plunging case 1 a collapsing case 2 and a surging breaker case 3 were observed respectively table 1 shows the main parameters of analyzed cases following la forgia et al 2018b s approach we estimated the reynolds wave number defined as 4 r e w a w c 0 ν where c 0 g h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 is the linear wave phase speed defined as in sutherland and ivey 2013 for the three cases the inferred wave reynolds numbers are r e w 2 25 10 3 case 1 r e w 3 66 10 3 case 2 r e w 4 91 10 3 case 3 in order to distinguish the different breaking mechanisms we used the iribarren number defined as the ratio between the topographic slope s b t a n θ and the wave slope aw λw 5 i r s b a w λ w numerical results are shown by using the nondimensional time scale t λ w a w where t is 2 14 s 3 31 s and 2 62 s in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively to be able to compare the interaction of the isw with the sloped surface among the different cases the time in each simulation t is specified with respect to the time t 0 at which the horizontal velocity in the upper layer starts to decrease because of the presence of the sloping boundary t 0 22 1 s 17 0 s and 16 0 s for case 1 2 and 3 respectively as the isws characteristics are fairly constant after they has formed but before it starts interacting with the sloped surface a proper comparison of the different cases should be done with respect to the time each isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary the new dimensional time scale is t t t 0 in nondimensional form t t t t 0 t where t is measured with respect to the time at which the lock gate is removed t t 0 3 bed shear stress over the sloping boundaries one of the advantages of 3 d eddy resolving simulations is that they allow estimating the bed friction velocity distributions on the sloped boundary once the isw starts interacting with this surface this is important given that the bed friction velocity is the main variable affecting the flux of sediment entrained from the sloped boundary in the case of a loose bed the nondimensional distributions of the bed friction velocity uτ ub at relevant times after the isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary are discussed for the plunging collapsing and surging cases in figs 2 4 respectively the bed friction velocity distribution is shown along the x axis see fig 1 the maximum values of uτ ub observed for the three cases are reported in table 2 to facilitate understanding the effect of the interaction between the isw and the sloped boundary on the bed friction velocity distributions the nondimensional spanwise averaged density field and the 3 d interface ρ 0 5 over the sloped surface are also shown in figs 2 4 fig 2 shows that as the isw reaches the sloped boundary a large amplification of the bed shear stress occurs in the plunging case because of the thin layer of salty water flow pushed down the incline by the approaching wave for example a region of high bed friction velocity amplification is observed for 0 4 x h 1 2 at t t 1 78 in fig 2a interestingly the bed shear stress distribution within this region is close to uniform in the spanwise direction indicating the thin layer of heavier fluid close to the sloped boundary contains negligible turbulence this is confirmed by the distribution of the nondimensional density at the same time that shows basically no mixing at the interface between the two layers until x h 1 2 in that region the strongly coherent kelvin helmholtz kh billows forming at the back of the isw start interacting with the inclined boundary consistent with this the 3 d interface also visualized in fig 2a at t t 1 78 shows only weak disturbances developing for x h 2 large scale disturbances in both the streamwise and spanwise directions develop behind the crest of the wave due to the shedding of kh vortices and their subsequent 3 d stretching analysis of the spanwise averaged distributions of bed friction velocity in fig 6a confirms that the largest levels of uτ ub are observed around t t 1 78 beneath the thin layer of accelerating heavier fluid trapped between the isw and the sloped boundary and also in the region where the large interfacial kh billows penetrate until close to the sloped boundary once the rear edge of the isw overturns lots of turbulence is generated along the sloped boundary this is the main reason why the distributions of uτ ub become very irregular in the spanwise direction for t t 2 especially in the region containing mixed fluid that is situated in the immediate vicinity of the boundary see fig 2b d at t t 2 46 the vorticity field shows a large region characterized by counterclockwise overturning 1 2 x h 2 2 whose vertical extent goes from the initial pycnocline depth up to the inclined surface see fig 5 a at a later stage at t t 3 17 the interface displays a region of high amplitude 2 d disturbances between the location where the bottom of the layer of light unmixed fluid is situated over the sloped boundary x h 0 6 and the bottom part of the region containing mixed fluid over the same boundary x h 1 6 this confirms that the breaking of the isw as it hits the sloped boundary generates highly 3 d eddies and lots of mixing leonardi et al 2018 the peak bed friction velocities at t t 3 17 are observed around x h 0 5 and 1 5 where the flow accelerates after the momentum changes direction from being oriented parallel to the streamwise direction to being oriented down of the sloped boundary a smaller but clear amplification of uτ ub occurs inside the layer of lighter fluid because some of the incoming fluid in the isw is pushed against the incline toward the top corner of the channel the presence of energetic 3 d eddies inside the mixed layer away from the region where this layer is in direct contact with the sloped boundary explains the relatively strong disturbances of uτ ub in the spanwise direction for 2 x h 2 7 at t t 3 17 in fig 2b the largest bed friction velocities are observed near the top and bottom boundaries of the layer of mixed fluid as it comes into contact with the sloped boundary see also fig 6a this is also observed at subsequent times e g t t 4 76 and t t 7 93 in fig 2c and d after the gravity current containing saltier water forms and the reflected wave starts moving away from the sloped boundary as the gravity current advances against the bed slope the peaks of uτ ub and the degree of non uniformity of the bed friction velocity distribution in the spanwise direction decreases this is also due to the gradual loss of coherence of the larger eddies generated inside the mixed layer during the time the incoming wave hits the sloped boundary the decay of the larger scale turbulence is confirmed by the decay of the 3 d disturbances on the surface of the ρ 0 5 isopycnal for t t 3 17 similar to the plunging case the largest amplification of the bed shear stress in the collapsing case occurs a short time after the isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary and starts displacing the heavier fluid downwards in the vicinity of the sloped boundary see distributions of bed friction velocity at t t 1 17 in fig 3a and b at these early times of interaction of the isw with the sloped boundary there is negligible large scale turbulence generated in the flow which explains why the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction the flow in the immediate vicinity of the sloped surface remains laminar and the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction it is only after the bolus forms t t 1 5 that the distributions of uτ ub become nonuniform in the spanwise direction the bolus is clearly visible by the velocity vectors that are superimposed on the vorticity field at t t 2 05 see fig 5b as the gravity current associated to the formation of the bolus moves upwards and the wave reflection at the sloped boundary is complete large scale 3 d turbulent eddies start developing inside the mixed layer e g see also interface deformations for t t 3 in fig 3 and the bed friction velocity distributions become highly nonuniform beneath and some distance behind the front of the gravity current at these times the largest values of uτ ub are observed around the location of the front of the gravity current interestingly the uτ ub in the region where the thin layer of mixed fluid comes into contact with the sloped boundary remain high even after the end of the breaking event e g at t t 7 76 in fig 3d over the incline the position at which the maximum velocity occurs is expected to move upstream until the consequent deceleration in the adverse pressure gradient region becomes strong enough to induce the boundary layer separation as for the plunging case the turbulence inside the mixed layer and the degree of nonuniformity of uτ ub in the spanwise direction decays after the gravity current dissipates and the mixed layer becomes close to horizontal near the sloped boundary similar to the collapsing case large values of uτ ub in the surging case occur as the front of the isw approaches the sloped boundary t t 0 4 fig 4a and c and the bolus forms fig 4b and c as for the previous cases the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction before the formation of the bolus despite the fact that large scale instabilities develop on the rear side of the approaching wave e g see ρ 0 5 interface at t t 0 4 in fig 4a as opposed to the other cases where the region of high uτ ub over the sloped boundary approximately corresponded to the extent of the mixed layer over the same boundary in the surging case the region of high uτ ub penetrates into the regions containing unmixed fluid above and below the thin mixing layer before the bolus forms the region of high uτ ub extends only beneath the mixed layer e g for x h 1 5 in fig 4a where the flow accelerates as the crest of the approaching wave moves toward the sloped boundary however the formation of the bolus induces the formation of 3 d eddies some of them being advected into the layer containing light unmixed fluid close to the surface of the sloped boundary fig 4b this explains the large fluctuations of uτ ub in the spanwise direction starting around x h 0 5 at t t 1 07 moreover at t t 1 07 the region containing the peaks of uτ ub starts at x h 1 1 way above the mixed layer which is situated at x h 1 5 and extends until x h 2 1 way inside the layer containing heavier fluid as for the other cases once the upsloping gravity current forms the largest values of uτ ub are recorded beneath the front of the current until close to the time when the current dissipates fig 4c and d the gravity current induces positive vorticity in the vicinity of the bottom see fig 5c as the current dissipates and the mixing layer becomes close to horizontal away from the sloped boundary the flow starts relaminarizing e g see ρ 0 5 interface at t t 8 6 in fig 4d and the distributions of uτ ub over the sloped boundary become more uniform in the spanwise direction see fig 4c and d as for the collapsing case some entrainment can occur around the region where the mixed layer comes into contact with the sloped boundary a long time after the wave has reflected e g see distribution of uτ ub near x h 0 3 at t t 8 6 in fig 4d interestingly the spanwise averaged bed friction velocity shows a spatial distribution is initially continuous over the sloping boundary in the region below the pycnocline at t t 0 4 in fig 6c assuming relatively large values and presenting its maximum approximately in the middle of the sloping surface at a later stage as the first instabilities develop and in particular immediately after the generation of the gravity current the bed shear velocity distribution becomes more irregular and a clear peak is observed where the instabilities induced by the wave breaking starts to develop at t t 1 07 in fig 6c as the gravity current flows up slope for t t 2 the friction velocity decreases and appears to be more uniformly distributed interestingly the flow instabilities associated with each breaking mechanism have a different influence on the spanwise nonuniformity of the bed friction velocities that measures the turbulence intensity effects on the bed shear stress in a first approximation this effect can be quantified by the standard deviation of the bed friction velocity in particular for each case we investigated the evolution of the standard deviation of bed friction velocity contours over the sloping boundary at different times see dashed lines in fig 6 as the wave is approaching to the sloping boundary only for the plunging case we observed a significant variation of tho instantaneous bed friction velocity this is consistent with the large edge overturning occurring before the wave directly engaged with the inclined surface fig 6a at t t 1 78 at the following times shown in fig 6a the standard deviation remains relatively large in response of tridimensional turbulent instabilities developing during the breaking event fig 6a at t t 3 the collapsing breaker is characterized instead by a lower lateral variability of the bed friction velocity during the entire breaking event this is probably due to the fact that the instability induced by the boundary layer separation occurs in a localized region in the case of the surging breaker the turbulent instabilities generated at the bottom of the gravity current moving against the bed slope generate a large variation of the bed friction velocity along the spanwise direction 4 sediment entrainment potential of an isw interacting with a sloped surface one interesting question is how the differences in the bed friction velocity distributions during the different stages of the evolution of the isw affects its overall capacity to entrain sediment from the sloped boundary various semi empirical models are available to estimate the instantaneous flux of sediment entrained from the bed by a turbulent overflow most of these models assume that the sediment flux is proportional to uτ φ or to u τ 2 u τ c 2 φ 2 where the former is commonly used for live bed scour conditions e g φ 3 in the meyer peter and muller 1948 formula and the latter is generally used for clear water scour conditions e g van rijn 1984 formula where uτc is the critical bed friction velocity for example van rijn 1984 formula eq 6 assumes that the local pick up rate p is proportional to u τ 2 u τ c 2 φ 2 with φ 3 in regions where uτ uτc 6 p 0 00033 u τ 2 u τ c 2 u τ c 2 1 5 ρ p ρ 1 0 6 g 0 6 d 0 8 ν 2 where p is expressed in units of volumetric flux per unit area and time ρ is the density of water and ρp is the density of the sediment particles of diameter d in the following simplified analysis one will assume that the flux of sediment entrained from the bed at a certain location is not limited by the presence of a high concentration of entrained particles over that location this is a standard assumption in previous studies that simulated the transport and deposition of entrained particles carried by gravity and turbidity currents e g necker et al 2005 for a given sediment grain size the generic nondimensional expression for the local flux of entrained sediment can be expressed by a generic formula i 2 as the one proposed by van rijn 1984 7 i 2 1 h 2 u b 3 a u τ u τ c u τ 2 u τ c 2 3 2 d a where a indicates the area of the inclined channel bottom results in fig 7 show that the capacity of the isw to entrain sediment over the sloped boundary is the largest in the collapsing case not only that the peak value of i 2 is the largest in the collapsing case but also the nondimensional time interval over which i 2 assumes relatively large values is the largest in this case up to 9t t for all three cases the sediment entrainment capacity of the current peaks as the maximum downstream acceleration over the inclined surface occurs immediately before the generation of the instability though the peak values of i 2 are comparable in the plunging and surging cases the peak of i 2 occurs much faster in the plunging case and decays fairly slowly compared to the surging case previous studies of gravity currents showed that after the incipient motion of the sediment and their lift up from the bed the upward velocities induced by the turbulent eddies contribute to counteract the falling velocity of the particles maintaining the sediments into suspension kneller et al 1997 ottolenghi et al 2017b kyrousi et al 2018 for all the breaking mechanism we investigated a gravity current formed and propagated up the slope thus most sediment particles entrained from the bottom during each isw breaking event are expected to remain in suspension once they are lifted up at least during the times the gravity current continues to move upwards over the inclined boundary 5 discussion and conclusions we investigated the effects on the bottom of three different breaking internal solitary waves interacting with a uniform sloping surface we used high resolution 3 d les to reproduce three laboratory experiments in which a plunging a collapsing and a surging breaker occur respectively the plunging breaker case 1 showed the steepening of the rear face of the wave the trailing edge indeed shoaled in deeper water with respect to the leading one thus the rear face propagated relatively faster before the wave reached the sloped surface the trailing edge overturning downstream occurred the onshore overturning produces an anti clockwise vortex which develops in the internal part of the flow i e relatively far from the bottom generating a large amount of mixing at a later stage the whirling region is carried downstream by the wave until it interacts directly with the inclined bottom as the mixed region reached the sloping boundary a large amplification of the bed shear stress occurs the distributions of uτ ub become very irregular both along the incline and in the spanwise direction compared to the other cases the peak values of the bed friction velocity are observed to occur in a region relatively closer to the initial pycnocline location after the wave is partially reflected and turbulent structure dissipates inducing a gradual reduction of the bed shear stress along the incline during the overall shoaling and breaking processes the plunging breaker showed an irregular spatial distribution of the bed friction velocities nevertheless the sediment entrainment potential assumes a continuous trend characterized by a constant increase until the mixed region interacts with the incline then a clear peak occurs and finally a gradual decrease of entrained sediment was observed the overall effect at the irregular spatial temporal trend of the bed shear stress addresses a sediment re suspension process more evenly distributed with respect to the other cases as the collapsing breaker case 2 shoals the heavier fluid beneath the leading edge of the wave leaves its original position in this region as observed in laboratory experiments sutherland and ivey 2013 la forgia et al 2018a down slope velocities increase at this stage the normalized bed friction velocity is close to uniform in the spanwise direction and assumes relatively large values before the heavier fluid is completely discharged boundary layer separation occurs in the adverse pressure gradient region a separation bolus form and the downward flow diverted with a clockwise motion from this time the distributions of uτ ub becomes non uniform in the spanwise direction over the incline the position at which the maximum velocity occurs is expected to move downstream until the consequent deceleration in the adverse pressure gradient region becomes strong enough to induce the boundary layer separation at this stage the bed shear stress shows clear peaks localized in the region where turbulent structure induced by the separated flow develops after the whirling motion dissipation the breaker event evolves with the generation of a gravity current forced by the unstable density distribution over the sloping boundary the bed shear stress distribution becomes more uniform with the largest values associated to the position of the gravity current head the sediment entrainment for a collapsing breaker shows a trend composed by two peaks the first in time is the largest it precedes the formation of the instability induced by boundary layer separation the second one occurs during the gravity current propagation up slope differently from the plunging breaker for a collapsing breaker the largest amount of sediments are entrained from a localized region i e the breaking location where the maximum down slope velocities occur only at a later stage the bed shear stress appears more evenly distributed such that the expected sediment re suspension mechanism involves a larger surface a very similar behavior was observed for the surging breaker case 3 however as the wave approaches the slope the down slope deceleration of the heavier fluid assumes lower values and the associated separation flow appears less significant la forgia et al 2018b then the localized region where the maximum down slope acceleration occurs is expected to be smaller compared to the collapsing case this is proved by the relatevely lower amount of sediment entrained during the isw breaking also in this case secondary peaks were also observed to occur as the gravity current forms and starts to accelerate we show how not only mixing and water entrainment are related to the breaking criteria but also the related flux of sediments despite la forgia et al 2018b proved that the plunging breaker dissipation was largest compared to the other cases this breaking mechanism is characterized by instabilities that develop mostly in the interior part of the fluid this is the reason why the nondimensional time interval over which i 2 assumes relatively large values is the lowest with respect to the other cases our simulations show that the collapsing mechanism induces a more localized instability which develops in close proximity to the sloped surface for topographic slope larger than the wave slopes the expected sediment re suspension is more energetic inducing more localized irregularities on the loose bed the relatively small spatial scale of our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations must be taken into account when assessing the geophysical relevance of the obtained results for larger reynolds numbers the turbulence levels away from the solid boundaries are expected to be larger so the eddies generated away from the solid boundaries are expected to have a larger contribution to the total dissipation in the coastal oceans the energy loss due to the interaction isw bottom has the same order of magnitude as the one dissipated within the water column arthur and fringer 2014 thus compared to our numerical experiment results one can expect somewhat lower bed friction

549,we investigate the interaction of strongly non linear internal solitary waves isws with boundaries having different slopes by means of high resolution 3d large eddy simulations les releasing a volume of fresh water into a stratified ambient fluid three different breaking mechanisms are produced plunging collapsing and surging breakers the different shoaling dynamics affect the isw evolution over the sloping boundary inducing different effects on the bottom in order to investigate the effects of the isw breaking on the inclined surface we calculate the bed shear stress and estimate the local flux of sediments entrained from the bed we analyze the relationship between the breaking criteria and the related effects on the sloping surface although plunging breakers are expected to induce significant effects within the fluid causing larger amount of mixing and fluid entrainment the effects on the bottom are totally opposite the collapsing breaker mechanism indeed generates boundary layer separation which in turn induces whirling instabilities results show that the isw interaction with the inclined surface occurs in its close proximity for collapsing breaker mechanism which explains why the largest bed shear stresses and sediment re suspension are predicted in the simulation where a collapsing breaker mechanism is observed keywords breaking solitary waves bed shear stress sediment entrainment potential numerical simulations laboratory experiments 1 introduction in density stratified lakes and the coastal ocean often schematized as a double layer fluid system with different uniform densities garrett 2003 internal solitary waves are commonly observed traveling hundreds of kilometers osborne and burch 1980 valerio et al 2012 guyennon et al 2014 they can slowly interact with a flat bottom into shallower waters or more quickly in presence of sloping topographies field observations numerical simulations and laboratory experiments showed that the interaction between isws and the continental or near shore slope may induce their shoaling and breaking alpers and salusti 1983 lemckert et al 2004 sutherland and ivey 2013 droghei et al 2016 producing mixing and bed material motion sutherland and ivey 2013 meyer et al 2015 la forgia et al 2018a 2018b in particular the interaction between isws with the near shore slope can cause their shoaling and then breaking those processes induce mixing and the friction velocities at the bottom which could cause bed material re suspension and re distribution bogucki et al 1997 quaresma et al 2007 the bottom shear stress induced by isws can be sufficient to mobilize sediment within the bottom boundary layer as occurring for other stratified flows zordan et al 2018 kyrousi et al 2018 cuthbertson et al 2011 la forgia et al 2019 however wave destabilization during shoaling and subsequent turbulence are required to efficiently let sediments cross the boundary layer and reach the water column boegman and ivey 2009 moreover turbulent vortices produced during shoaling could suspend and transport sediment up the slope as the boluses decay large particles may be deposited while finer particles may be advected offshore helfrich 1992 bourgault et al 2005 richards et al 2013 regardless of the particular breaking mechanism that could develop the shoaling and breaking evolution of an isw of depression over a uniform sloped surface is characterized by well defined successive events during the shoaling vigorous near bottom currents occur beneath the pycnocline while the isw becomes gradually asymmetric presenting a steeper rear face the bottom instability triggering the process is not necessary associated to the energy of wave induced current but rather to the increase of adverse pressure gradient in the bottom boundary layer caused by the wave steepening soontiens et al 2015 as the internal wave reaches the region in which the pycnocline intersects the sloping boundary the generation of upslope propagating bolus occurs it is composed by denser water and it has the potential to induce bottom boundary layer turbulence and re suspension sutherland and ivey 2013 the final phase of isw breaking consists of a jet of dense water flowing down slope in close proximity to the bottom this jet can produce shear instability and large overturning region an isw of

by different breaking mechanisms associated with shoaling isws has been widely investigated in the past michallet and ivey 1999 arthur and fringer 2014 la forgia et al 2018b moreover many authors analyzed the re suspension mechanism induced by shoaling isws however few authors investigate how the different breaking dynamics can affect the induced bed shear stress and the overall capacity of isws to entrain sediments from the bottom in the present work we extend the undrstanding of the isws breaking effects on the bottom we analyze 3 d les of differently breaking isws and we argued how different shoaling evolution may affect both the spatial and temporal bed friction velocity distribution and the potential capacity to entrain sediments from a loose bed the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model used to reproduce numerically the laboratory experiments on breaking internal solitary waves in section 3 we evaluate the shear stress induced at the sloping boundary by each breaker type in section 4 we quantify the associated sediment entrainment potential finally results discussion and concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem formulation and numerical model the breaking of lock exchange generated isws interacting with a uniform sloping boundary is investigated by 3 d large eddy simulations we analyzed three cases see table 1 characterized by different breaking mechanisms using the numerical results obtained by la forgia et al 2018b who reproduced numerically three laboratory experiments on differently breaking isws they assessed the reliability of the numerical model by comparing the results of the numerical simulations with those obtained from laboratory experiments performed as part of their research the laboratory experiments were performed in a 3 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 3 deep tank using the lock release method in a two layer stratified fluid system after the gate removal the light water confined in the lock slumped upward into the shallower fresh water ambient producing a hump shaped isw of depression the wave propagated downstream and it broke interacting with an inclined surface the domain considered in order to numerically reproduce the laboratory experiments is schematized in a horizontal vertical plane x y in fig 1 the dashed red line shows the initial pycnocline position at t 0 the ambient fluid on the left is composed by the upper layer having a uniform density ρ 1 and a thickness h 1 and a thicker lower layer with a uniform density ρ 2 ρ 1 a thicker upper layer is present on the right hand side of the domain for l x 0 x l in order to produce a displacement η 0 between the pycnoclines of the two regions a sloping boundary making an angle θ with the horizontal is present downstream to induce isw breaking in the present large eddy simulations the boussinesq approximation is employed to account for stratification effects in the present finite volume approach ooi et al 2009 borden et al 2012 the governing navier stokes and density transport equations are solved in non dimensional form the reduced gravity is g g ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 where g 9 81 m2 is the gravitational acceleration ρ 1 ρ 2 and h 1 h 2 are respectively the initial densities and heights of the layers containing fresh water and salty water to nondimensionalize the governing equations we used the total water depth h as length scale eq 1 the normalized density ρ x y z t is given by eq 2 it ranges between 0 and 1 corresponding to the initial density of the light and salty layers respectively 1 h h 1 h 2 2 ρ x y z t ρ x y z t ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 1 the corresponding reynolds number is r e u b h ν where ν is the molecular viscosity and u b g h is the buoyancy velocity the conservative form of the navier stokes equations are integrated in time using a semi implicit iterative method and are discretized in space using second order central schemes this minimizes numerical dissipation and damping of the resolved eddies in the simulations which is critical for accurate results using les the pressure poisson equation is solved using multigrid the numerical algorithm is second order accurate in both space and time a conserved scalar equation is solved for the non dimensional density the quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme is used to discretize the advective term in the equation for the nondimensional density the subgrid scale viscosity and the subgrid scale diffusivity are calculated using the dynamic smagorinsky model pierce and moin 2001 la forgia et al 2018b discusses in details the advantages of using the dynamic smagorinsky model for flows that contain regions of non turbulent flow e g bores propagating in still fluid it also contains validation for flows investigated in this paper for all three cases the numerical simulations predicted the formation of an isw with geometric and kinematic features i e amplitude wavelength and celerity very close to those observed in the corresponding experiments also the resulting reflected isws features are very close to those obtained experimentally we checked that both their celerity and their instantaneous location were similar with those measured from the experiments see for example fig 4 in la forgia et al 2018b this detail is crucial to assure that the amount of energy dissipated during each wave breaking event is in good agreement between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations additional validation and comparison with shallow water theory for flows e g bores intrusion currents developing into a multi layer stratified environment and for bottom propagating currents over a sloped surface are discussed in borden et al 2012 ooi et al 2007 tokyay and constantinescu 2015 steenhauer et al 2017 such simulations were used in several studies to discuss bed friction velocity distributions and capacity of the flow to entrain sediment tokyay et al 2011 2012 2014 the level of mesh refinement and physical reynolds numbers were comparable to those of the simulations discussed in the present paper the main geometrical variables are defined in fig 1 that shows the flow in a horizontal vertical x y plane before the lock gate is removed t 0 and the bore starts forming at t 0 the flow was assumed to be at rest and ρ was set equal to 1 in the region containing the saltier fluid and equal to 0 in the region containing ambient lighter fluid the domain is divided in two regions the ambient fluid for 0 x l x 0 and the lock region for l x 0 x x 0 la forgia et al 2018b proved that the transfer of vertical shear stress induced by the gate removal during the laboratory experiments can be considered negligible the solid boundaries including the sloped surface were treated as no slip surfaces while the free surface was treated as a shear free boundary in many theoretical studies the rigid lid approximation is typically used to impose the boundary condition on the free surface for flow respecting the boussinesq approximation e g helfrich and melville 2006 for a relatively small density difference as the one adopted for our cases the surface displacement is negligible and the resulting internal displacements are approximately equal to the ones modeled with the rigid lid approximation for this reason the internal displacements observed experimentally are very close to those predicted by less the flow is assumed to be homogeneous in the spanwise direction thus periodic boundary conditions were imposed in this direction a zero normal gradient boundary condition was used for the nondimensional density at all solid and shear free boundaries the molecular schmidt number was set to 100 corresponding to saline water about 70 million cells were used to discretize the computational domain the grid spacing in all three directions was around 0 008h a constant time step of 0 002h ub was used the solution for the analyzed cases was checked to be grid independent la forgia et al 2018b gives more details on how the simulations were set up grid resolution and the choice of the schmidt number given that the flow is homogeneous in the spanwise direction for each variable one can define the spanwise averaged value which is denoted as from numerical results we estimated the isw main features fig 1 the wave amplitude aw the wavelength lw and the wave celerity cw i e the first derivative of the trough s position we also evaluated the wave surface sw and the characteristic wavelength λw defined as 3 λ w 1 a w η x d x s w a w where η x is the vertical displacement of the pycnocline compared to its initial position in the present study we discuss three experiments for which a plunging case 1 a collapsing case 2 and a surging breaker case 3 were observed respectively table 1 shows the main parameters of analyzed cases following la forgia et al 2018b s approach we estimated the reynolds wave number defined as 4 r e w a w c 0 ν where c 0 g h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 is the linear wave phase speed defined as in sutherland and ivey 2013 for the three cases the inferred wave reynolds numbers are r e w 2 25 10 3 case 1 r e w 3 66 10 3 case 2 r e w 4 91 10 3 case 3 in order to distinguish the different breaking mechanisms we used the iribarren number defined as the ratio between the topographic slope s b t a n θ and the wave slope aw λw 5 i r s b a w λ w numerical results are shown by using the nondimensional time scale t λ w a w where t is 2 14 s 3 31 s and 2 62 s in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively to be able to compare the interaction of the isw with the sloped surface among the different cases the time in each simulation t is specified with respect to the time t 0 at which the horizontal velocity in the upper layer starts to decrease because of the presence of the sloping boundary t 0 22 1 s 17 0 s and 16 0 s for case 1 2 and 3 respectively as the isws characteristics are fairly constant after they has formed but before it starts interacting with the sloped surface a proper comparison of the different cases should be done with respect to the time each isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary the new dimensional time scale is t t t 0 in nondimensional form t t t t 0 t where t is measured with respect to the time at which the lock gate is removed t t 0 3 bed shear stress over the sloping boundaries one of the advantages of 3 d eddy resolving simulations is that they allow estimating the bed friction velocity distributions on the sloped boundary once the isw starts interacting with this surface this is important given that the bed friction velocity is the main variable affecting the flux of sediment entrained from the sloped boundary in the case of a loose bed the nondimensional distributions of the bed friction velocity uτ ub at relevant times after the isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary are discussed for the plunging collapsing and surging cases in figs 2 4 respectively the bed friction velocity distribution is shown along the x axis see fig 1 the maximum values of uτ ub observed for the three cases are reported in table 2 to facilitate understanding the effect of the interaction between the isw and the sloped boundary on the bed friction velocity distributions the nondimensional spanwise averaged density field and the 3 d interface ρ 0 5 over the sloped surface are also shown in figs 2 4 fig 2 shows that as the isw reaches the sloped boundary a large amplification of the bed shear stress occurs in the plunging case because of the thin layer of salty water flow pushed down the incline by the approaching wave for example a region of high bed friction velocity amplification is observed for 0 4 x h 1 2 at t t 1 78 in fig 2a interestingly the bed shear stress distribution within this region is close to uniform in the spanwise direction indicating the thin layer of heavier fluid close to the sloped boundary contains negligible turbulence this is confirmed by the distribution of the nondimensional density at the same time that shows basically no mixing at the interface between the two layers until x h 1 2 in that region the strongly coherent kelvin helmholtz kh billows forming at the back of the isw start interacting with the inclined boundary consistent with this the 3 d interface also visualized in fig 2a at t t 1 78 shows only weak disturbances developing for x h 2 large scale disturbances in both the streamwise and spanwise directions develop behind the crest of the wave due to the shedding of kh vortices and their subsequent 3 d stretching analysis of the spanwise averaged distributions of bed friction velocity in fig 6a confirms that the largest levels of uτ ub are observed around t t 1 78 beneath the thin layer of accelerating heavier fluid trapped between the isw and the sloped boundary and also in the region where the large interfacial kh billows penetrate until close to the sloped boundary once the rear edge of the isw overturns lots of turbulence is generated along the sloped boundary this is the main reason why the distributions of uτ ub become very irregular in the spanwise direction for t t 2 especially in the region containing mixed fluid that is situated in the immediate vicinity of the boundary see fig 2b d at t t 2 46 the vorticity field shows a large region characterized by counterclockwise overturning 1 2 x h 2 2 whose vertical extent goes from the initial pycnocline depth up to the inclined surface see fig 5 a at a later stage at t t 3 17 the interface displays a region of high amplitude 2 d disturbances between the location where the bottom of the layer of light unmixed fluid is situated over the sloped boundary x h 0 6 and the bottom part of the region containing mixed fluid over the same boundary x h 1 6 this confirms that the breaking of the isw as it hits the sloped boundary generates highly 3 d eddies and lots of mixing leonardi et al 2018 the peak bed friction velocities at t t 3 17 are observed around x h 0 5 and 1 5 where the flow accelerates after the momentum changes direction from being oriented parallel to the streamwise direction to being oriented down of the sloped boundary a smaller but clear amplification of uτ ub occurs inside the layer of lighter fluid because some of the incoming fluid in the isw is pushed against the incline toward the top corner of the channel the presence of energetic 3 d eddies inside the mixed layer away from the region where this layer is in direct contact with the sloped boundary explains the relatively strong disturbances of uτ ub in the spanwise direction for 2 x h 2 7 at t t 3 17 in fig 2b the largest bed friction velocities are observed near the top and bottom boundaries of the layer of mixed fluid as it comes into contact with the sloped boundary see also fig 6a this is also observed at subsequent times e g t t 4 76 and t t 7 93 in fig 2c and d after the gravity current containing saltier water forms and the reflected wave starts moving away from the sloped boundary as the gravity current advances against the bed slope the peaks of uτ ub and the degree of non uniformity of the bed friction velocity distribution in the spanwise direction decreases this is also due to the gradual loss of coherence of the larger eddies generated inside the mixed layer during the time the incoming wave hits the sloped boundary the decay of the larger scale turbulence is confirmed by the decay of the 3 d disturbances on the surface of the ρ 0 5 isopycnal for t t 3 17 similar to the plunging case the largest amplification of the bed shear stress in the collapsing case occurs a short time after the isw starts interacting with the sloped boundary and starts displacing the heavier fluid downwards in the vicinity of the sloped boundary see distributions of bed friction velocity at t t 1 17 in fig 3a and b at these early times of interaction of the isw with the sloped boundary there is negligible large scale turbulence generated in the flow which explains why the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction the flow in the immediate vicinity of the sloped surface remains laminar and the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction it is only after the bolus forms t t 1 5 that the distributions of uτ ub become nonuniform in the spanwise direction the bolus is clearly visible by the velocity vectors that are superimposed on the vorticity field at t t 2 05 see fig 5b as the gravity current associated to the formation of the bolus moves upwards and the wave reflection at the sloped boundary is complete large scale 3 d turbulent eddies start developing inside the mixed layer e g see also interface deformations for t t 3 in fig 3 and the bed friction velocity distributions become highly nonuniform beneath and some distance behind the front of the gravity current at these times the largest values of uτ ub are observed around the location of the front of the gravity current interestingly the uτ ub in the region where the thin layer of mixed fluid comes into contact with the sloped boundary remain high even after the end of the breaking event e g at t t 7 76 in fig 3d over the incline the position at which the maximum velocity occurs is expected to move upstream until the consequent deceleration in the adverse pressure gradient region becomes strong enough to induce the boundary layer separation as for the plunging case the turbulence inside the mixed layer and the degree of nonuniformity of uτ ub in the spanwise direction decays after the gravity current dissipates and the mixed layer becomes close to horizontal near the sloped boundary similar to the collapsing case large values of uτ ub in the surging case occur as the front of the isw approaches the sloped boundary t t 0 4 fig 4a and c and the bolus forms fig 4b and c as for the previous cases the distributions of uτ ub are close to uniform in the spanwise direction before the formation of the bolus despite the fact that large scale instabilities develop on the rear side of the approaching wave e g see ρ 0 5 interface at t t 0 4 in fig 4a as opposed to the other cases where the region of high uτ ub over the sloped boundary approximately corresponded to the extent of the mixed layer over the same boundary in the surging case the region of high uτ ub penetrates into the regions containing unmixed fluid above and below the thin mixing layer before the bolus forms the region of high uτ ub extends only beneath the mixed layer e g for x h 1 5 in fig 4a where the flow accelerates as the crest of the approaching wave moves toward the sloped boundary however the formation of the bolus induces the formation of 3 d eddies some of them being advected into the layer containing light unmixed fluid close to the surface of the sloped boundary fig 4b this explains the large fluctuations of uτ ub in the spanwise direction starting around x h 0 5 at t t 1 07 moreover at t t 1 07 the region containing the peaks of uτ ub starts at x h 1 1 way above the mixed layer which is situated at x h 1 5 and extends until x h 2 1 way inside the layer containing heavier fluid as for the other cases once the upsloping gravity current forms the largest values of uτ ub are recorded beneath the front of the current until close to the time when the current dissipates fig 4c and d the gravity current induces positive vorticity in the vicinity of the bottom see fig 5c as the current dissipates and the mixing layer becomes close to horizontal away from the sloped boundary the flow starts relaminarizing e g see ρ 0 5 interface at t t 8 6 in fig 4d and the distributions of uτ ub over the sloped boundary become more uniform in the spanwise direction see fig 4c and d as for the collapsing case some entrainment can occur around the region where the mixed layer comes into contact with the sloped boundary a long time after the wave has reflected e g see distribution of uτ ub near x h 0 3 at t t 8 6 in fig 4d interestingly the spanwise averaged bed friction velocity shows a spatial distribution is initially continuous over the sloping boundary in the region below the pycnocline at t t 0 4 in fig 6c assuming relatively large values and presenting its maximum approximately in the middle of the sloping surface at a later stage as the first instabilities develop and in particular immediately after the generation of the gravity current the bed shear velocity distribution becomes more irregular and a clear peak is observed where the instabilities induced by the wave breaking starts to develop at t t 1 07 in fig 6c as the gravity current flows up slope for t t 2 the friction velocity decreases and appears to be more uniformly distributed interestingly the flow instabilities associated with each breaking mechanism have a different influence on the spanwise nonuniformity of the bed friction velocities that measures the turbulence intensity effects on the bed shear stress in a first approximation this effect can be quantified by the standard deviation of the bed friction velocity in particular for each case we investigated the evolution of the standard deviation of bed friction velocity contours over the sloping boundary at different times see dashed lines in fig 6 as the wave is approaching to the sloping boundary only for the plunging case we observed a significant variation of tho instantaneous bed friction velocity this is consistent with the large edge overturning occurring before the wave directly engaged with the inclined surface fig 6a at t t 1 78 at the following times shown in fig 6a the standard deviation remains relatively large in response of tridimensional turbulent instabilities developing during the breaking event fig 6a at t t 3 the collapsing breaker is characterized instead by a lower lateral variability of the bed friction velocity during the entire breaking event this is probably due to the fact that the instability induced by the boundary layer separation occurs in a localized region in the case of the surging breaker the turbulent instabilities generated at the bottom of the gravity current moving against the bed slope generate a large variation of the bed friction velocity along the spanwise direction 4 sediment entrainment potential of an isw interacting with a sloped surface one interesting question is how the differences in the bed friction velocity distributions during the different stages of the evolution of the isw affects its overall capacity to entrain sediment from the sloped boundary various semi empirical models are available to estimate the instantaneous flux of sediment entrained from the bed by a turbulent overflow most of these models assume that the sediment flux is proportional to uτ φ or to u τ 2 u τ c 2 φ 2 where the former is commonly used for live bed scour conditions e g φ 3 in the meyer peter and muller 1948 formula and the latter is generally used for clear water scour conditions e g van rijn 1984 formula where uτc is the critical bed friction velocity for example van rijn 1984 formula eq 6 assumes that the local pick up rate p is proportional to u τ 2 u τ c 2 φ 2 with φ 3 in regions where uτ uτc 6 p 0 00033 u τ 2 u τ c 2 u τ c 2 1 5 ρ p ρ 1 0 6 g 0 6 d 0 8 ν 2 where p is expressed in units of volumetric flux per unit area and time ρ is the density of water and ρp is the density of the sediment particles of diameter d in the following simplified analysis one will assume that the flux of sediment entrained from the bed at a certain location is not limited by the presence of a high concentration of entrained particles over that location this is a standard assumption in previous studies that simulated the transport and deposition of entrained particles carried by gravity and turbidity currents e g necker et al 2005 for a given sediment grain size the generic nondimensional expression for the local flux of entrained sediment can be expressed by a generic formula i 2 as the one proposed by van rijn 1984 7 i 2 1 h 2 u b 3 a u τ u τ c u τ 2 u τ c 2 3 2 d a where a indicates the area of the inclined channel bottom results in fig 7 show that the capacity of the isw to entrain sediment over the sloped boundary is the largest in the collapsing case not only that the peak value of i 2 is the largest in the collapsing case but also the nondimensional time interval over which i 2 assumes relatively large values is the largest in this case up to 9t t for all three cases the sediment entrainment capacity of the current peaks as the maximum downstream acceleration over the inclined surface occurs immediately before the generation of the instability though the peak values of i 2 are comparable in the plunging and surging cases the peak of i 2 occurs much faster in the plunging case and decays fairly slowly compared to the surging case previous studies of gravity currents showed that after the incipient motion of the sediment and their lift up from the bed the upward velocities induced by the turbulent eddies contribute to counteract the falling velocity of the particles maintaining the sediments into suspension kneller et al 1997 ottolenghi et al 2017b kyrousi et al 2018 for all the breaking mechanism we investigated a gravity current formed and propagated up the slope thus most sediment particles entrained from the bottom during each isw breaking event are expected to remain in suspension once they are lifted up at least during the times the gravity current continues to move upwards over the inclined boundary 5 discussion and conclusions we investigated the effects on the bottom of three different breaking internal solitary waves interacting with a uniform sloping surface we used high resolution 3 d les to reproduce three laboratory experiments in which a plunging a collapsing and a surging breaker occur respectively the plunging breaker case 1 showed the steepening of the rear face of the wave the trailing edge indeed shoaled in deeper water with respect to the leading one thus the rear face propagated relatively faster before the wave reached the sloped surface the trailing edge overturning downstream occurred the onshore overturning produces an anti clockwise vortex which develops in the internal part of the flow i e relatively far from the bottom generating a large amount of mixing at a later stage the whirling region is carried downstream by the wave until it interacts directly with the inclined bottom as the mixed region reached the sloping boundary a large amplification of the bed shear stress occurs the distributions of uτ ub become very irregular both along the incline and in the spanwise direction compared to the other cases the peak values of the bed friction velocity are observed to occur in a region relatively closer to the initial pycnocline location after the wave is partially reflected and turbulent structure dissipates inducing a gradual reduction of the bed shear stress along the incline during the overall shoaling and breaking processes the plunging breaker showed an irregular spatial distribution of the bed friction velocities nevertheless the sediment entrainment potential assumes a continuous trend characterized by a constant increase until the mixed region interacts with the incline then a clear peak occurs and finally a gradual decrease of entrained sediment was observed the overall effect at the irregular spatial temporal trend of the bed shear stress addresses a sediment re suspension process more evenly distributed with respect to the other cases as the collapsing breaker case 2 shoals the heavier fluid beneath the leading edge of the wave leaves its original position in this region as observed in laboratory experiments sutherland and ivey 2013 la forgia et al 2018a down slope velocities increase at this stage the normalized bed friction velocity is close to uniform in the spanwise direction and assumes relatively large values before the heavier fluid is completely discharged boundary layer separation occurs in the adverse pressure gradient region a separation bolus form and the downward flow diverted with a clockwise motion from this time the distributions of uτ ub becomes non uniform in the spanwise direction over the incline the position at which the maximum velocity occurs is expected to move downstream until the consequent deceleration in the adverse pressure gradient region becomes strong enough to induce the boundary layer separation at this stage the bed shear stress shows clear peaks localized in the region where turbulent structure induced by the separated flow develops after the whirling motion dissipation the breaker event evolves with the generation of a gravity current forced by the unstable density distribution over the sloping boundary the bed shear stress distribution becomes more uniform with the largest values associated to the position of the gravity current head the sediment entrainment for a collapsing breaker shows a trend composed by two peaks the first in time is the largest it precedes the formation of the instability induced by boundary layer separation the second one occurs during the gravity current propagation up slope differently from the plunging breaker for a collapsing breaker the largest amount of sediments are entrained from a localized region i e the breaking location where the maximum down slope velocities occur only at a later stage the bed shear stress appears more evenly distributed such that the expected sediment re suspension mechanism involves a larger surface a very similar behavior was observed for the surging breaker case 3 however as the wave approaches the slope the down slope deceleration of the heavier fluid assumes lower values and the associated separation flow appears less significant la forgia et al 2018b then the localized region where the maximum down slope acceleration occurs is expected to be smaller compared to the collapsing case this is proved by the relatevely lower amount of sediment entrained during the isw breaking also in this case secondary peaks were also observed to occur as the gravity current forms and starts to accelerate we show how not only mixing and water entrainment are related to the breaking criteria but also the related flux of sediments despite la forgia et al 2018b proved that the plunging breaker dissipation was largest compared to the other cases this breaking mechanism is characterized by instabilities that develop mostly in the interior part of the fluid this is the reason why the nondimensional time interval over which i 2 assumes relatively large values is the lowest with respect to the other cases our simulations show that the collapsing mechanism induces a more localized instability which develops in close proximity to the sloped surface for topographic slope larger than the wave slopes the expected sediment re suspension is more energetic inducing more localized irregularities on the loose bed the relatively small spatial scale of our laboratory experiments and numerical simulations must be taken into account when assessing the geophysical relevance of the obtained results for larger reynolds numbers the turbulence levels away from the solid boundaries are expected to be larger so the eddies generated away from the solid boundaries are expected to have a larger contribution to the total dissipation in the coastal oceans the energy loss due to the interaction isw bottom has the same order of magnitude as the one dissipated within the water column arthur and fringer 2014 thus compared to our numerical experiment results one can expect somewhat lower bed friction velocities to be generated in the field for breaker types characterized by large scale turbulence generated inside the flow domain away from the solid boundaries i e plunging breakers notation t 0
