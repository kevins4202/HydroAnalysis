1315,naturally sourced groundwater quality issues are common but there is rarely a geochemical and mineralogical dataset of aquifer properties for comparison this study utilizes geochemical and mineralogical data to characterize naturally occurring minerals that are potential groundwater contaminants in the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system of west central wisconsin u s a a high resolution portable x ray fluorescence elemental analysis was used for initial characterization of geochemistry and chemostratigraphy of well cutting and drill core samples then a subset of sample materials was analyzed mineralogically and geochemically using xrd and icp ms respectively elevated concentrations of arsenic phosphorous strontium and various metals within the aquitard aquifer sandstone were identified mostly associated with sulfide minerals and iron hydr oxides and suggestive of mississippi valley type mineralization similar elemental contaminants in surface and groundwater in the study area indicate that the observed trace element bearing minerals are a natural source of groundwater contamination most likely through release into groundwater during fluctuating redox and ph conditions near the water table co occurrence of iron hydr oxide coated sulfide minerals near the water table and observations of sulfide oxidation post drilling suggests sulfides in these units are actively oxidizing well construction recommendations based on these results should mitigate current or future pumping of trace element contaminated groundwater and in the vast majority of cases eliminate naturally occurring contaminants as a potential source this study provides an extensive baseline dataset of aquifer mineralogy and trace element composition and an efficient approach for data collection that is necessary for interpreting and attributing possible future groundwater quality issues keywords sulfide water quality frac sand arsenic groundwater contaminants portable x ray fluorescence 1 introduction 1 1 scope of study groundwater quality issues related to trace element contamination can be sourced from naturally occurring minerals within the aquifer rock schreiber et al 2000 kim et al 2002 gotkowitz et al 2004 gonzalez et al 2005 zambito et al 2019 introduced to the groundwater system from a variety of anthropogenically derived surface sources like fly ash theis et al 1978 kopsick and angino 1981 or even released from naturally occurring iron hydr oxides during the anaerobic biodegradation of a crude oil contaminated aquifer cozzarelli et al 2015 ziegler et al 2021 identifying the source of groundwater contamination is challenging as the relationship between surface and groundwater is complex and controlled by climate geology and topography winter 1999 manning et al 2013 in west central wisconsin the focus of this study and where the primary source of drinking water is groundwater the recent combination of an increased number of high capacity wells and the introduction of large scale industrial sand mining has resulted in a thirst for knowledge about water quantity and quality by private land owners municipalities agricultural operations industry and academia parsen et al 2019 zambito et al 2019 as is often the case it can be difficult to attribute water quality issues to land use changes when widespread water quality analyses were not routinely performed prior to such change and or when there is a potential natural source of groundwater contamination the current study area is affected by both of these problems while some groundwater testing was undertaken prior to land use changes and found pre land use change instances of groundwater contamination once changes began private land owners municipalities agricultural operations industry and academia all increased the amount of surface and groundwater quality data they were collecting which expectedly also showed instances of contamination at the same time as water testing increased a variety of geologic studies were also undertaken to understand industrial sand resource distribution as well as aquifer sandstone characteristics with the goal of identifying any potential naturally occurring sources of groundwater contamination runkel et al 2012a zambito et al 2018 2019 to ultimately understand if groundwater contamination is a result of naturally occurring contaminants and or the result of land use change the timing of groundwater testing relative to land use changes as well as any potential natural sources of contamination in the aquifer itself must all be taken into account this study takes the novel approach of testing and constraining multiple working hypotheses for groundwater contamination in the study area while also creating an extensive baseline dataset of aquifer mineralogy and trace metal and other element composition that is necessary for mitigating current as well as preventing and attributing possible future groundwater quality issues through well construction recommendations to help constrain the source s of the observed groundwater contamination a dataset of redox sensitive sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system and their trace element composition has been constructed more specifically this study aims to provide a baseline dataset for determining if the observed trace element concentrations in trempealeau county west central wisconsin are sourced from naturally occurring minerals within the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system and or related to overlying industrial sand mining activities fig 1 1 2 regional groundwater quality issues a well understood case study of a bedrock source of groundwater contamination is the arsenic bearing iron sulfide mineralization zone in northeastern wisconsin schreiber et al 2000 a variety of studies in northeastern wisconsin have documented that naturally occurring arsenic nickel and cobalt bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals at the top of the ordovician st peter formation sandstone aquifer are the source of groundwater quality issues schreiber et al 2000 gotkowitz et al 2004 thornburg and sahai 2004 luczaj et al 2016 as groundwater is pumped from wells in this aquifer a cone of depression forms and depending on specific well conditions including static water level and elevation of specific mineralized horizons these minerals are no longer submerged below the water table in low dissolved oxygen groundwater rather they are exposed to relatively oxygen rich water and air oxidation reduction redox fluctuations caused by the cyclical rise and fall of the water table during repeated recharge and pumping cause the oxidation of sulfides and release of arsenic and sulfuric acid into the groundwater arsenic sorption onto newly formed iron hydr oxides and ultimately arsenic release from iron hydr oxides when groundwater attains a low ph schreiber et al 2000 in this situation the recommended remedy was to set well casing deeper into the aquifer below the arsenic bearing mineralization zone so that groundwater withdrawal is below and isolated from the contaminant source schreiber et al 2000 gotkowitz et al 2004 the sulfides present in northeastern wisconsin are related to mississippi valley type mvt mineralization which includes the emplacement of the minerals that include sphalerite galena and iron sulfides within paleozoic bedrock luczaj 2006 luczaj et al 2016 2018 hischke 2018 in wisconsin mvt mineralization not only occurs in the northeastern part of the state but is also prevalent though with a different geologic history in the southwest and extending into illinois iowa and minnesota see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 it is also worth noting that aquifer storage and recovery experiments conducted in northeastern wisconsin found that tunnel city group strata underlying the st peter was also a source of groundwater contamination with arsenic through oxidative dissolution of arsenic bearing sulfides dickoff 2010 jennings et al 2021 more recently the recognition by stewart et al 2021 that structural and hydrological changes in bedrock including fracture networks play a role in arsenic bearing mvt mineralization distribution and concentration in the cambrian aquifer indicates that there is much work to be done in understanding the distribution of mvt mineralization trace element contamination of groundwater from the oxidation of mvt mineralization is therefore a complex regional concern 1 3 groundwater quality in the study area our understanding of natural and or anthropogenically derived causes of groundwater quality issues in west central wisconsin is still in its infancy primarily because both of these sources can affect the same groundwater aquifer and the collection of groundwater quality data has only recently accelerated prior to recent land use changes masarik et al 2006 reported private wells with groundwater ph of 6 5 7 0 as well as wells contaminated with arsenic copper iron lead manganese and zinc in the northwest part of the study area where similar bedrock units are present a different pre land use change study summarized elevated phosphorus levels in surface water also in the northern part of the current study area freihofer and mcginley 2009 and a recent broader regional study that includes the study area found phosphorus concentrations in groundwater 1000 ppb as well as phosphorus present in bedrock iron magnesium oxides hackenmueller et al 2018 in the southern part of the study area zambito et al 2019 suggested that groundwater contamination of private wells in the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system by aluminum arsenic cadmium chromium cobalt copper iron lead manganese nickel sulfate vanadium and zinc was most likely a result of the oxidation of naturally occurring trace element bearing interpreted as likely mvt sulfide minerals furthermore zambito et al 2019 suggested that this sulfide oxidation was a regional concern that resulted in regionally low groundwater ph in west central wisconsin based on their observations of private well water ph as low as 4 08 as well as overall lower groundwater ph when considering average ph by county in a follow up study of pathways for trace metals from bedrock to groundwater haas 2021 demonstrated that oxidation of pyrite in the wonewoc formation sandstone which is lithologically similar to the mount simon sandstone of this study released metals into solution roughly in the order nickel cobalt manganese copper iron aluminum then zinc and lead through microbial activity under acidic conditions resulting from pyrite oxidation the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system is the primary target of industrial sand extraction in the study area and directly overlies the lithologically similar cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system that is the focus of this study fig 1 1 4 potential sources of groundwater contamination in the study area while naturally sourced groundwater contaminants clearly occur in west central wisconsin as outlined above the recent increase in industrial sand mining in the study area has caused alarm among private well owners and municipalities the vast majority of which are dependent on groundwater in the last 15 years the growth of large scale industrial frac sand mining in west central wisconsin has resulted in an increase in the number of high capacity wells for water used in the mining process in addition to those used for agriculture and municipal water supplies parsen and zambito 2014 zambito et al 2017a parsen et al 2019 the increased number of high capacity wells in the area has led to concerns about water table fluctuation and bedrock redox reactions that could liberate trace elements in groundwater similar to the process operating in northeastern wisconsin fig 1b parsen et al 2019 zambito et al 2019 if trace element bearing minerals are found in the cambrian eau claire mount simon sandstone aquitard aquifer system which is lithologically similar to the st peter aquifer of northeastern wisconsin a thorough documentation of their spatial and stratigraphic distribution is needed to mitigate trace element liberation through redox associated with water table fluctuation due to pumping or climate fig 1b another possible water quality concern is that the wonewoc formation sandstone mined for industrial sand and which directly overlies the aquitard aquifer system in west central wisconsin contains trace element bearing sulfide minerals as described above these have been suggested by zambito et al 2019 to be the source of groundwater quality issues in some private wells unlined ponds are often used on these mine sites for storage of storm water runoff process waters and settling of particulate and therefore there is a concern that trace elements released during the mining process may be transported to the aquifer through infiltration and seepage recharge fig 1c indeed water samples from process water ponds at industrial mine sites in the study area show concentrations of chromium copper lead nickel and zinc close to or above the estimated toxicity acute and or chronic for stream biota zambito et al 2019 therefore if trace metals and elements are observed in groundwater samples but not present in the local aquitard aquifer system sandstone this would indicate groundwater quality issues from an external source surface contaminant given that extracted sand resources host sulfide bearing trace elements and these elements can make their way into solution during the mining process nearby sand mines should then be considered as a possible source of trace element contamination for that reason it is necessary to characterize the baseline geochemical and mineralogical composition of the aquitard aquifer system sandstone to be able to constrain possible sources of contamination 1 5 goals and outcomes of this study the research presented herein addresses concerns regarding groundwater quality issues improves the subsurface stratigraphic framework and provides a high resolution spatial and stratigraphic dataset of aquitard aquifer system geochemical and mineralogical composition in central trempealeau county wisconsin fig 2 we focus on identifying both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system and their trace elemental composition these data provide baseline information for understanding if redox sensitive minerals in the study area can be natural sources for groundwater quality issues for example arsenic can be found in both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals and therefore oxidizing and reducing conditions respectively as well as ph changes may release this arsenic schreiber et al 2000 kim et al 2002 anawar et al 2003 akai et al 2004 korte and fernando 1991 these data are also necessary in order to constrain the source s of potential groundwater contamination i e aquifer aquitard and or sand mine sourced contaminants as a broader outcome this study outlines an approach to aquifer mineralogical and trace element characterization that combines easily collected large elemental datasets from a variety of subsurface materials using a handheld x ray fluorescence elemental analysis with subsequent focused and highly informed trace element and mineralogical study as detailed below this study has identified both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals within the aquitard aquifer system that are associated with the presence of trace elements in appreciable amounts in addition to arsenic we observed elevated concentrations relative to other samples of varying lithology mineralogy of chromium cobalt copper lead molybdenum nickel phosphorus strontium vanadium and zinc these trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are often found in close proximity to each other in the samples studied for example as iron hydr oxide rims on sulfide minerals while this makes it difficult to identify the mineral phase of trace element enrichment it does suggest that redox reactions have occurred and or are actively occurring and therefore natural sources of groundwater quality issues are a pressing concern in the study area based on these results it is recommended that well casing be set to a depth below the oxidation front associated with the water table during new well construction in the study area this depth would be site specific by determining the water table fluctuation and corresponding exposure to oxygen in the subsurface the updated subsurface stratigraphic framework presented herein will aid in constructing groundwater models to aid in well construction and groundwater modeling has recently received renewed interest in the study region in part because of increased industrial sand mining parsen et al 2019 it is also recommended that private and municipal well operators in the region regularly test groundwater for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph in regard to identifying aquifer aquitard versus sand mine sourced contaminants future work should be undertaken at the local site specific level and focus on flow path studies individual well construction and water table positions and geochemical fingerprinting of trace elements and sulfides for example isotopes 2 geologic setting the heavily dissected landscape of the study region is a common feature of the driftless area of the upper mississippi valley and controlled by the bedrock geology figs 1 and 2 brown 1988 see zambito et al 2018 for lithologic and thickness details of bedrock units the highest ridges in trempealeau county are capped by the fairly weathering resistant sandy dolostone of the prairie du chien group up to 38 m thick that overlies sandstone and dolostone of the trempealeau group also 38 m thick smaller ridges are capped by the slightly less resistant lower tunnel city group glauconitic and shaly dolostone and dolomitic sandstone total thickness of the tunnel city group is 45 m slopes of the smaller hills are comprised of weakly cemented wonewoc formation sandstone 45 m thick the hill bases and floors of larger valleys are in the upper part of the eau claire formation total thickness of the eau claire formation is 36 m the underlying mount simon formation and precambrian basement are only found in the subsurface in the study area mount simon formation is up to 114 m thick but that thickness varies based on precambrian basement surface relief the wonewoc formation is the primary industrial quartz sand resource in this region as it is present and easily extractable at the land surface figs 1 and 2 parsen and zambito 2014 zambito et al 2017a the underlying eau claire formation generally acts as an aquitard due to its higher clay content and dolomite cement aswasereelert et al 2008 though it does have sandier portions in the study area which provide aquifer like properties the mount simon formation below the eau claire is a porous sandstone with intermittent shalier intervals driese et al 1981 the mount simon formation is the primary bedrock aquifer for high capacity groundwater wells that are used for municipalities agriculture and industry in the study area the mount simon formation directly overlies the low to impermeable crystalline or clay rich weathered crystalline precambrian units medaris et al 2018 the geochemical and mineralogical data presented in this study comes from bedrock and any overlying soil or alluvial colluvial deposits present in central trempealeau county wisconsin fig 2 the bedrock units present in the boreholes include the precambrian crystalline and weathered crystalline rock in the deepest boreholes and the cambrian approximately 500 million year old mount simon eau claire and wonewoc formations of the elk mound group figs 1 and 2 these cambrian units were deposited over a vast area in shallow marine littoral and fluvial depositional environments along a broad submarine depositional ramp with an onshore offshore profile from modern day northeast to southwest driese et al 1981 dott et al 1986 runkel et al 1998 2007 2012b soil and sediment overlying the bedrock are lumped together as alluvial colluvial in this study these sediments were deposited by a combination of proglacial meltwater modern and ancient fluvial eroded hillslope derived and eolian processes thwaites 1964 muldoon and craven 1998 cates 2001 mason et al 2019 these alluvial colluvial deposits are primarily composed of medium sand or gravel of reworked sandstone and dolostone from the eroding ridge and hillsides a generalized 1 100 000 scale water table elevation map for trempealeau county was produced by muldoon and crave 1998 at the scale produced it is not considered definitive for site specific applications which would include this study water table elevations used herein come directly from well construction reports see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission which as noted by muldoon and craven 1998 are locally variable regardless in most of the wells studied which are located on the valley floor the water table is near the surface see also muldoon and craven 1998 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials and methods introduction the geochemical and mineralogical data presented herein are focused on the aquitard aquifer system cambrian sandstone in the study area specifically in the vicinity of whitehall wisconsin the county seat of trempealeau county figs 1 and 2 preliminary portable x ray fluorescence data were collected from core and cutting samples from 22 boreholes fig 2 zambito et al in review data in brief co submission based on this preliminary study herein we detail the results of pxrf x ray diffraction xrd and elemental analysis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms from a subset of boreholes that includes five cutting sets and two cores fig 2 the cuttings and cores from the 22 boreholes are currently stored at the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs two of the cutting sets blair city well 3 wgnhs well id 62000007 and whitehall city well wgnhs well id 62000022 were previously washed and curated and together contain the entire stratigraphic succession of the mount simon formation aquifer the two cores kulig quarry core wgnhs well id 62000231 and flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core wgnhs well id 62000119 also together contain the entire stratigraphic succession of the mount simon formation aquifer because cores allow high resolution in situ stratigraphic sampling the majority of mineralogical and geochemical analyses were undertaken on these materials furthermore sample type and preparation can influence these analyses and different samples represent different subsurface stratigraphic thicknesses zambito et al 2016 additionally samples of relatively fresh unwashed cuttings material from three wells at an industrial sand mine were also analyzed by xrd hi crush blair pw b1 pw b4 and pw b6 wgnhs well ids 62000207 62000209 and 62000211 respectively in addition to mineralogical and geochemical data for the mount simon aquifer xrd and icp ms data are also presented for the eau claire formation aquitard in part and the underlying precambrian crystalline basement the reader is referred to zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for a detailed description of well construction the sample materials examined how they were collected and stored and pxrf data and lithostratigraphic columns for 22 boreholes in the study area fig 1 while we describe the construction of these groundwater wells from available information specifically the depths of well casing and level of the water table observed at the time of drilling we are only aware of eight of these wells that are currently withdrawing potable water although five are withdrawing non potable water for industrial use in this study we present subsurface depths in both english and metric systems of measurement because these cores were drilled in the u s a where subsurface samples are marked in tenths of feet 3 2 geochemical and mineralogical analyses our previous work showing how pxrf elemental data can be used as a proxy for lithology and identifying intervals of interest for further analysis provided guidance on the suite of elements interpreted zambito et al 2016 2017b and 2018 herein we use aluminum potassium and silicon as a proxy for siliciclastic rocks quartz and feldspathic sandstone and clay minerals iron and sulfur together as a proxy for pyrite and other sulfides iron without sulfur as a proxy for iron hydr oxides and calcium and magnesium as a proxy for carbonate cements manganese phosphorus and strontium were also helpful for lithostratigraphic subdivision as these elements tended to correspond with shales and or carbonates for each borehole we identified stratigraphic units based on a combination of lithologic data pxrf geochemical data and when available wgnhs geologic logs and natural gamma radiation logs collected by downhole geophysical analysis all are available in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission initial elemental analysis was undertaken using a thermo fisher scientific niton xl3t goldd handheld portable x ray fluorescence pxrf analyzer with an 8 mm diameter sample window in testallgeo mode the analyzer was mounted in a lead lined benchtop stand the reader is referred to zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for further details of how pxrf data was collected following compilation of the pxrf elemental concentration results and observations on lithology and lithostratigraphy we selected a subset of samples of both sulfides and iron hydr oxides that represented the elemental and mineralogical variability within the geological successions observed we subsampled three of the most recently drilled cuttings sets hi crush blair pw b1 62000207 hi crush blair pw b4 62000209 and hi crush blair pw b6 62000211 as well as two rock cores kulig quarry 62000231 and flambeau mining co 96 1 1 62000119 for mineralogical identification and high precision elemental composition using xrd and icp ms respectively tables 1 and 2 appendix a while xrd analysis was undertaken on both cuttings and core icp ms analysis was restricted to core material in which we could better constrain the sedimentary context of the material being sampled material for these analyses was prepared by either sieving a portion of a well cuttings sample with a 1 68 mm mesh screen u s standard sieve size no 12 or using a tungsten carbide drill bit to sample powder from the rock cores the sieved or powdered samples were further pulverized using a silica based mortar and pestle if necessary in order to achieve a relatively fine grained homogenous sample the sampled material was then split for xrd and icp ms analysis individual mineral grains for single grain xrd analysis were not pulverized nor included in the split material these were removed from the sample prior to pulverization single grain xrd is preferable to xrd analysis of powdered samples with abundant quartz e g the mount simon formation because the signal for quartz typically swamps out or dominates the signal for other minerals such as pyrite or hematite see discussion in zambito et al 2019 the xrd analyses were undertaken using a rigaku rapid ii xrd system located in the university of wisconsin madison s department of geoscience a total of fourteen powdered and eighteen single grain xrd analyses were completed table 1 and appendix a for powdered sample analysis the powdered geologic sample was inserted into a 1 cm long polyamide kapton registered trademark of dupont cylindrical tube with a diameter of 1 mm and a wall thickness of 0 0205 0 5207 mm the ends of the tube were capped with play doh registered trademark of hasbro for single grain xrd analysis individual grains were picked either directly from the cuttings sample or the rock core or from sampling with a tungsten carbide drill bit these grains were then individually glued onto the end of a slitted kapton cylindrical tube using vacuum glue each powdered and single grain analyses were analyzed for a duration time of 15 to 20 min the xrd instrument was set to rotate the homogenized powder or single grain samples 360 degrees in phi at a rate of one degree per second rotation about a vertical axis the jade plus software package v9 5 0 10 19 2012 1995 2018 materials data inc was used to interpret the mineralogical profiles and recommended mineralogical assemblages of each sample according to the spectrum the relative abundance of each mineral present in the xrd spectrum was estimated by comparing the maximum peaks of each mineral identified in the spectrum since our main goal was to identify the sampled minerals particularly the sulfides and iron hydr oxides we did not quantify the abundance of the minerals present in each sample mineral identification was further confirmed by comparison to icp ms if available the icp ms analyses were performed by als global me ms61l super trace lowest dl 4a package at their reno nevada u s a and north vancouver british columbia canada facilities this method involves the digestion of sample material by four acids perchloric nitric hydrofluoric and hydrochloric ionization of the resulting solution and determination of ion concentration using a mass spectrometer icp ms allows for more accurate and precise results for elemental abundance of elements present in a geologic sample than what is capable by the pxrf instrument for example cobalt chromium phosphorus and vanadium pxrf measurements were determined to never be accurate and therefore pxrf data for those elements is not plotted see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission icp ms can also detect elements at lower concentrations than the pxrf instrument as demonstrated by zambito et al 2016 2019 who provide a comparison between the pxrf and icp ms approaches in case studies of lithologically similar cambrian sandstone from wisconsin 4 results 4 1 stratigraphic units lithology and recognition our stratigraphic determination of the mount simon eau claire and wonewoc formations as well as alluvium colluvium and precambrian crystalline basement in the boreholes studied is based on lithologic description of cuttings and core and elevations of any lithologic changes borehole gamma logs and qualitative comparison of pxrf major cation elemental profiles the color of the lithology was not used in determining lithostratigraphic units we observed that the colors brown orange and red were more common near land surface and the water table while blue and gray more typical of deeper subsurface samples regardless of stratigraphic unit figs 3 6 the mount simon formation is the main regional aquifer and consists of variably white gray tan red orange pink and blue shaly sandstone with interbedded shale beds typically colored green and or bluish gray the lower and middle mount simon tends to be shalier than the upper part of the formation as seen in the cutting and core images shown in figs 3 6 the strata near the eau claire mount simon formation contact has less interbedded mudstone and is also reddish orange in color while shalier intervals and or those found deeper in boreholes are typically gray and blue subdivision of the mount simon may be possible with the pxrf data available but will not be investigated further herein for example see subdivisions of driese et al 1981 the eau claire formation overlies the mount simon and has aquitard and aquifer characteristics it is similar in color and lithology to the mount simon though shalier and dolomitic at the contact between the mount simon and eau claire there is an increase in aluminum and potassium likely representing an increase in clay mineral presence and both calcium and magnesium representing carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite the wonewoc formation which overlies the eau claire is seen only in a few wells from the hi crush blair mine site where the boreholes were drilled at a higher land surface elevation the wonewoc formation is present as a tannish orange and white quartz sandstone in the wells studied the wonewoc is unconformably overlain by the lithologically variable alluvium colluvium in cutting sets from some boreholes it was sometimes difficult to place the contact between the precambrian crystalline rocks and the overlying cambrian mount simon formation geologic logs available in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission from some wells that intersect this contact describe an interval of weathered precambrian rock that formed prior to the deposition of the mount simon formation approximately 500 million years ago weathered precambrian rocks that transition downward into competent crystalline rock are also seen in the drill core flambeau mining co 96 1 1 fig 6 see medaris et al 2018 for detailed analysis of the precambrian weathering profile in this core in many boreholes drilling typically stopped when the first signs of precambrian basement rock are encountered and it is unclear if many of these wells finish in unaltered crystalline rock or overlying weathered basement complicating this is that material from the overlying mount simon may sluff downhole while basement rock is being drilled effectively smearing the stratigraphic contact in the sample materials recovered for this project we identified a precambrian basement stratigraphic unit in the boreholes studied if there was any indication of precambrian material in the samples whether reworked as clasts into the overlying mount simon or crystalline rock that is weathered or competent as defined herein the precambrian is geochemically enriched in potassium aluminum and iron as well as a suite of trace elements see section 4 3 below 4 2 mineralogy and trace element composition we identified iron sulfide e g pyrite and marcasite and iron hydr oxide e g hematite and goethite minerals in both the mount simon and eau claire formations tables 1 and 2 fig 7 appendix a these minerals based on available xrd data visual inspection of samples and or color observations are sometimes observed in the same cuttings interval or core horizon and are seen to alternate stratigraphically figs 8 11 furthermore co occurrence of sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals were observed in freshly retrieved drill core in the form of oxidation rinds around sulfide nodules while drilling the kulig quarry 62000231 core for example fig 7k l we have also observed that oxidation of iron sulfide minerals has occurred since this core was drilled in the summer of 2017 and similarly the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core drilled in 1996 appears to have undergone oxidative processes for decades which has resulted in the formation of sulfate minerals e g gypsum encrusting portions of the core further in both of these cores this oxidation only exists on the outside and is not present on freshly broken surfaces which show reduced mineralogies for cuttings given the smaller fragment size of rock material and therefore more surface area and in some cases decades since the wells were drilled it is difficult to determine if the oxide minerals observed during visual inspection are pre or post drilling mineral phases in general pxrf elemental profiles collected on drill cores show more variation than those collected from cuttings which tend to have smoother trends in elemental concentration changes through the borehole visual comparison of pxrf and available icp ms data figs 8 11 suggests that for the most part pxrf accurately captured elemental concentrations for the elements of interest one notable exception is that in both the eau claire and mount simon formations pxrf analysis appears to overestimate the concentration of uranium relative to icp ms figs 8 11 however direct comparison of pxrf and icp ms analyses should be done with caution because the material analyzed was not necessarily the same for each sample see section 5 2 below our geochemical and mineralogical analyses indicate that a variety of trace elements are present in both the eau claire and mount simon formations which upon visual inspection of the pxrf elemental plots and xrd data figs 8 11 are associated with clay sulfide and oxide minerals the majority of trace element concentration variability corresponds with the concentration of aluminum al and potassium k which are proxies for clay mineral content in these lithologic matrices zambito et al 2017b this correspondence is observed in all wells studied and stratigraphic units identified including alluvium colluvium eau claire and mount simon formations and precambrian basement because most of the wells are cased through the alluvium colluvium sediment we did not focus high resolution elemental or mineralogical analyses on these sediments likewise although a few xrd and icp ms analyses were undertaken on the precambrian basement rock and overlying paleosol in the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core fig 11 we do not discuss these in detail and instead the reader is referred to the recent study of this interval by medaris et al 2018 because the analyses herein are consistent with that work in the eau claire and mount simon formations the highest trace element concentrations observed through icp ms analysis and the minerals with which these elevated values occur are shown in table 2 these are often associated with sulfide and partially oxidized sulfide minerals however there is not a clear relationship between mineralogy and trace element composition for all elements in a general sense the lithologies of the eau claire and mount simon formation samples analyzed can be divided into three categories 1 fine to coarse grained quartz sandstone cemented and or coated with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations that typically include some combination of pyrite marcasite hematite and or goethite 2 shale and shaly sandstone associations that include various colored shales interlaminated shale and sandstone and bioturbated shale stringers or wisps in sandstone and 3 sandstone that is also various colors and sometimes cross bedded the concentration of the trace elements studied sometimes exhibit a relationship with these lithologic categories trace metals that have their highest concentrations associated with sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals include copper cu molybdenum mo and lead pb tables 1 and 2 an anomalously high cu value of 9340 0 ppm was observed in a marcasite cemented sandstone fig 7m n and values of 196 5 394 0 and 527 0 ppm fig 7c d e f o p q are seen in other samples with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations lower cu concentrations between 2 96 and 82 2 ppm are observed in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples likewise the highest mo value observed 20 5 ppm is in a marcasite cemented sandstone fig 7m n and values of 1 37 2 35 and 4 14 ppm fig 7c d e f o p q are associated with the same cu rich samples containing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals all other mo values are below 0 53 ppm and occur in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples with the exception of a pb concentration of 228 0 ppm in a single shaly sandstone sample with no sulfide or iron hydr oxide minerals identified flambeau mining co core sample 266 3 ft or 81 87 m all sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral samples have the highest pb concentrations observed 36 2 241 0 ppm and all other pb values are 4 46 23 9 ppm and seen in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples elevated trace metal concentrations that mostly correspond to shale and shaly sandstone lithologies include chromium cr strontium sr and vanadium v the highest cr concentration 115 0 ppm occurs in an interlaminated shale and sandstone and cr concentrations are consistently highest in shale and shaly sandstone with only a few exceptions tables 2 and 3 similarly the highest sr concentration 533 0 ppm occurs in bioturbated sandstone with shale stringers and overall higher sr concentrations occur in shale and shaly sandstone with the notable exception of concentrations of 128 5 and 294 0 ppm occurring with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations fig 7c f however other sulfide oxide samples have relatively low sr concentrations of 13 85 ppm and 23 0 ppm fig 7m q the highest v concentration 178 0 ppm occurs in an interlaminated shale and sandstone and other elevated values are also associated with shale and shaly sandstone the remaining elements of interest which include arsenic as cobalt co manganese mn nickel ni phosphorus p uranium u and zinc zn do not have a clear correspondence to the lithologic categories outlined above tables 1 and 2 for example the highest concentration of as 137 5 ppm is found in a stratiform potentially vug filling rusty sulfide nodule fig 7e f but all other values observed are less than 7 0 ppm the highest of which between 6 0 and 7 0 ppm are seen in pyrite cemented sandstone as well as bioturbated gray and orange shale stringers in quartz sandstone the highest co concentration 105 5 ppm is observed in a somewhat stratiform pyrite nodule in bioturbated sand and mudstone fig 7c d however co concentrations of 1 31 39 7 ppm occur in other sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral samples and range from 1 52 24 0 ppm and 0 51 17 35 ppm in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone respectively elevated concentrations of mn are inconsistently distributed between sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 8 0 167 0 ppm shale and shaly sandstone 15 7 276 0 ppm and sandstone 4 4 165 0 ppm samples the concentration of ni is overall lowest in sandstone samples 0 7 16 05 ppm but otherwise varies in samples of sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 5 73 86 1 ppm and shale shaly sandstone 0 84 87 9 ppm likewise p concentrations vary among the major lithologic categories ranging from 50 0 ppm to 1 in sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 70 0 5370 0 ppm in shale and shaly sandstone and 30 0 2980 0 ppm in sandstone overall the u concentrations are lower in the sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 0 38 2 59 ppm and variably in shale and shaly sandstone 0 81 4 91 ppm and sandstone 0 46 5 19 ppm samples finally the highest zn concentration 86 3 ppm occurs in a pyrite cemented sandstone fig 7c d but ranges from 11 7 23 0 ppm in other sulfide and iron hydr oxide samples is variable in shale and shaly sandstone 3 1 64 7 ppm samples and is overall lowest in sandstone samples 1 4 6 4 ppm 5 discussion 5 1 recognition of stratigraphic units the determination of stratigraphic units presented herein figs 3 6 and 8 11 based on a compilation of previously unavailable geochemical and natural gamma log data core samples and a better understanding of the regional geology of the study area e g zambito et al 2018 differs from some previous subsurface stratigraphic interpretations see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for unpublished wgnhs geologic logs referenced herein and note that the geologic map used in fig 2 is at the 1 250 000 scale these differences are mostly related to the position of the eau claire mount simon and the mount simon precambrian basement contacts in older well logs and the stratigraphic columns presented here it is recommended that future groundwater models in the study area use the revised stratigraphic picks determined herein using a larger stratigraphic toolset and regional geologic framework natural gamma logs are one new dataset that we used these are useful for boreholes in which only cuttings or incomplete core are available because the gamma log is a continuous downhole dataset fig 10 herein as well as appendix a in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission in general natural gamma radiation counts correspond to pxrf potassium profiles and less so for uranium suggesting that gamma radiation may be sourced from potassium present in muscovite and or potassium feldspar as shown in table 1 both are common in these samples in some boreholes we observe some offset in pxrf data and gamma logs which we attribute to the depth range that cuttings samples represent i e collected at 5 ft intervals and plotted at the mid point of the sample range it does not appear that variations in sample preparation of cuttings for pxrf analysis hindered chemostratigraphic determination of formations and as a whole the integrated subsurface stratigraphic framework presented herein is a vast improvement over previous basic geologic logs 5 2 sample preparation and type differences in pxrf and icp ms values elemental profiles determined for drill cores show more variation than those for cuttings which have smoother trends in elemental concentration changes figs 8 11 we attribute this difference to the sample type and pxrf techniques employed as described in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission all cuttings samples possess some degree of rock homogenization over a depth interval in contrast core analyses were undertaken on an area with a radius of 8 mm therefore the variability seen in the core versus cuttings pxrf profiles represents the lithologic variability seen in the rocks at the centimeter scale compare figs 3 7 we assume this is why elevated concentrations of both iron and sulfur are associated with pyrite nodules in core because these nodules were analyzed by pxrf directly and why iron and sulfur pxrf data from cuttings are noisier any pyrite present has been mixed with rock matrix material similarly samples collected from older boreholes drilled with the cable tool method tend to have smoother trends than samples from boreholes drilled by mud rotary zambito et al in review data in brief co submission this may be because samples from the older boreholes are collected once the entire typically 5 ft interval has been drilled rather than collected as a grab sample while that 5 ft interval is being drilled using mud rotary another possibility is that any impurities in the polypropylene film used when analyzing cuttings but not cores is adding a background elemental concentration to all of the cuttings samples that somehow smooths the signal but we suggest this is less likely than the effects of obvious well cutting sample homogenization or grab samples as polypropylene film impurities are negligible zambito et al in review data in brief co submission visual comparison of pxrf with the available icp ms data see figs 10 and 11 suggests that generally pxrf accurately captured elemental concentrations for the elements of interest differences are likely due to the different regions analyzed for cores the 8 mm area radius for pxrf comes from the surface of the core whereas icp ms sample powders were drilled from the core itself and therefore include material from below the core surface furthermore the spot analyzed by pxrf on the core face was not the exact same spot from which sample powders were collected zambito et al 2016 noted that for most elements pxrf is generally accurate but in many cases overestimates concentrations when compared to icp ms for samples from the tunnel city and wonewoc formations which are lithologically similar to the eau claire and mount simon formations respectively however in this study these comparisons are tentative because pxrf and icp ms analyses were not undertaken at all of the same depths and when they were the same exact material was not analyzed furthermore calibration methods for xrf elemental data vary and different methods are suitable depending on the importance of absolute concentrations for the questions being answered gregory et al 2019 5 3 mineralogy and trace element composition geochemical and mineralogical analyses show that trace elements and redox sensitive sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are present in the eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system high resolution analyses of samples using icp ms and xrd further confirm that these sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are trace element bearing and therefore a potential natural source of groundwater quality issues while we recognize the sulfide minerals pyrite and marcasite using xrd the trace elements observed such as cu zn pb sr may be indicative of unrecognized microscopic phases of chalcopyrite sphalerite galena and celestine as observed in previous studies luczaj et al 2016 hischke 2018 complicating a straightforward interpretation of the relationship of trace element geochemistry with mineralogy is that some of the sulfide minerals analyzed are closely associated with iron hydr oxide minerals an example of this is the partially oxidized trace element enriched pyrite nodule sampled from the kulig quarry core at a depth of 21 5 ft 6 55 m as seen in fig 7e and f see also table 2 in this sample we cannot determine if the trace metals are occurring in a reduced pyrite mineral phase oxidized goethite and hematite mineral phase or both and therefore under what groundwater redox conditions these trace elements may go into solution the presence of iron hydr oxide minerals in this sample and throughout kulig quarry core and its close proximity to land surface and the water table indicates that the pyrite and any other sulfides present is likely actively oxidizing figs 5 and 10 support for the interpretation of active oxidation is also seen in blair city well 3 figs 3 and 8 where the transition between brownish red oxidized lithologies and gray reduced lithologies occurs near the water table zambito et al 2018 plate 2 therein also described various cores from the study area that show oxidized mineralogies at and above the water table and reduced mineralogies below this interpretation of active oxidation can be contrasted with the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core that contains strata well below the water table and is nearly all gray in color and therefore still reduced fig 6 as well as the cuttings from the whitehall city well which generally show a similar color pattern fig 4 oxidation potential seems to be related to lithology with the shalier portions of the eau claire formation remaining more reduced hence grayish color than sandier intervals hence reddish color when in proximity to land surface fig 5 it is unclear if the presence of the iron hydrated sulfate minerals ferricopiapite and poitevinite in some of the deepest samples fig 7m q is a result of subsurface or post drilling oxidation regardless we assume that under oxidizing subsurface conditions the trace element enrichments in these sulfides may be introduced into groundwater in a dissolved phase of course some portion of these trace elements such as arsenic may become incorporated into resulting iron hydr oxides through sorption and therefore groundwater ph is an important parameter in understanding potential groundwater contamination schreiber et al 2000 5 4 sulfide mineral origin and oxidation the highest cu pb and zn concentrations occur in association with the minerals marcasite and pyrite table 2 this association as well as the sulfide mineral morphology observed in cores nodules vug fills and stratiform cementation as seen in fig 7 suggest mississippi valley type mvt sulfide mineralization in the study area even though most occurrences of this mineralization type occurs well to the south the study area is at the edge of observed southwestern wisconsin mvt mineralization see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 recognition of mvt mineralization in the study area has important implications for understanding groundwater quality as a variety of trace elements are known from mvt sulfide minerals both regionally and globally luczaj et al 2016 luczaj and huang 2018 wang et al 2018 furthermore a variety of trace element sources basin and precambrian basement sourced brines are suggested for local mvt mineralization thereby providing various sources for trace element enrichment luczaj 2006 field et al 2018 luczaj and huang 2018 the presence of hematite and goethite in a number of samples the prevalence of oxidized mineralogies near the water table and land surface relative to reduced mineralogies at depth as well as the visual observation of iron hydr oxide cemented burrow infills figs 5 7 may indicate that sulfide minerals were previously more common in the eau claire and mount simon formations and have been oxidized this interpretation is based on the premise that iron hydr oxides are found with sulfides near the water table as described above and that these burrows were likely pyritized during early diagenesis associated with the depositional environment it should also be noted that while zn is typically associated with mvt mineralization in the study area seawater derived pyrite is also a major host of zn hu et al 2018 therefore some sulfides and their trace element enrichments may be sourced from cambrian seawater through early diagenetic cementation though more work is needed to test this idea 5 5 implications for water quality and contamination sources while basement rocks are heterogenous across the upper mississippi valley van schmus et al 2007 many of the rock units studied are relatively continuous sheet sandstones representing similar depositional environments across a large area dott et al 1986 runkel et al 1998 2007 2012b therefore the potential for groundwater quality issues related to trace element bearing sulfide and hydr oxide minerals in the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system observed in the study area is of regional concern this is further supported by our interpretation that sulfides have a mvt origin which is a regional feature across parts of southwestern wisconsin illinois iowa and minnesota see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 as well as eastern wisconsin luczaj 2006 luczaj et al 2016 for most of the trace elements of interest either the highest observed concentrations occur in sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations e g as co cu mo p pb and zn or concentrations observed in these minerals are relatively elevated compared to the concentration ranges observed for shale shaly sandstone and sandstone e g cr ni sr and v only mn and v consistently occur in relatively low concentrations in sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations this suggests that the majority of these trace elements may have a pathway into groundwater from sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals during fluctuating redox and ph conditions as seen in similar hydrogeological scenarios schreiber et al 2000 sandstone and perhaps shaly sandstone with or without sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral cements may also chemically weather during fluctuating redox conditions given their inherent pore space and therefore increased surface area conversely trace element enrichments in shale and some shaly sandstone are likely relatively inert to redox fluctuations given the lower porosity and permeability of these lithologies and the likelihood that some trace metals e g cr sr and v are probably incorporated into chemically inert clay minerals with regard to the conceptual models for changes to groundwater quality presented in fig 1 the data compiled and presented herein provide a good starting point for mitigating and preventing potential natural sources of groundwater quality issues wisconsin has well established well casing and completion requirements for the northeastern part of the state in order to limit trace element contamination of groundwater and based on the results herein similar recommendations are made for the study area in the study area active well construction currently varies with some active shallow drinking water wells finished in alluvium colluvium and the casing of other wells finished in bedrock near or above the water table see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission casing wells below the water table and into the mount simon formation should limit the withdrawal of water from parts of the aquifer that are more prone to water table fluctuations such casing if past the water table through the eau claire formation and deeply into the sandstone of the underlying mount simon formation aquifer will isolate pumped groundwater from any potential trace elements released through water able fluctuation well drillers should also note that the mount simon formation is not a homogenous sandstone aquifer and has been subdivided into various hydrostratigraphic units in nearby chippewa county which should be considered during well construction parsen et al 2019 notably the use of mud rotary drilling will introduce less oxygen into the subsurface than air rotary finally as wells are drilled and intersect the crystalline basement rock or overlying weathered material it may be appropriate to back fill the wells to ensure that water is not withdrawn from basement rocks given with elevated trace metal concentrations which include the highest mn and ni values observed as well as relatively high concentrations of co sr and v table 2 indeed natural contamination of groundwater by trace elements sourced from basement rock at one of the hi crush mine wells has been detected personal communication d johnson wisconsin dnr 2017 as discussed above the presence of both reduced pyrite and marcasite and oxidized goethite and hematite minerals in the eau claire formation when present are near the land surface suggests that sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are actively breaking down due to fluctuations of the water table fig 1 this process is one explanation for the observed trace elements in groundwater in the study area especially those that occurred pre land use change masarik et al 2006 freihofer and mcginley 2009 hackenmueller et al 2018 this study in combination with the observation of zambito et al 2019 that redox reaction with sulfides in overlying the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system has led to trace element contamination of groundwater as well indicates that naturally occurring trace element bearing mvt sulfides and iron hydr oxides are prevalent and a source of groundwater contamination in the study area given the impetus of this study the question remaining is how can naturally occurring sources be distinguished from potential industrial sand mine sources of trace elements when in both cases the trace element bearing minerals have a mvt origin ultimately the site specific characteristics of a given well well construction pumping recharge rates aquifer mineralogy and trace element composition proximity to an industrial sand mine groundwater flow paths etc will all determine if groundwater contamination occurs and if so the potential sources therefore depending on well construction it may not be possible to differentiate trace element contamination sources regardless of the source s use in the study area of the well construction recommendations provided above which are similar to those utilized with success in northeastern wisconsin should mitigate current or future pumping of trace element contaminated groundwater and in the vast majority of cases eliminate naturally occurring contaminants as a potential source given the potential for groundwater contamination private and municipal well operators in the region should regularly test their water for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph 5 6 future research this study focused on identifying the presence of trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system of central trempealeau county and has confirmed their existence well specific examination of the relationship between water level and trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals is an important next step in determining mechanisms for redox reactions and the potential release of trace elements future work should also consider the volumetric ratio of sulfide iron hydr oxide minerals to host rock in order to understand the amount of trace elements that are available to go into solution as well as conduct leaching experiments to constrain the biogeochemical pathways of trace elements from sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals to groundwater for example see haas 2021 this could better inform whether potential future groundwater quality issues are sourced from fluctuating groundwater redox weathering of naturally occurring trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals or potential groundwater quality issues from an industrial surface source see hypothetical model in fig 1c if possible isolation and trace element analysis of different sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral phases as well as the use of isotopic analysis to confirm mineral origin would also enhance future investigations although costlier than pxrf data icp ms analysis should be utilized in related projects in order to determine the concentration of elements that naturally occur but are problematic to the pxrf such as chromium cobalt nickel phosphorus and vanadium a detailed pxrf standards study preferably with a standard for quartz sandstone matrices with both reduced and oxidized cements and varying trace element compositions should also be part of any future study finally the combination of pxrf icp ms and xrd was a useful and efficient methodological approach for producing a high resolution stratigraphic framework and identifying trace element bearing sulfides and iron hydr oxides in this study 6 conclusions trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals occur in the eau claire and mount simon formations in west central wisconsin and are most likely related to regional mvt mineralization these minerals are susceptible to chemical weathering during redox fluctuations and observations suggest that this is actively occurring at near the land surface and in the vicinity of the water table casing wells below the water table and into the mount simon formation should limit the withdrawal of water from parts of the aquitard aquifer system that are more prone to variable redox conditions these results also indicate that private well owners utilizing this aquitard aquifer system should regularly test their water for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph in order to determine if sulfide and or iron hydr oxide trace element leaching is occurring this dataset provides a baseline of aquifer mineralogy and geochemistry that can provide insight into subsurface stratigraphy as well as both existing and potential future aquifer water quality issues the approach to aquifer mineralogical and trace element characterization employed in this study could provide insight into preventing water quality issues in other sandstone aquifers data availability all data are available either in this

1315,naturally sourced groundwater quality issues are common but there is rarely a geochemical and mineralogical dataset of aquifer properties for comparison this study utilizes geochemical and mineralogical data to characterize naturally occurring minerals that are potential groundwater contaminants in the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system of west central wisconsin u s a a high resolution portable x ray fluorescence elemental analysis was used for initial characterization of geochemistry and chemostratigraphy of well cutting and drill core samples then a subset of sample materials was analyzed mineralogically and geochemically using xrd and icp ms respectively elevated concentrations of arsenic phosphorous strontium and various metals within the aquitard aquifer sandstone were identified mostly associated with sulfide minerals and iron hydr oxides and suggestive of mississippi valley type mineralization similar elemental contaminants in surface and groundwater in the study area indicate that the observed trace element bearing minerals are a natural source of groundwater contamination most likely through release into groundwater during fluctuating redox and ph conditions near the water table co occurrence of iron hydr oxide coated sulfide minerals near the water table and observations of sulfide oxidation post drilling suggests sulfides in these units are actively oxidizing well construction recommendations based on these results should mitigate current or future pumping of trace element contaminated groundwater and in the vast majority of cases eliminate naturally occurring contaminants as a potential source this study provides an extensive baseline dataset of aquifer mineralogy and trace element composition and an efficient approach for data collection that is necessary for interpreting and attributing possible future groundwater quality issues keywords sulfide water quality frac sand arsenic groundwater contaminants portable x ray fluorescence 1 introduction 1 1 scope of study groundwater quality issues related to trace element contamination can be sourced from naturally occurring minerals within the aquifer rock schreiber et al 2000 kim et al 2002 gotkowitz et al 2004 gonzalez et al 2005 zambito et al 2019 introduced to the groundwater system from a variety of anthropogenically derived surface sources like fly ash theis et al 1978 kopsick and angino 1981 or even released from naturally occurring iron hydr oxides during the anaerobic biodegradation of a crude oil contaminated aquifer cozzarelli et al 2015 ziegler et al 2021 identifying the source of groundwater contamination is challenging as the relationship between surface and groundwater is complex and controlled by climate geology and topography winter 1999 manning et al 2013 in west central wisconsin the focus of this study and where the primary source of drinking water is groundwater the recent combination of an increased number of high capacity wells and the introduction of large scale industrial sand mining has resulted in a thirst for knowledge about water quantity and quality by private land owners municipalities agricultural operations industry and academia parsen et al 2019 zambito et al 2019 as is often the case it can be difficult to attribute water quality issues to land use changes when widespread water quality analyses were not routinely performed prior to such change and or when there is a potential natural source of groundwater contamination the current study area is affected by both of these problems while some groundwater testing was undertaken prior to land use changes and found pre land use change instances of groundwater contamination once changes began private land owners municipalities agricultural operations industry and academia all increased the amount of surface and groundwater quality data they were collecting which expectedly also showed instances of contamination at the same time as water testing increased a variety of geologic studies were also undertaken to understand industrial sand resource distribution as well as aquifer sandstone characteristics with the goal of identifying any potential naturally occurring sources of groundwater contamination runkel et al 2012a zambito et al 2018 2019 to ultimately understand if groundwater contamination is a result of naturally occurring contaminants and or the result of land use change the timing of groundwater testing relative to land use changes as well as any potential natural sources of contamination in the aquifer itself must all be taken into account this study takes the novel approach of testing and constraining multiple working hypotheses for groundwater contamination in the study area while also creating an extensive baseline dataset of aquifer mineralogy and trace metal and other element composition that is necessary for mitigating current as well as preventing and attributing possible future groundwater quality issues through well construction recommendations to help constrain the source s of the observed groundwater contamination a dataset of redox sensitive sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system and their trace element composition has been constructed more specifically this study aims to provide a baseline dataset for determining if the observed trace element concentrations in trempealeau county west central wisconsin are sourced from naturally occurring minerals within the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system and or related to overlying industrial sand mining activities fig 1 1 2 regional groundwater quality issues a well understood case study of a bedrock source of groundwater contamination is the arsenic bearing iron sulfide mineralization zone in northeastern wisconsin schreiber et al 2000 a variety of studies in northeastern wisconsin have documented that naturally occurring arsenic nickel and cobalt bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals at the top of the ordovician st peter formation sandstone aquifer are the source of groundwater quality issues schreiber et al 2000 gotkowitz et al 2004 thornburg and sahai 2004 luczaj et al 2016 as groundwater is pumped from wells in this aquifer a cone of depression forms and depending on specific well conditions including static water level and elevation of specific mineralized horizons these minerals are no longer submerged below the water table in low dissolved oxygen groundwater rather they are exposed to relatively oxygen rich water and air oxidation reduction redox fluctuations caused by the cyclical rise and fall of the water table during repeated recharge and pumping cause the oxidation of sulfides and release of arsenic and sulfuric acid into the groundwater arsenic sorption onto newly formed iron hydr oxides and ultimately arsenic release from iron hydr oxides when groundwater attains a low ph schreiber et al 2000 in this situation the recommended remedy was to set well casing deeper into the aquifer below the arsenic bearing mineralization zone so that groundwater withdrawal is below and isolated from the contaminant source schreiber et al 2000 gotkowitz et al 2004 the sulfides present in northeastern wisconsin are related to mississippi valley type mvt mineralization which includes the emplacement of the minerals that include sphalerite galena and iron sulfides within paleozoic bedrock luczaj 2006 luczaj et al 2016 2018 hischke 2018 in wisconsin mvt mineralization not only occurs in the northeastern part of the state but is also prevalent though with a different geologic history in the southwest and extending into illinois iowa and minnesota see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 it is also worth noting that aquifer storage and recovery experiments conducted in northeastern wisconsin found that tunnel city group strata underlying the st peter was also a source of groundwater contamination with arsenic through oxidative dissolution of arsenic bearing sulfides dickoff 2010 jennings et al 2021 more recently the recognition by stewart et al 2021 that structural and hydrological changes in bedrock including fracture networks play a role in arsenic bearing mvt mineralization distribution and concentration in the cambrian aquifer indicates that there is much work to be done in understanding the distribution of mvt mineralization trace element contamination of groundwater from the oxidation of mvt mineralization is therefore a complex regional concern 1 3 groundwater quality in the study area our understanding of natural and or anthropogenically derived causes of groundwater quality issues in west central wisconsin is still in its infancy primarily because both of these sources can affect the same groundwater aquifer and the collection of groundwater quality data has only recently accelerated prior to recent land use changes masarik et al 2006 reported private wells with groundwater ph of 6 5 7 0 as well as wells contaminated with arsenic copper iron lead manganese and zinc in the northwest part of the study area where similar bedrock units are present a different pre land use change study summarized elevated phosphorus levels in surface water also in the northern part of the current study area freihofer and mcginley 2009 and a recent broader regional study that includes the study area found phosphorus concentrations in groundwater 1000 ppb as well as phosphorus present in bedrock iron magnesium oxides hackenmueller et al 2018 in the southern part of the study area zambito et al 2019 suggested that groundwater contamination of private wells in the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system by aluminum arsenic cadmium chromium cobalt copper iron lead manganese nickel sulfate vanadium and zinc was most likely a result of the oxidation of naturally occurring trace element bearing interpreted as likely mvt sulfide minerals furthermore zambito et al 2019 suggested that this sulfide oxidation was a regional concern that resulted in regionally low groundwater ph in west central wisconsin based on their observations of private well water ph as low as 4 08 as well as overall lower groundwater ph when considering average ph by county in a follow up study of pathways for trace metals from bedrock to groundwater haas 2021 demonstrated that oxidation of pyrite in the wonewoc formation sandstone which is lithologically similar to the mount simon sandstone of this study released metals into solution roughly in the order nickel cobalt manganese copper iron aluminum then zinc and lead through microbial activity under acidic conditions resulting from pyrite oxidation the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system is the primary target of industrial sand extraction in the study area and directly overlies the lithologically similar cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system that is the focus of this study fig 1 1 4 potential sources of groundwater contamination in the study area while naturally sourced groundwater contaminants clearly occur in west central wisconsin as outlined above the recent increase in industrial sand mining in the study area has caused alarm among private well owners and municipalities the vast majority of which are dependent on groundwater in the last 15 years the growth of large scale industrial frac sand mining in west central wisconsin has resulted in an increase in the number of high capacity wells for water used in the mining process in addition to those used for agriculture and municipal water supplies parsen and zambito 2014 zambito et al 2017a parsen et al 2019 the increased number of high capacity wells in the area has led to concerns about water table fluctuation and bedrock redox reactions that could liberate trace elements in groundwater similar to the process operating in northeastern wisconsin fig 1b parsen et al 2019 zambito et al 2019 if trace element bearing minerals are found in the cambrian eau claire mount simon sandstone aquitard aquifer system which is lithologically similar to the st peter aquifer of northeastern wisconsin a thorough documentation of their spatial and stratigraphic distribution is needed to mitigate trace element liberation through redox associated with water table fluctuation due to pumping or climate fig 1b another possible water quality concern is that the wonewoc formation sandstone mined for industrial sand and which directly overlies the aquitard aquifer system in west central wisconsin contains trace element bearing sulfide minerals as described above these have been suggested by zambito et al 2019 to be the source of groundwater quality issues in some private wells unlined ponds are often used on these mine sites for storage of storm water runoff process waters and settling of particulate and therefore there is a concern that trace elements released during the mining process may be transported to the aquifer through infiltration and seepage recharge fig 1c indeed water samples from process water ponds at industrial mine sites in the study area show concentrations of chromium copper lead nickel and zinc close to or above the estimated toxicity acute and or chronic for stream biota zambito et al 2019 therefore if trace metals and elements are observed in groundwater samples but not present in the local aquitard aquifer system sandstone this would indicate groundwater quality issues from an external source surface contaminant given that extracted sand resources host sulfide bearing trace elements and these elements can make their way into solution during the mining process nearby sand mines should then be considered as a possible source of trace element contamination for that reason it is necessary to characterize the baseline geochemical and mineralogical composition of the aquitard aquifer system sandstone to be able to constrain possible sources of contamination 1 5 goals and outcomes of this study the research presented herein addresses concerns regarding groundwater quality issues improves the subsurface stratigraphic framework and provides a high resolution spatial and stratigraphic dataset of aquitard aquifer system geochemical and mineralogical composition in central trempealeau county wisconsin fig 2 we focus on identifying both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system and their trace elemental composition these data provide baseline information for understanding if redox sensitive minerals in the study area can be natural sources for groundwater quality issues for example arsenic can be found in both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals and therefore oxidizing and reducing conditions respectively as well as ph changes may release this arsenic schreiber et al 2000 kim et al 2002 anawar et al 2003 akai et al 2004 korte and fernando 1991 these data are also necessary in order to constrain the source s of potential groundwater contamination i e aquifer aquitard and or sand mine sourced contaminants as a broader outcome this study outlines an approach to aquifer mineralogical and trace element characterization that combines easily collected large elemental datasets from a variety of subsurface materials using a handheld x ray fluorescence elemental analysis with subsequent focused and highly informed trace element and mineralogical study as detailed below this study has identified both sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals within the aquitard aquifer system that are associated with the presence of trace elements in appreciable amounts in addition to arsenic we observed elevated concentrations relative to other samples of varying lithology mineralogy of chromium cobalt copper lead molybdenum nickel phosphorus strontium vanadium and zinc these trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are often found in close proximity to each other in the samples studied for example as iron hydr oxide rims on sulfide minerals while this makes it difficult to identify the mineral phase of trace element enrichment it does suggest that redox reactions have occurred and or are actively occurring and therefore natural sources of groundwater quality issues are a pressing concern in the study area based on these results it is recommended that well casing be set to a depth below the oxidation front associated with the water table during new well construction in the study area this depth would be site specific by determining the water table fluctuation and corresponding exposure to oxygen in the subsurface the updated subsurface stratigraphic framework presented herein will aid in constructing groundwater models to aid in well construction and groundwater modeling has recently received renewed interest in the study region in part because of increased industrial sand mining parsen et al 2019 it is also recommended that private and municipal well operators in the region regularly test groundwater for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph in regard to identifying aquifer aquitard versus sand mine sourced contaminants future work should be undertaken at the local site specific level and focus on flow path studies individual well construction and water table positions and geochemical fingerprinting of trace elements and sulfides for example isotopes 2 geologic setting the heavily dissected landscape of the study region is a common feature of the driftless area of the upper mississippi valley and controlled by the bedrock geology figs 1 and 2 brown 1988 see zambito et al 2018 for lithologic and thickness details of bedrock units the highest ridges in trempealeau county are capped by the fairly weathering resistant sandy dolostone of the prairie du chien group up to 38 m thick that overlies sandstone and dolostone of the trempealeau group also 38 m thick smaller ridges are capped by the slightly less resistant lower tunnel city group glauconitic and shaly dolostone and dolomitic sandstone total thickness of the tunnel city group is 45 m slopes of the smaller hills are comprised of weakly cemented wonewoc formation sandstone 45 m thick the hill bases and floors of larger valleys are in the upper part of the eau claire formation total thickness of the eau claire formation is 36 m the underlying mount simon formation and precambrian basement are only found in the subsurface in the study area mount simon formation is up to 114 m thick but that thickness varies based on precambrian basement surface relief the wonewoc formation is the primary industrial quartz sand resource in this region as it is present and easily extractable at the land surface figs 1 and 2 parsen and zambito 2014 zambito et al 2017a the underlying eau claire formation generally acts as an aquitard due to its higher clay content and dolomite cement aswasereelert et al 2008 though it does have sandier portions in the study area which provide aquifer like properties the mount simon formation below the eau claire is a porous sandstone with intermittent shalier intervals driese et al 1981 the mount simon formation is the primary bedrock aquifer for high capacity groundwater wells that are used for municipalities agriculture and industry in the study area the mount simon formation directly overlies the low to impermeable crystalline or clay rich weathered crystalline precambrian units medaris et al 2018 the geochemical and mineralogical data presented in this study comes from bedrock and any overlying soil or alluvial colluvial deposits present in central trempealeau county wisconsin fig 2 the bedrock units present in the boreholes include the precambrian crystalline and weathered crystalline rock in the deepest boreholes and the cambrian approximately 500 million year old mount simon eau claire and wonewoc formations of the elk mound group figs 1 and 2 these cambrian units were deposited over a vast area in shallow marine littoral and fluvial depositional environments along a broad submarine depositional ramp with an onshore offshore profile from modern day northeast to southwest driese et al 1981 dott et al 1986 runkel et al 1998 2007 2012b soil and sediment overlying the bedrock are lumped together as alluvial colluvial in this study these sediments were deposited by a combination of proglacial meltwater modern and ancient fluvial eroded hillslope derived and eolian processes thwaites 1964 muldoon and craven 1998 cates 2001 mason et al 2019 these alluvial colluvial deposits are primarily composed of medium sand or gravel of reworked sandstone and dolostone from the eroding ridge and hillsides a generalized 1 100 000 scale water table elevation map for trempealeau county was produced by muldoon and crave 1998 at the scale produced it is not considered definitive for site specific applications which would include this study water table elevations used herein come directly from well construction reports see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission which as noted by muldoon and craven 1998 are locally variable regardless in most of the wells studied which are located on the valley floor the water table is near the surface see also muldoon and craven 1998 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials and methods introduction the geochemical and mineralogical data presented herein are focused on the aquitard aquifer system cambrian sandstone in the study area specifically in the vicinity of whitehall wisconsin the county seat of trempealeau county figs 1 and 2 preliminary portable x ray fluorescence data were collected from core and cutting samples from 22 boreholes fig 2 zambito et al in review data in brief co submission based on this preliminary study herein we detail the results of pxrf x ray diffraction xrd and elemental analysis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms from a subset of boreholes that includes five cutting sets and two cores fig 2 the cuttings and cores from the 22 boreholes are currently stored at the wisconsin geological and natural history survey wgnhs two of the cutting sets blair city well 3 wgnhs well id 62000007 and whitehall city well wgnhs well id 62000022 were previously washed and curated and together contain the entire stratigraphic succession of the mount simon formation aquifer the two cores kulig quarry core wgnhs well id 62000231 and flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core wgnhs well id 62000119 also together contain the entire stratigraphic succession of the mount simon formation aquifer because cores allow high resolution in situ stratigraphic sampling the majority of mineralogical and geochemical analyses were undertaken on these materials furthermore sample type and preparation can influence these analyses and different samples represent different subsurface stratigraphic thicknesses zambito et al 2016 additionally samples of relatively fresh unwashed cuttings material from three wells at an industrial sand mine were also analyzed by xrd hi crush blair pw b1 pw b4 and pw b6 wgnhs well ids 62000207 62000209 and 62000211 respectively in addition to mineralogical and geochemical data for the mount simon aquifer xrd and icp ms data are also presented for the eau claire formation aquitard in part and the underlying precambrian crystalline basement the reader is referred to zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for a detailed description of well construction the sample materials examined how they were collected and stored and pxrf data and lithostratigraphic columns for 22 boreholes in the study area fig 1 while we describe the construction of these groundwater wells from available information specifically the depths of well casing and level of the water table observed at the time of drilling we are only aware of eight of these wells that are currently withdrawing potable water although five are withdrawing non potable water for industrial use in this study we present subsurface depths in both english and metric systems of measurement because these cores were drilled in the u s a where subsurface samples are marked in tenths of feet 3 2 geochemical and mineralogical analyses our previous work showing how pxrf elemental data can be used as a proxy for lithology and identifying intervals of interest for further analysis provided guidance on the suite of elements interpreted zambito et al 2016 2017b and 2018 herein we use aluminum potassium and silicon as a proxy for siliciclastic rocks quartz and feldspathic sandstone and clay minerals iron and sulfur together as a proxy for pyrite and other sulfides iron without sulfur as a proxy for iron hydr oxides and calcium and magnesium as a proxy for carbonate cements manganese phosphorus and strontium were also helpful for lithostratigraphic subdivision as these elements tended to correspond with shales and or carbonates for each borehole we identified stratigraphic units based on a combination of lithologic data pxrf geochemical data and when available wgnhs geologic logs and natural gamma radiation logs collected by downhole geophysical analysis all are available in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission initial elemental analysis was undertaken using a thermo fisher scientific niton xl3t goldd handheld portable x ray fluorescence pxrf analyzer with an 8 mm diameter sample window in testallgeo mode the analyzer was mounted in a lead lined benchtop stand the reader is referred to zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for further details of how pxrf data was collected following compilation of the pxrf elemental concentration results and observations on lithology and lithostratigraphy we selected a subset of samples of both sulfides and iron hydr oxides that represented the elemental and mineralogical variability within the geological successions observed we subsampled three of the most recently drilled cuttings sets hi crush blair pw b1 62000207 hi crush blair pw b4 62000209 and hi crush blair pw b6 62000211 as well as two rock cores kulig quarry 62000231 and flambeau mining co 96 1 1 62000119 for mineralogical identification and high precision elemental composition using xrd and icp ms respectively tables 1 and 2 appendix a while xrd analysis was undertaken on both cuttings and core icp ms analysis was restricted to core material in which we could better constrain the sedimentary context of the material being sampled material for these analyses was prepared by either sieving a portion of a well cuttings sample with a 1 68 mm mesh screen u s standard sieve size no 12 or using a tungsten carbide drill bit to sample powder from the rock cores the sieved or powdered samples were further pulverized using a silica based mortar and pestle if necessary in order to achieve a relatively fine grained homogenous sample the sampled material was then split for xrd and icp ms analysis individual mineral grains for single grain xrd analysis were not pulverized nor included in the split material these were removed from the sample prior to pulverization single grain xrd is preferable to xrd analysis of powdered samples with abundant quartz e g the mount simon formation because the signal for quartz typically swamps out or dominates the signal for other minerals such as pyrite or hematite see discussion in zambito et al 2019 the xrd analyses were undertaken using a rigaku rapid ii xrd system located in the university of wisconsin madison s department of geoscience a total of fourteen powdered and eighteen single grain xrd analyses were completed table 1 and appendix a for powdered sample analysis the powdered geologic sample was inserted into a 1 cm long polyamide kapton registered trademark of dupont cylindrical tube with a diameter of 1 mm and a wall thickness of 0 0205 0 5207 mm the ends of the tube were capped with play doh registered trademark of hasbro for single grain xrd analysis individual grains were picked either directly from the cuttings sample or the rock core or from sampling with a tungsten carbide drill bit these grains were then individually glued onto the end of a slitted kapton cylindrical tube using vacuum glue each powdered and single grain analyses were analyzed for a duration time of 15 to 20 min the xrd instrument was set to rotate the homogenized powder or single grain samples 360 degrees in phi at a rate of one degree per second rotation about a vertical axis the jade plus software package v9 5 0 10 19 2012 1995 2018 materials data inc was used to interpret the mineralogical profiles and recommended mineralogical assemblages of each sample according to the spectrum the relative abundance of each mineral present in the xrd spectrum was estimated by comparing the maximum peaks of each mineral identified in the spectrum since our main goal was to identify the sampled minerals particularly the sulfides and iron hydr oxides we did not quantify the abundance of the minerals present in each sample mineral identification was further confirmed by comparison to icp ms if available the icp ms analyses were performed by als global me ms61l super trace lowest dl 4a package at their reno nevada u s a and north vancouver british columbia canada facilities this method involves the digestion of sample material by four acids perchloric nitric hydrofluoric and hydrochloric ionization of the resulting solution and determination of ion concentration using a mass spectrometer icp ms allows for more accurate and precise results for elemental abundance of elements present in a geologic sample than what is capable by the pxrf instrument for example cobalt chromium phosphorus and vanadium pxrf measurements were determined to never be accurate and therefore pxrf data for those elements is not plotted see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission icp ms can also detect elements at lower concentrations than the pxrf instrument as demonstrated by zambito et al 2016 2019 who provide a comparison between the pxrf and icp ms approaches in case studies of lithologically similar cambrian sandstone from wisconsin 4 results 4 1 stratigraphic units lithology and recognition our stratigraphic determination of the mount simon eau claire and wonewoc formations as well as alluvium colluvium and precambrian crystalline basement in the boreholes studied is based on lithologic description of cuttings and core and elevations of any lithologic changes borehole gamma logs and qualitative comparison of pxrf major cation elemental profiles the color of the lithology was not used in determining lithostratigraphic units we observed that the colors brown orange and red were more common near land surface and the water table while blue and gray more typical of deeper subsurface samples regardless of stratigraphic unit figs 3 6 the mount simon formation is the main regional aquifer and consists of variably white gray tan red orange pink and blue shaly sandstone with interbedded shale beds typically colored green and or bluish gray the lower and middle mount simon tends to be shalier than the upper part of the formation as seen in the cutting and core images shown in figs 3 6 the strata near the eau claire mount simon formation contact has less interbedded mudstone and is also reddish orange in color while shalier intervals and or those found deeper in boreholes are typically gray and blue subdivision of the mount simon may be possible with the pxrf data available but will not be investigated further herein for example see subdivisions of driese et al 1981 the eau claire formation overlies the mount simon and has aquitard and aquifer characteristics it is similar in color and lithology to the mount simon though shalier and dolomitic at the contact between the mount simon and eau claire there is an increase in aluminum and potassium likely representing an increase in clay mineral presence and both calcium and magnesium representing carbonate minerals like calcite and dolomite the wonewoc formation which overlies the eau claire is seen only in a few wells from the hi crush blair mine site where the boreholes were drilled at a higher land surface elevation the wonewoc formation is present as a tannish orange and white quartz sandstone in the wells studied the wonewoc is unconformably overlain by the lithologically variable alluvium colluvium in cutting sets from some boreholes it was sometimes difficult to place the contact between the precambrian crystalline rocks and the overlying cambrian mount simon formation geologic logs available in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission from some wells that intersect this contact describe an interval of weathered precambrian rock that formed prior to the deposition of the mount simon formation approximately 500 million years ago weathered precambrian rocks that transition downward into competent crystalline rock are also seen in the drill core flambeau mining co 96 1 1 fig 6 see medaris et al 2018 for detailed analysis of the precambrian weathering profile in this core in many boreholes drilling typically stopped when the first signs of precambrian basement rock are encountered and it is unclear if many of these wells finish in unaltered crystalline rock or overlying weathered basement complicating this is that material from the overlying mount simon may sluff downhole while basement rock is being drilled effectively smearing the stratigraphic contact in the sample materials recovered for this project we identified a precambrian basement stratigraphic unit in the boreholes studied if there was any indication of precambrian material in the samples whether reworked as clasts into the overlying mount simon or crystalline rock that is weathered or competent as defined herein the precambrian is geochemically enriched in potassium aluminum and iron as well as a suite of trace elements see section 4 3 below 4 2 mineralogy and trace element composition we identified iron sulfide e g pyrite and marcasite and iron hydr oxide e g hematite and goethite minerals in both the mount simon and eau claire formations tables 1 and 2 fig 7 appendix a these minerals based on available xrd data visual inspection of samples and or color observations are sometimes observed in the same cuttings interval or core horizon and are seen to alternate stratigraphically figs 8 11 furthermore co occurrence of sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals were observed in freshly retrieved drill core in the form of oxidation rinds around sulfide nodules while drilling the kulig quarry 62000231 core for example fig 7k l we have also observed that oxidation of iron sulfide minerals has occurred since this core was drilled in the summer of 2017 and similarly the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core drilled in 1996 appears to have undergone oxidative processes for decades which has resulted in the formation of sulfate minerals e g gypsum encrusting portions of the core further in both of these cores this oxidation only exists on the outside and is not present on freshly broken surfaces which show reduced mineralogies for cuttings given the smaller fragment size of rock material and therefore more surface area and in some cases decades since the wells were drilled it is difficult to determine if the oxide minerals observed during visual inspection are pre or post drilling mineral phases in general pxrf elemental profiles collected on drill cores show more variation than those collected from cuttings which tend to have smoother trends in elemental concentration changes through the borehole visual comparison of pxrf and available icp ms data figs 8 11 suggests that for the most part pxrf accurately captured elemental concentrations for the elements of interest one notable exception is that in both the eau claire and mount simon formations pxrf analysis appears to overestimate the concentration of uranium relative to icp ms figs 8 11 however direct comparison of pxrf and icp ms analyses should be done with caution because the material analyzed was not necessarily the same for each sample see section 5 2 below our geochemical and mineralogical analyses indicate that a variety of trace elements are present in both the eau claire and mount simon formations which upon visual inspection of the pxrf elemental plots and xrd data figs 8 11 are associated with clay sulfide and oxide minerals the majority of trace element concentration variability corresponds with the concentration of aluminum al and potassium k which are proxies for clay mineral content in these lithologic matrices zambito et al 2017b this correspondence is observed in all wells studied and stratigraphic units identified including alluvium colluvium eau claire and mount simon formations and precambrian basement because most of the wells are cased through the alluvium colluvium sediment we did not focus high resolution elemental or mineralogical analyses on these sediments likewise although a few xrd and icp ms analyses were undertaken on the precambrian basement rock and overlying paleosol in the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core fig 11 we do not discuss these in detail and instead the reader is referred to the recent study of this interval by medaris et al 2018 because the analyses herein are consistent with that work in the eau claire and mount simon formations the highest trace element concentrations observed through icp ms analysis and the minerals with which these elevated values occur are shown in table 2 these are often associated with sulfide and partially oxidized sulfide minerals however there is not a clear relationship between mineralogy and trace element composition for all elements in a general sense the lithologies of the eau claire and mount simon formation samples analyzed can be divided into three categories 1 fine to coarse grained quartz sandstone cemented and or coated with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations that typically include some combination of pyrite marcasite hematite and or goethite 2 shale and shaly sandstone associations that include various colored shales interlaminated shale and sandstone and bioturbated shale stringers or wisps in sandstone and 3 sandstone that is also various colors and sometimes cross bedded the concentration of the trace elements studied sometimes exhibit a relationship with these lithologic categories trace metals that have their highest concentrations associated with sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals include copper cu molybdenum mo and lead pb tables 1 and 2 an anomalously high cu value of 9340 0 ppm was observed in a marcasite cemented sandstone fig 7m n and values of 196 5 394 0 and 527 0 ppm fig 7c d e f o p q are seen in other samples with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations lower cu concentrations between 2 96 and 82 2 ppm are observed in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples likewise the highest mo value observed 20 5 ppm is in a marcasite cemented sandstone fig 7m n and values of 1 37 2 35 and 4 14 ppm fig 7c d e f o p q are associated with the same cu rich samples containing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals all other mo values are below 0 53 ppm and occur in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples with the exception of a pb concentration of 228 0 ppm in a single shaly sandstone sample with no sulfide or iron hydr oxide minerals identified flambeau mining co core sample 266 3 ft or 81 87 m all sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral samples have the highest pb concentrations observed 36 2 241 0 ppm and all other pb values are 4 46 23 9 ppm and seen in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone samples elevated trace metal concentrations that mostly correspond to shale and shaly sandstone lithologies include chromium cr strontium sr and vanadium v the highest cr concentration 115 0 ppm occurs in an interlaminated shale and sandstone and cr concentrations are consistently highest in shale and shaly sandstone with only a few exceptions tables 2 and 3 similarly the highest sr concentration 533 0 ppm occurs in bioturbated sandstone with shale stringers and overall higher sr concentrations occur in shale and shaly sandstone with the notable exception of concentrations of 128 5 and 294 0 ppm occurring with sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations fig 7c f however other sulfide oxide samples have relatively low sr concentrations of 13 85 ppm and 23 0 ppm fig 7m q the highest v concentration 178 0 ppm occurs in an interlaminated shale and sandstone and other elevated values are also associated with shale and shaly sandstone the remaining elements of interest which include arsenic as cobalt co manganese mn nickel ni phosphorus p uranium u and zinc zn do not have a clear correspondence to the lithologic categories outlined above tables 1 and 2 for example the highest concentration of as 137 5 ppm is found in a stratiform potentially vug filling rusty sulfide nodule fig 7e f but all other values observed are less than 7 0 ppm the highest of which between 6 0 and 7 0 ppm are seen in pyrite cemented sandstone as well as bioturbated gray and orange shale stringers in quartz sandstone the highest co concentration 105 5 ppm is observed in a somewhat stratiform pyrite nodule in bioturbated sand and mudstone fig 7c d however co concentrations of 1 31 39 7 ppm occur in other sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral samples and range from 1 52 24 0 ppm and 0 51 17 35 ppm in shale shaly sandstone and sandstone respectively elevated concentrations of mn are inconsistently distributed between sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 8 0 167 0 ppm shale and shaly sandstone 15 7 276 0 ppm and sandstone 4 4 165 0 ppm samples the concentration of ni is overall lowest in sandstone samples 0 7 16 05 ppm but otherwise varies in samples of sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 5 73 86 1 ppm and shale shaly sandstone 0 84 87 9 ppm likewise p concentrations vary among the major lithologic categories ranging from 50 0 ppm to 1 in sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 70 0 5370 0 ppm in shale and shaly sandstone and 30 0 2980 0 ppm in sandstone overall the u concentrations are lower in the sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals 0 38 2 59 ppm and variably in shale and shaly sandstone 0 81 4 91 ppm and sandstone 0 46 5 19 ppm samples finally the highest zn concentration 86 3 ppm occurs in a pyrite cemented sandstone fig 7c d but ranges from 11 7 23 0 ppm in other sulfide and iron hydr oxide samples is variable in shale and shaly sandstone 3 1 64 7 ppm samples and is overall lowest in sandstone samples 1 4 6 4 ppm 5 discussion 5 1 recognition of stratigraphic units the determination of stratigraphic units presented herein figs 3 6 and 8 11 based on a compilation of previously unavailable geochemical and natural gamma log data core samples and a better understanding of the regional geology of the study area e g zambito et al 2018 differs from some previous subsurface stratigraphic interpretations see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission for unpublished wgnhs geologic logs referenced herein and note that the geologic map used in fig 2 is at the 1 250 000 scale these differences are mostly related to the position of the eau claire mount simon and the mount simon precambrian basement contacts in older well logs and the stratigraphic columns presented here it is recommended that future groundwater models in the study area use the revised stratigraphic picks determined herein using a larger stratigraphic toolset and regional geologic framework natural gamma logs are one new dataset that we used these are useful for boreholes in which only cuttings or incomplete core are available because the gamma log is a continuous downhole dataset fig 10 herein as well as appendix a in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission in general natural gamma radiation counts correspond to pxrf potassium profiles and less so for uranium suggesting that gamma radiation may be sourced from potassium present in muscovite and or potassium feldspar as shown in table 1 both are common in these samples in some boreholes we observe some offset in pxrf data and gamma logs which we attribute to the depth range that cuttings samples represent i e collected at 5 ft intervals and plotted at the mid point of the sample range it does not appear that variations in sample preparation of cuttings for pxrf analysis hindered chemostratigraphic determination of formations and as a whole the integrated subsurface stratigraphic framework presented herein is a vast improvement over previous basic geologic logs 5 2 sample preparation and type differences in pxrf and icp ms values elemental profiles determined for drill cores show more variation than those for cuttings which have smoother trends in elemental concentration changes figs 8 11 we attribute this difference to the sample type and pxrf techniques employed as described in zambito et al in review data in brief co submission all cuttings samples possess some degree of rock homogenization over a depth interval in contrast core analyses were undertaken on an area with a radius of 8 mm therefore the variability seen in the core versus cuttings pxrf profiles represents the lithologic variability seen in the rocks at the centimeter scale compare figs 3 7 we assume this is why elevated concentrations of both iron and sulfur are associated with pyrite nodules in core because these nodules were analyzed by pxrf directly and why iron and sulfur pxrf data from cuttings are noisier any pyrite present has been mixed with rock matrix material similarly samples collected from older boreholes drilled with the cable tool method tend to have smoother trends than samples from boreholes drilled by mud rotary zambito et al in review data in brief co submission this may be because samples from the older boreholes are collected once the entire typically 5 ft interval has been drilled rather than collected as a grab sample while that 5 ft interval is being drilled using mud rotary another possibility is that any impurities in the polypropylene film used when analyzing cuttings but not cores is adding a background elemental concentration to all of the cuttings samples that somehow smooths the signal but we suggest this is less likely than the effects of obvious well cutting sample homogenization or grab samples as polypropylene film impurities are negligible zambito et al in review data in brief co submission visual comparison of pxrf with the available icp ms data see figs 10 and 11 suggests that generally pxrf accurately captured elemental concentrations for the elements of interest differences are likely due to the different regions analyzed for cores the 8 mm area radius for pxrf comes from the surface of the core whereas icp ms sample powders were drilled from the core itself and therefore include material from below the core surface furthermore the spot analyzed by pxrf on the core face was not the exact same spot from which sample powders were collected zambito et al 2016 noted that for most elements pxrf is generally accurate but in many cases overestimates concentrations when compared to icp ms for samples from the tunnel city and wonewoc formations which are lithologically similar to the eau claire and mount simon formations respectively however in this study these comparisons are tentative because pxrf and icp ms analyses were not undertaken at all of the same depths and when they were the same exact material was not analyzed furthermore calibration methods for xrf elemental data vary and different methods are suitable depending on the importance of absolute concentrations for the questions being answered gregory et al 2019 5 3 mineralogy and trace element composition geochemical and mineralogical analyses show that trace elements and redox sensitive sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are present in the eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system high resolution analyses of samples using icp ms and xrd further confirm that these sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are trace element bearing and therefore a potential natural source of groundwater quality issues while we recognize the sulfide minerals pyrite and marcasite using xrd the trace elements observed such as cu zn pb sr may be indicative of unrecognized microscopic phases of chalcopyrite sphalerite galena and celestine as observed in previous studies luczaj et al 2016 hischke 2018 complicating a straightforward interpretation of the relationship of trace element geochemistry with mineralogy is that some of the sulfide minerals analyzed are closely associated with iron hydr oxide minerals an example of this is the partially oxidized trace element enriched pyrite nodule sampled from the kulig quarry core at a depth of 21 5 ft 6 55 m as seen in fig 7e and f see also table 2 in this sample we cannot determine if the trace metals are occurring in a reduced pyrite mineral phase oxidized goethite and hematite mineral phase or both and therefore under what groundwater redox conditions these trace elements may go into solution the presence of iron hydr oxide minerals in this sample and throughout kulig quarry core and its close proximity to land surface and the water table indicates that the pyrite and any other sulfides present is likely actively oxidizing figs 5 and 10 support for the interpretation of active oxidation is also seen in blair city well 3 figs 3 and 8 where the transition between brownish red oxidized lithologies and gray reduced lithologies occurs near the water table zambito et al 2018 plate 2 therein also described various cores from the study area that show oxidized mineralogies at and above the water table and reduced mineralogies below this interpretation of active oxidation can be contrasted with the flambeau mining co 96 1 1 core that contains strata well below the water table and is nearly all gray in color and therefore still reduced fig 6 as well as the cuttings from the whitehall city well which generally show a similar color pattern fig 4 oxidation potential seems to be related to lithology with the shalier portions of the eau claire formation remaining more reduced hence grayish color than sandier intervals hence reddish color when in proximity to land surface fig 5 it is unclear if the presence of the iron hydrated sulfate minerals ferricopiapite and poitevinite in some of the deepest samples fig 7m q is a result of subsurface or post drilling oxidation regardless we assume that under oxidizing subsurface conditions the trace element enrichments in these sulfides may be introduced into groundwater in a dissolved phase of course some portion of these trace elements such as arsenic may become incorporated into resulting iron hydr oxides through sorption and therefore groundwater ph is an important parameter in understanding potential groundwater contamination schreiber et al 2000 5 4 sulfide mineral origin and oxidation the highest cu pb and zn concentrations occur in association with the minerals marcasite and pyrite table 2 this association as well as the sulfide mineral morphology observed in cores nodules vug fills and stratiform cementation as seen in fig 7 suggest mississippi valley type mvt sulfide mineralization in the study area even though most occurrences of this mineralization type occurs well to the south the study area is at the edge of observed southwestern wisconsin mvt mineralization see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 recognition of mvt mineralization in the study area has important implications for understanding groundwater quality as a variety of trace elements are known from mvt sulfide minerals both regionally and globally luczaj et al 2016 luczaj and huang 2018 wang et al 2018 furthermore a variety of trace element sources basin and precambrian basement sourced brines are suggested for local mvt mineralization thereby providing various sources for trace element enrichment luczaj 2006 field et al 2018 luczaj and huang 2018 the presence of hematite and goethite in a number of samples the prevalence of oxidized mineralogies near the water table and land surface relative to reduced mineralogies at depth as well as the visual observation of iron hydr oxide cemented burrow infills figs 5 7 may indicate that sulfide minerals were previously more common in the eau claire and mount simon formations and have been oxidized this interpretation is based on the premise that iron hydr oxides are found with sulfides near the water table as described above and that these burrows were likely pyritized during early diagenesis associated with the depositional environment it should also be noted that while zn is typically associated with mvt mineralization in the study area seawater derived pyrite is also a major host of zn hu et al 2018 therefore some sulfides and their trace element enrichments may be sourced from cambrian seawater through early diagenetic cementation though more work is needed to test this idea 5 5 implications for water quality and contamination sources while basement rocks are heterogenous across the upper mississippi valley van schmus et al 2007 many of the rock units studied are relatively continuous sheet sandstones representing similar depositional environments across a large area dott et al 1986 runkel et al 1998 2007 2012b therefore the potential for groundwater quality issues related to trace element bearing sulfide and hydr oxide minerals in the cambrian eau claire mount simon aquitard aquifer system observed in the study area is of regional concern this is further supported by our interpretation that sulfides have a mvt origin which is a regional feature across parts of southwestern wisconsin illinois iowa and minnesota see heyl and west 1982 luczaj 2006 and symons et al 2010 as well as eastern wisconsin luczaj 2006 luczaj et al 2016 for most of the trace elements of interest either the highest observed concentrations occur in sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations e g as co cu mo p pb and zn or concentrations observed in these minerals are relatively elevated compared to the concentration ranges observed for shale shaly sandstone and sandstone e g cr ni sr and v only mn and v consistently occur in relatively low concentrations in sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral associations this suggests that the majority of these trace elements may have a pathway into groundwater from sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals during fluctuating redox and ph conditions as seen in similar hydrogeological scenarios schreiber et al 2000 sandstone and perhaps shaly sandstone with or without sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral cements may also chemically weather during fluctuating redox conditions given their inherent pore space and therefore increased surface area conversely trace element enrichments in shale and some shaly sandstone are likely relatively inert to redox fluctuations given the lower porosity and permeability of these lithologies and the likelihood that some trace metals e g cr sr and v are probably incorporated into chemically inert clay minerals with regard to the conceptual models for changes to groundwater quality presented in fig 1 the data compiled and presented herein provide a good starting point for mitigating and preventing potential natural sources of groundwater quality issues wisconsin has well established well casing and completion requirements for the northeastern part of the state in order to limit trace element contamination of groundwater and based on the results herein similar recommendations are made for the study area in the study area active well construction currently varies with some active shallow drinking water wells finished in alluvium colluvium and the casing of other wells finished in bedrock near or above the water table see zambito et al in review data in brief co submission casing wells below the water table and into the mount simon formation should limit the withdrawal of water from parts of the aquifer that are more prone to water table fluctuations such casing if past the water table through the eau claire formation and deeply into the sandstone of the underlying mount simon formation aquifer will isolate pumped groundwater from any potential trace elements released through water able fluctuation well drillers should also note that the mount simon formation is not a homogenous sandstone aquifer and has been subdivided into various hydrostratigraphic units in nearby chippewa county which should be considered during well construction parsen et al 2019 notably the use of mud rotary drilling will introduce less oxygen into the subsurface than air rotary finally as wells are drilled and intersect the crystalline basement rock or overlying weathered material it may be appropriate to back fill the wells to ensure that water is not withdrawn from basement rocks given with elevated trace metal concentrations which include the highest mn and ni values observed as well as relatively high concentrations of co sr and v table 2 indeed natural contamination of groundwater by trace elements sourced from basement rock at one of the hi crush mine wells has been detected personal communication d johnson wisconsin dnr 2017 as discussed above the presence of both reduced pyrite and marcasite and oxidized goethite and hematite minerals in the eau claire formation when present are near the land surface suggests that sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals are actively breaking down due to fluctuations of the water table fig 1 this process is one explanation for the observed trace elements in groundwater in the study area especially those that occurred pre land use change masarik et al 2006 freihofer and mcginley 2009 hackenmueller et al 2018 this study in combination with the observation of zambito et al 2019 that redox reaction with sulfides in overlying the cambrian tunnel city wonewoc aquifer aquitard system has led to trace element contamination of groundwater as well indicates that naturally occurring trace element bearing mvt sulfides and iron hydr oxides are prevalent and a source of groundwater contamination in the study area given the impetus of this study the question remaining is how can naturally occurring sources be distinguished from potential industrial sand mine sources of trace elements when in both cases the trace element bearing minerals have a mvt origin ultimately the site specific characteristics of a given well well construction pumping recharge rates aquifer mineralogy and trace element composition proximity to an industrial sand mine groundwater flow paths etc will all determine if groundwater contamination occurs and if so the potential sources therefore depending on well construction it may not be possible to differentiate trace element contamination sources regardless of the source s use in the study area of the well construction recommendations provided above which are similar to those utilized with success in northeastern wisconsin should mitigate current or future pumping of trace element contaminated groundwater and in the vast majority of cases eliminate naturally occurring contaminants as a potential source given the potential for groundwater contamination private and municipal well operators in the region should regularly test their water for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph 5 6 future research this study focused on identifying the presence of trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals in the aquitard aquifer system of central trempealeau county and has confirmed their existence well specific examination of the relationship between water level and trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals is an important next step in determining mechanisms for redox reactions and the potential release of trace elements future work should also consider the volumetric ratio of sulfide iron hydr oxide minerals to host rock in order to understand the amount of trace elements that are available to go into solution as well as conduct leaching experiments to constrain the biogeochemical pathways of trace elements from sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals to groundwater for example see haas 2021 this could better inform whether potential future groundwater quality issues are sourced from fluctuating groundwater redox weathering of naturally occurring trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals or potential groundwater quality issues from an industrial surface source see hypothetical model in fig 1c if possible isolation and trace element analysis of different sulfide and iron hydr oxide mineral phases as well as the use of isotopic analysis to confirm mineral origin would also enhance future investigations although costlier than pxrf data icp ms analysis should be utilized in related projects in order to determine the concentration of elements that naturally occur but are problematic to the pxrf such as chromium cobalt nickel phosphorus and vanadium a detailed pxrf standards study preferably with a standard for quartz sandstone matrices with both reduced and oxidized cements and varying trace element compositions should also be part of any future study finally the combination of pxrf icp ms and xrd was a useful and efficient methodological approach for producing a high resolution stratigraphic framework and identifying trace element bearing sulfides and iron hydr oxides in this study 6 conclusions trace element bearing sulfide and iron hydr oxide minerals occur in the eau claire and mount simon formations in west central wisconsin and are most likely related to regional mvt mineralization these minerals are susceptible to chemical weathering during redox fluctuations and observations suggest that this is actively occurring at near the land surface and in the vicinity of the water table casing wells below the water table and into the mount simon formation should limit the withdrawal of water from parts of the aquitard aquifer system that are more prone to variable redox conditions these results also indicate that private well owners utilizing this aquitard aquifer system should regularly test their water for trace metals arsenic phosphorus sulfate and ph in order to determine if sulfide and or iron hydr oxide trace element leaching is occurring this dataset provides a baseline of aquifer mineralogy and geochemistry that can provide insight into subsurface stratigraphy as well as both existing and potential future aquifer water quality issues the approach to aquifer mineralogical and trace element characterization employed in this study could provide insight into preventing water quality issues in other sandstone aquifers data availability all data are available either in this

1316,in arid and semi arid regions improper irrigation activities not only exacerbate water shortages but also lead to environmental pollution such as soil salinization that hinders crop growth and agricultural sustainability there has been a lack of agricultural water management tools that could support agricultural water management with salinization related grey water footprints being considered and associated uncertainties being addressed in this study salinization related grey water footprints were measured through accounting for relationships among irrigation soil salinity evapotranspiration and crop yield and then incorporated into an agricultural water management model for supporting environmentally sound irrigation decisions such an agricultural water management model was also characterized by a newly proposed generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp method that could address ratio problems of two objectives and dual uncertainties the developed methodology coupling the gfifp method and grey water footprints was applied to an irrigation region in northwestern china where water scarcity and soil salinization hindered local development five credibility levels corresponding to decision makers varied satisfactory degrees over water availability and nine weight coefficients of possibility and necessity measures were considered results showed that in order to reduce negative environmental impacts while increasing economic benefits more irrigation water should be allocated to wheat and sunflower rather than corn when the credibility level is 0 5 and weight coefficient is 0 9 the system efficiency would be the highest compared to the benchmark year of 2018 this scenario would generate 0 330 6 647 billion yuan more benefits and 16 0 133 9 million m3 less grey water footprints compared to three conventional approaches gfifp could provide decisions with more flexibility and less environmental impacts the developed approach could also be applied to agricultural water management problems in other areas aiming at reducing grey water footprints and enhancing environmental benefits under uncertainty keywords grey water footprint soil salinity interval fractional programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming agricultural water management 1 introduction among all water sectors agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources which accounts for about 70 of total water consumption kang et al 2017 due to population growth and climate change water shortage has caused a series of problems such as agricultural drought soil salinization and food crisis djanibekov et al 2013 in arid and semi arid environments globally up to 40 of irrigated lands are affected by salinization abbas et al 2013 in some salinized regions which are heavily dependent on agriculture more water is needed to flush out salt and maintain soil quality this exacerbates fresh water shortage besides the salts in soil dissolve in water and increases the electrical conductivity of irrigation water that leads to the quality of irrigation water worse poor natural water endowment and improper management are the main cause of water shortage and soil salinization problems zhang et al 2019 to make good use of water resources while mitigating negative environmental impacts of salinization it is necessary to define an appropriate metric and incorporate it into decision support systems grey water footprint is proven to be effective for evaluating negative environmental impacts at a regional scale ma and peng 2013 the grey water footprint refers to the total amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants to background concentrations or environmental standards chapagain and hoekstra 2003 most of the previous studies on grey water footprint focused on nitrogen and phosphorus losses cao et al 2018 song et al 2019 in resent years the grey water footprint theory has gradually applied to the study of soil salinization al muaini et al 2019 quantified the salinization related grey water footprint by irrigation experiments and water footprint theory studies have shown that salinization related grey water footprints are much higher than those caused by nitrogen and phosphorus losses cao et al 2014 it is thus very necessary to study the grey water footprint in areas with severe salinization in agricultural irrigation systems the salinization related grey water footprint was defined as the amount of water for leaching out salt required to maintain soil quality for crop production multsch et al 2013 ayers and westcot 1994 developed a steady state model for the leaching requirement to maintain soil quality at the sought after yield percentage using this state model multsch et al 2011 calculated the grey water footprint and evaluated the total water footprints in saudi arabia subsequently a spatial model called spare water 1 0 multsch et al 2013 was developed to assess the regional crop water footprint in areas with severe salinity conditions although grey water footprint was used to assess the negative impacts of salinization on the environment few studies incorporated salinization related grey water footprints into agricultural water management models to support environmentally sound decisions maximizing economic benefits while minimizing environmental impacts is one of the major goals sought in agricultural water management aldaya et al 2010 to concurrently tackle two objectives linear fractional programming lfp could be an effective tool using the quotient of two functions e g cost volume output input as its objective function lfp could balance the trade offs between two objectives gomez et al 2006 guo et al 2014 there have been a number of studies adopting this method to solve agricultural water management problems with two goals cui et al 2018 guo et al 2014 as lfp could not deal with uncertainties in management problems a number of studies incorporated inexact mathematical programming methods into lfp song et al 2019 tan and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2018 for instance zhu et al 2014 introduced interval linear programming ilp into lfp to deal with uncertain parameters with known bounds but unknown distributions in many practical problems some parameters are difficult to be acquired precisely these parameters can be presented as interval numbers with known upper and lower bounds but unknown distribution information ilp could be considered as an effective tool to tackle these interval numbers nevertheless this method could not tackle ambiguous and vague information that was associated with subjective uncertainties in order to tackle ambiguous and vague information that was usually expressed as fuzzy sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was proposed based on the fuzzy set theory which was first proposed by zadeh 1978 due to its simplicity and efficiency in reflecting the fuzziness of parameters due to subjective consciousness fccp has been used in many areas chen et al 2018 li and zhang 2016 li et al 2013 tan et al 2015 yue et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the assumption behind fccp is that the credibility is the mean value of possibility and necessity measures hindered its applicability and scientific in in practical problems zhang and guo 2017 consequently zhang and guo 2017 proposed a generalized fuzzy credibility constrained programming gfccp which was applied to a water resources allocation and pollution control problem in the heihe river basin of china in gfccp the weight coefficient was set to represent the ratio of possibility and necessity measures the setting of credibility level and weight coefficient allows decision makers to determine the credibility level of constraints and the risk of violating constraints according to their subjective preferences and actual situations thus gfccp could not only deal with decision makers varied satisfactory degrees on water availability but also measure the risk of constraint violation however this method could not handle ratio efficiency problems involving two objectives therefore this paper developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp approach to address bi objective agricultural water management problems under uncertainty salinization related grey water footprint was measured to quantify the negative environmental impacts of irrigation and first introduced into an agricultural water management model through integrating interval fractional programming and generalized fuzzy credibility constrained programming the developed gfifp model could not only tackle the ratio problems of two objectives but also deal with multiple uncertainties the applicability of gfifp method will be demonstrated though an application to agricultural water management in arid and semi arid region of china the obtained modeling results could provide decision makers with optimal plans of crop irrigation in different situations this paper is organized as follows the complexities of soil salinization is introduced in section 2 the development process of the gfifp method is described in section 3 the study problem and the formation of gfifp is explained in section 4 result analysis and discussions are provided in section 5 and section 6 draws some conclusions of this research 2 complexities of irrigation induced soil salinization in arid and semi arid regions soil salinization is an important limiting factor for crop growth and greatly impairs regional soil and water environment metternicht and zinck 2003 there are many water soluble salts and ions in saline soil which are the main limiting factors for crop growth and development wang et al 2009 in the soil salts composition the main anions are hco 3 cl and so 4 and the main cations are na and k li et al 2021 when there are too many salts in the soil the concentration of ions in the irrigation water increases resulting in poor water quality irrigation water quality and irrigation method directly affect the salt accumulation degree of soil in the irrigation district gerten et al 2005 robock et al 2000 improper irrigation activities aggravated soil salinization when the salts taken away by drainage is less than that induced by irrigation the irrigation districts are in the state of salt accumulation zhang and zhang 2003 seepage from the irrigation canals and field irrigation cause the rising of underground water levels water is then lost from the topsoil due to evaporation and crop transpiration with the salt from groundwater and soil being remained zhang and zhang 2003 such salt accumulation on the surface is named secondary salinization of soil du et al 2010 as too many salts in the soil may reduce or terminate crop yields more water has to be irrigated to leach salts from rooting zones to the deep soil ayers and westcot 1994 this once again caused the rising of groundwater level and the accumulation of salts on the surface leading to a vicious circle at the same time irrigation operations planting structures and drainage capacities vary among different regions these factors result in temporal and spatial variability of soil salinization and propose more challenges for the assessment of soil salinization at a regional scale the grey water theory can assess the environmental impacts of pollutants in the process of agricultural production chapagain and hoekstra 2003 claimed that grey water footprint referred to the total amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants to background concentrations or environmental standards although there are no specific water quality standards for salts high salt concentrations are known to be detrimental to crop growth therefore multsch et al 2013 defined the grey water footprint as the amount of water required to leach salts and maintain soil quality for crop production mass and hoffman 1977 found that there is a negative linear correlation between soil salinity and crop yield ayers and westcot ayers and westcot 1994 multsch et al 2013 found that the leaching requirement was related to the salinity of irrigation water and soil salinity based on these findings and empirical formulas the grey water footprint can be measured and used to assess the negative environmental impacts of salinity induced by irrigation it is very complicated to measure negative environmental impacts of soil salinization by using grey water footprint theory soil salinity affects the electrical conductivity of water which affects crop yield and agricultural water consumption besides the amount of water availability is influenced not only by climate conditions but also by the subjective preferences of decision makers due to natural variability and cognition limitations some uncertainties such as the randomness of agricultural production and the volatility of economic parameters further complicate the multi objective decision problems zhang et al 2019 these uncertainties make agricultural water management challenging ifp and gfccp have been employed widely to deal with such challenges dong et al 2014 dong et al 2015 tan et al 2010 tan et al 2015 tan et al 2017 tan and zhang 2018 ilp is an effective method to tackle uncertain parameters with known upper and lower bounds but unknown distribution information gfccp could tackle ambiguous and vague information with subjective preferences of decision makers thus this study developed gfifp which integrated ifp and gfccp by introducing the grey water footprint theory into the agricultural water management model the negative environmental impacts caused by soil salinization could be assessed and alleviated 3 methodology 3 1 development of the gfifp method in agricultural water management systems there exits the trade off between economic benefits and environmental impacts besides optimal allocation of water resources is subject to uncertainty due to natural variability climate change and subjective factors leading to difficulties in obtaining deterministic values for parameters such as water availability crop production price and planting area many uncertain parameters are likely to be available as fuzzy membership functions in order to address these problems this study developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp approach which integrated gfccp and ifp the developed model could tackle the ratio problems of two objectives and uncertainties expressed as interval numbers and vague information the development and solving algorithm of gfifp is described as follows the gfifp model can be formulated as follows 1a max f i 1 n c i x i h i n d i x i k subject to 1b cr i 1 n a ij x i b j α j 1 2 m 1c i 1 n e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 1d x i 0 i 1 2 n where x 1 x 2 x n are decision variables i is the number of variables and j is the number of constrains h and k are scalar constants c i and d i are respectively coefficients of numerator and denominator of the objective a ij and e ij are technical coefficients g j is right hand side parameters b j is a fuzzy coefficients and α is the credibility level all of these parameters are interval numbers or fuzzy sets gfifp integrated gfccp and ifp within a general framework the detailed derivation process of gfccp was introduced first for the credibility of fuzzy events r ξ can be defined as follows 2 cr r ξ α where ξ is a fuzzy set and α is scalar constants when the credibility level of a fuzzy event is 1 the fuzzy event has definitely occurred when the credibility is 0 this event does not occur shi et al 2011 xu and yao 2009 the credibility of this constraint consists of possibility and necessity 3 cr r ξ β pos r ξ 1 β nec r ξ where β is a weight coefficient considering the fuzzy variable ξ that is defined by a symmetric triangular fuzzy variable ξ ξ ξ the possibility necessity and credibility of the fuzzy credibility constraint r ξ can be expressed as 4a pos r ξ 1 r ξ r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ 4b nec r ξ 1 r ξ ξ r ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ 4c cr r ξ 1 r ξ β 1 β r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ β r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ let μ ξ cr r ξ denote the credibility of variable r for ξ if r ξ μ ξ 1 when ξ r ξ μ ξ varies from 0 to 1 based on formula 4c given μ ξ α i there is a uniquely identified r corresponding to λ λ the choice of credibility α depends on the manager s preference for constraint satisfaction α 0 means that the constraint is not satisfied and corresponds to an unreliable scheme α 1 means that the constraint is completely satisfied and corresponds to a completely credible scheme in practical applications the decision makers prefer satisfaction of system constraint with high credibility so as to obtain a more reliable scheme therefore the credibility of the system constraint should be higher than 0 5 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 then for the formula 4c for each 0 5 α μ ξ 1 there are 5 cr r ξ β 1 r β r ξ ξ α r α 1 ξ β α ξ β 1 ξ r ξ β r ξ ξ ξ α r α ξ ξ β ξ ξ r ξ by substituting i 1 n a ij x i for r and b j for ξ eq 1b can be solved then the gfccp model was integrated into the ifp model assuming that the solution set of gfifp model is nonempty and bounded and the objective function is continuously differentiable the fractional programming can be formulated as 6a max f i 1 n c i x i h i n d i x i k subject to 6b i 1 n e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 6c x i 0 i 1 2 n if the denominator is constant in sign assuming that i n d i x i k 0 on the feasible region the fractional programming can be transformed to 7a max g i 1 n c i x i hr subject to 7b i 1 n e ij x i g j r j 1 2 m 7c i n d i x i kr 1 7d x i 0 i 1 2 n 7e r 0 gfifp model can be solved through the branch and bound algorithm zhu and huang 2013 the gfifp model can be transformed into two sub models corresponding to f and f respectively zhu et al 2014 in order to get better optimization results sub model i corresponding to f can be solved first and then the interactive method can be used to solve sub model ii corresponding to f the gfifp model can be transformed into a linear deterministic model that is divided into two sub models the lower bound sub model is first formulated as follows 8a max f i 1 k c i x i i k 1 n c i x i i 1 k d i x i i k 1 n d i x i 8b cr i 1 k a ij sign a ij x i i k 1 n a ij sign a ij x i b j α j 1 2 m 8c i 1 k e ij sign e ij x i i k 1 n e ij sign e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 8d x i 0 i 1 2 k 8e x i 0 i k 1 k 2 n where sign a ij is defined as sign a ij 1 if a ij 0 1 if a ij 0 according to the lower bound sub model solutions of x i i 1 2 k x i i k 1 k 2 n can be obtained the other sub model corresponding to f can then be formulated and solved by an interactive algorithm as follows 9a max f i 1 k c i x i i k 1 n c i x i i 1 k d i x i i k 1 n d i x i 9b cr i 1 k a ij sign a ij x i i k 1 n a ij sign a ij x i b j α j 1 2 m 9c i 1 k e ij sign e ij x i i k 1 n e ij sign e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 9d x i x i i 1 2 k 9e x i x i i k 1 k 2 n according to the upper bound sub model solutions of x i i 1 2 k x i i k 1 k 2 n can be obtained the interactive constraints 9b 9e which communicate with two sub models can identify feasible and stable ranges of decision variables in the given decision space thus the final solutions of f f f and x i x i x i i 1 2 n can be obtained the technical framework of the model is illustrated in fig 1 the solution process of the model can be briefly summarized as follows 1 formulate the gfifp model 2 transform fuzzy credibility constraint 1b into a deterministic one though a given credibility level α and a given weight coefficient β 3 divide the gfifp model into two sub models corresponding to f and f respectively and 4 solve two sub models to obtain a global optimal solution under a certain credibility level and weight coefficient 3 2 salinization related grey water footprint according to multsch et al 2011 the salinization related grey water footprint is the amount of water required to leach salts and maintain soil quality for crop production different amount of leaching water alleviates soil salinization in different degree which affects the crop yields based on this definition the grey water footprint can be calculated using the following formula 10 gwf i 1 i lr i a i where gwf is the total grey water footprint of all crops m3 lr i is the leaching requirement of crop i m3 m2 and a i is the planting area of crop i m2 11 gwf crop lr i a i y i where gwf crop is the grey water footprint of crop i m3 kg and y i is the total yield of crop i kg gwf crop represents the grey water footprint for growing crop i according to ayers and westcot 1994 the empirical formula of soil salinity and leaching quantity is introduced 12a lf i ec w 5 ec ei ec w 12b lr i et i 1 lf i lf i where ec w is the salinity of irrigation water ds m ec ei is the average soil salinity tolerated by crop i as measured on a soil saturation extract ds m lf i is the ratio of leaching water amount to irrigation and et i is the evapotranspiration of crop i m3 hm2 4 application 4 1 the study problem the study area is shown in fig 2 bayan nur city covers 65 100 km2 and has seven counties including dengkou county hanghou banner linhe district wuyuan county urad front banner urad middle banner and urad rear banner this region is located in the temperate zone and has the continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 3 7 7 6 c the annual sunshine ranges from 3100 to 3300 h the potential evapotranspiration is more than 2000 mm which is 7 to 15 times as much as the annual total precipitation according to the inner mongolia statistical yearbook 2019 fu et al 2021 bayan nur city has the largest effective irrigated area in inner mongolia which is 6527 km2 thus it can be seen that agriculture is very important in bayan nur city hetao irrigation district located in bayan bur city is one of the biggest irrigation regions of china due to droughts and scarce precipitation agricultural irrigation is heavily dependent on the yellow river at present the annual water diversion in hetao irrigation district is about 5 billion m3 accounting for 90 of the water diversion in inner mongolia meanwhile water consumption of hetao irrigation district has exceeded the target of yellow river diversion plan by 1 billion m3 which necessitate water saving besides local irrigation activities are still limited to traditional flood irrigation du et al 2010 with the expansion of irrigation area and the increase of water diversion the groundwater level remained relatively shallow for a long time due to improper irrigation methods and the improper irrigation and drainage projects the depth of groundwater in autumn is the shallowest which is 0 5 m du et al 2010 the problems of secondary salinization is common in order to plant crops in saline alkali soil local people choose to wash salts from the surface soil into the deep soil by flood irrigation after the autumn harvest or before spring plowing such flood irrigation further aggravates water shortage the two problems of water shortage and soil salinization affect each other triggering a dilemma for agricultural water management in bayan nur city therefore how to efficiently use water resources and slow down local soil salinization has become an urgent problem to be solved 4 2 modeling formulation there are two objectives in this study one is the maximum economic benefits and the other is the minimum environmental impact the developed model could optimize the ratio of two objectives the economic benefit is the total crop income minus the costs of irrigation the salinization related grey water footprint is used as the environmental impact indicator the model sets six constraints constraint on water availability constraint on grain yields constraint on grey water footprint constraint on economic benefits constraint on irrigation quota and non negative constraint the model sets the irrigated water per unit area as decision variables the model is constructed as follows objective function 13a max f eb gwf where eb is economic benefits yuan and gwf is the grey water footprint m3 economic benefits 13b eb i 1 i j 1 j a ij p i pro ij yr i i 1 i j 1 j a ij iqs ij iql ij co where a ij is the planting area for crop i in region j hm2 p i is the price for crop i yuan kg yr i is the relative yield of crop i dimensionless number co is agricultural water price yuan m3 iql ij is of the water used to flush salts from the root zones of crop i in region j m3 hm2 iqs ij is the decision variables which means the amount of water irrigated to crop i in region j m3 hm2 and pro ij is the yield of crop i which is a linear water production function kg hm2 the water production functions are used to analyze the relationship between crop yield and water demand in this study the water production function for the entire growth period was used chen and kang 1995 took evapotranspiration during the whole growth period of crops as an independent variable and established linear and nonlinear empirical models between crop yield and crop water demand 13c pro ij a 0 iqs ij b 0 where pro ij is the yield of crop i kg hm2 a 0 b 0 are empirical coefficients which can be obtained by regression analysis of experimental data this linear model is suitable for the areas with insufficient water resources and agricultural irrigation wang et al 2001 zhang and oweis 1999 the relative crop yield changes with soil salinity during agricultural irrigation the relationship is taken from the reference mass and hoffman 1977 namely 13d yr i 1 ec ei ec th 100 b 100 13e b ec th 0 ec th 100 where yr i is the relative crop yield affected by salinity which is dimensionless and set through literature review and expert consultation ec ei is the salinity of soil after flooding ds m ec th is salinity threshold value ds m b is the yield decline coefficient over the salinity threshold ec th0 and ec th100 are salinity thresholds of crops with 0 and 100 yield potential respectively these data can be found in the reference ayers and westcot 1994 as shown in table 1 the grey water footprint 13f gwf i 1 i j 1 j a ij iql ij where iql ij is the soil flushing requirement of crop i in region j m3 hm2 its calculation formula is as follows 13g iql ij iqs ij 1 lf i lf i 13h lf i ec w 5 ec ei ec w the salinity of the crop was determined by setting the upper and lower bounds of relative yields yr i and the leaching demand iql ij and leaching fraction lf i were calculated using formulas 13g and 13h respectively constraints 1 water availability constraint 13i cr i 1 i a ij iql ij iqs ij η wa j α j where wa j is the water availability in region j m3 and η is the irrigation water utilization coefficient formula 13i represents that the credibility of the constraint should be greater than or equal to the credibility level α 2 constraint on grain yield 13j j 1 j a ij pro ij yr i fd i i where a ij is the planting area of crop i in region j hm2 pro ij is the yield of crop i kg hm2 and fd i is the original production of crop i kg 3 constraint on the grey water footprint 13k i 1 i j 1 j a ij iql ij gwf where gwf means the benchmark grey water footprint m3 after optimization the grey water footprint should be smaller than the benchmark scenario 4 constraint on the economic

collection and processing the data from 2015 to 2018 acquired from the bayan nur statistical yearbook were selected as the upper and lower limits of the interval numbers crop prices could be obtained from china agricultural information n d crop irrigation quota was taken from the industrial water quota standard of inner mongolia autonomous region which could be seen in table 2 the representative crops planted in the hetao irrigation district included wheat corn sunflower watermelon and tomato given the relative crop yield ece value could be calculated by formula 13d the linear water production function relationship of crops was obtained through literature review and experimental regression analysis of data as shown in table 3 the salinity of the yellow river was averaged over many years 0 598 g l according to reference cao et al 2014 5 result analyses and discussions in this study there are two parameters that are adjustable one is the credibility level α the subjective preferences of decision makers can be expressed as the preferred credibility levels for constraints based on the linguistic term scale jimenez et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the credibility levels of 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 respectively are expressed as quite satisfied constraint sc very sc almost sc practically sc and completely sc another parameter is the weight coefficient β the credibility measure consists of two parts possibility and necessity in order to express the decision makers subjective preferences for possibility and necessity the weight coefficient is defined as the degree which possibility contributes to credibility the lower weight coefficient is the greater necessity ratio is and may result in the risk of water resource being underutilized in order to satisfy the different preferences of managers on possibility and necessity nine weight coefficients 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 and five credibility levels 0 5 0 6 and 0 9 are introduced into gfifp model there are 45 optimal irrigation water allocation schemes were provided to support agricultural production 5 1 system benefits the objective function value is economic benefits per unit grey water footprint fig 3 shows the upper and lower bounds of objective function values with the change of credibility level α and weight coefficient β as can be seen from fig 3 with the increase of credibility level both the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value would decrease for instance under the condition that weight coefficient equals to 0 1 when credibility level increases from 0 5 to 0 9 the objective function value would decrease from 42 262 123 316 to 41 269 122 481 yuan m3 this is because as decision makers satisfaction increases the risk of violating the water availability constraints decreases resulting in less water availability the decrease of available water leads to the decrease of system benefits fig 3 also suggests that both the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value would increase as weight coefficient increases and the growth rate would gradually decrease take results obtained with 0 8 credibility level for example when weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the objective function value would increase from 41 576 123 021 to 42 656 123 332 yuan m3 meanwhile the objective function would have significant increase under lower weight coefficient and the growth rate would gradually slow down with the increase of weight coefficient for instance when weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 5 the growth rate of the lower and upper bound objective function value would be 1 167 and 0 226 respectively when weight coefficient increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the growth rate of the lower and upper bound objective function value would be 1 036 and 0 063 respectively it can be seen that the influence of the weight coefficient on the objective function value would gradually decrease with the increase of the weight coefficient 5 2 water allocation plans the decision variables would change with credibility levels and weight coefficients changing fig 4 shows the results of irrigation water allocation under different credibility levels when weight coefficient is set as 0 5 as the credibility increasing the water availability would decrease in the lower bound sub model more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the sunflower with the credibility increasing for example when the credibility level increases from 0 5 to 0 9 the irrigation water amount of wheat is from 0 425 0 544 to 0 409 0 540 billion m3 and the irrigation water amount of sunflower is from 0 771 1 135 to 0 780 1 093 billion m3 this is because sunflowers can bring more system benefits than wheat with the credibility level increasing water availability decreases in order to achieve the maximum system benefits more irrigation water would be allocated to high benefit crop in the upper bound sub model the system benefits of corn were higher than sunflower so more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the corn whereas the system benefits would decrease because the water availability would decrease with credibility level increasing with credibility increasing the irrigation water allocation of tomato and watermelon would not change significantly this is because the total planting area of tomato and watermelon is about 5 5 that of sunflower and these two crops require less irrigation water than other crops fig 5 shows the irrigation water allocation under 0 8 credibility level with weight coefficient changing with weight coefficient increasing more irrigation water amount would be allocated to wheat and less to sunflower in the lower bound sub model this is because weight coefficient increasing resulting in higher possibility in credibility more possibility leads to higher risk of violating the water availability constraint the lower bound irrigation water amount of wheat would increase from 0 410 billion m3 to 0 425 billion m3 when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 while the lower bound irrigation water amount of sunflower would decrease from 0 778 billion m3 to 0 771 billion m3 in the upper bound sub model more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the sunflower and less to the corn when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the upper bound irrigation water amount of the sunflower would increase from 1 093 billion m3 to 1 136 billion m3 with a growth rate of 3 934 while the upper bound irrigation water amount of the corn would decrease from 1 487 billion m3 to 1 402 billion m3 with a drop rate of 5 716 different weight coefficients lead to different water allocation for crops and system benefits this indicates decision makers need to balance the weight coefficient of possibility and necessity according to the actual situation and preferences in order to explore the environmental impact of water allocation plans under different credibility levels and weight coefficients this study analyzed the variation of salinization related grey water footprint with parameters changing as credibility levels and weight coefficients changing the lower bound of grey water footprint would have always been maintained at 0 173 billion m3 but the upper bound of grey water footprint would change this indicates that the change of parameters has no great influence on the lower bound of grey water footprint as can be seen in fig 6 the grey water footprint would increase with the credibility levels increasing the higher the credibility levels the greater the increase of grey water footprint for instance under the condition that the weight coefficient β equals to 0 5 the grey water footprint would from 0 353 billion m3 to 0 362 billion m3 when the credibility levels increase from 0 5 to 0 9 grey water footprint increasing means that more water would be allocated to reduce the negative environmental impact of soil salinization thus less water would be allocated to crop growth with credibility levels increasing and decision making would be more conservative as weight coefficient β increasing the grey water footprint would decrease take the credibility level α 0 8 for example the grey water footprint would decrease from 0 362 billion m3 to 0 353 billion m3 when the weight coefficients increase from 0 1 to 0 9 the weight coefficient increasing means that the ratio of possibility in credibility measure increases as the weight coefficient increasing less water would be allocated to alleviate soil salinization and the decision would be more partial to pursue economic benefits which would be more risk 5 3 discussions in order to further explore the advantages of developed gfifp the study problem was also solved by three alternative models the first alternative model was the interval fractional fuzzy programming iffp model which could be viewed as a special case of the gfifp when the weight coefficient was 0 5 the second alternative model was the generalized fuzzy interval programming gfip model which did not consider environmental impact the third alternative model was the generalized fuzzy fractional programming gffp model which did not consider the interval uncertainty iffp was solved under a credibility level of 0 7 and a weight coefficient of 0 5 i e the default value the other two alternatives were solved under credibility level of 0 7 and a weight coefficient of 0 8 the economic benefits and grey water footprint obtained from alternative models as well as gfifp are presented in fig 7 compared with the gfifp iffp would have lower economic benefits and higher grey water footprint the upper and lower bounds economic benefits of iffp was 0 312 6 651 million yuan less than that of gfifp while the upper and lower bounds grey water footprints of iffp were 0 3 028 million m3 higher than that of gfifp this shows the impact of weight coefficient on model result the weight coefficient represents the proportion of possibility in the credibility measure gfifp and iffp were solved under 0 8 and 0 5 weight coefficient respectively that implied the proportion of possibility in the gfifp and iffp was 80 and 50 respectively at the same level of credibility a higher weight coefficient meant greater risk of constraint violation and therefore higher system benefits by analyzing the results obtained from different weight coefficients the optimistic and pessimistic attitude of decision makers could be quantified and related optimal solutions could be provided for decision makers the objective function value of the gfip only considered economic benefits compared with the gfifp as shown in fig 7 the economic benefits of the gfip would be 16 558 23 908 billion yuan and that of gfifp would be 15 039 21 334 billion yuan compared against results obtained from gfifp the upper bound and the lower bound of economic benefits obtained from gfip would increase by 12 067 and 10 098 nevertheless the grey water footprints of gfip would be significantly higher than gfifp for instance the grey water footprint of gfip would be 0 275 0 355 billion m3 and that of gfifp would be 0173 0 353 billion m3 it is can be observed that though gfip without considering the environmental effect would provide higher economic benefits but it would generate greater negative environmental impact than the gfifp model compared against gfip gfifp can reasonably balance the tradeoff between economic benefits and environmental impacts compared to the gfifp gffp did not consider the uncertain information without distributions whereas gfifp is capable of tackling uncertain information with known lower and upper bounds and the results can be present as interval numbers the objective function value of the gffp is shown in fig 8 the objective function values of the gfifp model and the gffp would have the same variation tendency as the credibility and weight coefficients changing under different credibility levels and different weight coefficients the objective function values of gffp would be all between the upper and lower bounds of gfifp model for instance under the scenario 1 α 0 7 β 0 8 the objective function value of gffp would be 73 087 yuan m3 while gfifp would be 42 660 123 331 yuan m3 compared to the deterministic results the solution in the interval form could flexibly reflect the changes of the system caused by the uncertainty and the decision variables in the interval form improved more robust solutions for decision makers generally three alternative models have their own specific metrics and limitations gfifp integrates these models and breaks their limitations gfifp not only considers economic benefits and environmental impacts but also deals with multiple uncertainties in agricultural water management system furthermore two parameters of credibility and weight coefficient were incorporated in gfifp the credibility level represents the degree to which the constraint is satisfied the weight coefficient represents the risk of violating the constraint thus solutions under various scenarios can be generated with the consideration of the tradeoffs between economic benefits and environment effects and the impact of tolerance for optimism and pessimism aiming to achieve higher economic benefits from unit grey water footprint the developed model could provide decision makers with optimal water allocation plans under different water resources availabilities the decision makers can choose the appropriate decision plan according to the actual situation and their preferences for decision makers who prefer conservative decisions a scenario with a high credibility level and weight coefficient could be chosen in this case the irrigation water allocation for wheat should be reduced and that of sunflower s could be slightly increased although conservative decisions mean lower water shortage risks it would also lead to low economic benefits from unit grey water footprint for decision makers who pursue higher economic benefits form unit grey water footprint a scenario with a low credibility level and weight coefficient could be chosen the irrigation water allocation for wheat and sunflower could be reduced and the irrigation water allocation for corn could be increased for mitigating risk of soil salinization and maintaining environmental sustainability it is suggested to promote drought tolerant and salt tolerant crops such as sunflower in regions with water shortage and salinization the developed gfifp model took account the uncertainties of water availability crop planting patterns market prices and irrigation targets in the agricultural water management system in addition the model set two parameters of credibility levels and weight coefficients and considered decision makers varied preferences for risk besides the agricultural irrigation management problems in arid and severely salinized areas studied in this research the developed gfifp method could also be applied to other resource allocation problems under uncertain conditions and risks 6 conclusions soil salinization has a serious impact on agricultural production proper agricultural water management can not only save water but also alleviate the negative environmental impact caused by soil salinization due to natural variability and cognition limitations there are many uncertainties leading to agricultural water management difficult therefore this study developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp for supporting agricultural water management considering the complexity of water and salt transport during crop growth salinization related grey water footprint was incorporated into gfifp for quantifying negative environmental impacts and firstly introduced to a water agricultural management the proposed model could optimize the ratio of two objectives and deal with uncertainties expressed as intervals and fuzzy sets the developed gfifp model for agricultural water management could alleviate soil salinization through optimizing water allocation in agricultural systems and provide flexible strategies under different scenarios the developed method was applied to bayan nur city located in an arid and saline region in china for irrigation management and soil salinity control grey water footprint was introduced into the modeling formulation for illustrating the complex relationship among water soil salinity and crop production five credibility levels 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 corresponding to decision makers varied satisfactory degree over water availability and nine weight coefficients of possibility and necessary measures 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 were considered in this study a total of 45 scenarios were explored for pursuing the optimal water resources allocation patterns several findings could be concluded as follows i the weight coefficients and credibility levels would affect the system optimization results significantly under a certain weight coefficient the objective function value would decrease as credibility increases under the same credibility level the objective function value would increase with the increase of weight coefficient ii in order to promote economic benefits and reduce negative environmental impact more irrigation water should be allocated to wheat and sunflower and less irrigation water should be allocated to corn iii when the credibility level is 0 5 and weight coefficient is 0 9 the system benefits would be the highest under this water allocation scenario the economic benefits would be increased by 0 330 6 647 billion yuan and the salinization related grey water footprint would be reduced by 16 0 133 9 million m3 compared with the benchmark year of 2018 compared with three alternative models gfifp could provide more flexible strategies and could obtain higher environmental benefits however there are still some shortcomings in this study for example the linear water production function used in this model is only applicable to arid areas and is not suitable for areas with abundant water in terms of negative environmental impacts the salinization related grey water footprint can be jointly considered along with those caused by nitrogen and phosphorus losses in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

1316,in arid and semi arid regions improper irrigation activities not only exacerbate water shortages but also lead to environmental pollution such as soil salinization that hinders crop growth and agricultural sustainability there has been a lack of agricultural water management tools that could support agricultural water management with salinization related grey water footprints being considered and associated uncertainties being addressed in this study salinization related grey water footprints were measured through accounting for relationships among irrigation soil salinity evapotranspiration and crop yield and then incorporated into an agricultural water management model for supporting environmentally sound irrigation decisions such an agricultural water management model was also characterized by a newly proposed generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp method that could address ratio problems of two objectives and dual uncertainties the developed methodology coupling the gfifp method and grey water footprints was applied to an irrigation region in northwestern china where water scarcity and soil salinization hindered local development five credibility levels corresponding to decision makers varied satisfactory degrees over water availability and nine weight coefficients of possibility and necessity measures were considered results showed that in order to reduce negative environmental impacts while increasing economic benefits more irrigation water should be allocated to wheat and sunflower rather than corn when the credibility level is 0 5 and weight coefficient is 0 9 the system efficiency would be the highest compared to the benchmark year of 2018 this scenario would generate 0 330 6 647 billion yuan more benefits and 16 0 133 9 million m3 less grey water footprints compared to three conventional approaches gfifp could provide decisions with more flexibility and less environmental impacts the developed approach could also be applied to agricultural water management problems in other areas aiming at reducing grey water footprints and enhancing environmental benefits under uncertainty keywords grey water footprint soil salinity interval fractional programming fuzzy credibility constrained programming agricultural water management 1 introduction among all water sectors agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources which accounts for about 70 of total water consumption kang et al 2017 due to population growth and climate change water shortage has caused a series of problems such as agricultural drought soil salinization and food crisis djanibekov et al 2013 in arid and semi arid environments globally up to 40 of irrigated lands are affected by salinization abbas et al 2013 in some salinized regions which are heavily dependent on agriculture more water is needed to flush out salt and maintain soil quality this exacerbates fresh water shortage besides the salts in soil dissolve in water and increases the electrical conductivity of irrigation water that leads to the quality of irrigation water worse poor natural water endowment and improper management are the main cause of water shortage and soil salinization problems zhang et al 2019 to make good use of water resources while mitigating negative environmental impacts of salinization it is necessary to define an appropriate metric and incorporate it into decision support systems grey water footprint is proven to be effective for evaluating negative environmental impacts at a regional scale ma and peng 2013 the grey water footprint refers to the total amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants to background concentrations or environmental standards chapagain and hoekstra 2003 most of the previous studies on grey water footprint focused on nitrogen and phosphorus losses cao et al 2018 song et al 2019 in resent years the grey water footprint theory has gradually applied to the study of soil salinization al muaini et al 2019 quantified the salinization related grey water footprint by irrigation experiments and water footprint theory studies have shown that salinization related grey water footprints are much higher than those caused by nitrogen and phosphorus losses cao et al 2014 it is thus very necessary to study the grey water footprint in areas with severe salinization in agricultural irrigation systems the salinization related grey water footprint was defined as the amount of water for leaching out salt required to maintain soil quality for crop production multsch et al 2013 ayers and westcot 1994 developed a steady state model for the leaching requirement to maintain soil quality at the sought after yield percentage using this state model multsch et al 2011 calculated the grey water footprint and evaluated the total water footprints in saudi arabia subsequently a spatial model called spare water 1 0 multsch et al 2013 was developed to assess the regional crop water footprint in areas with severe salinity conditions although grey water footprint was used to assess the negative impacts of salinization on the environment few studies incorporated salinization related grey water footprints into agricultural water management models to support environmentally sound decisions maximizing economic benefits while minimizing environmental impacts is one of the major goals sought in agricultural water management aldaya et al 2010 to concurrently tackle two objectives linear fractional programming lfp could be an effective tool using the quotient of two functions e g cost volume output input as its objective function lfp could balance the trade offs between two objectives gomez et al 2006 guo et al 2014 there have been a number of studies adopting this method to solve agricultural water management problems with two goals cui et al 2018 guo et al 2014 as lfp could not deal with uncertainties in management problems a number of studies incorporated inexact mathematical programming methods into lfp song et al 2019 tan and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2018 for instance zhu et al 2014 introduced interval linear programming ilp into lfp to deal with uncertain parameters with known bounds but unknown distributions in many practical problems some parameters are difficult to be acquired precisely these parameters can be presented as interval numbers with known upper and lower bounds but unknown distribution information ilp could be considered as an effective tool to tackle these interval numbers nevertheless this method could not tackle ambiguous and vague information that was associated with subjective uncertainties in order to tackle ambiguous and vague information that was usually expressed as fuzzy sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was proposed based on the fuzzy set theory which was first proposed by zadeh 1978 due to its simplicity and efficiency in reflecting the fuzziness of parameters due to subjective consciousness fccp has been used in many areas chen et al 2018 li and zhang 2016 li et al 2013 tan et al 2015 yue et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the assumption behind fccp is that the credibility is the mean value of possibility and necessity measures hindered its applicability and scientific in in practical problems zhang and guo 2017 consequently zhang and guo 2017 proposed a generalized fuzzy credibility constrained programming gfccp which was applied to a water resources allocation and pollution control problem in the heihe river basin of china in gfccp the weight coefficient was set to represent the ratio of possibility and necessity measures the setting of credibility level and weight coefficient allows decision makers to determine the credibility level of constraints and the risk of violating constraints according to their subjective preferences and actual situations thus gfccp could not only deal with decision makers varied satisfactory degrees on water availability but also measure the risk of constraint violation however this method could not handle ratio efficiency problems involving two objectives therefore this paper developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp approach to address bi objective agricultural water management problems under uncertainty salinization related grey water footprint was measured to quantify the negative environmental impacts of irrigation and first introduced into an agricultural water management model through integrating interval fractional programming and generalized fuzzy credibility constrained programming the developed gfifp model could not only tackle the ratio problems of two objectives but also deal with multiple uncertainties the applicability of gfifp method will be demonstrated though an application to agricultural water management in arid and semi arid region of china the obtained modeling results could provide decision makers with optimal plans of crop irrigation in different situations this paper is organized as follows the complexities of soil salinization is introduced in section 2 the development process of the gfifp method is described in section 3 the study problem and the formation of gfifp is explained in section 4 result analysis and discussions are provided in section 5 and section 6 draws some conclusions of this research 2 complexities of irrigation induced soil salinization in arid and semi arid regions soil salinization is an important limiting factor for crop growth and greatly impairs regional soil and water environment metternicht and zinck 2003 there are many water soluble salts and ions in saline soil which are the main limiting factors for crop growth and development wang et al 2009 in the soil salts composition the main anions are hco 3 cl and so 4 and the main cations are na and k li et al 2021 when there are too many salts in the soil the concentration of ions in the irrigation water increases resulting in poor water quality irrigation water quality and irrigation method directly affect the salt accumulation degree of soil in the irrigation district gerten et al 2005 robock et al 2000 improper irrigation activities aggravated soil salinization when the salts taken away by drainage is less than that induced by irrigation the irrigation districts are in the state of salt accumulation zhang and zhang 2003 seepage from the irrigation canals and field irrigation cause the rising of underground water levels water is then lost from the topsoil due to evaporation and crop transpiration with the salt from groundwater and soil being remained zhang and zhang 2003 such salt accumulation on the surface is named secondary salinization of soil du et al 2010 as too many salts in the soil may reduce or terminate crop yields more water has to be irrigated to leach salts from rooting zones to the deep soil ayers and westcot 1994 this once again caused the rising of groundwater level and the accumulation of salts on the surface leading to a vicious circle at the same time irrigation operations planting structures and drainage capacities vary among different regions these factors result in temporal and spatial variability of soil salinization and propose more challenges for the assessment of soil salinization at a regional scale the grey water theory can assess the environmental impacts of pollutants in the process of agricultural production chapagain and hoekstra 2003 claimed that grey water footprint referred to the total amount of fresh water required to dilute pollutants to background concentrations or environmental standards although there are no specific water quality standards for salts high salt concentrations are known to be detrimental to crop growth therefore multsch et al 2013 defined the grey water footprint as the amount of water required to leach salts and maintain soil quality for crop production mass and hoffman 1977 found that there is a negative linear correlation between soil salinity and crop yield ayers and westcot ayers and westcot 1994 multsch et al 2013 found that the leaching requirement was related to the salinity of irrigation water and soil salinity based on these findings and empirical formulas the grey water footprint can be measured and used to assess the negative environmental impacts of salinity induced by irrigation it is very complicated to measure negative environmental impacts of soil salinization by using grey water footprint theory soil salinity affects the electrical conductivity of water which affects crop yield and agricultural water consumption besides the amount of water availability is influenced not only by climate conditions but also by the subjective preferences of decision makers due to natural variability and cognition limitations some uncertainties such as the randomness of agricultural production and the volatility of economic parameters further complicate the multi objective decision problems zhang et al 2019 these uncertainties make agricultural water management challenging ifp and gfccp have been employed widely to deal with such challenges dong et al 2014 dong et al 2015 tan et al 2010 tan et al 2015 tan et al 2017 tan and zhang 2018 ilp is an effective method to tackle uncertain parameters with known upper and lower bounds but unknown distribution information gfccp could tackle ambiguous and vague information with subjective preferences of decision makers thus this study developed gfifp which integrated ifp and gfccp by introducing the grey water footprint theory into the agricultural water management model the negative environmental impacts caused by soil salinization could be assessed and alleviated 3 methodology 3 1 development of the gfifp method in agricultural water management systems there exits the trade off between economic benefits and environmental impacts besides optimal allocation of water resources is subject to uncertainty due to natural variability climate change and subjective factors leading to difficulties in obtaining deterministic values for parameters such as water availability crop production price and planting area many uncertain parameters are likely to be available as fuzzy membership functions in order to address these problems this study developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp approach which integrated gfccp and ifp the developed model could tackle the ratio problems of two objectives and uncertainties expressed as interval numbers and vague information the development and solving algorithm of gfifp is described as follows the gfifp model can be formulated as follows 1a max f i 1 n c i x i h i n d i x i k subject to 1b cr i 1 n a ij x i b j α j 1 2 m 1c i 1 n e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 1d x i 0 i 1 2 n where x 1 x 2 x n are decision variables i is the number of variables and j is the number of constrains h and k are scalar constants c i and d i are respectively coefficients of numerator and denominator of the objective a ij and e ij are technical coefficients g j is right hand side parameters b j is a fuzzy coefficients and α is the credibility level all of these parameters are interval numbers or fuzzy sets gfifp integrated gfccp and ifp within a general framework the detailed derivation process of gfccp was introduced first for the credibility of fuzzy events r ξ can be defined as follows 2 cr r ξ α where ξ is a fuzzy set and α is scalar constants when the credibility level of a fuzzy event is 1 the fuzzy event has definitely occurred when the credibility is 0 this event does not occur shi et al 2011 xu and yao 2009 the credibility of this constraint consists of possibility and necessity 3 cr r ξ β pos r ξ 1 β nec r ξ where β is a weight coefficient considering the fuzzy variable ξ that is defined by a symmetric triangular fuzzy variable ξ ξ ξ the possibility necessity and credibility of the fuzzy credibility constraint r ξ can be expressed as 4a pos r ξ 1 r ξ r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ 4b nec r ξ 1 r ξ ξ r ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ 4c cr r ξ 1 r ξ β 1 β r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ β r ξ ξ ξ ξ r ξ 0 r ξ let μ ξ cr r ξ denote the credibility of variable r for ξ if r ξ μ ξ 1 when ξ r ξ μ ξ varies from 0 to 1 based on formula 4c given μ ξ α i there is a uniquely identified r corresponding to λ λ the choice of credibility α depends on the manager s preference for constraint satisfaction α 0 means that the constraint is not satisfied and corresponds to an unreliable scheme α 1 means that the constraint is completely satisfied and corresponds to a completely credible scheme in practical applications the decision makers prefer satisfaction of system constraint with high credibility so as to obtain a more reliable scheme therefore the credibility of the system constraint should be higher than 0 5 yang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 then for the formula 4c for each 0 5 α μ ξ 1 there are 5 cr r ξ β 1 r β r ξ ξ α r α 1 ξ β α ξ β 1 ξ r ξ β r ξ ξ ξ α r α ξ ξ β ξ ξ r ξ by substituting i 1 n a ij x i for r and b j for ξ eq 1b can be solved then the gfccp model was integrated into the ifp model assuming that the solution set of gfifp model is nonempty and bounded and the objective function is continuously differentiable the fractional programming can be formulated as 6a max f i 1 n c i x i h i n d i x i k subject to 6b i 1 n e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 6c x i 0 i 1 2 n if the denominator is constant in sign assuming that i n d i x i k 0 on the feasible region the fractional programming can be transformed to 7a max g i 1 n c i x i hr subject to 7b i 1 n e ij x i g j r j 1 2 m 7c i n d i x i kr 1 7d x i 0 i 1 2 n 7e r 0 gfifp model can be solved through the branch and bound algorithm zhu and huang 2013 the gfifp model can be transformed into two sub models corresponding to f and f respectively zhu et al 2014 in order to get better optimization results sub model i corresponding to f can be solved first and then the interactive method can be used to solve sub model ii corresponding to f the gfifp model can be transformed into a linear deterministic model that is divided into two sub models the lower bound sub model is first formulated as follows 8a max f i 1 k c i x i i k 1 n c i x i i 1 k d i x i i k 1 n d i x i 8b cr i 1 k a ij sign a ij x i i k 1 n a ij sign a ij x i b j α j 1 2 m 8c i 1 k e ij sign e ij x i i k 1 n e ij sign e ij x i g j j 1 2 m 8d x i 0 i 1 2 k 8e x i 0 i k 1 k 2 n where sign a ij is defined as sign a ij 1 if a ij 0 1 if a ij 0 according to the lower bound sub model solutions of x i i 1 2 k x i i k 1 k 2 n can be obtained the other sub model corresponding to f can then be formulated and solved by an interactive algorithm as follows 9a max f i 1 k c i x i i k 1 n

given credibility level α and a given weight coefficient β 3 divide the gfifp model into two sub models corresponding to f and f respectively and 4 solve two sub models to obtain a global optimal solution under a certain credibility level and weight coefficient 3 2 salinization related grey water footprint according to multsch et al 2011 the salinization related grey water footprint is the amount of water required to leach salts and maintain soil quality for crop production different amount of leaching water alleviates soil salinization in different degree which affects the crop yields based on this definition the grey water footprint can be calculated using the following formula 10 gwf i 1 i lr i a i where gwf is the total grey water footprint of all crops m3 lr i is the leaching requirement of crop i m3 m2 and a i is the planting area of crop i m2 11 gwf crop lr i a i y i where gwf crop is the grey water footprint of crop i m3 kg and y i is the total yield of crop i kg gwf crop represents the grey water footprint for growing crop i according to ayers and westcot 1994 the empirical formula of soil salinity and leaching quantity is introduced 12a lf i ec w 5 ec ei ec w 12b lr i et i 1 lf i lf i where ec w is the salinity of irrigation water ds m ec ei is the average soil salinity tolerated by crop i as measured on a soil saturation extract ds m lf i is the ratio of leaching water amount to irrigation and et i is the evapotranspiration of crop i m3 hm2 4 application 4 1 the study problem the study area is shown in fig 2 bayan nur city covers 65 100 km2 and has seven counties including dengkou county hanghou banner linhe district wuyuan county urad front banner urad middle banner and urad rear banner this region is located in the temperate zone and has the continental monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 3 7 7 6 c the annual sunshine ranges from 3100 to 3300 h the potential evapotranspiration is more than 2000 mm which is 7 to 15 times as much as the annual total precipitation according to the inner mongolia statistical yearbook 2019 fu et al 2021 bayan nur city has the largest effective irrigated area in inner mongolia which is 6527 km2 thus it can be seen that agriculture is very important in bayan nur city hetao irrigation district located in bayan bur city is one of the biggest irrigation regions of china due to droughts and scarce precipitation agricultural irrigation is heavily dependent on the yellow river at present the annual water diversion in hetao irrigation district is about 5 billion m3 accounting for 90 of the water diversion in inner mongolia meanwhile water consumption of hetao irrigation district has exceeded the target of yellow river diversion plan by 1 billion m3 which necessitate water saving besides local irrigation activities are still limited to traditional flood irrigation du et al 2010 with the expansion of irrigation area and the increase of water diversion the groundwater level remained relatively shallow for a long time due to improper irrigation methods and the improper irrigation and drainage projects the depth of groundwater in autumn is the shallowest which is 0 5 m du et al 2010 the problems of secondary salinization is common in order to plant crops in saline alkali soil local people choose to wash salts from the surface soil into the deep soil by flood irrigation after the autumn harvest or before spring plowing such flood irrigation further aggravates water shortage the two problems of water shortage and soil salinization affect each other triggering a dilemma for agricultural water management in bayan nur city therefore how to efficiently use water resources and slow down local soil salinization has become an urgent problem to be solved 4 2 modeling formulation there are two objectives in this study one is the maximum economic benefits and the other is the minimum environmental impact the developed model could optimize the ratio of two objectives the economic benefit is the total crop income minus the costs of irrigation the salinization related grey water footprint is used as the environmental impact indicator the model sets six constraints constraint on water availability constraint on grain yields constraint on grey water footprint constraint on economic benefits constraint on irrigation quota and non negative constraint the model sets the irrigated water per unit area as decision variables the model is constructed as follows objective function 13a max f eb gwf where eb is economic benefits yuan and gwf is the grey water footprint m3 economic benefits 13b eb i 1 i j 1 j a ij p i pro ij yr i i 1 i j 1 j a ij iqs ij iql ij co where a ij is the planting area for crop i in region j hm2 p i is the price for crop i yuan kg yr i is the relative yield of crop i dimensionless number co is agricultural water price yuan m3 iql ij is of the water used to flush salts from the root zones of crop i in region j m3 hm2 iqs ij is the decision variables which means the amount of water irrigated to crop i in region j m3 hm2 and pro ij is the yield of crop i which is a linear water production function kg hm2 the water production functions are used to analyze the relationship between crop yield and water demand in this study the water production function for the entire growth period was used chen and kang 1995 took evapotranspiration during the whole growth period of crops as an independent variable and established linear and nonlinear empirical models between crop yield and crop water demand 13c pro ij a 0 iqs ij b 0 where pro ij is the yield of crop i kg hm2 a 0 b 0 are empirical coefficients which can be obtained by regression analysis of experimental data this linear model is suitable for the areas with insufficient water resources and agricultural irrigation wang et al 2001 zhang and oweis 1999 the relative crop yield changes with soil salinity during agricultural irrigation the relationship is taken from the reference mass and hoffman 1977 namely 13d yr i 1 ec ei ec th 100 b 100 13e b ec th 0 ec th 100 where yr i is the relative crop yield affected by salinity which is dimensionless and set through literature review and expert consultation ec ei is the salinity of soil after flooding ds m ec th is salinity threshold value ds m b is the yield decline coefficient over the salinity threshold ec th0 and ec th100 are salinity thresholds of crops with 0 and 100 yield potential respectively these data can be found in the reference ayers and westcot 1994 as shown in table 1 the grey water footprint 13f gwf i 1 i j 1 j a ij iql ij where iql ij is the soil flushing requirement of crop i in region j m3 hm2 its calculation formula is as follows 13g iql ij iqs ij 1 lf i lf i 13h lf i ec w 5 ec ei ec w the salinity of the crop was determined by setting the upper and lower bounds of relative yields yr i and the leaching demand iql ij and leaching fraction lf i were calculated using

constraints 13n iqs ij 0 i j in this model wa j is set as a fuzzy number due to the fuzzy information existing in water availability and eq 13i is set as the fuzzy credibility constraint to solve the model the fuzzy number needs to be converted into a definite form wa j can be expressed as wa j wa j wa j in this paper lingo software is used to solve the established model lingo n d 4 3 data collection and processing the data from 2015 to 2018 acquired from the bayan nur statistical yearbook were selected as the upper and lower limits of the interval numbers crop prices could be obtained from china agricultural information n d crop irrigation quota was taken from the industrial water quota standard of inner mongolia autonomous region which could be seen in table 2 the representative crops planted in the hetao irrigation district included wheat corn sunflower watermelon and tomato given the relative crop yield ece value could be calculated by formula 13d the linear water production function relationship of crops was obtained through literature review and experimental regression analysis of data as shown in table 3 the salinity of the yellow river was averaged over many years 0 598 g l according to reference cao et al 2014 5 result analyses and discussions in this study there are two parameters that are adjustable one is the credibility level α the subjective preferences of decision makers can be expressed as the preferred credibility levels for constraints based on the linguistic term scale jimenez et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the credibility levels of 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 respectively are expressed as quite satisfied constraint sc very sc almost sc practically sc and completely sc another parameter is the weight coefficient β the credibility measure consists of two parts possibility and necessity in order to express the decision makers subjective preferences for possibility and necessity the weight coefficient is defined as the degree which possibility contributes to credibility the lower weight coefficient is the greater necessity ratio is and may result in the risk of water resource being underutilized in order to satisfy the different preferences of managers on possibility and necessity nine weight coefficients 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 and five credibility levels 0 5 0 6 and 0 9 are introduced into gfifp model there are 45 optimal irrigation water allocation schemes were provided to support agricultural production 5 1 system benefits the objective function value is economic benefits per unit grey water footprint fig 3 shows the upper and lower bounds of objective function values with the change of credibility level α and weight coefficient β as can be seen from fig 3 with the increase of credibility level both the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value would decrease for instance under the condition that weight coefficient equals to 0 1 when credibility level increases from 0 5 to 0 9 the objective function value would decrease from 42 262 123 316 to 41 269 122 481 yuan m3 this is because as decision makers satisfaction increases the risk of violating the water availability constraints decreases resulting in less water availability the decrease of available water leads to the decrease of system benefits fig 3 also suggests that both the upper and lower bounds of the objective function value would increase as weight coefficient increases and the growth rate would gradually decrease take results obtained with 0 8 credibility level for example when weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the objective function value would increase from 41 576 123 021 to 42 656 123 332 yuan m3 meanwhile the objective function would have significant increase under lower weight coefficient and the growth rate would gradually slow down with the increase of weight coefficient for instance when weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 5 the growth rate of the lower and upper bound objective function value would be 1 167 and 0 226 respectively when weight coefficient increases from 0 6 to 0 9 the growth rate of the lower and upper bound objective function value would be 1 036 and 0 063 respectively it can be seen that the influence of the weight coefficient on the objective function value would gradually decrease with the increase of the weight coefficient 5 2 water allocation plans the decision variables would change with credibility levels and weight coefficients changing fig 4 shows the results of irrigation water allocation under different credibility levels when weight coefficient is set as 0 5 as the credibility increasing the water availability would decrease in the lower bound sub model more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the sunflower with the credibility increasing for example when the credibility level increases from 0 5 to 0 9 the irrigation water amount of wheat is from 0 425 0 544 to 0 409 0 540 billion m3 and the irrigation water amount of sunflower is from 0 771 1 135 to 0 780 1 093 billion m3 this is because sunflowers can bring more system benefits than wheat with the credibility level increasing water availability decreases in order to achieve the maximum system benefits more irrigation water would be allocated to high benefit crop in the upper bound sub model the system benefits of corn were higher than sunflower so more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the corn whereas the system benefits would decrease because the water availability would decrease with credibility level increasing with credibility increasing the irrigation water allocation of tomato and watermelon would not change significantly this is because the total planting area of tomato and watermelon is about 5 5 that of sunflower and these two crops require less irrigation water than other crops fig 5 shows the irrigation water allocation under 0 8 credibility level with weight coefficient changing with weight coefficient increasing more irrigation water amount would be allocated to wheat and less to sunflower in the lower bound sub model this is because weight coefficient increasing resulting in higher possibility in credibility more possibility leads to higher risk of violating the water availability constraint the lower bound irrigation water amount of wheat would increase from 0 410 billion m3 to 0 425 billion m3 when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 while the lower bound irrigation water amount of sunflower would decrease from 0 778 billion m3 to 0 771 billion m3 in the upper bound sub model more irrigation water amount would be allocated to the sunflower and less to the corn when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 when the weight coefficient increases from 0 1 to 0 9 the upper bound irrigation water amount of the sunflower would increase from 1 093 billion m3 to 1 136 billion m3 with a growth rate of 3 934 while the upper bound irrigation water amount of the corn would decrease from 1 487 billion m3 to 1 402 billion m3 with a drop rate of 5 716 different weight coefficients lead to different water allocation for crops and system benefits this indicates decision makers need to balance the weight coefficient of possibility and necessity according to the actual situation and preferences in order to explore the environmental impact of water allocation plans under different credibility levels and weight coefficients this study analyzed the variation of salinization related grey water footprint with parameters changing as credibility levels and weight coefficients changing the lower bound of grey water footprint would have always been maintained at 0 173 billion m3 but the upper bound of grey water footprint would change this indicates that the change of parameters has no great influence on the lower bound of grey water footprint as can be seen in fig 6 the grey water footprint would increase with the credibility levels increasing the higher the credibility levels the greater the increase of grey water footprint for instance under the condition that the weight coefficient β equals to 0 5 the grey water footprint would from 0 353 billion m3 to 0 362 billion m3 when the credibility levels increase from 0 5 to 0 9 grey water footprint increasing means that more water would be allocated to reduce the negative environmental impact of soil salinization thus less water would be allocated to crop growth with credibility levels increasing and decision making would be more conservative as weight coefficient β increasing the grey water footprint would decrease take the credibility level α 0 8 for example the grey water footprint would decrease from 0 362 billion m3 to 0 353 billion m3 when the weight coefficients increase from 0 1 to 0 9 the weight coefficient increasing means that the ratio of possibility in credibility measure increases as the weight coefficient increasing less water would be allocated to alleviate soil salinization and the decision would be more partial to pursue economic benefits which would be more risk 5 3 discussions in order to further explore the advantages of developed gfifp the study problem was also solved by three alternative models the first alternative model was the interval fractional fuzzy programming iffp model which could be viewed as a special case of the gfifp when the weight coefficient was 0 5 the second alternative model was the generalized fuzzy interval programming gfip model which did not consider environmental impact the third alternative model was the generalized fuzzy fractional programming gffp model which did not consider the interval uncertainty iffp was solved under a credibility level of 0 7 and a weight coefficient of 0 5 i e the default value the other two alternatives were solved under credibility level of 0 7 and a weight coefficient of 0 8 the economic benefits and grey water footprint obtained from alternative models as well as gfifp are presented in fig 7 compared with the gfifp iffp would have lower economic benefits and higher grey water footprint the upper and lower bounds economic benefits of iffp was 0 312 6 651 million yuan less than that of gfifp while the upper and lower bounds grey water footprints of iffp were 0 3 028 million m3 higher than that of gfifp this shows the impact of weight coefficient on model result the weight coefficient represents the proportion of possibility in the credibility measure gfifp and iffp were solved under 0 8 and 0 5 weight coefficient respectively that implied the proportion of possibility in the gfifp and iffp was 80 and 50 respectively at the same level of credibility a higher weight coefficient meant greater risk of constraint violation and therefore higher system benefits by analyzing the results obtained from different weight coefficients the optimistic and pessimistic attitude of decision makers could be quantified and related optimal solutions could be provided for decision makers the objective function value of the gfip only considered economic benefits compared with the gfifp as shown in fig 7 the economic benefits of the gfip would be 16 558 23 908 billion yuan and that of gfifp would be 15 039 21 334 billion yuan compared against results obtained from gfifp the upper bound and the lower bound of economic benefits obtained from gfip would increase by 12 067 and 10 098 nevertheless the grey water footprints of gfip would be significantly higher than gfifp for instance the grey water footprint of gfip would be 0 275 0 355 billion m3 and that of gfifp would be 0173 0 353 billion m3 it is can be observed that though gfip without considering the environmental effect would provide higher economic benefits but it would generate greater negative environmental impact than the gfifp model compared against gfip gfifp can reasonably balance the tradeoff between economic benefits and environmental impacts compared to the gfifp gffp did not consider the uncertain information without distributions whereas gfifp is capable of tackling uncertain information with known lower and upper bounds and the results can be present as interval numbers the objective function value of the gffp is shown in fig 8 the objective function values of the gfifp model and the gffp would have the same variation tendency as the credibility and weight coefficients changing under different credibility levels and different weight coefficients the objective function values of gffp would be all between the upper and lower bounds of gfifp model for instance under the scenario 1 α 0 7 β 0 8 the objective function value of gffp would be 73 087 yuan m3 while gfifp would be 42 660 123 331 yuan m3 compared to the deterministic results the solution in the interval form could flexibly reflect the changes of the system caused by the uncertainty and the decision variables in the interval form improved more robust solutions for decision makers generally three alternative models have their own specific metrics and limitations gfifp integrates these models and breaks their limitations gfifp not only considers economic benefits and environmental impacts but also deals with multiple uncertainties in agricultural water management system furthermore two parameters of credibility and weight coefficient were incorporated in gfifp the credibility level represents the degree to which the constraint is satisfied the weight coefficient represents the risk of violating the constraint thus solutions under various scenarios can be generated with the consideration of the tradeoffs between economic benefits and environment effects and the impact of tolerance for optimism and pessimism aiming to achieve higher economic benefits from unit grey water footprint the developed model could provide decision makers with optimal water allocation plans under different water resources availabilities the decision makers can choose the appropriate decision plan according to the actual situation and their preferences for decision makers who prefer conservative decisions a scenario with a high credibility level and weight coefficient could be chosen in this case the irrigation water allocation for wheat should be reduced and that of sunflower s could be slightly increased although conservative decisions mean lower water shortage risks it would also lead to low economic benefits from unit grey water footprint for decision makers who pursue higher economic benefits form unit grey water footprint a scenario with a low credibility level and weight coefficient could be chosen the irrigation water allocation for wheat and sunflower could be reduced and the irrigation water allocation for corn could be increased for mitigating risk of soil salinization and maintaining environmental sustainability it is suggested to promote drought tolerant and salt tolerant crops such as sunflower in regions with water shortage and salinization the developed gfifp model took account the uncertainties of water availability crop planting patterns market prices and irrigation targets in the agricultural water management system in addition the model set two parameters of credibility levels and weight coefficients and considered decision makers varied preferences for risk besides the agricultural irrigation management problems in arid and severely salinized areas studied in this research the developed gfifp method could also be applied to other resource allocation problems under uncertain conditions and risks 6 conclusions soil salinization has a serious impact on agricultural production proper agricultural water management can not only save water but also alleviate the negative environmental impact caused by soil salinization due to natural variability and cognition limitations there are many uncertainties leading to agricultural water management difficult therefore this study developed a generalized fuzzy interval fractional programming gfifp for supporting agricultural water management considering the complexity of water and salt transport during crop growth salinization related grey water footprint was incorporated into gfifp for quantifying negative environmental impacts and firstly introduced to a water agricultural management the proposed model could optimize the ratio of two objectives and deal with uncertainties expressed as intervals and fuzzy sets the developed gfifp model for agricultural water management could alleviate soil salinization through optimizing water allocation in agricultural systems and provide flexible strategies under different scenarios the developed method was applied to bayan nur city located in an arid and saline region in china for irrigation management and soil salinity control grey water footprint was introduced into the modeling formulation for illustrating the complex relationship among water soil salinity and crop production five credibility levels 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 corresponding to decision makers varied satisfactory degree over water availability and nine weight coefficients of possibility and necessary measures 0 1 0 2 and 0 9 were considered in this study a total of 45 scenarios were explored for pursuing the optimal water resources allocation patterns several findings could be concluded as follows i the weight coefficients and credibility levels would affect the system optimization results significantly under a certain weight coefficient the objective function value would decrease as credibility increases under the same credibility level the objective function value would increase with the increase of weight coefficient ii in order to promote economic benefits and reduce negative environmental impact more irrigation water should be allocated to wheat and sunflower and less irrigation water should be allocated to corn iii when the credibility level is 0 5 and weight coefficient is 0 9 the system benefits would be the highest under this water allocation scenario the economic benefits would be increased by 0 330 6 647 billion yuan and the salinization related grey water footprint would be reduced by 16 0 133 9 million m3 compared with the benchmark year of 2018 compared with three alternative models gfifp could provide more flexible strategies and could obtain higher environmental benefits however there are still some shortcomings in this study for example the linear water production function used in this model is only applicable to arid areas and is not suitable for areas with abundant water in terms of negative environmental impacts the salinization related grey water footprint can be jointly considered along with those caused by nitrogen and phosphorus losses in future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

1317,water quality degradation can be caused by excessive agricultural nutrient transfers from fertilised soils exposed to wet weather mitigation measures within the eu nitrates directive aim to reduce this pressure by including closed fertiliser spreading periods during wet months for organic fertilisers such as slurry and manure this closed period requires sufficient on farm winter storage and good weather conditions to relieve storage at the end of the period therefore robust scientific evidence is needed to support the measure incidental nutrient transfers of recently applied organic fertilisers in wet weather can also be complicated by synchronous transfers from residual soil stores and tracing is required for risk assessments the combination of nutrient monitoring and biomarker analyses may aid this and one such biomarker suite is faecal steroids accordingly this study investigated the persistence of steroids and their association with phosphorus during leaching episodes the focus was on the coupled behaviour of steroids and total phosphorus tp concentrations in sub surface hydrological pathways cattle slurry was applied to monolith lysimeters either side of a closed period and concentrations of both steroids and tp were monitored in the leachate the study showed no significant effect of the treatment average p 0 17 though tracer concentrations did significantly change over time average p 0 001 while the steroidal concentration ratio was validated for herbivorous faecal pollution in the leachate there was a weak positive correlation between the steroids and tp further investigation at more natural scales hillslope catchment is required to confirm tracer behaviours correlations and to compliment this sub surface pathway study graphical abstract unlabelled

in faecal matter applied to soils should be wholly utilised by the plant or crop edmeades 2003 however limitations to nutrient use efficiency dobermann 2007 adverse weather conditions cassman et al 2002 and sub optimal management practices goulding et al 2007 can result in excessive faecal matter associated nutrient loss into waters via surface runoff or sub surface drain flow especially when rainfall follows recent applications shore et al 2016 ramos et al 2006 the combination of faecal matter and nutrients lost from agricultural land to water in organic fertilisers can result in microbial contamination and eutrophication foote et al 2015 chislock et al 2013 in the european union eu the nitrates directive ojeu 1991 is the main policy instrument used to manage agricultural nutrients as a water pollution pressure also in uk law following brexit in each state regulations can include limits on organic and inorganic fertiliser application rates basso et al 2016 and applications on sloping or frozen soils vadas et al 2019 velthof et al 2014 restrictions to the timings of applications buckley 2012 and specific yard management to ensure adequate slurry manure storage capacity barnes et al 2011 in several eu countries both n and p are regulated within the nd due to the combined impacts of these nutrients on sensitive aquatic receptors mcdonald et al 2019 jordan et al 2012 specific restrictions to the timing of fertiliser applications in the nd are designed to avoid incidental nutrient losses during periods of heavy rainfall these may be limited to nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs in river catchments barnes et al 2011 lord et al 2010 osborn and cook 1997 or based on whole territory designations buckley et al 2016 velthof et al 2014 farmers operating under these regulations must cease fertiliser applications after a certain specified date and only resume after another specified date barnes et al 2009 these closed period dates vary according to climatic zone but are generally coincident with periods of high effective rainfall totals and the concomitant elevated risk of incidental pollution transfers fig 1 in agricultural livestock systems where organic fertilisers are stored for subsequent land application the closed period may present certain management problems related to storage capacity for example where slurry and manure accumulate in storage due to wetter spring and summer conditions the pressure to spread immediately before the closed period starts increases or may run into the closed period if derogated by government shore et al 2016 furthermore the manure and slurry produced from winter housed livestock may require immediate application to relieve storage capacity as soon as the closed period ends buckley 2012 barnes et al 2009 these two scenarios may over large catchment areas present sudden water quality pressures and especially at times when soil moisture deficits are low and when rainfall becomes excess to soil storage and evapotranspiration since residual soil nutrients are also vulnerable to runoff during periods of high effective rainfall there is a requirement to understand how this potential pollution signal differs from incidental nutrient losses associated with organic fertiliser applications this is necessary to enable policies such as nvz closed periods to be risk assessed or to apportion water quality pressures from multiple sources in complex catchments shore et al 2016 for organic fertilisers this should include both the faecal matter and nutrient pressure for faecal matter biomarker techniques have been employed usually involving the unique properties of animal wastes but including the use of natural steroids manley et al 2020 leeming et al 1996 work to isotopically label n from specific sources in upstream catchments or water bodies is well established collins et al 2019 gooddy et al 2014 heaton et al 2012 kendall 1998 but isotope labels are more difficult to apply to p in these settings gooddy et al 2016 as p is considered to be the most important limiting nutrient in many freshwater systems chislock et al 2013 there is still a need to understand the coupling of faecal and p sources their combined mobilisation from soils and delivery to water bodies the use of steroids has the advantages of being able to target frequently detectable compounds in freshwater following faecal contamination fahrenfeld et al 2016 the ability to distinguish between human and non human sources shah et al 2007 leeming et al 1996 and of being temporally and geographically applicable noblet et al 2004 ottoson and stenström 2003 however with the definition of a biomarker being an organic compound that maintains sufficient structural integrity between source to source to be recognised leeming et al 1996 pp 2893 the propensity for steroids to undergo microbial based degradation can be a potential issue confounding their reliability therefore it is important to investigate their persistence at different scales and especially in combination with faecal matter associated p for example arnscheidt et al 2007 used riverbed sediments as passive samplers for steroid accumulations downstream of animal cattle sheep and human faecal sources they compared these data with seasonal tp concentrations at the delivery end of the catchment water pollution continuum there are fewer studies investigating steroids and p at the mobilisation end of the continuum reichwaldt et al 2017 nash and halliwell 2000 and particularly related to decay and or dilution processes to address this knowledge gap the primary aim of this study was to investigate the persistence and ratio changes to cattle slurry biomarkers steroids over time at plot scale in parallel to tp concentrations a secondary aim was to investigate the presence of a steroid fingerprint in sampled soil leachates the hypotheses were that i following an application of cattle slurry steroid and tp levels would spike and gradually decline due to being flushed out by wet weather over time ii that the ratios of the steroids would change as biohydrogenation would decrease the concentrations of primary steroids and increase the concentrations of secondary steroids and iii that it would be possible to identify the steroidal signals originating from herbivorous faecal matter 2 methods 2 1 treatments to investigate steroids and p mobilisation after slurry application at plot scale monolith lysimeters of intact blocks of soil 135 cm deep and 80 cm diameter located at rothamsted research north wyke devon uk fig 2 were used the lysimeters were last used more than 2 years previously this unpublished masters experiment involved the application of nitrogen and phosphate fertilisers triple superphosphate and calcium phosphate prior to this the lysimeters had not been used for over 10 years the lysimeters were assumed to act as analogues for hillslopes where sub surface hydrological pathways would leach water and water borne pollutants to deeper pathways or adjacent channels the soils in these monolith lysimeters were collected and deployed in 1982 following a methodology described by belford 1979 four soil series are represented and two were used in this study a free draining brown earth from the frilsham series world reference base luvisol and a well drained clay loam from the radyr series world reference base cambisol table 1 each was replicated four times fig 3 the surface of each lysimeter is situated level with the ground with a 10 mm layer of shingle below draining leachate into pipes silicone tubing and 25 l vessels in a collection tunnel below the lysimeters fig 3 cattle slurry was collected from an open air slurry lagoon on a dairy cattle farm in sw england on a grazed grassland system with winter housing of animals the eight lysimeters used were mown and slurry applied at a rate of 33 m3 ha in november 2019 and march 2020 approximately either side of a typical uk winter closed period fig 1 brennan et al 2012 although with a slightly late first application due to operational delays as the lysimeter plots have a surface area of 0 5 m2 approximately 1 66 l of slurry was applied manually samples of the slurry were also reserved from each lysimeter plot for analysis to act as a control one of the plots from each soil

between the 29th of november 2019 and the 4th of march 2020 following each storm event leachate samples were collected from the 25 l vessels in the collection tunnel this included 9 different sampling times table 2 with slurry being reapplied at the same application rate after the collection of samples at sampling time 6 samples were returned to the laboratory and analysed for steroids and tp to summarise the experiment had been arranged as a completely randomised design for the treated control soil series allocations with sampling time being allocated as a sub plot treatment where the lysimeters are the plots 2 2 steroidal analysis slurry samples taken during applications and lysimeter leachates were passed through pre furnaced pre weighed whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters these filters

handling and statistical analysis data were analysed in genstat 19 vsn international 2020 any values of 0 were due to the concentrations being below the level of detection for steroids or tp for anova data were compared using the lysimeter number as a block and the application of slurry as the treatment treatment sampling time soil due to the variability in concentrations amongst steroids and the numerous values of 0 the steroid data were increased by 0 01 and then transformed logarithm to base 10 the application of the logarithm transformation is to satisfy the anova assumption of homogeneity of variance with the addition of the small constant 0 01 to enable this transformation to be applied to the zero below the limit of detection observations the tp data were not increased or transformed due to having less variability principal component analysis pca was then performed to assess the variation in the data using the correlation matrix the correlation matrix was used as the scales on which different variables have been measured are different this pca looks for the combination of variables that explains as much of the variability in the data as possible correlation scale pca treats all variables equally and looks for this combination of variables to explain variability without any variable dominating the significance level for all statistical tests was 0 05 a final correlation test was performed on all the data all of which were logged including tp to investigate associations 3 results the slurry samples used in this study contained on average a dry matter content of 4 63 table 3 shows the average steroid and tp concentrations in the slurry spread on the lysimeters per application the anovas table 4 showed that the treatment yielded no significant effects on the concentrations of any of the steroid tracers it was a similar case for the series of soil used except in one instance with coprostanol p 0 03 sampling time was the only factor that had any significant effect this factor was extremely significant p 0 001 0 003 across all the steroid tracers consequently the two factor interactions including sampling time were more significant than their single factor counterparts whilst only coprostanol had a significant result for the interaction between treatment and sampling time p 0 015 it should be noted that the p values were still generally lower than in treatment alone almost all the tracers except cholesterol p 0 092 had significant results for the interaction between soil and sampling time p 0 001 0 026 however only three of the tracers had significant results by the interaction between all three of the factors coprostanol p 0 007 and 5β stigmastanol p 0 015 and campestanol p 0 043 to help illustrate the significance of the passage of time on steroid tracer concentrations sampling time fig 4 shows the varying concentrations of all the tracers per lysimeter over the sampling period there is a visible difference between the tracer concentrations of the radyr soil series fig 4 lysimeter 1 4 and the frilsham soil series fig 4 lysimeter 5 8 the radyr soil series appeared to begin with elevated concentrations of steroid that then decreased and remained low until the reapplication of slurry at sampling time 7 here in lysimeters 1 3 there was a spike in steroidal concentrations particularly of cattle slurry associated steroids 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol that decreased sharply in consequent samplings in the control for radyr soil lysimeter 4 this sharp increase was not seen except in epi coprostanol though there were still general though smaller increases in steroids at this time point the frilsham soil series appeared to start at higher concentrations of steroid than the radyr soil series this then sharply decreased in the frilsham lysimeters there was no clear pattern other than small variations though there was consistently always a small peak at sampling time 7 the graph showing the levels of tp across the lysimeters over time followed the same trend a decrease that levelled out followed by a small increase following cattle slurry reapplication fig 5 shows the different effects of the other factors in this experiment soil series and treatment as well as how they changed over time all steroids showed the same general trend control mean concentrations are almost always lower than the treated concentrations except for cholesterol at sampling time 4 and the radyr soil series has almost always higher concentrations than the frilsham soil series except at the first sampling time the tp graph has no real trend between the control treated and radyr frilsham soils but still shows the general trend of an initially high level that decreases over time table 5 shows the differing contributions of each steroid in the pca all the values for the steroids are quite similar in principal component pc 1 however the pca loadings of cholesterol 0 18846 β sitosterol 0 21911 campesterol 0 22894 and 5α cholestanol 0 24061 table 5 are marginally lower than the rest this suggests that the first pc is more of a mean of all the responses of the steroids as they are all so similarly weighted the second pc has more variation in the responses of each steroid some of the steroids have negative loadings epi 5β stigmastanol stigmasterol 5α cholestanol campesterol β sitosterol and cholesterol the second principal component is therefore capturing a difference between these groups of steroids in fig 6 this can be seen graphically as those steroids with higher concentrations are on the positive axis and ones with lower concentrations are on the negative axis resulting in two groups fig 6 also reveals some general groupings the frilsham soil series is generally on the right of the plot as are the control lysimeter points the correlation plot fig 7 shows the level of correlation between the variables all the steroids have a very high positive correlation with values ranging from 0 48 8 9 epi coprostanol cholesterol to 1 00 13 14 24 ethyl coprostenol 24 ethyl epi coprostenol cholesterol is generally the steroid with the smallest correlation amongst the steroids in terms of correlations between tp and the steroids there is a weak positive correlation between 0 14 and 0 26 and one steroid 9 cholesterol with a negative correlation 0 18 with tp 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the treatment an application of cattle slurry at a rate of 33 m3 ha was the treatment used in this experiment agricultural cattle slurry can contain high levels of nutrients such as p and n li et al 2019 mcgechan 2002 slurry is also a key source of the steroids considered faecal indicators such as 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol prost et al 2017 leeming et al 1996 the slurry applied to the lysimeters in this experiment did indeed have these high levels of both steroids and tp table 4 there was however a lowering of these levels between applications that can be attributed to being stored over the study period as such it was unexpected to find there was no significant effect of the treatment on any of the lysimeters in this experiment with the anova results table 4 ranging from 0 082 coprostanol to 0 798 tp however it can still be seen in fig 5 that there is a general trend of the treated lysimeters having higher concentrations of steroid than that of the control lysimeters just not significantly so regarding tp it would have been more expected that the treatment would have caused a significant difference between the treated and control lysimeters as slurry is used as a fertiliser to add p and n to soils however as stated there was no significant difference between the treated and the control lysimeter regarding p in this experiment typically for p to move vertically slower and more prolonged hydrological responses are required this allows leachate production that will penetrate deeper and may contain the p from the application of slurry however the autumn winter of 2019 2020 was very wet and had many flashy rain events for the period of sampling november to march the average rainfall per year was 560 7 mm for 2016 17 1296 5 mm for 2017 18 1156 3 mm for 2018 19 and 1787 0 mm for the sampled year 2019 20 this could explain the lack of a p signal as the greater penetration would result in greater dilution for steroids it is not as surprising that there was no effect of treatment though this could have been similarly affected by the heavy rainfall like p in this study the leachate from each of the lysimeters was collected filtered and analysed the leachate was quite clear and devoid of any sediment particulates with samples containing less than 0 01 g l thus requiring many litres to be collected typically 10 18 l this meant there was very little solid matter on the filter papers to be analysed it is generally accepted that steroids are predominantly found in solid matrices as opposed to liquid due to the hydrophobic nature of steroids as non polar molecules matić bujagić et al 2016 writer et al 1995 brown and wade 1984 this coincides with the knowledge that 95 of steroids are found in the suspended sediment fraction of water isobe et al 2002 as well as attached to colloidal material nash and halliwell 2000 as such with so little solid matter being on the filter paper and the filter papers pore size 0 7 μm being too large to retain any colloids it is perhaps unsurprising that a significant level of steroids had not leached from the surface through the soil and into the sampled leachate 4 2 the effect of soil series differences two different soil series were used in this study radyr clay loam and frilsham sandy loam table 1 in general there was no significant effect caused by using the different soil series though there were two tracers coprostanol and 5β campestanol table 4 that were significantly affected with respective p values of 0 03 and 0 036 table 4 however whilst there was statistically no difference between the two soils it can be seen in fig 4 that there is a visible difference in the tracer concentrations between the two soil series as well as amongst the frilsham soil series where there were two distinct patterns the differences between these soil series are further illustrated in fig 5 where a trend shows that the radyr lysimeters generally have much higher steroidal concentrations than frilsham whilst soil carbon content has been reported to be a factor to consider regarding steroid transport qi and zhang 2016 there is no real difference in the carbon content of the two soils used in this study table 1 so this can be eliminated as a factor another factor that is known to have an impact on the sorption of steroids to soil is particle size sangster et al 2015 qi et al 2014 isobe et al 2002 typically sorption capacity for steroid hormones is ranked clay silt sand qi et al 2014 as the frilsham soil has a much higher content of coarse sands compared with clays than radyr it would be expected that there would be less steroid sorption table 1 however this is not the case in this study where there are higher concentrations of faecal steroids within the leachate from radyr lysimeters fig 4 and fig 5 this is unexpected as the literature sangster et al 2015 qi et al 2014 indicates it should be the opposite however the cited studies investigated steroid hormones and faecal steroids and it has been shown that not all steroids follow this trend isobe et al 2002 further investigation would be required to fully understand sorption processes in our study soils regarding tp however after the initially high values at sampling 1 fig 4 there is little fluctuation this could indicate that an equilibrium was being maintained within the soil water due to desorption processes between the leachate water and the soil turner and haygarth 2000 these differences could be linked to the chalky nature of the soil with an average ph of 7 as calcium fixes p by precipitation turner and haygarth 2000 furthermore the frilsham soil series is known to have relatively impeded drainage due this lower layer of chalky rubble in contrast the radyr soil series is freely draining 4 3 the effect of time the experiment spanned a period of 6 months from november 2019 to march 2020 it can be observed from table 4 that time was indeed the only factor that had any significance for all the steroid tracers in this study with anova p values ranging from 0 001 0 003 however multiple factor interactions including sampling time did have significant results also this shows that whilst the differences between the treatment application and soil series were not significant themselves the significant interactions involving sampling time and the other factors suggests changes between the levels of the interacting factor the significant interactions between sampling time and treatment indicates that there are differences between treated and control plots over time this is shown in fig 5 where for all steroids at all times barring cholesterol at sampling time 4 the lysimeters treated with slurry had mean steroidal concentrations higher than that of the control lysimeters the significant interactions between sampling time and soil series indicates that the differences between the two soils changes over time this again is illustrated in fig 5 where the radyr soil series is consistently always has higher mean tracer concentrations than the frilsham soil series except at sampling time 1 the significant three factor interactions between all factors indicates that the consistency of the effects of treated vs control in the different soils changes over time these interactions between factors can also be seen in fig 4 where the tracer concentrations in the 8 lysimeters have been separated over time in lysimeters 1 4 radyr soil series fig 4 steroidal concentrations were generally higher at sampling time 1 and then slowly declined till sampling time 6 at this point slurry was reapplied there was then a spike in steroidal concentrations particularly in 24 ethyl coprostanol epi 24 ethyl coprostanol cholesterol and epi coprostanol these steroids are commonly associated with cattle slurry leeming et al 1996 so this spike was unsurprising in lysimeter 4 radyr control lysimeter fig 4 despite not receiving treatment the lysimeter showed a similar trend though on a much smaller scale as the highest steroidal concentration was approximately 120 μg g compared to 600 3000 μg g observed in the other lysimeters this small spike was also not from the expected cattle slurry indicator steroids mentioned previously but epi coprostanol the second soil frilsham showed no obvious trends fig 4 lysimeters 5 and 6 began with a higher steroid concentration than lysimeters 7 and 8 though lysimeter 6 had a much lower general steroid concentration approximately 30 times this could be a consequence of innate differences amongst lysimeters of the same soil series these lysimeters like the lysimeters representing the radyr soil series had a small spike of steroid concentrations at sampling time 7 steroids are known to adhere to solid matrices due to their hydrophobic nature matić bujagić et al 2016 which can produce a lag in vertical transport however this was not the case in this study there have been previous investigations on these lysimeters that have indicated such rapid fluxes of slurry related tracers the lysimeters used in this study have been used previously to monitor the behaviour of nutrients from fertilisers in subsurface pathways alfaro et al 2006 turner and haygarth 2000 turner and haygarth 2000 applied fertiliser to these lysimeters between september 1993 june 1994 and then again between october 1994 may 1995 leachate samples were taken and measured for different forms of p in this study a larger than expected p concentration in the 0 45 μm fraction was detected in the leachate which indicated the importance of preferential flow through the soil profiles in the lysimeters similarly alfaro et al 2006 used the lysimeters between june 2000 june 2001 which involved applying cattle slurry and measuring potassium k in both leachate and the soil again preferential flow and macropores were indicated as having effects within the lysimeters that caused high k concentrations in the leachate whilst some work has reported that steroids move vertically quite slowly through soil profiles the presence of preferential flow pathways and the high rainfall during the sampling period clearly resulted in rapid movement hence a clear steroid fingerprint was detected in the leachate samples despite the relatively shorter sampling period as previously highlighted the steroids themselves cannot be used individually as indicators of cattle waste pollution rather they were used in ratios to do this this includes the relative ratios of epi coprostanol to 5β stigmastanol ratio 1 leeming et al 1996 and coprostanol to coprostanol 5β stigmastanol ratio 2 harrault et al 2019 leeming et al 1997 at approximately ratio 1 values 2 8 indicate human faeces whereas 0 1 2 indicates animals leeming et al 1997 for ratio 2 values 0 38 indicate herbivore faeces and values 0 73 indicate human faeces in this study it was hypothesised that these ratios would be evident at both application times 1 and 7 with the ratios decreasing slightly after applications none of the lysimeters had sufficient concentrations of steroid to use the ratios at all sampling times lysimeters 6 8 did not have sufficient steroid concentrations to use these ratios at all except lysimeter 6 at sampling time one where ratio 1 was 0 18 and ratio 2 was 0 24 both of these values are indicative of herbivorous faecal contamination however within lysimeters 1 5 it was possible to use these ratios more usually at the first 3 sampling times and the last 3 sampling times lysimeter 5 was the only lysimeter that had an initial ratio 1 that was 0 18 0 10 this lysimeter then increased slightly to 0 14 at sampling time 2 and then dropped down to 0 11 at sampling time 3 this small increase could be due to a time lag lysimeters 1 4 had initial ratio 1 values that were higher than the value indicating herbivorous faecal pollution but too low to indicate human faecal pollution 2 8 for ratio 2 lysimeters 1 2 3 and 5 were all also indicative of herbivorous faeces 0 38 whilst lysimeters 4 6 7 and 8 did not have the steroid profile to use the ratio these differences in ratios could be because of biohydrogenation causing certain steroids to change structure into a different steroid leeming et al 1996 4 4 limitations and next stages this study used lysimeters as analogues to study steroid and tp transfer processes in sub surface hydrological pathways leaching at the hillslope scale the experimental set up is a useful link between laboratory scale and catchment scale experiments wang et al 2012 but does not account for more surface driven high energy hydrological pathways the lysimeters boundaries and consequent disruption to soil drainage pütz et al 2018 and the restrictive dimensions of the lysimeters can affect the hydraulic gradient and natural flow field of the soil pütz et al 2018 corwin 2000 thus even with minimal physical disturbance to the soil taken for the monolith there would still be differences compared to natural hillslope conditions this could result in differences in transit time for leaching and the steroids contained kim et al 2016 as such these differences could cause different steroidal signals to occur at larger scales moreover the data here indicate that particulate matter vectors for steroids and tp were not high in magnitude or consistent and that any pathways may have been impacted by other soil physical properties swelling shrinking or acted as chemical barriers p adsorption in addition to this there was an assumption that the flux was the same for all lysimeters due to the combination of a lack of particulate matter and large leachate volumes full 25 l bottles upon collection here it is noteworthy that previous work using these lysimeters also indicated flows were very similar for these lysimeters alfaro et al 2006 turner and haygarth 2000 in summary the study provides a benchmark for steroid nutrient dynamics from cattle slurry in sub surface leaching pathways as being a low magnitude and inconsistent transport process and likely impacted by flushing dilution similar experiments and experimental design in surface hydrological pathways would be the next important stage 5 conclusion this study used monolith lysimeters that had cattle slurry applied both at the beginning and end of a slurry spreading closed period the leachate from this was then analysed using ase and the aquakem to monitor faecal steroids and tp respectively during the length of this experiment there were two small steroid concentration spikes that occurred following slurry applications that then decreased over time this was particularly true for 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol typical ruminant faecal indicator steroids from this it could be seen that whilst the treatment of cattle slurry itself had no significant effect p 0 05 sampling time did p 0 05 this could have been due in part to the treatment potentially being understated by the particularly wet year causing heavy dilution or perhaps due to the near negligible amount of sediment found in the sampled leachate since steroids typically adhere to particulate matter regardless the study showed that indeed tracer concentrations do spike following slurry application and decrease over time hypothesis i regarding the actual concentrations of the steroids these too changed over time the ratios used in this study work by making comparisons between primary and secondary steroids in other words comparing precursor primary steroids to their resultant secondary steroids that form following biohydrogenation by microbes however this is not always possible due to either insufficient or non existent concentrations of steroids potentially due to the aforementioned issues in the cases within this study where steroid profiles had enough data to use these ratios such as in lysimeter 5 it was possible to identify correctly the steroids as having come from ruminant faecal contamination thus the study showed that there were differences in primary secondary steroid concentrations over the course of the experiment and that it was also possible to use these concentrations to identify the origin of the contamination hypotheses ii and iii the next logical step to extend this study would be to take it to hillslope plot scale completing experimental work examining the persistence of steroid tracers in both surface and subsurface pathways or even further to catchment scale this would tackle the limitations addressed here and further confirm the utility of the approach for disentangling incidental and residual nutrient sources credit authorship contribution statement amber manley conceptualization

1317,water quality degradation can be caused by excessive agricultural nutrient transfers from fertilised soils exposed to wet weather mitigation measures within the eu nitrates directive aim to reduce this pressure by including closed fertiliser spreading periods during wet months for organic fertilisers such as slurry and manure this closed period requires sufficient on farm winter storage and good weather conditions to relieve storage at the end of the period therefore robust scientific evidence is needed to support the measure incidental nutrient transfers of recently applied organic fertilisers in wet weather can also be complicated by synchronous transfers from residual soil stores and tracing is required for risk assessments the combination of nutrient monitoring and biomarker analyses may aid this and one such biomarker suite is faecal steroids accordingly this study investigated the persistence of steroids and their association with phosphorus during leaching episodes the focus was on the coupled behaviour of steroids and total phosphorus tp concentrations in sub surface hydrological pathways cattle slurry was applied to monolith lysimeters either side of a closed period and concentrations of both steroids and tp were monitored in the leachate the study showed no significant effect of the treatment average p 0 17 though tracer concentrations did significantly change over time average p 0 001 while the steroidal concentration ratio was validated for herbivorous faecal pollution in the leachate there was a weak positive correlation between the steroids and

rainfall follows recent applications shore et al 2016 ramos et al 2006 the combination of faecal matter and nutrients lost from agricultural land to water in organic fertilisers can result in microbial contamination and eutrophication foote et al 2015 chislock et al 2013 in the european union eu the nitrates directive ojeu 1991 is the main policy instrument used to manage agricultural nutrients as a water pollution pressure also in uk law following brexit in each state regulations can include limits on organic and inorganic fertiliser application rates basso et al 2016 and applications on sloping or frozen soils vadas et al 2019 velthof et al 2014 restrictions to the timings of applications buckley 2012 and specific yard management to ensure adequate slurry manure storage capacity barnes et al 2011 in several eu countries both n and p are regulated within the nd due to the combined impacts of these nutrients on sensitive aquatic receptors mcdonald et al 2019 jordan et al 2012 specific restrictions to the timing of fertiliser applications in the nd are designed to avoid incidental nutrient losses during periods of heavy rainfall these may be limited to nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs in river catchments barnes et al 2011 lord et al 2010 osborn and cook 1997 or based on whole territory designations buckley et al 2016 velthof et al 2014 farmers operating under these regulations must cease fertiliser applications after a certain specified date and only resume after another specified date barnes et al 2009 these closed period dates vary according to climatic zone but are generally coincident with periods of high effective rainfall totals and the concomitant elevated risk of incidental pollution transfers fig 1 in agricultural livestock systems where organic fertilisers are stored for subsequent land application the closed period may present certain management problems related to storage capacity for example where slurry and manure accumulate in storage due to wetter spring and summer conditions the pressure to spread immediately before the closed period starts increases or may run into the closed period if derogated by government shore et al 2016 furthermore the manure and slurry produced from winter housed livestock may require immediate application to relieve storage capacity as soon as the closed period ends buckley 2012 barnes et al 2009 these two scenarios may over large catchment areas present sudden water quality pressures and especially at times when soil moisture deficits are low and when rainfall becomes excess to soil storage and evapotranspiration since residual soil nutrients are also vulnerable to runoff during periods of high effective rainfall there is a requirement to understand how this potential pollution signal differs from incidental nutrient losses associated with organic fertiliser applications this is necessary to enable policies such as nvz closed periods to be risk assessed or to apportion water quality pressures from multiple sources in complex catchments shore et al 2016 for organic fertilisers this should include both the faecal matter and nutrient pressure for faecal matter biomarker techniques have been employed usually involving the unique properties of animal wastes but including the use of natural steroids manley et al 2020 leeming et al 1996 work to isotopically label n from specific sources in upstream catchments or water bodies is well established collins et al 2019 gooddy et al 2014 heaton et al 2012 kendall 1998 but isotope labels are more difficult to apply to p in these settings gooddy et al 2016 as p is considered to be the most important limiting nutrient in many freshwater systems chislock et al 2013 there is still a need to understand the coupling of faecal and p sources their combined mobilisation from soils and delivery to water bodies the use of steroids has the advantages of being able to target frequently detectable compounds in freshwater following faecal contamination fahrenfeld et al 2016 the ability to distinguish between human and non human sources shah et al 2007 leeming et al 1996 and of being temporally and geographically applicable noblet et al 2004 ottoson and stenström 2003 however with the definition of a biomarker being an organic compound that maintains sufficient structural integrity between source to source to be recognised leeming et al 1996 pp 2893 the propensity for steroids to undergo microbial based degradation can be a potential issue confounding their reliability therefore it is important to investigate their persistence at different scales and especially in combination with faecal matter associated p for example arnscheidt et al 2007 used riverbed sediments as passive samplers for steroid accumulations downstream of animal cattle sheep and human faecal sources they compared these data with seasonal tp concentrations at the delivery end of the catchment water pollution continuum there are fewer studies investigating steroids and p at the mobilisation end of the continuum reichwaldt et al 2017 nash and halliwell 2000 and particularly related to decay and or dilution processes to address this knowledge gap the primary aim of this study was to investigate the persistence and ratio changes to cattle slurry biomarkers steroids over time at plot scale in parallel to tp concentrations a secondary aim was to investigate the presence of a steroid fingerprint in sampled soil leachates the hypotheses were that i following an application of cattle slurry steroid and tp levels would spike and gradually decline due to being flushed out by wet weather over time ii that the ratios of the steroids would change as biohydrogenation would decrease the concentrations of primary steroids and increase the concentrations of secondary steroids and iii that it would be possible to identify the steroidal signals originating from herbivorous faecal matter 2 methods 2 1 treatments to investigate steroids and p mobilisation after slurry application at plot scale monolith lysimeters of intact blocks of soil 135 cm deep and 80 cm diameter located at

phosphate fertilisers triple superphosphate and calcium phosphate prior to this the lysimeters had not been used for over 10 years the lysimeters were assumed to act as analogues for hillslopes where sub surface hydrological pathways would leach water and water borne pollutants to deeper pathways or adjacent channels the soils in these monolith lysimeters were collected and deployed in 1982 following a methodology described by belford 1979 four soil series are represented and two were used in this study a free draining brown earth from the frilsham series world reference base luvisol and a well drained clay loam from the radyr series world reference base cambisol table 1 each was replicated four times fig 3 the surface of each lysimeter is situated level with the ground with a 10 mm layer of shingle below draining leachate into pipes silicone tubing and 25 l vessels in a collection tunnel below the lysimeters fig 3 cattle slurry was collected from an open air slurry lagoon on a dairy cattle farm in sw england on a grazed grassland system with winter housing of animals the eight lysimeters used were mown and slurry applied at a rate of 33 m3 ha in november 2019 and march 2020 approximately either side of a typical uk winter closed period fig 1 brennan et al 2012 although with a slightly late first application due to operational delays as the lysimeter plots have a surface area of 0 5 m2 approximately 1 66 l of slurry was applied manually samples of the slurry were also reserved from each lysimeter plot for analysis to act as a control one of the plots from each soil series was selected at random to receive no slurry treatment radyr 4 and frilsham 8 plots shown in fig 3 the slurry applications were exposed to natural rainfall periods over a period of 6 months between the 29th of november 2019 and the 4th of march 2020 following each storm event leachate samples were collected from the 25 l vessels in the collection tunnel this included 9 different sampling times table 2 with slurry being reapplied at the same application rate after the collection of samples at sampling time 6 samples were returned to the laboratory and analysed for steroids and tp to summarise the experiment had been arranged as a completely randomised design for the treated control soil series allocations with sampling time being allocated as a sub plot treatment where the lysimeters are the plots 2 2 steroidal analysis slurry samples taken during applications and lysimeter leachates were passed through pre furnaced pre weighed whatman gf f 0 7 μm filters these filters were then dried overnight in an oven set at 30 c the samples were extracted using a dionex ase 350 thermo fisher scientific hemel hempstead hertfordshire uk by accelerated solvent extraction ase the full details of the ase methodology are described in manley et al 2020 samples were inserted into ase cells with the internal standard 20 μl of 0 2 mg ml 5β pregan 3α ol and underwent extraction this gave the total lipid extracts tle for the samples the tles were then rotary evaporated resuspended in dichloromethane dcm acetone 1 1 and evaporated at 40 c under a gentle stream of n2 blown down the tle samples were processed and analysed following the methodology of manley et al 2020 derived from bull et al 2003 the tles were saponified to break any ester bonds and free all alcohols using 5 m potassium hydroxide in 90 methanol saponified extracts were then acidified and extracted in chloroform following this extracts were put through drying columns using chloroform these columns were comprised of glass pasteur pipettes solvent cleaned cotton wool to plug and 5 cm of activated sodium sulphate extracts were then fractionated using fractionation columns the same structure as drying columns except activated silica instead of sodium sulphate using dcm fraction 1 and dcm methanol at a ratio of 1 1 fraction 2 the extract fraction isolating the steroids was then blown down finally fractionated extracts were derivatised via silylation using n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide trimethylchlorosilane and blown down in preparation for analysis via gc ms the samples were analysed using an agilent technologies 6890gc 5973 n gc ms with 7683 autosampler agilent technologies santa clara california usa the total ion count tic data were acquired and analysed using agilent chemstation software the biomarkers were identified using known characteristic spectra and comparisons with those in the national institute of standards spectral library nist 2012 accessed 2019 the tic data were quantified against internal standards and had a detection limit of 0 3 μg g 2 3 tp analysis leachate samples were agitated and sub samples placed into 30 ml greiner tubes pre leached slurry samples were diluted down to 1 50 by pipetting 0 5 ml of sample and 24 5 ml of milliq water into 30 ml greiner bottles before analyses an aquakem 250 discrete photometric analyser thermo fisher

forms of p organic condensed and colloidal are converted to orthophosphate by oxidation with acidified potassium persulphate in an autoclave at 121 c total phosphate is subsequently determined colourimetrically by reaction with ammonium molybdate in acid solution to form phosphomolybdic acid and reduction to phosphomolybdenum blue which has absorbance maxima at 660 nm and 880 nm 2 4 data handling and statistical analysis data were analysed in genstat 19 vsn international 2020 any values of 0 were due to the concentrations being below the level of detection for steroids or tp for anova data were compared using the lysimeter number as a block and the application of slurry as the treatment treatment sampling time soil due to the variability in concentrations amongst steroids and the numerous values of 0 the steroid data were increased by 0 01 and then transformed logarithm to base 10 the application of the logarithm transformation is to satisfy the anova assumption of homogeneity of variance with the addition of the small constant 0 01 to enable this transformation to be applied to the zero below the limit of detection observations the tp data were not increased or transformed due to having less variability principal component analysis pca was then performed to assess the variation in the data using the correlation matrix the correlation matrix was used as the scales on which different variables have been measured are different this pca looks for the combination of variables that explains as much of the variability in the data as possible correlation scale pca treats all variables equally and looks for this combination of variables to explain variability without any variable dominating the significance level for all statistical tests was 0 05 a final correlation test was performed on all the data all of which were logged including tp to investigate associations 3 results the slurry samples used in this study contained on average a dry matter content of 4 63 table 3 shows the average steroid and tp concentrations in the slurry spread on the lysimeters per application the anovas table 4 showed that the treatment yielded no significant effects on the concentrations of any of the steroid tracers it was a similar case for the series of soil used except in one instance with coprostanol p 0 03 sampling time was the only factor that had any significant effect this factor was extremely significant p 0 001 0 003 across all the steroid tracers consequently the two factor interactions including sampling time were more significant than their single factor counterparts whilst only coprostanol had a significant result for the interaction between treatment and sampling time p 0 015 it should be noted that the p values were still generally lower than in treatment alone almost all the tracers except cholesterol p 0 092 had significant results for the interaction between soil and sampling time p 0 001 0 026 however only three of the tracers had significant results by the interaction between all three of the factors coprostanol p 0 007 and 5β stigmastanol p 0 015 and campestanol p 0 043 to help illustrate the significance of the passage of time on steroid tracer concentrations sampling time fig 4 shows the varying concentrations of all the tracers per lysimeter over the sampling period there is a visible difference between the tracer concentrations of the radyr soil series fig 4 lysimeter 1 4 and the frilsham soil series fig 4 lysimeter 5 8 the radyr soil series appeared to begin with elevated concentrations of steroid that then decreased and remained low until the reapplication of slurry at sampling time 7 here in lysimeters 1 3 there was a spike in steroidal concentrations particularly of cattle slurry associated steroids 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol that decreased sharply in consequent samplings in the control for radyr soil lysimeter 4 this sharp increase was not seen except in epi coprostanol though there were still general though smaller increases in steroids at this time point the frilsham soil series appeared to start at higher concentrations of steroid than the radyr soil series this then sharply decreased in the frilsham lysimeters there was no clear pattern other than small variations though there was consistently always a small peak at sampling time 7 the graph showing the levels of tp across the lysimeters over time followed the same trend a decrease that levelled out followed by a small increase following cattle slurry reapplication fig 5 shows the different effects of the other factors in this experiment soil series and treatment as well as how they changed over time all steroids showed the same general trend control mean concentrations are almost always lower than the treated concentrations except for cholesterol at sampling time 4 and the radyr soil series has almost always higher concentrations than the frilsham soil series except at the first sampling time the tp graph has no real trend between the control treated and radyr frilsham soils but still shows the general trend of an initially high level that decreases over time table 5 shows the differing contributions of each steroid in the pca all the values for the steroids are quite similar in principal component pc 1 however the pca loadings of cholesterol 0 18846 β sitosterol 0 21911 campesterol 0 22894 and 5α cholestanol 0 24061 table 5 are marginally lower than the rest this suggests that the first pc is more of a mean of all the responses of the steroids as they are all so similarly weighted the second pc has more variation in the responses of each steroid some of the steroids have negative loadings epi 5β stigmastanol stigmasterol 5α cholestanol campesterol β sitosterol and cholesterol the second principal component is therefore capturing a difference between these groups of steroids in fig 6 this can be seen graphically as those steroids with higher concentrations are on the positive axis and ones with lower concentrations are on the negative axis resulting in two groups fig 6 also reveals some general groupings the frilsham soil series is generally on the right of the plot as are the control lysimeter points the correlation plot fig 7 shows the level of correlation between the variables all the steroids have a very high positive correlation with values ranging from 0 48 8 9 epi coprostanol cholesterol to 1 00 13 14 24 ethyl coprostenol 24 ethyl epi coprostenol cholesterol is generally the steroid with the smallest correlation amongst the steroids in terms of correlations between tp and the steroids there is a weak positive correlation between 0 14 and 0 26 and one steroid 9 cholesterol with a negative correlation 0 18 with tp 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of the treatment an application of cattle slurry at a rate of 33 m3 ha was the treatment used in this experiment agricultural cattle slurry can contain high levels of nutrients such as p and n li et al 2019 mcgechan 2002 slurry is also a key source of the steroids considered faecal indicators such as 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol prost et al 2017 leeming et al 1996 the slurry applied to the lysimeters in this experiment did indeed have these high levels of both steroids and tp table 4 there was however a lowering of these levels between applications that can be attributed to being stored over the study period as such it was unexpected to find there was no significant effect of the treatment on any of the lysimeters in this experiment with the anova results table 4 ranging from 0 082 coprostanol to 0 798 tp however it can still be seen in fig 5 that there is a general trend of the treated lysimeters having higher concentrations of steroid than that of the control lysimeters just not significantly so regarding tp it would have been more expected that the treatment would have caused a significant difference between the treated and control lysimeters as slurry is used as a fertiliser to add p and n to soils however as stated there was no significant difference between the treated and the control lysimeter regarding p in this experiment typically for p to move vertically slower and more prolonged hydrological responses are required this allows leachate production that will penetrate deeper and may contain the p from the application of slurry however the autumn winter of 2019 2020 was very wet and had many flashy rain events for the period of sampling november to march the average rainfall per year was 560 7 mm for 2016 17 1296 5 mm for 2017 18 1156 3 mm for 2018 19 and 1787 0 mm for the sampled year 2019 20 this could explain the lack of a p signal as the greater penetration would result in greater dilution for steroids it is not as surprising that there was no effect of treatment though this could have been similarly affected by the heavy rainfall like p in this study the leachate from each of the lysimeters was collected filtered and analysed the leachate was quite clear and devoid of any sediment particulates with samples containing less than 0 01 g l thus requiring many litres to be collected typically 10 18 l this meant there was very little solid matter on the filter papers to be analysed it is generally accepted that steroids are predominantly found in solid matrices as opposed to liquid due to the hydrophobic nature of steroids as non polar molecules matić bujagić et al 2016 writer et al 1995 brown and wade 1984 this coincides with the knowledge that 95 of steroids are found in the suspended sediment fraction of water isobe et al 2002 as well as attached to colloidal material nash and halliwell 2000 as such with so little solid matter being on the filter paper and the filter papers pore size 0 7 μm being too large to retain any colloids it is perhaps unsurprising that a significant level of steroids had not leached from the surface through the soil and into the sampled leachate 4 2 the effect of soil series differences two different soil series were used in this study radyr clay loam and frilsham sandy loam table 1 in general there was no significant effect caused by using the different soil series though there were two tracers coprostanol and 5β campestanol table 4 that were significantly affected with respective p values of 0 03 and 0 036 table 4 however whilst there was statistically no difference between the two soils it can be seen in fig 4 that there is a visible difference in the tracer concentrations between the two soil series as well as amongst the frilsham soil series where there were two distinct patterns the differences between these soil series are further illustrated in fig 5 where a trend shows that the radyr lysimeters generally have much higher steroidal concentrations than frilsham whilst soil carbon content has been reported to be a factor to consider regarding steroid transport qi and zhang 2016 there is no real difference in the carbon content of the two soils used in this study table 1 so this can be eliminated as a factor another factor that is known to have an impact on the sorption of steroids to soil is particle size sangster et al 2015 qi et al 2014 isobe et al 2002 typically sorption capacity for steroid hormones is ranked clay silt sand qi et al 2014 as the frilsham soil has a much higher content of coarse sands compared with clays than radyr it would be expected that there would be less steroid sorption table 1 however this is not the case in this study where there are higher concentrations of faecal steroids within the leachate from radyr lysimeters fig 4 and fig 5 this is unexpected as the literature sangster et al 2015 qi et al 2014 indicates it should be the opposite however the cited studies investigated steroid hormones and faecal steroids and it has been shown that not all steroids follow this trend isobe et al 2002 further investigation would be required to fully understand sorption processes in our study soils regarding tp however after the initially high values at sampling 1 fig 4 there is little fluctuation this could indicate that an equilibrium was being maintained within the soil water due to desorption processes between the leachate water and the soil turner and haygarth 2000 these differences could be linked to the chalky nature of the soil with an average ph of 7 as calcium fixes p by precipitation turner and haygarth 2000 furthermore the frilsham soil series is known to have relatively impeded drainage due this lower layer of chalky rubble in contrast the radyr soil series is freely draining 4 3 the effect of time the experiment spanned a period of 6 months from november 2019 to march 2020 it can be observed from table 4 that time was indeed the only factor that had any significance for all the steroid tracers in this study with anova p values ranging from 0 001 0 003 however multiple factor interactions including sampling time did have significant results also this shows that whilst the differences between the treatment application and soil series were not significant themselves the significant interactions involving sampling time and the other factors suggests changes between the levels of the interacting factor the significant interactions between sampling time and treatment indicates that there are differences between treated and control plots over time this is shown in fig 5 where for all steroids at all times barring cholesterol at sampling time 4 the lysimeters treated with slurry had mean steroidal concentrations higher than that of the control lysimeters the significant interactions between sampling time and soil series indicates that the differences between the two soils changes over time this again is illustrated in fig 5 where the radyr soil series is consistently always has higher mean tracer concentrations than the frilsham soil series except at sampling time 1 the significant three factor interactions between all factors indicates that the consistency of the effects of treated vs control in the different soils changes over time these interactions between factors can also be seen in fig 4 where the tracer concentrations in the 8 lysimeters have been separated over time in lysimeters 1 4 radyr soil series fig 4 steroidal concentrations were generally higher at sampling time 1 and then slowly declined till sampling time 6 at this point slurry was reapplied there was then a spike in steroidal concentrations particularly in 24 ethyl coprostanol epi 24 ethyl coprostanol cholesterol and epi coprostanol these steroids are commonly associated with cattle slurry leeming et al 1996 so this spike was unsurprising in lysimeter 4 radyr control lysimeter fig 4 despite not receiving treatment the lysimeter showed a similar trend though on a much smaller scale as the highest steroidal concentration was approximately 120 μg g compared to 600 3000 μg g observed in the other lysimeters this small spike was also not from the expected cattle slurry indicator steroids mentioned previously but epi coprostanol the second soil frilsham showed no obvious trends fig 4 lysimeters 5 and 6 began with a higher steroid concentration than lysimeters 7 and 8 though lysimeter 6 had a much lower general steroid concentration approximately 30 times this could be a consequence of innate differences amongst lysimeters of the same soil series these lysimeters like the lysimeters representing the radyr soil series had a small spike of steroid concentrations at sampling time 7 steroids are known to adhere to solid matrices due to their hydrophobic nature matić bujagić et al 2016 which can produce a lag in vertical transport however this was not the case in this study there have been previous investigations on these lysimeters that have indicated such rapid fluxes of slurry related tracers the lysimeters used in this study have been used previously to monitor the behaviour of nutrients from fertilisers in subsurface pathways alfaro et al 2006 turner and haygarth 2000 turner and haygarth 2000 applied fertiliser to these lysimeters between september 1993 june 1994 and then again between october 1994 may 1995 leachate samples were taken and measured for different forms of p in this study a larger than expected p concentration in the 0 45 μm fraction was detected in the leachate which indicated the importance of preferential flow through the soil profiles in the lysimeters similarly alfaro et al 2006 used the lysimeters between june 2000 june 2001 which involved applying cattle slurry and measuring potassium k in both leachate and the soil again preferential flow and macropores were indicated as having effects within the lysimeters that caused high k concentrations in the leachate whilst some work has reported that steroids move vertically quite slowly through soil profiles the presence of preferential flow pathways and the high rainfall during the sampling period clearly resulted in rapid movement hence a clear steroid fingerprint was detected in the leachate samples despite the relatively shorter sampling period as previously highlighted the steroids themselves cannot be used individually as indicators of cattle waste pollution rather they were used in ratios to do this this includes the relative ratios of epi coprostanol to 5β stigmastanol ratio 1 leeming et al 1996 and coprostanol to coprostanol 5β stigmastanol ratio 2 harrault et al 2019 leeming et al 1997 at approximately ratio 1 values 2 8 indicate human faeces whereas 0 1 2 indicates animals leeming et al 1997 for ratio 2 values 0 38 indicate herbivore faeces and values 0 73 indicate human faeces in this study it was hypothesised that these ratios would be evident at both application times 1 and 7 with the ratios decreasing slightly after applications none of the lysimeters had sufficient concentrations of steroid to use the ratios at all sampling times lysimeters 6 8 did not have sufficient steroid concentrations to use these ratios at all except lysimeter 6 at sampling time one where ratio 1 was 0 18 and ratio 2 was 0 24 both of these values are indicative of herbivorous faecal contamination however within lysimeters 1 5 it was possible to use these ratios more usually at the first 3 sampling times and the last 3 sampling times lysimeter 5 was the only lysimeter that had an initial ratio 1 that was 0 18 0 10 this lysimeter then increased slightly to 0 14 at sampling time 2 and then dropped down to 0 11 at sampling time 3 this small increase could be due to a time lag lysimeters 1 4 had initial ratio 1 values that were higher than the value indicating herbivorous faecal pollution but too low to indicate human faecal pollution 2 8 for ratio 2 lysimeters 1 2 3 and 5 were all also indicative of herbivorous faeces 0 38 whilst lysimeters 4 6 7 and 8 did not have the steroid profile to use the ratio these differences in ratios could be because of biohydrogenation causing certain steroids to change structure into a different steroid leeming et al 1996 4 4 limitations and next stages this study used lysimeters as analogues to study steroid and tp transfer processes in sub surface hydrological pathways leaching at the hillslope scale the experimental set up is a useful link between laboratory scale and catchment scale experiments wang et al 2012 but does not account for more surface driven high energy hydrological pathways the lysimeters boundaries and consequent disruption to soil drainage pütz et al 2018 and the restrictive dimensions of the lysimeters can affect the hydraulic gradient and natural flow field of the soil pütz et al 2018 corwin 2000 thus even with minimal physical disturbance to the soil taken for the monolith there would still be differences compared to natural hillslope conditions this could result in differences in transit time for leaching and the steroids contained kim et al 2016 as such these differences could cause different steroidal signals to occur at larger scales moreover the data here indicate that particulate matter vectors for steroids and tp were not high in magnitude or consistent and that any pathways may have been impacted by other soil physical properties swelling shrinking or acted as chemical barriers p adsorption in addition to this there was an assumption that the flux was the same for all lysimeters due to the combination of a lack of particulate matter and large leachate volumes full 25 l bottles upon collection here it is noteworthy that previous work using these lysimeters also indicated flows were very similar for these lysimeters alfaro et al 2006 turner and haygarth 2000 in summary the study provides a benchmark for steroid nutrient dynamics from cattle slurry in sub surface leaching pathways as being a low magnitude and inconsistent transport process and likely impacted by flushing dilution similar experiments and experimental design in surface hydrological pathways would be the next important stage 5 conclusion this study used monolith lysimeters that had cattle slurry applied both at the beginning and end of a slurry spreading closed period the leachate from this was then analysed using ase and the aquakem to monitor faecal steroids and tp respectively during the length of this experiment there were two small steroid concentration spikes that occurred following slurry applications that then decreased over time this was particularly true for 5β stigmastanol and epi 5β stigmastanol typical ruminant faecal indicator steroids from this it could be seen that whilst the treatment of cattle slurry itself had no significant effect p 0 05 sampling time did p 0 05 this could have been due in part to the treatment potentially being understated by the particularly wet year causing heavy dilution or perhaps due to the near negligible amount of sediment found in the sampled leachate since steroids typically adhere to particulate matter regardless the study showed that indeed tracer concentrations do spike following slurry application and decrease over time hypothesis i regarding the actual concentrations of the steroids these too changed over time the ratios used in this study work by making comparisons between primary and secondary steroids in other words comparing precursor primary steroids to their resultant secondary steroids that form following biohydrogenation by microbes however this is not always possible due to either insufficient or non existent concentrations of steroids potentially due to the aforementioned issues in the cases within this study where steroid profiles had enough data to use these ratios such as in lysimeter 5 it was possible to identify correctly the steroids as having come from ruminant faecal contamination thus the study showed that there were differences in primary secondary steroid concentrations over the course of the experiment and that it was also possible to use these concentrations to identify the origin of the contamination hypotheses ii and iii the next logical step to extend this study would be to take it to hillslope plot scale completing experimental work examining the persistence of steroid tracers in both surface and subsurface pathways or even further to catchment scale this would tackle the limitations addressed here and further confirm the utility of the approach for disentangling incidental and residual nutrient sources credit authorship contribution statement amber manley conceptualization

1318,the fate and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges in livestock wastewater by microbial fuel cell mfc was evaluated by high throughput quantitative pcr the results showed that 137 args and 9 mges were detected in untreated livestock wastewater the arg number of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group b mlsb tetracycline and sulfonamide were relatively higher throughout the treatment process the number and abundance of args and mges significantly decreased the relative abundance of tetracycline sulfonamide and chloramphenicol resistance genes showed the most obvious decreasing trend and the relative abundance of mges decreased by 75 from 0 012 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 003 copies 16s rrna copies however the absolute abundance of beta lactamase resistance genes slightly increased the operation process of mfc produces selective pressure on microorganisms and actinobacteria were predominant and had the ability to decompose antibiotics the cod removal rate and tn removal rate of livestock wastewater were 67 81 and 62 09 and the maximum power density and coulomb efficiency ce reached 11 49 and 38 40 respectively this study demonstrated that although the removal of cod and tn by mfc was limited mfc was quite effective in reducing the risk of antibiotic toxicity and horizontal gene transfer keywords livestock wastewater microbial fuel cell antibiotic resistance genes args mobile genetic elements mges high throughput quantitative pcr 1 introduction with the transformation of agriculture to scale and industrialization the livestock industry is gradually turning to intensive and specialized and the discharge of livestock wastewater is increasing in recent years yu et al 2020 livestock wastewater contains organic matter pathogenic microorganism heavy metal antibiotic and other pollutants meng et al 2019 which has widely aroused attention to the serious environmental pollution kim et al 2019 tullo et al 2019 as feed additives antibiotics have been playing an important role in preventing diseases and promoting the growth of livestock so they are widely used in livestock breeding baron et al 2018 veterinary antibiotics such as tetracyclines sulfonamides fluoroquinolones and macrolides are widely used in livestock for prophylactic and feed additives quaik et al 2020 because antibiotics are difficult to be absorbed in the body most of them in the original form of antibiotics or related metabolites are discharged into the agricultural waste at the same time residual feces and urine were cleaned by flushing water in most livestock farms resulting in higher concentrations of residual antibiotics in livestock wastewater most antibiotics are water soluble compounds that could travel down the drainage system to subsequent processing including pre treatment anaerobic treatment and aerobic treatment at present the processes used in most livestock wastewater treatment system are mainly designed for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater which is not effective of remove antibiotics resulting in the widespread residue of antibiotics in the effluent lee et al 2017 therefore livestock wastewater treatment system is another important repository for antibiotics it has been reported that a variety of antibiotics have been detected in the influent of treatment facilities and the residue of antibiotics after treatment was still high mao et al 2015 after the residual antibiotics are discharged into the ecosystem they will induce and spread all kinds of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which poses a threat to the health of human and other organisms the sewage sludge containing a lot of antibiotics in livestock wastewater treatment system is processed into agricultural fertilizer which causes certain harm to soil groundwater and farmland ecosystem as a refractory substance antibiotics remain for a long time in the environment which will exert selection pressure on microorganisms and accelerate the existence of microbial resistance antibiotic resistance genes args have its inherent biological characteristics and could use mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmid transposon integron to perform horizontal gene transfer hgt or even self amplification among microorganisms liu et al 2020a tong et al 2019 some of the mges can be transferred to other cells during conjugation during this process mges use their own conjugative genes or hijack the conjugative systems of other elements carraro et al 2017 the mobility of mge produces mutations and rearrangements of genetic material inside microbial cells residual antibiotics may induce the production of args making a potential repository of args in farms and nearby watersheds it results in the persistence transfer and spread of antibiotic resistance genes being more harmful than the antibiotics themselves in the environment in recent years the problem of antibiotic resistance pollution in livestock feces has become increasingly prominent args are frequently detected in livestock feces especially tetracycline resistance genes trgs and sulfonamide resistance genes srgs there were about 150 args have been identified in some swine farms in china and posed a serious threat to the health and safety of humans and other creatures yuan et al 2018 so far at least 38 trgs have been detected from different bacteria among them 23 trgs can expel tetracycline out of cells by encoding efflux proteins so as to reduce the concentration in cells such as teta tetb tetc tetd tete and tetg eleven args encode ribosomal protective proteins which combine with ribosomes to change ribosomal configuration such as tetm teto and tetw at present at least 22 trgs have been detected in bacteria isolated from water environment the tetracycline resistance rate of drug resistant escherichia coli in wenyu river of beijing was 5 25 xu et al 2015 therefore livestock wastewater is an important reservoir of antibiotics and args in the environment and carries the risk of pollution transfer there has been attached great importance to the treatment of livestock wastewater in many counties covering the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the optimization of cod and the treatment of hormones and antibiotics at present the treatment technologies for livestock wastewater mainly include 1 aerobic biological treatment such as using rotating biological contactor and sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process sbr 2 anaerobic biological treatment such as the use of up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb and biogas tanks and 3 natural biological methods such as employing oxidation pond and constructed wetland among these treatment methods just few studies have focused on args in addition 90 of wastewater treatment processes are characterized by high abundance biomass which provides a favorable environment for the transmission of args and speeds up the horizontal diffusion of args sebastian et al 2020 therefore there is the need to optimize current treatment technologies to reduce the environmental risks caused by antibiotics and args microbial fuel cell mfc is a kind of green technology that uses microorganism as biocatalysts to decompose organic compounds in wastewater in this process it can convert chemical energy to bioelectrical electrical energy logan and regan 2006 mfc has advantages in promoting the degradation of refractory substances and antibiotics so far a great deal of work has been done on the treatment of various kinds of polluted wastewater by mfc and much progress has been made cecconet et al 2018 le et al 2018 there have also been a large number of researches on the mfc treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics but these studies mainly focused on the optimization of the device the improvement of electricity generation efficiency composite electrode material and other aspects ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2020

digestion uv spectrophotometric method all samples were analyzed in triplicate 2 5 fluorescence spectroscopy determination studies have proved that args interacts with colloids in water the removal of args is closely related to proteins polysaccharides and doc dissolved organic carbon in water breazeal et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to study the removal of fluorescent dissolved organic matter and arg in mfc simultaneously the products migration of influent and effluent wastewater was analyzed using a luminescence spectrometer fp 8500 jasco japan three dimensional excitation emission matrix

plots were made by origin pro 9 1 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 composition and abundance of args and mges in samples there are three main mechanisms of bacterial resistance to tetracyclines antibiotics ribosomal protection proteins effiux pumps proteins enzymatic inactivation mechanisms the resistance mechanism of bacteria to sulfonamides mainly depends on the dihydropteroate synthase dhps to avoid the invasion of sulfonamides three dhps sul1 sul2 and sul3 have been found to play an important role in srgs the relative abundance of srgs sul1 and sul2 could range from 10 2 10 1 copies 16s rrna copies cheng et al 2013 the composition of nine types of args and mges in the samples was determined by ht qpcr fig 1 it can be concluded that there were more types of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group b mlsb tetracycline sulfonamide and multidrug were observed in the three samples the number of args and megs detected in raw livestock wastewater sample r without treatment by mfc was the highest including 137 args and 9 mges after the treatment in mfc the detection species of chloramphenicol remained unchanged in sample 1 and sample 2 while detection number of other gene species decreased by calculating the relative copy numbers the changes of the relative abundance of args and megs at different stages of processing were illustrated in fig 2a in the raw livestock wastewater the relative abundance of tetracycline sulfonamide vancomycin and multidrug in the samples was significantly higher after treatment args and megs in wastewater decreased to different degrees relative abundance of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes decreased from 0 043 copies 16s rrna copies and 0 057 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 018 copies 16s rrna copies and 0 021 copies 16s rrna copies respectively at the same time relative abundance of megs also decreased observably from 0 012 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 003 copies 16s rrna copies in the process therefore mfc treatment could reduce the relative abundance of args and megs in wastewater trgs can accumulate in sediment easily and enter human body through food chain or other ways which is harmful to human health tetracycline resistant bacteria and trgs were detected in cache la poudre river and sediment in the united states trgs were also detected in huangpu river and beijiang river in china in a previous study in another study it has been observed that the erma gene has been greatly amplified after activated sludge treatment guo et al 2015 after detecting the absolute copy number the absolute abundance of water samples args and megs has been observed showing in the fig 2b the absolute abundance of args detected in raw livestock wastewater was the highest with the absolute abundance of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes up to 580 000 copies l 1 and 570 000 copies l 1 respectively after a period of treatment except that the absolute abundance of beta lactamase increased slightly the absolute abundance of other genes showed a downward trend with the operation of the reactor it s worth noting that the absolute abundance of mlsb tetracycline sulfonamide and aminoglycoside all declined by two orders of magnitude and the absolute abundance of multidrug and mges declined by one order of magnitude in the meantime absolute abundance of aminoglycoside and vancomycin continued to reduce in the process thus these results of this study provide evidence that mfc seems to be a simple and effective treatment in controlling arg removal 3 2 cod and tn removal the formal study was carried out under the condition that the volume ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution was 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the experimental influent cod and tn were about 900 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the removal rates in four cycles were tested fig s1 it can be seen that mfc has a certain removal rate of cod and tn in different proportions of livestock wastewater in the first three operation cycles the cod removal rate was about 67 which was relatively stable however the removal rate of cod decreased to 56 57 in the treatment of raw livestock wastewater indicating that the complex solution has some influence on the removal of cod in mfc at the same time the removal rate of tn increased from 46 67 to 61 88 and finally decreased to 43 5 the trend of total tn rate showed that microorganisms with nitrogen removal function could grow and reproduce well in the reactor the formal study was carried out under the condition that the volume ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution was 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the experimental influent cod and tn were about 900 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the removal rates in four cycles were tested fig s1 it can be seen that mfc has a certain removal rate of cod and tn in different proportions of livestock wastewater in the first three operation cycles the cod removal rate was about 67 which was relatively stable however the removal rate of cod decreased to 56 57 in the treatment of raw livestock wastewater indicating that the complex solution has some influence on the removal of cod in mfc at the same time the removal rate of tn increased from 46 67 to 61 88 and finally decreased to 43 5 the trend of total tn rate showed that microorganisms with nitrogen removal function could grow and reproduce well in the reactor 3 3 fluorescence eem characteristics the 3d eem results showed the migration of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in wastewater before and after treatment fig 3 the water samples were mainly humic acid like while fulvic acid and soluble microbial metabolites also accounted for a certain proportion in the first two cycles the fluorescence intensity of each substance increased after treatment we may speculate that the increase of metabolites was caused by the enhancement of microbial life activity in the next treatment humic acid like accounted for the majority of the proportion and the content decreased slightly at the end of a single cycle 3 4 bioelectricity generation performance the change of voltage with time in the process was recorded showing in fig 4a and can be divided into two stages start up period and operation period at first the voltage start up period was less than 0 08 v by changing nutrient solution constantly the voltage rose and the peak voltage gradually increased after 922 h of start up the maximum output voltage was 0 537 v and the power density was 5 86 w m3 by adding raw livestock wastewater the peak voltage increased slightly according to the voltage curves of four cycles in the formal operation stage fig 4b c d e we can see that voltage change in a power generation cycle has gone through three stages rising stable and falling when the ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution reached 1 1 the power generation performance was the best with the increase of the proportion of raw livestock wastewater the composition of anode solution became more and more complex and the power generation performance of mfc decreased it was proved that antibiotics and other substances in livestock wastewater have a negative impact on the electricity generation efficiency of the system ce is an important index to measure the recovery efficiency of anode electrons and it can be used to characterize the transformation of organic matter to electron in the process of increasing the proportion of raw livestock wastewater from 1 3 to 1 0 ce calculated by formula increased from 25 39 to 38 40 firstly and then decreased to 27 16 and 21 07 this change showed that the growth and metabolism of microorganisms became slower in wastewater with antibiotic which leaded to the decrease of organic matter utilization efficiency and the reduction of electron transfer when the output voltage of each power generation cycle was stable the steady state discharge method could be used to measure the voltage of mfc under different external resistance conditions the polarization curve and the power density curve of four cycles were calculated as shown in fig 5 with the increase of the proportion of raw livestock wastewater in anodic liquid it was found that the internal resistance of mfc increased from 290 ω to 380 ω and the corresponding maximum power density decreased from 12 57 w m3 to 11 50 w m3 similarly it can be seen that the complexity of the anode liquid composition was one of the factors that affect the power generation performance of mfc the anode liquid with antibiotic would lead to greater internal resistance which would affect the power generation efficiency of the reactor 3 5 microbial morphology by sem in order to analyze the apparent structure anode before and after operation were observed by sem fig 6 the magnification of sem photo of the blank carbon felt was smooth and interlaced by carbon fiber to form a network structure fig 6a it was conducive to the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the electrode fig 6b c d showed the photos of anode sem at the end of operation it can be seen a large number of microorganisms of different shapes and sizes attached to the anode surface to form colonies most of them were cocci and bacilli covering the anode surface at the same time there were some skeletons like structures interspersed on the electrode surface which may have better stability 3 6 microbial community structure analysis principal coordinate analysis pcoa can visually show the similarities and differences in the evolution of microbial samples fig 7a the samples of inoculated sludge sample 0 glucose stabilized sludge sample b1 and b2 and raw water stabilized sludge sample b3 and b4 were far away from each other and the distance of the same period was relatively close by means of non metric multidimensional scaling nmds this difference was reflected by the distance between samples fig 7b it showed clear groups between samples at different stages and there were significant changes in bacterial community structure after the inoculated sludge was operated by mfc the bacterial community changed gradually to adapt the treatment of livestock wastewater the relative abundance of bacterial community structure at phylum level was displayed in fig 8a a total of 18 bacterial phyla were detected and proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were dominant in the inoculated sludge samples the results showed that the microbial community changed markedly at phylum level in the subsequent processing the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increased by 39 09 and 16 77 respectively and the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased finally the bacteria with the function of electricity generation nitrogen removal were screened out as shown in fig 8b geobacter syntrophomonas and caloramator were the dominant genera in the inoculated sludge at genus level some new bacteria appeared on the anode surface with the operation of mfc at the same time the disappearance of caloramator and anoxybacillus occurred after mfc operation the dominant bacteria on the anode biofilm changed to simplicispira trichococcus and rhodopseudomonas the addition of livestock wastewater gradually has a significant effect on the composition of microbial community the effect of raw livestock wastewater on microbial community composition at class level was reflected by a heatmap fig 8c deltaproteobacteria clostridia and anaerolineae were dominant and abundant in the inoculated sludge at the glucose stable stage the abundance of anaerolineae synergistia and bacilli decreased at the same time the abundance of actinobacteria betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria increased showing their advantages gradually after the operation of raw livestock wastewater flavobacteriia appeared it may be speculated that the change was caused by the multiplication of dominant bacteria and selective effect of livestock wastewater 4 discussion the livestock wastewater treatment system including microbial processes is an unavoidable reservoir for args and their mges cheng et al 2020a long term exposure of microorganisms to antibiotic selection pressure would increase the spread of antibiotic resistance genes huang et al 2017 at present a large number of studies have been carried out on the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics by mfc but most of the studies only focus on the removal rate of antibiotics with little attention paid to the behavior of args and megs cheng et al 2020b xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 hence it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of args and megs in the treatment of livestock wastewater by mfc a total of 137 args and 9 megs were detected in the raw livestock wastewater and the number was relatively high it indicated that livestock waste water is the storage of args if was not treated properly it may lead to the horizontal transfer of args zainab et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in the agricultural most of the livestock wastewater has not been treated strictly which causes certain harm to the soil surface water groundwater and even farmland ecosystem and poses a threat to human health hu et al 2017 therefore more attention should be paid to the control of livestock wastewater point source pollution in rural areas among them the number of args and mges decreased significantly after mfc treatment the numbers of mlsb tetracycline and mges all dropped by more than 50 and the number changed little during subsequent processing in the same way the relative abundance and absolute abundance of args and mges showed a remarkable decreasing trend after treatment however after mfc treatment the absolute abundance of beta lactamase gene increased and its causes need to be further studied previous studies confirmed that anaerobic treatment processes can efficiently remove arb and args christgen et al 2015 ghosh et al 2009 as a bioelectrochemical system bes the key mechanism of mfc is the combination of anaerobic biodegradation and electrical stimulation compared with traditional biological treatment persistent electrical stimulation can provide electrons to stimulate microorganisms to metabolize antibiotics rapidly by secreting enzymes dominguez benetton et al 2018 some bacteria promote electron transfer by carrying out extracellular electron transfers to improve the removal rate of antibiotics such as rhodoferax sp and cupriavidus sp obata et al 2020 the low selection pressure of antibiotics would inhibit the production and transmission of args in addition lower excess biomass and less residual sludge in mfc would reduce the abundance of arb and meg resulting in the obstacles of arg dissemination in conclusion mfc has the ability to reduce args effectively it may be indicated that the bioelectrochemical process in mfc system can effectively reduce the number of args and mges to decrease the environmental risk of resistance gene transfer while the internal mechanism causing the change needs to be explored by a lot of follow up studies at the same time some previous studies targeted args to evaluate the dynamics and judge their environmental risks such as sul1 sul2 and sul3 zhang et al 2017b since this study mainly focused on the reduction of total amount of args and mge by mfc and the specific target genes were measured to have the total amount of args it mainly included mlsb tetracycline and sulfonamide the removal of a specific resistance gene was not described in detail more detailed work will be done to explore the dynamics of args and mges in wastewater treatment in our follow up studies at present the construction of mfc for wastewater treatment containing refractory substances researches has made some progress koffi and okabe 2020 liu et al 2020b the results showed that livestock wastewater has little effect on cod removal in a certain range while mfc was used to treat raw livestock wastewater the removal efficiency of organic matter decreased the reason for the decrease of cod removal rate may be the presence of toxic substances such as antibiotics in livestock wastewater which affects the growth and metabolism of some anode microorganisms lu et al 2020 the residual antibiotics in livestock wastewater may be one of the factors limiting microbial metabolism wang et al 2018 but the specific influencing factors in this process need to be further studied when the volume ratio of livestock wastewater was 50 the total nitrogen removal efficiency is the best and the removal rate was 61 88 mfc treatment of wastewater is a joint effect of metabolism of various microorganisms li et al 2020 combined with the previous analysis it could be speculated that the adaptability of anode microorganism to livestock wastewater during mfc operation was insufficient and the ability of utilizing organic matter was decreased similarly the results of 3d eem fluorescence scanning showed that the growth and metabolism ability of microorganisms was stronger and the treatment effect of livestock wastewater was better in the early treatment process as a kind of dom the reduction of humic substances may prove that mfc was helpful to the removal of args feng et al 2021 humic substances have been confirmed to protect extracellular args against degradation and keep persistence dires et al 2018 in the wastewater treatment process the removal of args was positively correlated with the removal of protein total organic carbon toc and humus by adsorption of dna breazeal et al 2013 these results suggest that the presence of dom might be an important driving factor in args removal in addition it has been reported that total carbon tc had strong correlations with cod concentrations and bacterial biomass chen et al 2016 these might explain that biodegradation was one of the main removal mechanisms of args and dom in mfc however the correlation between dom and args should be analyzed in detail by experimental data and statistical tools in our following research in our study the voltage was relatively high after the device was started which proved that the microorganism in the inoculated sludge can degrade well when glucose is used as substrate it showed a better power generation efficiency toczyłowska mamińska et al 2018 compared with some studies the power density and coulomb efficiency were higher ma et al 2016 the reason for this phenomenon may be that carbon felt with a large relative surface area was used as anode in our experiment it enriched a large number of microorganisms and improves the energy transfer efficiency of biofilm farber et al 2019 in addition the internal resistance of mfc increased from 290 ω to 380 ω during the whole operation combined with relevant research it can be inferred that the livestock wastewater made the composition of anode liquid more complex the electron transfer was hindered to some extent the specific components that affect the electron transfer in livestock wastewater need to be studied in addition the gradual addition of livestock wastewater would directly affect the activity of enzyme system and metabolism of microorganisms and it ultimately affected the generation mechanism of electrons resulting in the reduction of electricity production efficiency he et al 2008 raghavulu et al 2009 through microbial morphology by sem the influence of process conditions on microbial community morphology can be explored the electrical stimulation can alter the microbial communities and their relative abundance in the mfc yang et al 2018 and antibiotics can produce selective pressure on microorganisms and accelerate the existence of microbial drug resistance at the same time some bacteria can promote electron transfer to improve the removal of antibiotics obata et al 2020 some studies have showed that resistance genes were positively correlated with specific bacteria in wastewater treatment system wang et al 2020 in the treatment system the existence and amplification of functional bacteria were closely related to the transmission of args these bacteria always play an important role in the proliferation process of args furthermore previous studies demonstrated that electrical stimulation can alter the microbial communities and their relative abundance in the bes yang et al 2018 the dominant bacteria played an essential role in the elimination of sulfadiazine in another study it was pointed out that the increment of the abundance of methanobacterium methanosaeta treponema and achromobacter was responsible for the degradation of highly concentrated sulfamethoxazole smx in mfcs kong et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to explore the relevance of microbial community on the proliferation and reduction of args in wastewater treatment process the correlation between args and microbial community may be distinguished which provide more information on the control of args in livestock wastewater treatment process in the process of mfc treating wastewater the growth and reproduction of anode microorganism will directly affect the treatment effect deng et al 2020 at the start up stage the microorganisms grew rapidly and multiplied and the diversity of bacterial community was increased after adding livestock wastewater the selection of anode microorganism was improved through a long time of operation the diversity of bacterial community was reduced and it was similar to other researches huang et al 2017 the dominant bacteria of inoculated sludge at the phylum level were proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi which were similar to the study on the microbial community of uasb operation chen et al 2020 some studies have shown that proteobacteria and firmicutes can be used as anode respiratory bacteria and proteobacteria is considered as electrochemical active bacteria chen et al 2019 after the successful start up actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were added as the dominant bacteria which showed that the capacity of nitrogen removal of mfc was enhanced xing et al 2016 actinobacteria was the dominant bacteria in the anode biofilm at the end of operation combined with actinobacteria has the function of decomposing antibiotics and other complex organic matters mfc can treat livestock better in the experiment huang et al 2017 as the main electricity producing bacteria in organic wastewater environment geobacter was one of the dominant genera of inoculated sludge which proves that inoculated sludge has good adaptability to mfc dhar et al 2018 in addition deltaproteobacteria was one of the dominant bacteria of inoculated sludge which plays a role in cod degradation kiely et al 2011 after the start up the proteobacteria as the dominant species plays an important role in wastewater treatment and participate in cod degradation nitrification and other processes furthermore there were unclassified bacteria at the level of genus and class of anode biofilm which was similar to li s research results these microorganisms are worthy of further study in wastewater treatment li et al 2019b under the action of microorganisms mfc can be utilized as a power source through the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy which has promising application potential however the overall cost of system components is still one of the biggest obstacles to economic sustainability of mfc the cost of mfc constitutes of electrode 19 5 and membrane material 62 5 accounting for the major share of the total investment cost ge and he 2016 because of the expensive electrode and membrane materials a study proved that the capital cost of mfc is about 30 times of traditional activated sludge treatment systems he et al 2017 but the effective degradation of pollutants and higher power density output are still the advantages of mfc in some studies the cost of the reactor can be reduced by using expensive metal catalysts and membrane substitutes but the total cost is still too high for practical application khalili et al 2017 the combination with other sunlight driven systems and the use of cheap and stable separators might be beneficial for large scale mfc applications at a lower cost liu et al 2021 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that high level of args and mges were in livestock wastewater including 137 args and 9 mges therefore livestock wastewater poses great health and environmental risks and its management and treatment efficiency should be enhanced in the process of livestock wastewater treatment in mfc the number and abundance of most args and mges decreased significantly the relative abundance of sulfonamide beta lactamase and mges all reduced by more than 60 therefore livestock wastewater as the repository of resistance genes its environmental risk of resistance transfer could be effectively reduced by the bioelectrochemical process although our study clearly showed that bioelectrochemical methods effectively reduced the number of args and control the risk of horizontal gene transfer the removal mechanism and the transformation pathway need to be further studied the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary fig s1 removal rate of cod and

1318,the fate and removal efficiency of antibiotic resistance genes args and mobile genetic elements mges in livestock wastewater by microbial fuel cell mfc was evaluated by high throughput quantitative pcr the results showed that 137 args and 9 mges were detected in untreated livestock wastewater the arg number of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group b mlsb tetracycline and sulfonamide were relatively higher throughout the treatment process the number and abundance of args and mges significantly decreased the relative abundance of tetracycline sulfonamide and chloramphenicol resistance genes showed the most obvious decreasing trend and the relative abundance of mges decreased by 75 from 0 012 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 003 copies 16s rrna copies however the absolute abundance of beta lactamase resistance genes slightly increased the operation process of mfc produces selective pressure on microorganisms and actinobacteria were predominant and had the ability to decompose antibiotics the cod removal rate and tn removal rate of livestock wastewater were 67 81 and 62 09 and the maximum power density and coulomb efficiency ce reached 11 49 and 38 40 respectively this study demonstrated that although the removal of cod and tn by mfc was limited mfc was quite effective in reducing the risk of antibiotic toxicity and horizontal gene transfer

to scale and industrialization the livestock industry is gradually turning to intensive and specialized and the discharge of livestock wastewater is increasing in recent years yu et al 2020 livestock

antibiotics are difficult to be absorbed in the body most of them in the original form of antibiotics or related metabolites are discharged into the agricultural waste at the same time residual feces and urine were cleaned by flushing water in most livestock farms resulting in higher concentrations of residual antibiotics in livestock wastewater most antibiotics are water soluble compounds that could travel down the drainage system to subsequent processing including pre treatment anaerobic treatment and aerobic treatment at present the processes used in most livestock wastewater treatment system are mainly designed for the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater which is not effective of remove antibiotics resulting in the widespread residue of antibiotics in the effluent lee et al 2017 therefore livestock wastewater treatment system is another important repository for antibiotics it has been reported that a variety of antibiotics have been detected in the influent of treatment facilities and the residue of antibiotics after treatment was still high mao et al 2015 after the residual antibiotics are discharged into the ecosystem they will induce and spread all kinds of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb which poses a threat to the health of human and other organisms the sewage sludge containing a lot of antibiotics in livestock wastewater treatment system is processed into agricultural fertilizer which causes certain harm to soil groundwater and farmland ecosystem as a refractory substance antibiotics remain for a long time in the environment which will exert selection pressure on microorganisms and accelerate the existence of microbial resistance antibiotic resistance genes args have its inherent biological characteristics and could use mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmid transposon integron to perform horizontal gene transfer hgt or even self amplification among microorganisms liu et al 2020a tong et al 2019 some of the mges can be transferred to other cells during conjugation during this process mges use their own conjugative genes or hijack the conjugative systems of other elements carraro et al 2017 the mobility of mge produces mutations and rearrangements of genetic material inside microbial cells residual antibiotics may induce the production of args making a potential repository of args in farms and nearby watersheds it results in the persistence transfer and spread of antibiotic resistance genes being more harmful than the antibiotics themselves in the environment in recent years the problem of antibiotic resistance pollution in livestock feces has become increasingly prominent args are frequently detected in livestock feces especially tetracycline resistance genes trgs and sulfonamide resistance genes srgs there were about 150 args have been identified in some swine farms in china and posed a serious threat to the health and safety of humans and other creatures yuan et al 2018 so far at least 38 trgs have been detected from different bacteria among them 23 trgs can expel tetracycline out of cells by encoding efflux proteins so as to reduce the concentration in cells such as teta tetb tetc tetd tete and tetg eleven args encode ribosomal protective proteins which combine with ribosomes to change ribosomal configuration such as tetm teto and tetw at present at least 22 trgs have been detected in bacteria isolated from water environment the tetracycline resistance rate of drug resistant escherichia coli in wenyu river of beijing was 5 25 xu et al 2015 therefore livestock wastewater is an important reservoir of antibiotics and args in the environment and carries the risk of pollution transfer there has been attached great importance to the treatment of livestock wastewater in many counties covering the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus the optimization of cod and the treatment of hormones and antibiotics at present the treatment technologies for livestock wastewater mainly include 1 aerobic biological treatment such as using rotating biological contactor and sequencing batch reactor activated sludge process sbr 2 anaerobic biological treatment such as the use of up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb and biogas tanks and 3 natural biological methods such as employing oxidation pond and constructed wetland among these treatment methods just few studies have focused on args in addition 90 of wastewater treatment processes are characterized by high abundance biomass which provides a favorable environment for the transmission of args and speeds up the horizontal diffusion of args sebastian et al 2020 therefore there is the need to optimize current treatment technologies to reduce the environmental risks caused by antibiotics and args microbial fuel cell mfc is a kind of green technology that uses microorganism as biocatalysts to decompose organic compounds in wastewater in this process it can convert chemical energy to bioelectrical electrical energy logan and regan 2006 mfc has advantages in promoting the degradation of refractory substances and antibiotics so far a great deal of work has been done on the treatment of various kinds of polluted wastewater by mfc and much progress has been made cecconet et al 2018 le et al 2018 there have also been a large number of researches on the mfc treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics but these studies mainly focused on the optimization of the device the improvement of electricity generation efficiency composite electrode material and other aspects ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 reports on the fate of args and mges in wastewater treatment and the related microbial processes need to be further studied in this study mfcs were operated and ht qpcr was employed to assess the abundance change and horizontal transfer ability of antibiotic resistance genes in livestock wastewater treatment meanwhile the wastewater treatment effect electrical performance and associated microbial processes were also investigated the results are expected to provide theoretical basis for the green treatment of livestock wastewater and theoretical reference for revealing the existence reduction and fate of args in the treatment process 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of mfc the two chambered mfc bioreactor was constructed of plexiglass two electrode chambers

through a 0 45 μm membrane filter the chemical oxygen demand cod was determined using potassium dichromate colorimetric method the valued of total nitrogen tn was measured using potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method all samples were analyzed in triplicate 2 5 fluorescence spectroscopy determination studies have proved that args interacts with colloids in water the removal of args is closely related to proteins polysaccharides and doc dissolved organic carbon in water breazeal et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to study the removal of fluorescent dissolved organic matter and arg in mfc simultaneously the products migration of influent and effluent wastewater was analyzed using a luminescence spectrometer fp 8500 jasco japan three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra were collected with subsequent scanning emission spectra from 240 to 550 nm at 10 nm increments by varying the excitation wavelength from 220 to 450 nm at 1 nm increments the scanning speed was set at 500 nm min 2 6 bioelectricity generation performance the voltage data of external resistance was recorded every 5 min by data collector keithley daq 6510 when bioreactor runs to the

table of sem after a 1500 nm metal film was coated on the surface of the sample the microbial community morphology was observed by sem su 3500 hitachi janpan 2 8 illumina sequencing of bacterial community anode samples of inoculated sludge at volume ratio was 0 1 and 1 0 were further analyzed for bacterial community the hypervariable v4 v5 regions were selected for sequencing analysis in the reaction 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 was used as the pre primer 806r 5 gccaatggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 as the post primer and the extracted microbial dna was used as the template for pcr amplification zhang et al 2020 the amplicons were detected by 1 2 agarose gel electrophoresis the amplification was purified and quantified the pcr amplicons were sequenced on illumina miseq platform in tinygene bio tech shanghai co ltd the out clustering and taxonomic analysis of the optimized sequence were carried out at 97 similarity level with usearch software species annotation and alpha diversity

05 of the results in different working conditions principal coordinate analysis pcoa non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds and a heatmap were generated by r language 3 4 1 the figures of other plots were made by origin pro 9 1 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 composition and abundance of args and mges in samples there are three main mechanisms of bacterial resistance to tetracyclines antibiotics ribosomal protection proteins effiux pumps proteins enzymatic inactivation mechanisms the resistance mechanism of bacteria to sulfonamides mainly depends on the dihydropteroate synthase dhps to avoid the invasion of sulfonamides three dhps sul1 sul2 and sul3 have been found to play an important role in srgs the relative abundance of srgs sul1 and sul2 could range from 10 2 10 1 copies 16s rrna copies cheng et al 2013 the composition of nine types of args and mges in the samples was determined by ht qpcr fig 1 it can be concluded that there were more types of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group b mlsb tetracycline sulfonamide and multidrug were observed in the three samples the number of args and megs detected in raw livestock wastewater sample r without treatment by mfc was the highest including 137 args and 9 mges after the treatment in mfc the detection species of chloramphenicol remained unchanged in sample 1 and sample 2 while detection number of other gene species decreased by calculating the relative copy numbers the changes of the relative abundance of args and megs at different stages of processing were illustrated in fig 2a in the raw livestock wastewater the relative abundance of tetracycline sulfonamide vancomycin and multidrug in the samples was significantly higher after treatment args and megs in wastewater decreased to different degrees relative abundance of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes decreased from 0 043 copies 16s rrna copies and 0 057 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 018 copies 16s rrna copies and 0 021 copies 16s rrna copies respectively at the same time relative abundance of megs also decreased observably from 0 012 copies 16s rrna copies to 0 003 copies 16s rrna copies in the process therefore mfc treatment could reduce the relative abundance of args and megs in wastewater trgs can accumulate in sediment easily and enter human body through food chain or other ways which is harmful to human health tetracycline resistant bacteria and trgs were detected in cache la poudre river and sediment in the united states trgs were also detected in huangpu river and beijiang river in china in a previous study in another study it has been observed that the erma gene has been greatly amplified after activated sludge treatment guo et al 2015 after detecting the absolute copy number the absolute abundance of water samples args and megs has been observed showing in the fig 2b the absolute abundance of args detected in raw livestock wastewater was the highest with the absolute abundance of tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes up to 580 000 copies l 1 and 570 000 copies l 1 respectively after a period of treatment except that the absolute abundance of beta lactamase increased slightly the absolute abundance of other genes showed a downward trend with the operation of the reactor it s worth noting that the absolute abundance of mlsb tetracycline sulfonamide and aminoglycoside all declined by two orders of magnitude and the absolute abundance of multidrug and mges declined by one order of magnitude in the meantime absolute abundance of aminoglycoside and vancomycin continued to reduce in the process thus these results of this study provide evidence that mfc seems to be a simple and effective treatment in controlling arg removal 3 2 cod and tn removal the formal study was carried out under the condition that the volume ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution was 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the experimental influent cod and tn were about 900 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the removal rates in four cycles were tested fig s1 it can be seen that mfc has a certain removal rate of cod and tn in different proportions of livestock wastewater in the first three operation cycles the cod removal rate was about 67 which was relatively stable however the removal rate of cod decreased to 56 57 in the treatment of raw livestock wastewater indicating that the complex solution has some influence on the removal of cod in mfc at the same time the removal rate of tn increased from 46 67 to 61 88 and finally decreased to 43 5 the trend of total tn rate showed that microorganisms with nitrogen removal function could grow and reproduce well in the reactor the formal study was carried out under the condition that the volume ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution was 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 1 0 the experimental influent cod and tn were about 900 mg l and 400 mg l respectively the removal rates in four cycles were tested fig s1 it can be seen that mfc has a certain removal rate of cod and tn in different proportions of livestock wastewater in the first three operation cycles the cod removal rate was about 67 which was relatively stable however the removal rate of cod decreased to 56 57 in the treatment of raw livestock wastewater indicating that the complex solution has some influence on the removal of cod in mfc at the same time the removal rate of tn increased from 46 67 to 61 88 and finally decreased to 43 5 the trend of total tn rate showed that microorganisms with nitrogen removal function could grow and reproduce well in the reactor 3 3 fluorescence eem characteristics the 3d eem results showed the migration of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in wastewater before and after treatment fig 3 the water samples were mainly humic acid like while fulvic acid and soluble microbial metabolites also accounted for a certain proportion in the first two cycles the fluorescence intensity of each substance increased after treatment we may speculate that the increase of metabolites was caused by the enhancement of microbial life activity in the next treatment humic acid like accounted for the majority of the proportion and the content decreased slightly at the end of a single cycle 3 4 bioelectricity generation performance the change of voltage with time in the process was recorded showing in fig 4a and can be divided into two stages start up period and operation period at first the voltage start up period was less than 0 08 v by changing nutrient solution constantly the voltage rose and the peak voltage gradually increased after 922 h of start up the maximum output voltage was 0 537 v and the power density was 5 86 w m3 by adding raw livestock wastewater the peak voltage increased slightly according to the voltage curves of four cycles in the formal operation stage fig 4b c d e we can see that voltage change in a power generation cycle has gone through three stages rising stable and falling when the ratio of livestock wastewater and glucose nutrient solution reached 1 1 the power generation performance was the best with the increase of the proportion of raw livestock wastewater the composition of anode solution became more and more complex and the power generation performance of mfc decreased it was proved that antibiotics and other substances in livestock wastewater have a negative impact on the electricity generation efficiency of the system ce is an important index to measure the recovery efficiency of anode electrons and it can be used to characterize the transformation of organic matter to electron in the process of increasing the proportion of raw livestock wastewater from 1 3 to 1 0 ce calculated by formula increased from 25 39 to 38 40 firstly and then decreased to 27 16 and 21 07 this change showed that the growth and metabolism of microorganisms became slower in wastewater with antibiotic which leaded to the decrease of organic matter utilization efficiency and the reduction of electron transfer when the output voltage of each power generation cycle was stable the steady state discharge method could be used to measure the voltage of mfc under different external resistance conditions the polarization curve and the power density curve of four cycles were calculated as shown in fig 5 with the increase of the proportion of raw livestock wastewater in anodic liquid it was found that the internal resistance of mfc increased from 290 ω to 380 ω and the corresponding maximum power density decreased from 12 57 w m3 to 11 50 w m3 similarly it can be seen that the complexity of the anode liquid composition was one of the factors that affect the power generation performance of mfc the anode liquid with antibiotic would lead to greater internal resistance which would affect the power generation efficiency of the reactor 3 5 microbial morphology by sem in order to analyze the apparent structure anode before and after operation were observed by sem fig 6 the magnification of sem photo of the blank carbon felt was smooth and interlaced by carbon fiber to form a network structure fig 6a it was conducive to the attachment and growth of microorganisms on the electrode fig 6b c d showed the photos of anode sem at the end of operation it can be seen a large number of microorganisms of different shapes and sizes attached to the anode surface to form colonies most of them were cocci and bacilli covering the anode surface at the same time there were some skeletons like structures interspersed on the electrode surface which may have better stability 3 6 microbial community structure analysis principal coordinate analysis pcoa can visually show the similarities and differences in the evolution of microbial samples fig 7a the samples of inoculated sludge sample 0 glucose stabilized sludge sample b1 and b2 and raw water stabilized sludge sample b3 and b4 were far away from each other and the distance of the same period was relatively close by means of non metric multidimensional scaling nmds this difference was reflected by the distance between samples fig 7b it showed clear groups between samples at different stages and there were significant changes in bacterial community structure after the inoculated sludge was operated by mfc the bacterial community changed gradually to adapt the treatment of livestock wastewater the relative abundance of bacterial community structure at phylum level was displayed in fig 8a a total of 18 bacterial phyla were detected and proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi were dominant in the inoculated sludge samples the results showed that the microbial community changed markedly at phylum level in the subsequent processing the relative abundance of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increased by 39 09 and 16 77 respectively and the relative abundance of chloroflexi decreased finally the bacteria with the function of electricity generation nitrogen removal were screened out as shown in fig 8b geobacter syntrophomonas and caloramator were the dominant genera in the inoculated sludge at genus level some new bacteria appeared on the anode surface with the operation of mfc at the same time the disappearance of caloramator and anoxybacillus occurred after mfc operation the dominant bacteria on the anode biofilm changed to simplicispira trichococcus and rhodopseudomonas the addition of livestock wastewater gradually has a significant effect on the composition of microbial community the effect of raw livestock wastewater on microbial community composition at class level was reflected by a heatmap fig 8c deltaproteobacteria clostridia and anaerolineae were dominant and abundant in the inoculated sludge at the glucose stable stage the abundance of anaerolineae synergistia and bacilli decreased at the same time the abundance of actinobacteria betaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria increased showing their advantages gradually after the operation of raw livestock wastewater flavobacteriia appeared it may be speculated that the change was caused by the multiplication of dominant bacteria and selective effect of livestock wastewater 4 discussion the livestock wastewater treatment system including microbial processes is an unavoidable reservoir for args and their mges cheng et al 2020a long term exposure of microorganisms to antibiotic selection pressure would increase the spread of antibiotic resistance genes huang et al 2017 at present a large number of studies have been carried out on the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics by mfc but most of the studies only focus on the removal rate of antibiotics with little attention paid to the behavior of args and megs cheng et al 2020b xue et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 hence it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of args and megs in the treatment of livestock wastewater by mfc a total of 137 args and 9 megs were detected in the raw livestock wastewater and the number was relatively high it indicated that livestock waste water is the storage of args if was not treated properly it may lead to the horizontal transfer of args zainab et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 in the agricultural most of the livestock wastewater has not been treated strictly which causes certain harm to the soil surface water groundwater and even farmland ecosystem and poses a threat to human health hu et al 2017 therefore more attention should be paid to the control of livestock wastewater point source pollution in rural areas among them the number of args and mges decreased significantly after mfc treatment the numbers of mlsb tetracycline and mges all dropped by more than 50 and the number changed little during subsequent processing in the same way the relative abundance and absolute abundance of args and mges showed a remarkable decreasing trend after treatment however after mfc treatment the absolute abundance of beta lactamase gene increased and its causes need to be further studied previous studies confirmed that anaerobic treatment processes can efficiently remove arb and args christgen et al 2015 ghosh et al 2009 as a bioelectrochemical system bes the key mechanism of mfc is the combination of anaerobic biodegradation and electrical stimulation compared with traditional biological treatment persistent electrical stimulation can provide electrons to stimulate microorganisms to metabolize antibiotics rapidly by secreting enzymes dominguez benetton et al 2018 some bacteria promote electron transfer by carrying out extracellular electron transfers to improve the removal rate of antibiotics such as rhodoferax sp and cupriavidus sp obata et al 2020 the low selection pressure of antibiotics would inhibit the production and transmission of args in addition lower excess biomass and less residual sludge in mfc would reduce the abundance of arb and meg resulting in the obstacles of arg dissemination in conclusion mfc has the ability to reduce args effectively it may be indicated that the bioelectrochemical process in mfc system can effectively reduce the number of args and mges to decrease the environmental risk of resistance gene transfer while the internal mechanism causing the change needs to be explored by a lot of follow up studies at the same time some previous studies targeted args to evaluate the dynamics and judge their environmental risks such as sul1 sul2 and sul3 zhang et al 2017b since this study mainly focused on the reduction of total amount of args and mge by mfc and the specific target genes were measured to have the total amount of args it mainly included mlsb tetracycline and sulfonamide the removal of a specific resistance gene was not described in detail more detailed work will be done to explore the dynamics of args and mges in wastewater treatment in our follow up studies at present the construction of mfc for wastewater treatment containing refractory substances researches has made some progress koffi and okabe 2020 liu et al 2020b the results showed that livestock wastewater has little effect on cod removal in a certain range while mfc was used to treat raw livestock wastewater the removal efficiency of organic matter decreased the reason for the decrease of cod removal rate may be the presence of toxic substances such as antibiotics in livestock wastewater which affects the growth and metabolism of some anode microorganisms lu et al 2020 the residual antibiotics in livestock wastewater may be one of the factors limiting microbial metabolism wang et al 2018 but the specific influencing factors in this process need to be further studied when the volume ratio of livestock wastewater was 50 the total nitrogen removal efficiency is the best and the removal rate was 61 88 mfc treatment of wastewater is a joint effect of metabolism of various microorganisms li et al 2020 combined with the previous analysis it could be speculated that the adaptability of anode microorganism to livestock wastewater during mfc operation was insufficient and the ability of utilizing organic matter was decreased similarly the results of 3d eem fluorescence scanning showed that the growth and metabolism ability of microorganisms was stronger and the treatment effect of livestock wastewater was better in the early treatment process as a kind of dom the reduction of humic substances may prove that mfc was helpful to the removal of args feng et al 2021 humic substances have been confirmed to protect extracellular args against degradation and keep persistence dires et al 2018 in the wastewater treatment process the removal of args was positively correlated with the removal of protein total organic carbon toc and humus by adsorption of dna breazeal et al 2013 these results suggest that the presence of dom might be an important driving factor in args removal in addition it has been reported that total carbon tc had strong correlations with cod concentrations and bacterial biomass chen et al 2016 these might explain that biodegradation was one of the main removal mechanisms of args and dom in mfc however the correlation between dom and args should be analyzed in detail by experimental data and statistical tools in our following research in our study the voltage was relatively high after the device was started which proved that the microorganism in the inoculated sludge can degrade well when glucose is used as substrate it showed a better power generation efficiency toczyłowska mamińska et al 2018 compared with some studies the power density and coulomb efficiency were higher ma et al 2016 the reason for this phenomenon may be that carbon felt with a large relative surface area was used as anode in our experiment it enriched a large number of microorganisms and improves the energy transfer efficiency of biofilm farber et al 2019 in addition the internal resistance of mfc increased from 290 ω to 380 ω during the whole operation combined with relevant research it can be inferred that the livestock wastewater made the composition of anode liquid more complex the electron transfer was hindered to some extent the specific components that affect the electron transfer in livestock wastewater need to be studied in addition the gradual addition of livestock wastewater would directly affect the activity of enzyme system and metabolism of microorganisms and it ultimately affected the generation mechanism of electrons resulting in the reduction of electricity production efficiency he et al 2008 raghavulu et al 2009 through microbial morphology by sem the influence of process conditions on microbial community morphology can be explored the electrical stimulation can alter the microbial communities and their relative abundance in the mfc yang et al 2018 and antibiotics can produce selective pressure on microorganisms and accelerate the existence of microbial drug resistance at the same time some bacteria can promote electron transfer to improve the removal of antibiotics obata et al 2020 some studies have showed that resistance genes were positively correlated with specific bacteria in wastewater treatment system wang et al 2020 in the treatment system the existence and amplification of functional bacteria were closely related to the transmission of args these bacteria always play an important role in the proliferation process of args furthermore previous studies demonstrated that electrical stimulation can alter the microbial communities and their relative abundance in the bes yang et al 2018 the dominant bacteria played an essential role in the elimination of sulfadiazine in another study it was pointed out that the increment of the abundance of methanobacterium methanosaeta treponema and achromobacter was responsible for the degradation of highly concentrated sulfamethoxazole smx in mfcs kong et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to explore the relevance of microbial community on the proliferation and reduction of args in wastewater treatment process the correlation between args and microbial community may be distinguished which provide more information on the control of args in livestock wastewater treatment process in the process of mfc treating wastewater the growth and reproduction of anode microorganism will directly affect the treatment effect deng et al 2020 at the start up stage the microorganisms grew rapidly and multiplied and the diversity of bacterial community was increased after adding livestock wastewater the selection of anode microorganism was improved through a long time of operation the diversity of bacterial community was reduced and it was similar to other researches huang et al 2017 the dominant bacteria of inoculated sludge at the phylum level were proteobacteria firmicutes and chloroflexi which were similar to the study on the microbial community of uasb operation chen et al 2020 some studies have shown that proteobacteria and firmicutes can be used as anode respiratory bacteria and proteobacteria is considered as electrochemical active bacteria chen et al 2019 after the successful start up actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were added as the dominant bacteria which showed that the capacity of nitrogen removal of mfc was enhanced xing et al 2016 actinobacteria was the dominant bacteria in the anode biofilm at the end of operation combined with actinobacteria has the function of decomposing antibiotics and other complex organic matters mfc can treat livestock better in the experiment huang et al 2017 as the main electricity producing bacteria in organic wastewater environment geobacter was one of the dominant genera of inoculated sludge which proves that inoculated sludge has good adaptability to mfc dhar et al 2018 in addition deltaproteobacteria was one of the dominant bacteria of inoculated sludge which plays a role in cod degradation kiely et al 2011 after the start up the proteobacteria as the dominant species plays an important role in wastewater treatment and participate in cod degradation nitrification and other processes furthermore there were unclassified bacteria at the level of genus and class of anode biofilm which was similar to li s research results these microorganisms are worthy of further study in wastewater treatment li et al 2019b under the action of microorganisms mfc can be utilized as a power source through the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy which has promising application potential however the overall cost of system components is still one of the biggest obstacles to economic sustainability of mfc the cost of mfc constitutes of electrode 19 5 and membrane material 62 5 accounting for the major share of the total investment cost ge and he 2016 because of the expensive electrode and membrane materials a study proved that the capital cost of mfc is about 30 times of traditional activated sludge treatment systems he et al 2017 but the effective degradation of pollutants and higher power density output are still the advantages of mfc in some studies the cost of the reactor can be reduced by using expensive metal catalysts and membrane substitutes but the total cost is still too high for practical application khalili et al 2017 the combination with other sunlight driven systems and the use of cheap and stable separators might be beneficial for large scale mfc applications at a lower cost liu et al 2021 5 conclusion this study demonstrated that high level of args and mges were in livestock wastewater including 137 args and 9 mges therefore livestock wastewater poses great health and environmental risks and its management and treatment efficiency should be enhanced in the process of livestock wastewater treatment in mfc the number and abundance of most args and mges decreased significantly the relative abundance of sulfonamide beta lactamase and mges all reduced by more than 60 therefore livestock wastewater as the repository of resistance genes its environmental risk of resistance transfer could be effectively reduced by the bioelectrochemical process although our study clearly showed that bioelectrochemical methods effectively reduced the number of args and control the risk of horizontal gene transfer the removal mechanism and the transformation pathway need to be further studied the following are the supplementary data related to this article supplementary fig s1 removal rate of cod and

1319,surfactant and foam processes have been widely used to enhance oil recovery from petroleum bearing geological formations and also been recently extended to remediate non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants from the shallow subsurface this study investigates the potential of using surfactant and foam processes for the in situ remediation treatments within a military base in south korea first optimizing the subsurface permeability and net to gross ntg values based on history matching and machine learning algorithm second performing simulations that successfully predict the surfactant foam processes applied in the field and third expanding simulations that evaluate different scenarios that might have been used for field tests the site for the pilot scale testing located in the existing fuel distribution facilities within a military base has 5 m 5 m treatment area with 3 m depth prepared with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells the napl of interest is a mixture of various oil compounds showing the average oil saturation of 5 the overall remediation process applied consists of two major steps the first is a 20 day injection of surfactant solution tween 80 to mobilize the oleic phase trapped by capillary force and the second is a 3 day injection of foam i e gas and surfactant co injection to control the mobility of injected gas and overcome the heterogeneity of the underground system the major findings of this study are i surfactant foam processes can be an effective means of napl recovery from shallow subsurface recovering more than 90 of contaminants and ii computer simulations can be a useful tool for evaluating the in situ treatment and improving the design of similar operations keywords in situ remediation foam surfactant sweep napl 1 introduction an everlasting concern for groundwater bodies and soil is their contamination by organic and hydrophobic pollutants sometimes known as non aqueous phase liquid napl forsyth 1991 these pollutants can be divided into dense napl dnapl and light napl lnapl based on their density values with respect to water the manner in which dnapls and lnapls interact with soil and water can be significantly different konečný et al 2003 therefore increasing the complexity of their distributions underground in addition to ex situ remediation techniques i e treatment methods by removing contaminated soil and water from the original locations a myriad of in situ techniques have been developed including a pump and treat method based on simple water injection although convenient and popular this method does not yield an efficient contaminant removal mackay and cherry 1989 demonstrating the difficulty of handling napl spills other remediation techniques are aligned with various enhanced oil recovery processes in the petroleum industry such as hot water and steam injection cosolvents surfactants alkaline agents and polymers udell 1992 davis and lien 1993 fulton et al 1991 mayer et al 1999 zhong et al 2013 using these enhanced techniques the recovery of napls can be improved to more than 50 of the total contaminant volumes as opposed to considerably less than 50 with conventional water injection newell et al 1995 among various in situ remediation techniques the use of surfactant processes sometimes called surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear has been widely studied karthick et al 2019a mulligan and eftekhari 2003 zhong et al 2001 zhong et al 2003 wang and mulligan 2004 and shown to improve remediation efficiencies by reducing capillary trapping and dissolving napls many studies also show that by injecting surfactant solutions and gas phases together the resulting foam mixtures can sweep the medium more efficiently and overcome subsurface heterogeneity szafranski et al 1998 ma et al 2012 karthick et al 2019b forey et al 2020 roostapour and kam 2012 roostapour et al 2014 with a theoretical foundation of foam displacement mechanisms provided rosman and kam 2009 lee et al 2014 farajzadeh et al 2012 although modeling foam rheology is very complicated because of its non newtonian behavior kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 lee and kam 2013 a relatively simpler concept has been developed and employed for real world applications by using a specific foam simulation parameter called the mobility reduction factor mrf the term mrf depicts how much the mobility of gas phase is altered in various situations within porous media depending on water saturation sw and oil saturation so as well as types of surfactants and napls for instance the case of mrf 1 represents no foaming meaning conventional gas water two phase flow without foams while lower and higher mrf values represent less stable low strength foams e g 1 mrf 10 and more stable high strength foams e g mrf 50 respectively mayberry et al 2008 this study investigates a military base in the republic of korea fig 1 where the field was contaminated by both dense pce and tce and light benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene or btex napls originating from multiple leak sources such as storage tanks distribution facilities and transportation pipelines the site of interest within the field that is the fuel distribution facilities as shown by a dotted circle in fig 1 b mostly contaminated by btex lnapls was treated by 20 days 0 15 wt tween80 surfactant injection partly with 671 mg l bromide tracers at the beginning followed by 3 days foam injection and successfully recovered more than 90 of the btex lnapls a thorough site investigation was performed before the in situ treatments um et al 2013 and a simulation study was conducted for a history matching purpose to understand the level of subsurface heterogeneity fleifel et al 2020 the simulation applied a combination of large and small grid blocks fig 2 a see the finer grid system in the focus area including three injection wells left one monitoring well middle and three extraction wells right with 5 m 5 m areal coverage x and y directions and 3 m vertical depth z direction and identified three major horizontal permeability kh values fig 2 b i e kh 64 darcy for the high kh outer band area red kh 16 darcy for the medium kh inner band area light blue and kh 1 32 darcy for the low kh background area dark blue as denoted by kha khb and khc respectively the geometric average of which matched the field average kh of about 1 0 darcy note that 1 darcy is roughly equivalent to 10 12 m2 the site had gas saturation sg of 0 05 in the top grid layer i e z 0 3 m below which sg 0 0 i e 0 3 m z 3 0 m as illustrated by the different colors in fig 2 a the simulation was based on the net to gross ratio ntg of 0 33 this somewhat low ntg was justified by the geological survey with very high clay contents and the vertical permeability kv was estimated to be a tenth of the horizontal permeability kh due to compaction i e kv 0 1 kh some relevant photos during the set up and operation of the in situ remediation treatments in this site are shown in fig 3 2 objectives of this study this study has two main objectives the first is to revisit the previous rough history matching study of fleifel et al 2020 based on the trial and error method and find a better description of subsurface heterogeneity by applying optimization techniques and error analysis this study demonstrates how to examine the effects of various sets of permeability and ntg values and how to determine an optimum set that leads to less error in history matching the second main objective is to evaluate different types of surfactant and foam remediation scenarios and recommend more appropriate and efficient cases for this site the optimum input set of permeability and ntg values selected from the first objective is used as a basis to perform this second objective 3 methodology simulations of in situ remediation processes are essentially based on the partial differential equation of mass conservation as a governing equation which is defined as follows in a general form 1 t ϕ j 1 n p ρ j s j ω ij 1 ϕ ρ s ω is j n p ρ j ω ij u j ϕ s j k ij ω ij ϕ j 1 n p s j r ij 1 ϕ r is where i j and s represent components fluid phases and solid phase respectively in addition ϕ represents porosity ωij mass fraction ρj and ρs density sj saturation u j velocity vector k ij dispersion coefficient tensor and rij and ris chemical reactions the dispersion coefficient term is assumed to be negligible because of the convection dominant nature of this study this governing equation is solved together with transport equations for involved phases j for example 2a q j a u j k k rj μ j p j l for phase j where q j u j μ j and p j l are the flow rate velocity viscosity and pressure gradient of phase j while a and k represent the cross sectional area and absolute permeability either kh or kv of the medium respectively the term k rj is the relative permeability to phase j that is a function of phase saturations when foam is present the term mrf is employed to the transport equation of the gas phase to adjust gas mobility in the simulation 2b q g a u g k k rg μ g mrf p g l in this study there exist three phases j w o and g representing aqueous water oleic oil and gaseous gas phases respectively and five components i w o g s and t representing h2o or water xylene or oil nitrogen or gas tween80 or surfactant and bromide or tracer components respectively the oil and gas phases form single component and single phase systems while the water phase may consist of up to three components water surfactant and tracer components forming a three component and single phase system the pressure difference between two immiscible phases is represented by capillary pressure pc that can be related to the interfacial tension contact angle and average pore size through the young laplace equation rossen 1996 for example at any given time and location within the system the pressure values of water and oil p w and p o respectively can be linked to each other as follows by using water oil capillary pressure p c wo water oil interfacial tension σ wo water oil contact angle at the rock surface θ wo and average radius of pores r pore 3 p o p w p c wo 2 σ wo cos θ wo r pore if water behaves as an external phase and oil an internal phase the presence of surfactant molecules in water reduces σ wo and p c wo and thus lowers the level of capillary pressure and the amount of oil trapped such a relationship is essentially reflected in the transport equations as shown in eqs 2a and 2b the same goes for water air or oil air mixture similarly this study uses computer modeling group cmg software i e cmost computer assisted matching optimization and sensitivity analysis tool and stars advanced processes and thermal reservoir simulator cmost which is a non linear regression and supervised machine learning model helps determine the optimal sets of independent inputs such as absolute permeability and net to gross values to better match dependent outputs such as cumulative oil production from multiple wells among various optimization methods cmg dece pso de latin hypercube plus proxy and random brute force methods computer modeling group ltd 2013 cmg dece designed exploration and controlled evolution optimizer is the optimization engine selected this engine works in two steps first in the designed exploration stage search techniques are used to explore the space of solutions then in the evolution stage the algorithm is applied with statistical methods in the results from the exploration stage ranazzi and pinto 2017 on the other hand stars which is designed for complex phenomena associated with chemical flooding solves partial differential equations for mass balance and energy balance and is applied to evaluate a variety of remediation scenarios to briefly review the simulation efforts the grid system is constructed with a finer grid system 42 42 10 blocks representing 10 5 m 10 5 m 3 m as well as a coarser grid system 39 39 10 blocks representing 19 5 m 19 5 m 3 m surrounding the finer grid system see fig 2 a the finer grid system encompasses all seven wells north middle south injection wells inj n inj m inj s north middle south extractions wells ext n ext m ext s and a monitoring well in between and the entire system is provided with a no flow boundary condition because it interacts with a much larger body of aquifer the oil saturation so distribution is shown in fig 4 a with an average oil saturation in the site of 5 0 while the oil production history qo during the first 10 days or 240 h of period is shown in fig 4 b for ext n ext m and ext s wells together with the total adding these three together as shown in the following sections this production data in fig 4 b converted from the original field data of oil concentration in the liquid produced is used as a basis for history matching to determine the level of subsurface heterogeneity note that the data from 75 to 150 h seems to be somewhat anomalous showing very low values which adds some uncertainty regarding how to interpret in simulation fit the injection condition consists of three phases i e first 10 days of surfactant injection phase 1 second 10 days of surfactant injection phase 2 and last 3 days of foam injection phase 3 the total injection rate qt is maintained to be at qt 2 30 m3 day during the three injection phases i e qt qw during phases 1 and 2 surfactant injection qt qg qw 1 848 m3 day 0 462 m3 day and fg qg qt 0 80 during phase 3 foam injection except that an additional water phase with tracer is injected at qw 0 79 m3 day for the first 200 min of phase 1 i e the total water injection rate of qw 3 09 m3 day during that time the distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is important because the samplings from the extraction wells are performed multiple times during the day in phase 1 compared to only one sampling at the end of 10 days in phase 2 see more in the results section below in addition it should be noted that each day during the entire remediation treatments 23 days with phase 1 2 and 3 consists of 9 h of active working time 8 am to 5 pm and 15 h of shut in time due to the limited access to the military base for the operation for the error analysis to evaluate different sets of input parameters permeability and ntg values the total error et that is no other than a sum of local errors i e en em and es for north middle and south wells respectively can be expressed as follows 4 e t e n e m e s 3 and 5 e k i 1 n s q o sim q o data 2 q o data 2 i n s k for k n m and s the subscript k represents the extraction wells north middle or south while qosim and qodata represent oil production rates from the simulations and field data respectively for the k th well ns is the number of data points at which the errors are calculated 4 results this section consists of three parts i optimization of subsurface heterogeneity based on optimization technique and error analysis to determine the permeability and ntg distributions ii evaluation of surfactant and foam processes as the way the in situ remediation treatment is carried out taking various mrf values into account and iii evaluation of other scenarios not carried out in the field but considered as possible methods 4 1 optimization of subsurface heterogeneity in order to determine the distributions of permeability and ntg values for optimization purpose other parameters are assumed and held constant in simulations they include connate water saturation swc 0 2 residual oil saturation sor 0 0 residual gas saturation sgr 0 0 porosity ϕ 8 75 water density ρw 1 04 g cc oil density ρo 0 68 g cc water viscosity μw 1 0 cp and oil viscosity μo 0 70 cp while the entire field of the military base shows both dnapl and lnapl spills this specific site is contaminated by lnapls only the same relative permeability functions as shown in fleifel et al 2020 following stone s model stone 1970 are applied interfacial tension values between water and air water and oil and oil and air are about 72 30 and 25 dynes cm respectively as measured from the lab tests with surfactant interfacial tension value between surfactant solution and oil is reduced down to 0 01 dynes cm the first attempt in this effort is to evaluate the distributions of permeability and ntg values selected by the trial and error method in fleifel et al 2020 they are three kh values of 64 16 and 1 32 darcies making the average kh 1 0 darcy see fig 2 b and a single uniform ntg value of 0 33 in all depths i e 0 z 3 m the oil production data from three extraction wells fig 4 b is converted to show the cumulative oil production first fig 5 a and then normalized by using the value at the end of the first 10 days or 240 h as a second step as shown by the field symbols in fig 5 b c and d for ext n ext m and ext s wells respectively the comparison between the field data x symbols and simulation results open symbols in fig 5 b through d shows that although fleifel et al 2020 somewhat over estimates oil production during the in situ treatments overall it successfully captures the trend with relatively simple subsurface descriptions the total error et from the error analysis is shown to be about 15 0 the step by step increase in oil recovery with time in fig 5 is because the injection is halted overnight during the treatment among many attempts made this study shows only two more cases as a high level summary of this optimization efforts i determining three new kh values still resulting in the same average kh 1 0 darcy keeping the same uniform ntg value of 0 33 to further reduce the error for better match fig 6 and ii determining three new ntg values depending on the depth by using the pre determined kh values in fig 6 to reduce the error even further fig 7 fig 6 a through c show the results to optimize three kh values the conditions specified for the optimization include the high kha ranging from 6 400 to 320 0 darcy the medium khb ranging from 1 600 to 80 00 darcy and the low khc calculated to make the geometric average becoming 1 0 darcy with the number of simulations runs 300 each of these 300 simulation runs sometimes called experiments has its own total error et calculated as shown in fig 6 d and the run expressed by the red symbol in fig 6 d is shown to be the case with a minimum et value of 10 0 providing kh values of kha 9 536 khb 1 600 and khc 0 256 darcies the red lines and numerous light colored lines in fig 6 a through c represent the optimum case in fig 6 with the minimum error of 10 0 and 299 other simulation runs respectively the symbols and the dark blue lines represent the field data and the simulation case from fig 5 respectively fig 6 d showing the errors from the 300 runs serves as a summary of runs associated with fig 6 a through c fig 7 a through c show the results to optimize three ntg values for vertical intervals such as simulation layer 1 0 z 0 3 m layer 2 to 5 0 3 z 1 5 m and layer 6 to 10 1 5 z 3 0 m among many possible choices this particular recommendation is made based on the field survey in that layer 1 is the interval above the groundwater table layer 2 5 is the interval with added foreign soils and compactions to make a solid foundation for the fuel distribution facilities and layer 6 10 is the interval with the original well compacted soils the conditions specified for the optimization include a uniform distribution within a lower limit ntg of 0 1 upper limit ntg of 1 0 and with the number of simulations run 300 fig 7 d presents these 300 simulation runs with et values calculated the optimum case expressed by the red lines in fig 7 shows a minimum et value of 8 0 providing ntg values of 0 581 0 302 and 0 289 for the upper middle and lower intervals respectively kh values are the same as those in fig 6 kha 9 536 khb 1 600 and khc 0 256 darcies note that the case of three k simulation runs is the optimum case shown in fig 6 note that the optimum kh and ntg values determined as shown in fig 7 may not be necessarily the optimum set of all possible input values providing the global minimum et but the set can be viewed as a very plausible one that can be used as a basis for the simulation evaluation of in situ remediation treatments as shown in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of surfactant foam processes by using the kh and ntg values in fig 7 the in situ remediation treatment with surfactant and foam is ready to be simulated fig 8 is the field data during the 23 days of operations 10 days of phase 1 next 10 days of phase 2 and last 3 days of phase 3 the yellow square marks with vertical red lines are the trend to match from the simulation in this study three values of mrf are used for this simulation effort mrf 100 as the base case following previous lab flow tests see type 3 experiments in gauglitz et al 2002 for similar tests with unconsolidated sands and mrf 10 and 500 to investigate the sensitivity of foam strength in the treatment previous studies show that mrf values depend on the absolute permeability of the medium as well as fluid saturations kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 but they are assumed to be identical in the simulations because of lacking laboratory data fig 9 a through d show the simulation results of the case of mrf 100 base case in terms of oil production rate cumulative oil production injection well bottomhole pressure and extraction well bottomhole pressure respectively fig 9 a seems to match the overall trend fig 8 of oil production quite well during phases 1 2 and 3 the injection pressure history fig 9 c is also consistent with qualitative field observations in that i the pressure increases during the injection period and declines during the shut in period and ii the middle injection well inj m shows higher injection pressure than the north and south wells inj n and inj s because it sits in between the pressure during the shut in period of surfactant injection first 20 days is a bit higher than that of foam injection last 3 days because of higher hydrostatic pressure of the surfactant solution in the well the extraction pressure fig 9 d is maintained near the atmospheric pressure during the shut in period and is a bit higher during the operation time due to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column and the presence of foams in the well fig 10 shows what happens in terms of oil saturation so during the entire process for layer 1 2 3 and 7 selected among the 10 layers at different operation days during phases 1 and 2 i e surfactant injection the oil seems to migrate horizontally and vertically too whenever it gets the opportunity to flow i e originally trapped by the capillary force but now mobilized by surfactant solution therefore the top layer layer 1 is the main layer for most of oil to be produced from day 10 through 20 it is observed that there is an influx of oil rising from the layers below during subsequent surfactant injection during phase 3 i e foam injection foam tends to sweep the top layer more uniformly overcoming the permeability differences it is interesting to see part of the oil in the top layer during foam injection is pushed down to the lower layer eg layer 2 as foams preferentially occupy the top layer similarly figs 11 and 12 show the case of mrf 10 i e lower strength foams compared to the base case while figs 13 and 14 show the case of mrf 500 i e higher strength foam compared to the base case in terms of oil production histories and oil saturation distributions compared with the field history in figs 8 11 a with mrf 10 underestimates but fig 13 a with mrf 500 overestimates the oil production rate such an aspect is also reflected by the oil saturation maps in figs 12 and 14 i e less effective vs more effective sweep with lower vs higher mrf respectively note that mrf 500 is viewed as an extreme just for simulation purpose as it is too high to achieve in the field table 1 summarizes the simulation results of these three cases with more details including oil production from each extraction well for the entire 23 days of period the amount of oil recovered at the end of 23 days of operations are 0 2836 0 3008 and 0 3037 m3 for mrf 10 100 and 500 respectively these values correspond to 86 7 91 9 and 92 9 of oil recovery the original oil in place is 0 327 m3 the oil recovery of 91 9 of the base case following the trend observed from the field data shows that the surfactant foam remediation treatment in this study is very successful overall this specific surfactant solution seems very effective in reducing capillary trapping of the contaminants during phases 1 and 2 and creating foams strong enough to improve the sweep efficiency the upward migration of the contaminant during the operation is another benefit in this field 4 3 evaluation of other remediation scenarios in addition to the base case scenario i e 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of foam injection with mrf 100 figs 9 and 10 that was applied in the field other scenarios have also been considered during the designing phase among many this study takes the following scenarios into consideration for simulation efforts scenario 1 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of gas water co injection scenario 2 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of alternating injection of foam and surfactant foam 1 day surfactant 1 day foam 1 day scenario 3 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of alternating injection of foam and surfactant foam 2 days surfactant 1 day and scenario 4 23 days of surfactant injection in all of these attempts the same total injection rate qt 2 30 m3 day is maintained for each injection well except for the first 200 min with additional tracer solution as before when foams are used foam quality of 80 i e the gas fraction fg 0 80 and mrf 100 are applied to keep consistency figs 15 and 16 show the simulation results of scenario 1 in which gas and water are injected together during the last 3 days without forming foams the cumulative oil recovered at the end of 23 days is about 0 2804 m3 which is equivalent to 85 7 of oil recovery note 91 9 recovery from the base case figs 9 and 10 as expected a simple gas and water co injection without foaming and thus without mobility control tends to show a poorer sweep leading to lower oil recovery the distribution of oil phase in layer 1 on day 22 in fig 16 exhibits another interesting behavior that is the gas phase without mobility control breaks through quickly pushing the oil phase out of the treatment area i e the square shaped area that is formed by connecting 6 injection and extraction wells which of course should be avoided in in situ remediation treatments figs 17 and 18 show the simulation results of scenario 2 in which foam and surfactant injections are alternated during the last 3 days foam surfactant and foam each with 1 day injection the results show the cumulative oil production of 0 3012 m3 and recovery percentage of 92 1 which is quite comparable to 91 9 recovery of the base case 3 day foam injection with mrf 100 figs 9 and 10 because of more surfactant chemical costs involved by injecting surfactant for a full day this scenario seems inferior to the base case figs 19 and 20 show the simulation results of scenario 3 in which foam and surfactant injections are alternated during the last 3 days foam 2 days and surfactant 1 day the results show a superior performance to scenario 2 recovering 0 3022 m3 of oil equivalent to the recovery percentage of 92 4 comparing the outcomes from the base case scenario 2 and scenario 3 provides a useful insight into surfactant foam remediation processes that is a careful selection of fluid injection strategy can indeed make a meaningful difference in field treatments figs 21 and 22 show the simulation results of scenario 4 in which only surfactant injections are continued for the entire 23 days the results show a total oil recovery of 0 2931 m3 or 89 6 scenarios 4 seems not only inferior to the cases with foams i e the base case scenario 2 and scenario 3 in terms of oil recovery but also causes difficulties by pushing the oil of the treatment area similar to gas water injection in scenario 1 scenarios 1 and 4 may well suffer from such a behavior because the process does not have the ability to overcome the permeability contrast table 2 summarizes the results of these four scenarios with more details including oil production from each extraction well for the entire 23 days the amount of oil recovery at the end of 23 days of operations are 0 2804 0 3012 0 3022 and 0 2931 m3 for scenarios 1 through 4 respectively these values correspond to 85 7 92 1 92 4 and 89 6 of oil recovery this outcome shows that i surfactant injection is a useful means of remediating subsurface contaminants in in situ remediation and ii using surfactant foam processes further improves the sweep efficiency in the field trials 5 discussions this simulation study uses a fixed value of mrf mrf 1 10 and 500 for example to represent foam rheology during the process assuming an instantaneous attainment of local equilibrium status because of interrupted fluid injection i e 9 h of active injection followed by 15 h shut in per day foam texture during the overnight shut in period may change such a transient behavior is not expected to alter the outcomes of this study significantly because earlier foam generation studies show experimentally and theoretically that the near steady state mrf values are obtained quickly as the injection resumes at even harsher conditions such as high temperature and high brine concentration kam et al 2007 also related discussions in gauglitz et al 2002 and kam and rossen 2003 more details on the in situ bubble creation and coalescence can be found in the literature kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 szafranski et al 1998 together with the prediction of foam propagation distance using bubble population balance model izadi and kam 2019 izadi and kam 2018 dynamic foam simulations may help design and predict the process where the transient behavior is of high importance kovscek and radke 1994 kam 2008 one may find it odd that the oil recovery at the end of surfactant only injection day 20 is slightly different depending on mrf values applied as shown in table 1 which is also reflected by figs 10 12 and 14 the difference is caused by the mobility of the gas phase in the top layer i e the unsaturated 0 3 m vadose zone with sg 5 even though the magnitude is not really significant in terms of gas transport due to low gas saturation the change in gas phase mobility does contribute to the transport of all phases in the top layer allowing oil to flow more mrf 10 100 or 500 or less mrf 1 easily relatively these simulation results also reflect foam physics correctly because such a trapping mechanism of gas bubbles in the presence of surfactant solution is a part of the transport mechanism of the gas phase in situ 6 conclusions this study investigates surfactant foam assisted in situ shallow subsurface remediation processes to recover lnapl contaminants from a site within the military base in south korea the pilot test performed in the treatment area of 5 m 5 m with 3 m depth with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells during 23 days of surfactant tween80 and foam injections is matched by computer simulations this study can be summarized with the following conclusions by using the pattern of subsurface heterogeneity determined by the previous study both optimization techniques and error analysis employed in this study can help select the distributions of permeability and net to gross values leading to less errors down to 8 in terms of matching oil production history the simulation can successfully predict the performance of 23 days of surfactant foam processes 20 days of surfactant and 3 days of foam injection as observed in the field the use of gas phase mobility reduction factor mrf 100 as identified in separate lab tests is shown to recover about 91 of contaminants from the site which is consistent with the field pilot test other possible scenarios are also examined including gas water injection and surfactant only injection with no foams as well as alternating foams and surfactant solutions this study finds that the use of foams is a crucial component to control gas mobility and overcome

1319,surfactant and foam processes have been widely used to enhance oil recovery from petroleum bearing geological formations and also been recently extended to remediate non aqueous phase liquid napl contaminants from the shallow subsurface this study investigates the potential of using surfactant and foam processes for the in situ remediation treatments within a military base in south korea first optimizing the subsurface permeability and net to gross ntg values based on history matching and machine learning algorithm second performing simulations that successfully predict the surfactant foam processes applied in the field and third expanding simulations that evaluate different scenarios that might have been used for field tests the site for the pilot scale testing located in the existing fuel distribution facilities within a military base has 5 m 5 m treatment area with 3 m depth prepared with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells the napl of interest is a mixture of various oil compounds showing the average oil saturation of 5 the overall remediation process applied consists of two major steps the first is a 20 day injection of surfactant solution tween 80 to mobilize the oleic phase trapped by capillary force and the second is a 3 day injection of foam i e gas and surfactant co injection to control the mobility of injected gas and overcome the heterogeneity of the underground system the major findings of this study are i surfactant foam processes can be an effective means of napl recovery from shallow subsurface recovering more than 90 of contaminants and ii computer simulations can be a useful tool for evaluating the in situ treatment and improving the design of similar operations keywords in situ remediation foam surfactant sweep napl 1 introduction an everlasting concern for groundwater bodies and soil is their contamination by organic and hydrophobic pollutants sometimes known as non aqueous phase liquid napl forsyth 1991 these pollutants can be divided into dense napl dnapl and light napl lnapl based on their density values with respect to water the manner in which dnapls and lnapls interact with soil and water can be significantly different konečný et al 2003 therefore increasing the complexity of their distributions underground in addition to ex situ remediation techniques i e treatment methods by removing contaminated soil and water from the original locations a myriad of in situ techniques have been developed including a pump and treat method based on simple water injection although convenient and popular this method does not yield an efficient contaminant removal mackay and cherry 1989 demonstrating the difficulty of handling napl spills other remediation techniques are aligned with various enhanced oil recovery processes in the petroleum industry such as hot water and steam injection cosolvents surfactants alkaline agents and polymers udell 1992 davis and lien 1993 fulton et al 1991 mayer et al 1999 zhong et al 2013 using these enhanced techniques the recovery of napls can be improved to more than 50 of the total contaminant volumes as opposed to considerably less than 50 with conventional water injection newell et al 1995 among various in situ remediation techniques the use of surfactant processes sometimes called surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear has been widely studied karthick et al 2019a mulligan and eftekhari 2003 zhong et al 2001 zhong et al 2003 wang and mulligan 2004 and shown to improve remediation efficiencies by reducing capillary trapping and dissolving napls many studies also show that by injecting surfactant solutions and gas phases together the resulting foam mixtures can sweep the medium more efficiently and overcome subsurface heterogeneity szafranski et al 1998 ma et al 2012 karthick et al 2019b forey et al 2020 roostapour and kam 2012 roostapour et al 2014 with a theoretical foundation of foam displacement mechanisms provided rosman and kam 2009 lee et al 2014 farajzadeh et al 2012 although modeling foam rheology is very complicated because of its non newtonian behavior kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 lee and kam 2013 a relatively simpler concept has been developed and employed for real world applications by using a specific foam simulation parameter called the mobility reduction factor mrf the term mrf depicts how much the mobility of gas phase is altered in various situations within porous media depending on water saturation sw and oil saturation so as well as types of surfactants and napls for instance the case of mrf 1 represents no foaming meaning conventional gas water two phase flow without foams while lower and higher mrf values represent less stable low strength foams e g 1 mrf 10 and more stable high strength foams e g mrf 50 respectively mayberry et al 2008 this study investigates a military base in the republic of korea fig 1 where the field was contaminated by both dense pce and tce and light benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene or btex napls originating from multiple leak sources such as storage tanks distribution facilities and transportation pipelines the site of interest within the field that is the fuel distribution facilities as shown by a dotted circle in fig 1 b mostly contaminated by btex lnapls was treated by 20 days 0 15 wt tween80 surfactant injection partly with 671 mg l bromide tracers at the beginning followed by 3 days foam injection and successfully recovered more than 90 of the btex lnapls a thorough site investigation was performed before the in situ treatments um et al 2013 and a simulation study was conducted for a history matching purpose to understand the level of subsurface heterogeneity fleifel et al 2020 the simulation applied a combination of large and small grid blocks fig 2 a see the finer grid system in the focus area including three injection wells left one monitoring well middle and three extraction wells right with 5 m 5 m areal coverage x and y directions and 3 m vertical depth z direction and identified three major horizontal permeability kh values fig 2 b i e kh 64 darcy for the high kh outer band area red kh 16 darcy for the medium kh inner band area light blue and kh 1 32 darcy for the low kh background area dark blue as denoted by kha khb and khc respectively the geometric average of which matched the field average kh of about 1 0 darcy note that 1 darcy is roughly equivalent to 10 12 m2 the site had gas saturation sg of 0 05 in the top grid layer i e z 0 3 m below which sg 0 0 i e 0 3 m z 3 0 m as illustrated by the different colors in fig 2 a the simulation was based on the net to gross ratio ntg of 0 33 this somewhat low ntg was justified by the geological survey with very high clay contents and the vertical permeability kv was estimated to be a tenth of the horizontal permeability kh due to compaction i e kv 0 1 kh some relevant photos during the set up and operation of the in situ remediation treatments in this site are shown in fig 3 2 objectives of this study this study has two main objectives the first is to revisit the previous rough history matching study of fleifel et al 2020 based on the trial and error method and find a better description of subsurface heterogeneity by applying optimization techniques and error analysis this study demonstrates how to examine the effects of various sets of permeability and ntg values and how to determine an optimum set that leads to less error in history matching the second main objective is to evaluate different types of surfactant and foam remediation scenarios and recommend more appropriate and efficient cases for this site the optimum input set of permeability and ntg values selected from the first objective is used as a basis to perform this second objective 3 methodology simulations of in situ remediation processes are essentially based on the partial differential equation of mass conservation as a governing equation which is defined as follows in a general form 1 t ϕ j 1 n p ρ j s j ω ij 1 ϕ ρ s ω is j n p ρ j ω ij u j ϕ s j k ij ω ij ϕ j 1 n p s j r ij 1 ϕ r is where i j and s represent components fluid phases and solid phase respectively in addition ϕ represents porosity ωij mass fraction ρj and ρs density sj saturation u j velocity vector k ij dispersion coefficient tensor and rij and ris chemical reactions the dispersion coefficient term is assumed to be negligible because of the convection dominant nature of this study this governing equation is solved together with transport equations for involved phases j for example 2a q j a u j k k rj μ j p j l for phase j where q j u j μ j and p j l are the flow rate velocity viscosity and pressure gradient of phase j while a and k represent the cross sectional area and absolute permeability either kh or kv of the medium respectively the term k rj is the relative permeability to phase j that is a function of phase saturations when foam is present the term mrf is employed to the transport equation of the gas phase to adjust gas mobility in the simulation 2b q g a u g k k rg μ g mrf p g l in this study there exist three phases j w o and g representing aqueous water oleic oil and gaseous gas phases respectively and five components i w o g s and t representing h2o or water xylene or oil nitrogen or gas tween80 or surfactant and bromide or tracer components respectively the oil and gas phases form single component and single phase systems while the water phase may consist of up to three components water surfactant and tracer components forming a three component and single phase system the pressure difference between two immiscible phases is represented by capillary pressure pc that can be related to the interfacial tension contact angle and average pore size through the young laplace equation rossen 1996 for example at any given time and location within the system the pressure values of water and oil p w and p o respectively can be linked to each other as follows by using water oil capillary pressure p c wo water oil interfacial tension σ wo water oil contact angle at the rock surface θ wo and average radius of pores r pore 3 p o p w p c wo 2 σ wo cos θ wo r pore if water behaves as an external phase and oil an internal phase the presence of surfactant molecules in water reduces σ wo and p c wo and thus lowers the level of capillary pressure and the amount of oil trapped such a relationship is essentially reflected in the transport equations as shown in eqs 2a and 2b the same goes for water air or oil air mixture similarly this study uses computer modeling group cmg software i e cmost computer assisted matching optimization and sensitivity analysis tool and stars advanced processes and thermal reservoir simulator cmost which is a non linear regression and supervised machine learning model helps determine the optimal sets of independent inputs such as absolute permeability and net to gross values to better match dependent outputs such as cumulative oil production from multiple wells among various optimization methods cmg dece pso de latin hypercube plus proxy and random brute force methods computer modeling group ltd 2013 cmg dece designed exploration and controlled evolution optimizer is the optimization engine selected this engine works in two steps first in the designed exploration stage search techniques are used to explore the space of solutions then in the evolution stage the algorithm is applied with statistical methods in the results from the exploration stage ranazzi and pinto 2017 on the other hand stars which is designed for complex phenomena associated with chemical flooding solves partial differential equations for mass balance and energy balance and is applied to evaluate a variety of remediation scenarios to briefly review the simulation efforts the grid system is constructed with a finer grid system 42 42 10 blocks representing 10 5 m 10 5 m 3 m as well as a coarser grid system 39 39 10 blocks representing 19 5 m 19 5 m 3 m surrounding the finer grid system see fig 2 a the finer grid system encompasses all seven wells north middle south injection wells inj n inj m inj s north middle south extractions wells ext n ext m ext s and a monitoring well in between and the entire system is provided with a no flow boundary condition because it interacts with a much larger body of aquifer the oil saturation so distribution is shown in fig 4 a with an average oil saturation in the site of 5 0 while the oil production history qo during the first 10 days or 240 h of period is shown in fig 4 b for ext n ext m and ext s wells together with the total adding these three together as shown in the following sections this production data in fig 4 b converted from the original field data of oil concentration in the liquid produced is used as a basis for history matching to determine the level of subsurface heterogeneity note that the data from 75 to 150 h seems to be somewhat anomalous showing very low values which adds some uncertainty regarding how to interpret in simulation fit the injection condition consists of three phases i e first 10 days of surfactant injection phase 1 second 10 days of surfactant injection phase 2 and last 3 days of foam injection phase 3 the total injection rate qt is maintained to be at qt 2 30 m3 day during the three injection phases i e qt qw during phases 1 and 2 surfactant injection qt qg qw 1 848 m3 day 0 462 m3 day and fg qg qt 0 80 during phase 3 foam injection except that an additional water phase with tracer is injected at qw 0 79 m3 day for the first 200 min of phase 1 i e the total water injection rate of qw 3 09 m3 day during that time the distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is important because the samplings from the extraction wells are performed multiple times during the day in phase 1 compared to only one sampling at the end of 10 days in phase 2 see more in the results section below in addition it should be noted that each day during the entire remediation treatments 23 days with phase 1 2 and 3 consists of 9 h of active working time 8 am to 5 pm and 15 h of shut in time due to the limited access to the military base for the operation for the error analysis to evaluate different sets of input parameters permeability and ntg values the total error et that is no other than a sum of local errors i e en em and es for north middle and south wells respectively can be expressed as follows 4 e t e n e m e s 3 and 5 e k i 1 n s q o sim q o data 2 q o data 2 i n s k for k n m and s the subscript k represents the extraction wells north middle or south while qosim and qodata represent oil production rates from the simulations and field data respectively for the k th well ns is the number of data points at which the errors are calculated 4 results this section consists of three parts i optimization of subsurface heterogeneity based on optimization technique and error analysis to determine the permeability and ntg distributions ii evaluation of surfactant and foam processes as the way the in situ remediation treatment is carried out taking various mrf values into account and iii evaluation of other scenarios not carried out in the field but considered as possible methods 4 1 optimization of subsurface heterogeneity in order to determine the distributions of permeability and ntg values for optimization purpose other parameters are assumed and held constant in simulations they include connate water saturation swc 0 2 residual oil saturation sor 0 0 residual gas saturation sgr 0 0 porosity ϕ 8 75 water density ρw 1 04 g cc oil density ρo 0 68 g cc water viscosity μw 1 0 cp and oil viscosity μo 0 70 cp while the entire field of the military base shows both dnapl and lnapl spills this specific site is contaminated by lnapls only the same relative permeability functions as shown in fleifel et al 2020 following stone s model stone 1970 are applied interfacial tension values between water and air water and oil and oil and air are about 72 30 and 25 dynes cm respectively as measured from the lab tests with surfactant interfacial tension value between surfactant solution and oil is reduced down to 0 01 dynes cm the first attempt in this effort is to evaluate the distributions of permeability and ntg values selected by the trial and error method in fleifel et al 2020 they are three kh values of 64 16 and 1 32 darcies making the average kh 1 0 darcy see fig 2 b and a single uniform ntg value of 0 33 in all depths i e 0 z 3 m the oil production data from three extraction wells fig 4 b is converted to show the cumulative oil production first fig 5 a and then normalized by using the value at the end of the first 10 days or 240 h as a second step as shown by the field symbols in fig 5 b c and d for ext n ext m and ext s wells respectively the comparison between the field data x symbols and simulation results open symbols in fig 5 b through d shows that although fleifel et al 2020 somewhat over estimates oil production during the in situ treatments overall it successfully captures the trend with relatively simple subsurface descriptions the total error et from the error analysis is shown to be about 15 0 the step by step increase in oil recovery with time in fig 5 is because the injection is halted overnight during the treatment among many attempts made this study shows only two more cases as a high level summary of this optimization efforts i determining three new kh values still resulting in the same average kh 1 0 darcy keeping the same uniform ntg value of 0 33 to further reduce the error for better match fig 6 and ii determining three new ntg values depending on the depth by using the pre determined kh values in fig 6 to reduce the error even further fig 7 fig 6 a through c show the results to optimize three kh values the conditions specified for the optimization include the high kha ranging from 6 400 to 320 0 darcy the medium khb ranging from 1 600 to 80 00 darcy and the low khc calculated to make the geometric average becoming 1 0 darcy with the number of simulations runs 300 each of these 300 simulation runs sometimes called experiments has its own total error et calculated as shown in fig 6 d and the run expressed by the red symbol in fig 6 d is shown to be the case with a minimum et value of 10 0 providing kh values of kha 9 536 khb 1 600 and khc 0 256 darcies the red lines and numerous light colored lines in fig 6 a through c represent the optimum case in fig 6 with the minimum error of 10 0 and 299 other simulation runs respectively the symbols and the dark blue lines represent the field data and the simulation case from fig 5 respectively fig 6 d showing the errors from the 300 runs serves as a summary of runs associated with fig 6 a through c fig 7 a through c show the results to optimize three ntg values for vertical intervals such as simulation layer 1 0 z 0 3 m layer 2 to 5 0 3 z 1 5 m and layer 6 to 10 1 5 z 3 0 m among many possible choices this particular recommendation is made based on the field survey in that layer 1 is the interval above the groundwater table layer 2 5 is the interval with added foreign soils and compactions to make a solid foundation for the fuel distribution facilities and layer 6 10 is the interval with the original well compacted soils the conditions specified for the optimization include a uniform distribution within a lower limit ntg of 0 1 upper limit ntg of 1 0 and with the number of simulations run 300 fig 7 d presents these 300 simulation runs with et values calculated the optimum case expressed by the red lines in fig 7 shows a minimum et value of 8 0 providing ntg values of 0 581 0 302 and 0 289 for the upper middle and lower intervals respectively kh values are the same as those in fig 6 kha 9 536 khb 1 600 and khc 0 256 darcies note that the case of three k simulation runs is the optimum case shown in fig 6 note that the optimum kh and ntg values determined as shown in fig 7 may not be necessarily the optimum set of all possible input values providing the global minimum et but the set can be viewed as a very plausible one that can be used as a basis for the simulation evaluation of in situ remediation treatments as shown in the following sections 4 2 evaluation of surfactant foam processes by using the kh and ntg values in fig 7 the in situ remediation treatment with surfactant and foam is ready to be simulated fig 8 is the field data during the 23 days of operations 10 days of phase 1 next 10 days of phase 2 and last 3 days of phase 3 the yellow square marks with vertical red lines are the trend to match from the simulation in this study three values of mrf are used for this simulation effort mrf 100 as the base case following previous lab flow tests see type 3 experiments in gauglitz et al 2002 for similar tests with unconsolidated sands and mrf 10 and 500 to investigate the sensitivity of foam strength in the treatment previous studies show that mrf values depend on the absolute permeability of the medium as well as fluid saturations kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 but they are assumed to be identical in the simulations because of lacking laboratory data fig 9 a through d show the simulation results of the case of mrf 100 base case in terms of oil production rate cumulative oil production injection well bottomhole pressure and extraction well bottomhole pressure respectively fig 9 a seems to match the overall trend fig 8 of oil production quite well during phases 1 2 and 3 the injection pressure history fig 9 c is also consistent with qualitative field observations in that i the pressure increases during the injection period and declines during the shut in period and ii the middle injection well inj m shows higher injection pressure than the north and south wells inj n and inj s because it sits in between the pressure during the shut in period of surfactant injection first 20 days is a bit higher than that of foam injection last 3 days because of higher hydrostatic pressure of the surfactant solution in the well the extraction pressure fig 9 d is maintained near the atmospheric pressure during the shut in period and is a bit higher during the operation time due to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column and the presence of foams in the well fig 10 shows what happens in terms of oil saturation so during the entire process for layer 1 2 3 and 7 selected among the 10 layers at different operation days during phases 1 and 2 i e surfactant injection the oil seems to migrate horizontally and vertically too whenever it gets the opportunity to flow i e originally trapped by the capillary force but now mobilized by surfactant solution therefore the top layer layer 1 is the main layer for most of oil to be produced from day 10 through 20 it is observed that there is an influx of oil rising from the layers below during subsequent surfactant injection during phase 3 i e foam injection foam tends to sweep the top layer more uniformly overcoming the permeability differences it is interesting to see part of the oil in the top layer during foam injection is pushed down to the lower layer eg layer 2 as foams preferentially occupy the top layer similarly figs 11 and 12 show the case of mrf 10 i e lower strength foams compared to the base case while figs 13 and 14 show the case of mrf 500 i e higher strength foam compared to the base case in terms of oil production histories and oil saturation distributions compared with the field history in figs 8 11 a with mrf 10 underestimates but fig 13 a with mrf 500 overestimates the oil production rate such an aspect is also reflected by the oil saturation maps in figs 12 and 14 i e less effective vs more effective sweep with lower vs higher mrf respectively note that mrf 500 is viewed as an extreme just for simulation purpose as it is too high to achieve in the field table 1 summarizes the simulation results of these three cases with more details including oil production from each extraction well for the entire 23 days of period the amount of oil recovered at the end of 23 days of operations are 0 2836 0 3008 and 0 3037 m3 for mrf 10 100 and 500 respectively these values correspond to 86 7 91 9 and 92 9 of oil recovery the original oil in place is 0 327 m3 the oil recovery of 91 9 of the base case following the trend observed from the field data shows that the surfactant foam remediation treatment in this study is very successful overall this specific surfactant solution seems very effective in reducing capillary trapping of the contaminants during phases 1 and 2 and creating foams strong enough to improve the sweep efficiency the upward migration of the contaminant during the operation is another benefit in this field 4 3 evaluation of other remediation scenarios in addition to the base case scenario i e 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of foam injection with mrf 100 figs 9 and 10 that was applied in the field other scenarios have also been considered during the designing phase among many this study takes the following scenarios into consideration for simulation efforts scenario 1 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of gas water co injection scenario 2 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of alternating injection of foam and surfactant foam 1 day surfactant 1 day foam 1 day scenario 3 20 days of surfactant injection followed by 3 days of alternating injection of foam and surfactant foam 2 days surfactant 1 day and scenario 4 23 days of surfactant injection in all of these attempts the same total injection rate qt 2 30 m3 day is maintained for each injection well except for the first 200 min with additional tracer solution as before when foams are used foam quality of 80 i e the gas fraction fg 0 80 and mrf 100 are applied to keep consistency figs 15 and 16 show the simulation results of scenario 1 in which gas and water are injected together during the last 3 days without forming foams the cumulative oil recovered at the end of 23 days is about 0 2804 m3 which is equivalent to 85 7 of oil recovery note 91 9 recovery from the base case figs 9 and 10 as expected a simple gas and water co injection without foaming and thus without mobility control tends to show a poorer sweep leading to lower oil recovery the distribution of oil phase in layer 1 on day 22 in fig 16 exhibits another interesting behavior that is the gas phase without mobility control breaks through quickly pushing the oil phase out of the treatment area i e the square shaped area that is formed by connecting 6 injection and extraction wells which of course should be avoided in in situ remediation treatments figs 17 and 18 show the simulation results of scenario 2 in which foam and surfactant injections are alternated during the last 3 days foam surfactant and foam each with 1 day injection the results show the cumulative oil production of 0 3012 m3 and recovery percentage of 92 1 which is quite comparable to 91 9 recovery of the base case 3 day foam injection with mrf 100 figs 9 and 10 because of more surfactant chemical costs involved by injecting surfactant for a full day this scenario seems inferior to the base case figs 19 and 20 show the simulation results of scenario 3 in which foam and surfactant injections are alternated during the last 3 days foam 2 days and surfactant 1 day the results show a superior performance to scenario 2 recovering 0 3022 m3 of oil equivalent to the recovery percentage of 92 4 comparing the outcomes from the base case scenario 2 and scenario 3 provides a useful insight into surfactant foam remediation processes that is a careful selection of fluid injection strategy can indeed make a meaningful difference in field treatments figs 21 and 22 show the simulation results of scenario 4 in which only surfactant injections are continued for the entire 23 days the results show a total oil recovery of 0 2931 m3 or 89 6 scenarios 4 seems not only inferior to the cases with foams i e the base case scenario 2 and scenario 3 in terms of oil recovery but also causes difficulties by pushing the oil of the treatment area similar to gas water injection in scenario 1 scenarios 1 and 4 may well suffer from such a behavior because the process does not have the ability to overcome the permeability contrast table 2 summarizes the results of these four scenarios with more details including oil production from each extraction well for the entire 23 days the amount of oil recovery at the end of 23 days of operations are 0 2804 0 3012 0 3022 and 0 2931 m3 for scenarios 1 through 4 respectively these values correspond to 85 7 92 1 92 4 and 89 6 of oil recovery this outcome shows that i surfactant injection is a useful means of remediating subsurface contaminants in in situ remediation and ii using surfactant foam processes further improves the sweep efficiency in the field trials 5 discussions this simulation study uses a fixed value of mrf mrf 1 10 and 500 for example to represent foam rheology during the process assuming an instantaneous attainment of local equilibrium status because of interrupted fluid injection i e 9 h of active injection followed by 15 h shut in per day foam texture during the overnight shut in period may change such a transient behavior is not expected to alter the outcomes of this study significantly because earlier foam generation studies show experimentally and theoretically that the near steady state mrf values are obtained quickly as the injection resumes at even harsher conditions such as high temperature and high brine concentration kam et al 2007 also related discussions in gauglitz et al 2002 and kam and rossen 2003 more details on the in situ bubble creation and coalescence can be found in the literature kovscek and radke 1994 rossen 1996 szafranski et al 1998 together with the prediction of foam propagation distance using bubble population balance model izadi and kam 2019 izadi and kam 2018 dynamic foam simulations may help design and predict the process where the transient behavior is of high importance kovscek and radke 1994 kam 2008 one may find it odd that the oil recovery at the end of surfactant only injection day 20 is slightly different depending on mrf values applied as shown in table 1 which is also reflected by figs 10 12 and 14 the difference is caused by the mobility of the gas phase in the top layer i e the unsaturated 0 3 m vadose zone with sg 5 even though the magnitude is not really significant in terms of gas transport due to low gas saturation the change in gas phase mobility does contribute to the transport of all phases in the top layer allowing oil to flow more mrf 10 100 or 500 or less mrf 1 easily relatively these simulation results also reflect foam physics correctly because such a trapping mechanism of gas bubbles in the presence of surfactant solution is a part of the transport mechanism of the gas phase in situ 6 conclusions this study investigates surfactant foam assisted in situ shallow subsurface remediation processes to recover lnapl contaminants from a site within the military base in south korea the pilot test performed in the treatment area of 5 m 5 m with 3 m depth with 3 injection wells and 3 extraction wells during 23 days of surfactant tween80 and foam injections is matched by computer simulations this study can be summarized with the following conclusions by using the pattern of subsurface heterogeneity determined by the previous study both optimization techniques and error analysis employed in this study can help select the distributions of permeability and net to gross values leading to less errors down to 8 in terms of matching oil production history the simulation can successfully predict the performance of 23 days of surfactant foam processes 20 days of surfactant and 3 days of foam injection as observed in the field the use of gas phase mobility reduction factor mrf 100 as identified in separate lab tests is shown to recover about 91 of contaminants from the site which is consistent with the field pilot test other possible scenarios are also examined including gas water injection and surfactant only injection with no foams as well as alternating foams and surfactant solutions this study finds that the use of foams is a crucial component to control gas mobility and overcome
