12975,the anthropogenic emission of boron to the environment has posed a serious risk to human and animal health due to its non biodegradability and the resulting accumulation in the body bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed has been proven to be an economical and effective process to remove and recover boron from wastewater in this work we verified multiple process parameters to evaluate the efficiency of boron removal and recovery using intermittent and continuous bmed modes higher initial boron concentrations appeared to reduce the boron processing rate but this reduction may be ameliorated by increasing current density similarly higher initial ph was observed to retard the removal rate of boron with increasing mass transfer rate when solution ph was controlled from 9 5 to 10 5 and the current density was 6 36 a m2 under maximum allowable voltage of 12 v boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98 6 and 86 5 respectively during the ph control process current variation pattern indicated that current density was associated with initial boron concentrations in salt apartment when the current variation pattern was applied to a five cycle sequential feed batch bmed process it accurately reflected the timing of complete boron removal and recovery on a batch fill and draw process the overall boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98 53 and 81 2 respectively with an energy consumption of 31 5 wh g under these conditions the final boron concentrations in effluent were less than 10 mg l as required by the taiwan environmental protection administration epa overall bmed is a cost effective treatment process for boron containing wastewater the proposed process indicator reflecting sequential bmed process progression based on process information will further elucidate the automatic process control in industrial applications graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords boron separation boron recycling bmed wastewater treatment sequential feed batch process 1 introduction the trace mineral boron is naturally widespread at relatively low concentrations in the environment and is an essential micronutrient for plant animal and human health 1 boron can also originate from various anthropogenic activities such as the manufacture of glass and ceramics semiconductors insecticides fertilizers and detergents potentially impacting local water bodies 2 boron compounds are generally antimicrobial and difficult to biodegrade or treat due to their complexity and dynamic interactions with various environmental factors 3 therefore discharging boron associated compounds into the environment may pose threats to regional ecosystems specifically boric acid b oh 3 is a weak acid pka 9 14 with the tetrahydroxyborate b oh 4 ions dominant under alkaline conditions ph 9 14 in some cases boron concentrations up to 100 mg l are detected in the aforementioned anthropogenic discharges and can be higher in agricultural effluent or sewage 4 although boron serves an essential role in metabolism and calcium utilization in humans and animals long term intake of excess boron through drinking water can pose deleterious effects on humans and animals 2 the world health organization who and the european union eu have established a health based guideline of 0 5 mg l and 1 mg l respectively for boron in drinking water 5 6 however higher boron concentrations can be found in industrial and wastewater effluents the taiwan environmental protection administration taiwan epa has set the effluent standard for boron in wastewater at 1 mg l 7 and up to 10 mg l in boron related industries 8 to protect regional environmental and human health from exposure to elevated levels of boron in drinking and irrigation waters reducing the levels of boron compounds in industrial wastewater is critical before discharging effluents into the environment consequently increased research efforts have been devoted to boron removal in wastewater using advanced technologies 9 advanced technologies that remove boron include ion exchange 10 reverse osmosis 11 adsorption 12 13 on metal hydroxides 14 15 and solvent extraction 16 however most of these methods tend to be uneconomical and unsustainable due to their specific disadvantages 17 adsorption is likely to produce large amounts of sludge drastically increasing landfilling and land application requirements the processes of solvent extraction and ion exchange and the use of commercial resins require relatively large acid and alkali consumption in addition most boron absorbents exhibit limited surface area lower chemical and thermal stability and are expensive 18 while membrane methods such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration and polymer enhanced ultrafiltration and membrane distillation appeared to be effective technologies for boron removal specific issues present substantial challenges to their practical application 19 22 for example a high ph range must be maintained for higher boron rejection 23 moreover hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxides were observed to precipitate on the membrane surface 24 increasing energy requirements to draw water through the membrane and necessitating high cost membrane replacement if precipitation is irreversible a combination of sorption system and membrane filtration is usually necessary electrodialysis ed has been considered an alternative method for boron removal 25 however the degree of boron removal is highly dependent on solution ph to overcome this challenge bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed as a combined technology of electric field enhanced water dissociation in bipolar membranes bpms and the separation in conventional eds was adopted for boron removal briefly boric acids in wastewater dissociate to form borate ions by reacting with hydroxide ions oh boric ions can penetrate through the anion exchange membranes aems to acid compartments for separation and recovery the cations e g sodium na also migrate through the cation exchange membranes cems to the base compartments permitting corresponding base recovery next the borate ions react with protons h to form boric acid in the concentrated compartments while ed uses ion exchange membranes to separate ions from salts bpms provide h and oh that convert anions and cations into acids and bases by a water splitting reaction that does not require additional chemicals a previous study indicated that the operation cost using a single pass bmed to regenerate 35 hydrochloric acid hcl and 99 sodium hydroxide naoh from dilute waste salt solutions was significantly less than the commercial cost in bulk quantities 26 similar applications of bmed process on resource recycling can be found in many studies 27 31 consequently bmed has been widely applied for boron removal and recovery as a sustainable and environmentally friendly method 32 34 given that boron is relatively scarce on earth bmed has proven to be economical and effective for boron removal and recovery bunani et al 32 35 investigated simultaneous separation and recovery of lithium and boron from aqueous solution using bmed with 10 three chamber units the authors found that the performance of bmed increased with an increase in applied voltage but decreased with an increase in initial sample volume while alkaline conditions improved separation and recovery of boron and lithium excessive oh can limit recovery of boron and lithium over time due to their high mobility furthermore the applied voltage was directly proportional to the specific power consumption and mass transfer rate but inversely proportional to the current efficiency 35 despite the simultaneous permeation of na and chloride cl the effect of these co existing ions on bmed performance was negligible 35 36 simultaneous removal and recovery of boron from wastewater in a series of batch processes was accomplished using a multi step procedure developed by noguchi et al 34 the authors showed that boron concentrations in the concentrate were at most five times higher than the initial boron concentrations in the feed compartment 34 despite this advancement optimal operation conditions of bmed process for boron removal and recovery from wastewater still remain relatively understudied no effort has yet been made to optimize the process parameters of bmed process such as include applied current initial sample concentrations and ph from the engineering point of view more research is warranted to comprehensively evaluate multiple parameters while achieving optimal boron removal and energy consumption in this work multiple experiments using the economical bmed process in boron removal and recovery were performed to evaluate its feasibility and performance in batch and continuous modes first a batch mode was used to evaluate the effect of process parameters on boron removal and recovery efficiencies from wastewater these parameters include applied current initial sample concentrations and ph within a fixed bmed system in the context of current efficiency and power consumption second a sequential and continuous feed batch system was evaluated in the context of current efficiency and power consumption with final boron concentrations below the regulated taiwan epa regulation limit in wastewater or industrial effluent for engineering purposes a bmed process in a sequential feed batch continuous operation using controllable variables such ph or applied current was preferable than laborious boron analysis therefore process information and influential indicators reflecting the progress of bmed operation were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed cell apparatus the electrodialysis experiments were

units and electrodes the anode and cathode were ru ir coated ti stretched metal the flow process is shown fig 1 where each compartment contained approximately 1 l of solutions with circulation rates of 0 6 l min the electrode rinsing solution 1 l of 0 5 v v naoh was circulated in the electrode compartment the experiments were conducted with various current applied voltage and compositions of feed acid and base compartment solution used the solutions in the acid and base compartments were 0 01 v v and 0 43 v v naoh respectively feed salt compartment include 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v sulfuric acid h2so4 0 43 boric acid b oh 3 and mixtures of 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 21 v v naoh and 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v h2so4 all reagents were analytical grade and obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa aqueous solutions of h2so4 or naoh were used to adjust solution ph which was determined by a digital ph meter suntex ts 1 taiwan the bmed system operated for 2 h and samples were collected from feed and acid compartments every 20 min for further analyses boron concentrations were determined using azomethine h method 37 38 preparation of azomethine h solution buffer solution boron standard solutions and analyzed solutions in cuvettes is briefly described as follow 1 azomethine h solution was prepared from dissolving 3 8 g azomethine h and 8 g l ascorbic acid with 1 l deionized water 2 buffer solution was made by adding 500 g ammonium acetate and filling with 1 l deionized water 3 boron standard solutions were prepared by diluting from 100 mg l boric acid solutions with deionized water into five boron standard solutions 0 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l and 4 analyzed solutions in cuvettes were filled with 3 5 ml boron standard solutions or samples followed by 0 5 ml 0 0025 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution 2 5 ml azomethine h solution and 1 ml buffer solution and allowed to stand for 2 h boron concentrations were analyzed in triplicate by the uv vis spectrophotometer hitachi u 2900 hitachi high technologies co kyoto japan with the absorbance at 420 nm mean boron concentrations were determined by averaging triplicate measurements for each collected sample since the triplicate variability was 5 of the mean error bars error bars were not demonstrated in graphs all reagents above were analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa calibration curves were constructed throughout each day of testing using five boron standard solutions 0 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l with an average r2 of 0 999 the bmed unit was flushed thoroughly with deionized water after each experimental run with water electrical resistance measured to examine fouling situations however membrane fouling is unlikely to occur because no organics and divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium ions were added meanwhile the acid cleaning protocol was also performed every ten run by soaking the membranes in 1 w w hydrochloric acid solution for 3 h with an agitation speed of 50 r min at ambient temperature as described previously 39 2 2 calculating power consumption and current efficiency the power consumption e c wh g and current efficiency η for boron removal and recovery were calculated to assess bmed performance the power consumption e c wh g is the total energy requirement associated with bmed process for boron removal and recovery 40 as shown in eq 1 1 e c σ u i t 3600 c af v al m where u is the applied voltage across the bmed system i is the electric current a t is the time interval from time 0 to t s c af is the boron concentration in the acid compartment at time t mol m3 v al is the volume of the acid compartment m3 and m is the molecular weight of boric acid g mol the current efficiency η is defined as the ratio

evaluation and characterization in the bmed unit ions migrate from one solution in a compartment to another under the influence of electrical potential between electrodes the rate of this process is known for its high association with both electrical current and mass transfer rates ions encounter a series of mass transfer resistances including those from the boundary films between the bulk solution and the membranes and internal membranes during migration because mass transfer resistance may limit current density and mass transfer rates porous spacers were incorporated into the membranes to alter the character of boundary layers leading to turbulent flow patterns for solution recirculation in the compartments as previously suggested 40 the types of compartment solutions also play a significant role in mass transfer rates it is essential to understand the relationship between the electric current and the applied voltage in different compartment solutions given that a higher electric current is significantly associated with ions migration we examined the effect of different feed compartment solutions on the change of electric current and applied voltage the applied solutions in the acid and base compartments were 0 01 v v naoh and 0 43 v v naoh respectively the applied solutions and their concentrations in the feed salt compartments were 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 21 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v b oh 3 and deionized water the results demonstrated that as voltage varied every 30 s the electric current had the highest increase rate in 0 43 v v naoh followed by 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 and 0 21 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 fig 2a in contrast no obvious electric current change was observed in non ionic b oh 3 and water implying the h and oh ions in those solutions are relatively less mobile than in other solutions with the addition of non ionic b oh 3 rates of electric current increase for the acidic mixture of 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 b oh 3 v v and basic mixture of 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 but they were relatively lower than those in 0 43 v v naoh and 0 43 v v h2so4 in this case the 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 solution was selected as the feed compartment solution due to the favorable dissociation of b oh 3 into b oh 4 meanwhile maintaining b oh 4 ions at higher concentrations under alkaline conditions is essential since the electric currents are strongly associated with ion concentrations the effect of different solution ph in acid compartments was also evaluated electric currents in feed solution ph of 4 9 and 10 were lower than when the solution ph was 11 and 12 fig 2b therefore 0 01 v v naoh was chosen as an acid compartment solution to maintain a high level of b oh 4 ions after the compartment solution was chosen a preliminary process examination was conducted to observe the current variation under constant voltages of 10 v and 12 v fig 2c the highest electric current under constant voltages of 10 v and 12 v were 0 3 a and 0 37 a respectively the electric current started to decrease after 90 min due to relatively low ion concentrations compared to previous works 32 35 36 41 lower voltages and currents in the bmed process were achieved with selected compartment solutions and optimized flow pattern design for lower mass transfer resistance the power consumption in the present work was also expected to be lower for boron removal and recovery from wastewater 3 2 effect of initial concentrations and ph on boron removal the effect of various initial boron concentrations on the boron removals over time was investigated four different initial boron concentrations ca 680 330 150 5 and 33 mg b l were tested concomitantly with ph monitoring based on previous works 32 35 41 the results indicated that boron concentrations in the acid compartment increased relatively stably and approached saturation after 100 min especially in the experiment when the initial concentration was 680 mg b l fig 3a the boron removal rate was higher when the initial boron concentration was 680 mg b l than 330 150 5 and 33 mg b l in the first 60 min fig 3b this was probably due to the competitive effect between oh and borate ions according to bunani et al 32 high oh concentrations ph 12 5 can retard boron transfer rates the retarding effect reduced when initial boron concentrations were higher leading to higher competition and vice versa fig 3a and b boron molecules in the acid compartment across all treatments started to recover substantially after 60 min fig 3a the substantial increase of boron concentrations in the acid compartment occurred simultaneously with the decrease of ph when borate ions migrated to acid compartments the feed compartment solution ph largely decreased non ionic b oh 3 molecules became dominant when the solution ph was lower than the pka and limited ion diffusion between compartments final boron concentrations in the feed compartment were 58 and 30 mg b l after 100 min with initial boron concentrations of 680 and 330 mg b l respectively fig 3b this may be explained by the decreasing solution ph to 9 24 and 9 09 after 100 min resulting in similar pka and low ion transfer nonetheless final boron concentrations in the salt compartment with initial boron concentrations of 150 5 and 33 mg b l continued to drop after 100 min when ph was 9 90 and 9 77 higher than pka reaching 10 and 1 7 mg b l at 120 min respectively these values are acceptable according to the taiwan epa effluent standards 10 mg l for boron associated industries 8 and the who drinking water requirement of 2 4 mg l 6 respectively feed compartment ph appeared to reflect the progress of borate transfer from feed compartment to acid compartment a trade off between ion competition and ion transfer rates indicated an optimal ph ranging from 9 14 to 11 5 hereafter we chose a ph of 9 5 10 5 fig 3c yet feed compartment ph cannot estimate boron concentrations in wastewater effluent an initial boron concentration of 680 mg b l was adopted to study the effect of solution ph on power consumption and current efficiency due to its high removal rate the results indicated that power consumptions and current efficiency were 43 8 26 0 24 58 and 24 58 wh g and 43 1 74 3 78 8 and 82 8 corresponding to ph values of 12 4 11 8 11 0 and 10 11 respectively fig 4 as the ph changed from 12 4 to 10 11 power consumption decreased by 43 19 and current efficiency increased by 92 11 suggesting that maintaining solution ph approximately 10 11 is highly energy efficient keeping ph higher than the pka was essential during operation along with meeting wastewater discharge regulations 3 3 effect of applied current density and initial boron concentrations we investigated the effect of current density on boron removal and recovery efficiencies under the maximum applied voltage of 12 v at a ph of 9 5 to 10 5 to retain high removal efficiency and low power consumption of bmed fig 2c the current of 0 4 a 0 35 a 0 30 a and 0 25 was examined the results indicated that both boron removal and recovery efficiencies were correlated with the electric current densities fig 5 higher current densities led to higher diffusion rates for ionic species such as oh and b oh 4 toward the concentrate compartment the fitted linear relationships between ln c c0 and time of bmed experimental data using fick s law showed that the mass transfer coefficients were 2 75 10 6 m s 2 68 10 6 m s 2 15 10 6 m s and 1 97 10 6 m s for current of 0 40 a 0 35 a 0 30 a and 0 25 a respectively graph not shown the boron removals and recoveries increased with increasing current densities in the salt and acid compartments reaching recoveries of 83 0 86 5 84 6 and 83 2 and removal efficiencies of 98 6 98 6 98 5 and 98 4 at current densities of 7 27 6 36 5 45 and 4 55 a m2 respectively the minor discrepancies between removals and recoveries of boron may be due to the retention or diffusion of boron molecules in membranes or through membranes into base compartments in such cases boron diffusion through the bipolar membrane ranged from 2 0 to 6 0 depending on current densities meanwhile power consumption 26 25 23 and 22 wh g decreased significantly with increasing current density 4 55 5 45 6 36 and 7 27 a cm2 with a current efficiency up to 80 fig 5 variation of current density during bmed operation corresponding to boron concentrations was also observed which supported observations depicted in fig 2 the current density initially reached the highest value and decreased gradually as the boron concentrations in the feed compartment decreased which is most likely due to high mass transfer resistances through membranes caused by boron depletion in the salt compartment the current density may also serve as an indicator that reflects boron removal progress namely current that approaches zero during bmed operation signifies relatively low boron concentrations in the salt compartment and can be used as the experimental endpoint indicator the effect of initial boron concentrations higher than 670 mg b l with a fixed solution ph range between 9 5 and 10 5 was further assessed using boron concentrations of 4700 3200 1725 960 and 670 mg b l the experiment was conducted where initial boron concentrations were similar to levels in boron containing wastewater 4 when the current density of 6 36 a cm2 and the maximum allowable voltage of 12 v were adopted the initial boron concentrations in the salt compartment were negatively correlated with the boron removal and recovery efficiencies fig 6 boron removal and recovery efficiencies exhibited steep and linear relationships with time at the initial phase in all initial boron concentrations and leveled off at the end of the experiment this observation supported our preliminary findings that retarding effect was negatively associated with initial boron concentrations as mentioned earlier when the bmed process was nearly completed the final boron concentrations in effluents were found to meet the taiwan epa regulation requirement 10 mg l despite an initial concentration up to 4700 mg b l highlighting the bmed system to treat such high concentrations of boron laden wastewater particularly under the current density of 6 36 a cm2 borate ions are able to overcome mass transfer resistance between salt and acid compartments meanwhile the current variation pattern accurately reflected the experimental endpoint with high initial boron concentrations which may inform improved design strategies for sequential bmed feed batch operation since it is possible that boron concentrations in the acid compartment were higher than the feed compartment 35 3 4 sequential feed batch operation a sequential feed batch trial was performed to investigate the feasibility of continuous boron removal by the bmed batch process using current profile as an indicator for feed and draw cycle based on previously optimized parameters current density 6 36 a cm2 and maximum allowable applied voltage 12 v the salt compartment was filled with a batch of boron containing solution c0 612 mg b l while boron concentrations and current were monitored during bmed operation the recovered boron concentrations in the acid compartment initially increased linearly with time then became relatively stable when boron concentrations significantly dropped to 7 mg b l in the salt compartment the current was relatively low the experiment was repeated for five batches sequentially using the current variation pattern as a feed and draw cycle time indicator fig 7 constant boron removal within each bmed batch was observed leading to an average removal efficiency of 98 6 a final recovered boron concentration of 2655 mg b l the average recovery efficiency current efficiency and power consumption were 81 2 61 4 and 31 5 wh g respectively boron concentrations in the second third fourth and fifth operation stages dropped from 626 to 9 78 mg b l 750 to 9 73 mg b l 610 to 10 mg b l and 674 to 9 5 mg b l respectively in the meantime the current variation pattern proved to be a suitable indicator of the fill and draw cycle time more specifically relatively low current can signify treatment completion and the availability of the bmed process for the next batch according to fill and draw cycles 4 conclusion bmed with a three compartment configuration was used to remove and recover boric acid from boron containing wastewater first a bmed system was evaluated to identify appropriate compartment solutions the effect of ph initial boron concentration and current density was investigated higher ph was observed to retard the transfer of tetrahydroxyborate ion b oh 4 from the salt compartment to the concentrate compartment maintaining solution ph higher than pka was also crucial given that the operation is more energy efficient while also meeting the boron wastewater requirement in high boron containing wastewater when the solution ph was controlled between 9 5 and 10 5 the boron removal and recovery increased with increasing current density in contrast boron removal and the recovery rate appeared to decrease with increasing initial boron concentration we also observed a current variation pattern during the bmed process which was subsequently applied to its sequential feed batch process it was proven successful for timely feed and draw cycles during bmed sequential feed batch processes under maximum allowable working voltage of 12 v after five consecutive batch runs we achieved an average removal efficiency of 98 6 average recovery efficiency of 81 2 current efficiency of 61 4 and power consumption of 31 5 wh g bmed was effective for boron removal and recovery from boron laden wastewater using intermittent and continuous modes all treated synthetic wastewater by the bmed system met the taiwan epa boron wastewater requirement moreover this work provided unique insight into sequential feed batch bmed processes in which batch process endpoints can be identified by the current profile however additional feasibility studies such as large scale or field scale of boron treatment are required for further industrial applications declaration of competing interest the

efficiency of boron removal and recovery using intermittent and continuous bmed modes higher initial boron concentrations appeared to reduce the boron processing rate but this reduction may be ameliorated by increasing current density similarly higher initial ph was observed to retard the removal rate of boron with increasing mass transfer rate when solution ph was controlled from 9 5 to 10 5 and the current density was 6 36 a m2 under maximum allowable voltage of 12 v boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98 6 and 86 5 respectively during the ph control process current variation pattern indicated that current density was associated with initial boron concentrations in salt apartment when the current variation pattern was applied to a five cycle sequential feed batch bmed process it accurately reflected the timing of complete boron removal and recovery on a batch fill and draw process the overall boron removal and recovery efficiencies were 98 53 and 81 2 respectively

removal and energy consumption in this work multiple experiments using the economical bmed process in boron removal and recovery were performed to evaluate its feasibility and performance in batch and continuous modes first a batch mode was used to evaluate the effect of process parameters on boron removal and recovery efficiencies from wastewater these parameters include applied current initial sample concentrations and ph within a fixed bmed system in the context of current efficiency and power consumption second a sequential and continuous feed batch system was evaluated in the context of current efficiency and power consumption with final boron concentrations below the regulated taiwan epa regulation limit in wastewater or industrial effluent for engineering purposes a bmed process in a sequential feed batch continuous operation using controllable variables such ph or applied current was preferable than laborious boron analysis therefore process information and influential indicators reflecting the progress of bmed operation were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 bipolar membrane electrodialysis bmed cell apparatus the electrodialysis experiments were

units and electrodes the anode and cathode were ru ir coated ti stretched metal the flow process is shown fig 1 where each compartment contained approximately 1 l of solutions with circulation rates of 0 6 l min the electrode rinsing solution 1 l of 0 5 v v naoh was circulated in the electrode compartment the experiments were conducted with various current applied voltage and compositions of feed acid and base compartment solution used the solutions in the acid and base compartments were 0 01 v v and 0 43 v v naoh respectively feed salt compartment include 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v sulfuric acid h2so4 0 43 boric acid b oh 3 and mixtures of 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 21 v v naoh and 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v h2so4 all reagents were analytical grade and obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa aqueous solutions of h2so4 or naoh were used to adjust solution ph which was determined by a digital ph meter suntex ts 1 taiwan the bmed system operated for 2 h and samples were collected from feed and acid compartments every 20 min for further analyses boron concentrations were determined using azomethine h method 37 38 preparation of azomethine h solution buffer solution boron standard solutions and analyzed solutions in cuvettes is briefly described as follow 1 azomethine h solution was prepared from dissolving 3 8 g azomethine h and 8 g l ascorbic acid with 1 l deionized water 2 buffer solution was made by adding 500 g ammonium acetate and filling with 1 l deionized water 3 boron standard solutions were prepared by diluting from 100 mg l boric acid solutions with deionized water into five boron standard solutions 0 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l and 4 analyzed solutions in cuvettes were filled with 3 5 ml boron standard solutions or samples followed by 0 5 ml 0 0025 m ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta solution 2 5 ml azomethine h solution and 1 ml buffer solution and allowed to stand for 2 h boron concentrations were analyzed in triplicate by the uv vis spectrophotometer hitachi u 2900 hitachi high technologies co kyoto japan with the absorbance at 420 nm mean boron concentrations were determined by averaging triplicate measurements for each collected sample since the triplicate variability was 5 of the mean error bars error bars were not demonstrated in graphs all reagents above were analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa calibration curves were constructed throughout each day of testing using five boron standard solutions 0 2 5 5 0 10 and 20 mg l with an average r2 of 0 999 the bmed unit was flushed thoroughly with deionized water after each experimental run with water electrical resistance measured to examine fouling situations however membrane fouling is unlikely to occur because no organics and divalent ions such as calcium and magnesium ions were added meanwhile the acid cleaning protocol was also performed every ten run by soaking the membranes in 1 w w hydrochloric acid solution for 3 h with an agitation speed of 50 r min at ambient temperature as described previously 39 2 2 calculating power consumption and current efficiency the power consumption e c wh g and current efficiency η for boron removal and recovery were calculated to assess bmed performance the power consumption e c wh g is the total energy requirement associated with bmed process for boron removal and recovery 40

evaluation and characterization in the bmed unit ions migrate from one solution in a compartment to another under the influence of electrical potential between electrodes the rate of this process is known for its high association with both electrical current and mass transfer rates ions encounter a series of mass transfer resistances including those from the boundary films between the bulk solution and the membranes and internal membranes during migration because mass transfer resistance may limit current density and mass transfer rates porous spacers were incorporated into the membranes to alter the character of boundary layers leading to turbulent flow patterns for solution recirculation in the compartments as previously suggested 40 the types of compartment solutions also play a significant role in mass transfer rates it is essential to understand the relationship between the electric current and the applied voltage in different compartment solutions given that a higher electric current is significantly associated with ions migration we examined the effect of different feed compartment solutions on the change of electric current and applied voltage the applied solutions in the acid and base compartments were 0 01 v v naoh and 0 43 v v naoh respectively the applied solutions and their concentrations in the feed salt compartments were 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 21 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v b oh 3 and deionized water the results demonstrated that as voltage varied every 30 s the electric current had the highest increase rate in 0 43 v v naoh followed by 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 v v b oh 3 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 and 0 21 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 fig 2a in contrast no obvious electric current change was observed in non ionic b oh 3 and water implying the h and oh ions in those solutions are relatively less mobile than in other solutions with the addition of non ionic b oh 3 rates of electric current increase for the acidic mixture of 0 43 v v h2so4 0 43 b oh 3 v v and basic mixture of 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 but they were relatively lower than those in 0 43 v v naoh and 0 43 v v h2so4 in this case the 0 43 v v naoh 0 43 v v b oh 3 solution was selected as the feed compartment solution due to the favorable dissociation of b oh 3 into b oh 4 meanwhile maintaining b oh 4 ions at higher concentrations under alkaline conditions is essential since the electric currents are strongly associated with ion concentrations the effect of different solution ph in acid compartments was also evaluated electric currents in feed solution ph of 4 9 and 10 were lower than when the solution ph was 11 and 12 fig 2b therefore 0 01 v v naoh was chosen as an acid compartment solution to maintain a high level of b oh 4 ions after the compartment solution was chosen a preliminary process examination was conducted to observe the current variation under constant voltages of 10 v and 12 v fig 2c the highest electric current under constant voltages of 10 v and 12 v were 0 3 a and 0 37 a respectively the electric current started to decrease after 90 min due to relatively low ion concentrations compared to previous works 32 35 36 41 lower voltages and currents in the bmed process were achieved with selected compartment solutions and optimized flow pattern design for lower mass transfer resistance the power consumption in the present work was also expected to be lower for boron removal and recovery from wastewater 3 2 effect of initial concentrations and ph on boron removal the effect of various initial boron concentrations on the boron removals over time was investigated four different initial boron concentrations ca 680 330 150 5 and 33 mg b l were tested concomitantly with ph monitoring based on previous works 32 35 41 the results indicated that boron concentrations in the acid compartment increased relatively stably and approached saturation after 100 min especially in the experiment when the initial concentration was 680 mg b l fig 3a the boron removal rate was higher when the initial boron concentration was 680 mg b l than 330 150 5 and 33 mg b l in the first 60 min fig 3b this was probably due to the competitive effect between oh and borate ions according to bunani et al 32 high oh concentrations ph 12 5 can retard boron transfer rates the retarding effect reduced when initial boron concentrations were higher leading to higher competition and vice versa fig 3a and b boron molecules in the acid compartment across all treatments started to recover substantially after 60 min fig 3a the substantial increase of boron concentrations in the acid compartment occurred simultaneously with the decrease of ph when borate ions migrated to acid compartments the feed compartment solution ph largely decreased non ionic b oh 3 molecules became dominant when the solution ph was lower than the pka and limited ion diffusion between compartments final boron concentrations in the feed compartment were 58 and 30 mg b l after 100 min with initial boron concentrations of 680 and 330 mg b l respectively fig 3b this may be explained by the decreasing solution ph to 9 24 and 9 09 after 100 min resulting in similar pka and low ion transfer nonetheless final boron concentrations in the salt compartment with initial boron concentrations of 150 5 and 33 mg b l continued to drop after 100 min when ph was 9 90 and 9 77 higher than pka reaching 10 and 1 7 mg b l at 120 min respectively these values are acceptable according to the taiwan epa effluent standards 10 mg l for boron associated industries 8 and the who drinking water requirement of 2 4 mg l 6 respectively feed compartment ph appeared to reflect the progress of borate transfer from feed compartment to acid compartment a trade off between ion competition and ion transfer rates indicated an optimal ph ranging from 9 14 to 11 5 hereafter we chose a ph of 9 5 10 5 fig 3c yet feed compartment ph cannot estimate boron concentrations in wastewater effluent an initial boron concentration of 680 mg b l was adopted to study the effect of solution ph on power consumption and current efficiency due to its high removal rate the results indicated that power consumptions and current efficiency were 43 8 26 0 24 58 and 24 58 wh g and 43 1 74 3 78 8 and 82 8 corresponding to ph values of 12 4 11 8 11 0 and 10 11 respectively fig 4 as the ph changed from 12 4 to 10 11 power consumption decreased by 43 19 and current efficiency increased by 92 11 suggesting that maintaining solution ph approximately 10 11 is highly energy efficient keeping ph higher than the pka was essential during operation along with meeting wastewater discharge regulations 3 3 effect of applied current density and initial boron concentrations we investigated the effect of current density on boron removal and recovery efficiencies under the maximum applied voltage of 12 v at a ph of 9 5 to 10 5 to retain high removal efficiency and low power consumption of bmed fig 2c the current of 0 4 a 0 35 a 0 30 a and 0 25 was examined the results indicated that both boron removal and recovery efficiencies were correlated with the electric current densities fig 5 higher current densities led to higher diffusion rates for ionic species such as oh and b oh 4 toward the concentrate compartment the fitted linear relationships between ln c c0 and time of bmed experimental data using fick s law showed that the mass transfer coefficients were 2 75 10 6 m s 2 68 10 6 m s 2 15 10 6 m s and 1 97 10 6 m s for current of 0 40 a 0 35 a 0 30 a and 0 25 a respectively graph not shown the boron removals and recoveries increased with increasing current densities in the salt and acid compartments reaching recoveries of 83 0 86 5 84 6 and 83 2 and removal efficiencies of 98 6 98 6 98 5 and 98 4 at current densities of 7 27 6 36 5 45 and 4 55 a m2 respectively the minor discrepancies between removals and recoveries of boron may be due to the retention or diffusion of boron molecules in membranes or through membranes into base compartments in such cases boron diffusion through the bipolar membrane ranged from 2 0 to 6 0 depending on current densities meanwhile power consumption 26 25 23 and 22 wh g decreased significantly with increasing current density 4 55 5 45 6 36 and 7 27 a cm2 with a current efficiency up to 80 fig 5 variation of current density during bmed operation corresponding to boron concentrations was also observed which supported observations depicted in fig 2 the current density initially reached the highest value and decreased gradually as the boron concentrations in the feed compartment decreased which is most likely due to high mass transfer resistances through membranes caused by boron depletion in the salt compartment the current density may also serve as an indicator that reflects boron removal progress namely current that approaches zero during bmed operation signifies relatively low boron concentrations in the salt compartment and can be used as the experimental endpoint indicator the effect of initial boron concentrations higher than 670 mg b l with a fixed solution ph range between 9 5 and 10 5 was further assessed using boron concentrations of 4700 3200 1725 960 and 670 mg b l the experiment was conducted where initial boron concentrations were similar to levels in boron containing wastewater 4 when the current density of 6 36 a cm2 and the maximum allowable voltage of 12 v were adopted the initial boron concentrations in the salt compartment were negatively correlated with the boron removal and recovery efficiencies fig 6 boron removal and recovery efficiencies exhibited steep and linear relationships with time at the initial phase in all initial boron concentrations and leveled off at the end of the experiment this observation supported our preliminary findings that retarding effect was negatively associated with initial boron concentrations as mentioned earlier when the bmed process was nearly completed the final boron concentrations in effluents were found to meet the taiwan epa regulation requirement 10 mg l despite an initial concentration up to 4700 mg b l highlighting the bmed system to treat such high concentrations of boron laden wastewater particularly under the current density of 6 36 a cm2 borate ions are able to overcome mass transfer resistance between salt and acid compartments meanwhile the current variation pattern accurately reflected the experimental endpoint with high initial boron concentrations which may inform improved design strategies for sequential bmed feed batch operation since it is possible that boron concentrations in the acid compartment were higher than the feed compartment 35 3 4 sequential feed batch operation a sequential feed batch trial was performed to investigate the feasibility of continuous boron removal by the bmed batch process using current profile as an indicator for feed and draw cycle based on previously optimized parameters current density 6 36 a cm2 and maximum allowable applied voltage 12 v the salt compartment was filled with a batch of boron containing solution c0 612 mg b l while boron concentrations and current were monitored during bmed operation the recovered boron concentrations in the acid compartment initially increased linearly with time then became relatively stable when boron concentrations significantly dropped to 7 mg b l in the salt compartment the current was relatively low the experiment was repeated for five batches sequentially using the current variation pattern as a feed and draw cycle time indicator fig 7 constant boron removal within each bmed batch was observed leading to an average removal efficiency of 98 6 a final recovered boron concentration of 2655 mg b l the average recovery efficiency current efficiency and power consumption were 81 2 61 4 and 31 5 wh g respectively boron concentrations in the second third fourth and fifth operation stages dropped from 626 to 9 78 mg b l 750 to 9 73 mg b l 610 to 10 mg b l and 674 to 9 5 mg b l respectively in the meantime the current variation pattern proved to be a suitable indicator of the fill and draw cycle time more specifically relatively low current can signify treatment completion and the availability of the bmed process for the next batch according to fill and draw cycles 4 conclusion bmed with a three compartment configuration was used to remove and recover boric acid from boron containing wastewater first a bmed system was evaluated to identify appropriate compartment solutions the effect of ph initial boron concentration and current density was investigated higher ph was observed to retard the transfer of tetrahydroxyborate ion b oh 4 from the salt compartment to the concentrate compartment maintaining solution ph higher than pka was also crucial given that the operation is more energy efficient while also meeting the boron wastewater requirement in high boron containing wastewater when the solution ph was controlled between 9 5 and 10 5 the boron removal and recovery increased with increasing current density in contrast boron removal and the recovery rate appeared to decrease with increasing initial boron concentration we also observed a current variation pattern during the bmed process which was subsequently applied to its sequential feed batch process it was proven successful for timely feed and draw cycles during bmed sequential feed batch processes under maximum allowable working voltage of 12 v after five consecutive batch runs we achieved an average removal efficiency of 98 6 average recovery efficiency of 81 2 current efficiency of 61 4 and power consumption of 31 5 wh g bmed was effective for boron removal and recovery from boron laden wastewater using intermittent and continuous modes all treated synthetic wastewater by the bmed system met the taiwan epa boron wastewater requirement moreover this work provided unique insight into sequential feed batch bmed processes in which batch process endpoints can be identified by the current profile however additional feasibility studies such as large scale or field scale of boron treatment are required for further industrial applications declaration of competing interest the

12976,new odour prevention strategies in wastewater treatment facilities need to be investigated to find effective and low cost technologies for the control of malodorous emissions in this study the potential of activated sludge as and oxidized nitrogen n nox recycling as an environmentally friendly and cost effective strategy for the prevention and minimization of odour nuisance during wastewater treatment was evaluated and optimized using h2s acetic acid and α pinene as model odorants in 2 1 l gas tight bottles this approach uses by products from wastewater treatment to mitigate odour annoyance preliminary abiotic tests showed headspace concentration losses of 25 for h2s and α pinene and 7 for acetic acid due to odorant adsorption in 4 h the experiments carried out at different concentrations of as 0 10 25 50 100 mg vss l and oxidized nitrogen 1 5 5 7 5 and 10 mg n nox l revealed an effective h2s removal at 7 5 10 mg n nox l and 50 100 mg vss l interestingly no3 was more effective than no2 as electron acceptor during the biodegradation of h2s regardless of the as concentration and n nox concentrations in the presence of dissolved h2s and as concentrations of 50 100 mg vss l acetic acid was partially metabolized by microorganisms at the end of experiment from 27 to 23 ppmv in 4 5 h while α pinene concentrations experienced a similar gradual decrease than in the abiotic tests finally the assays carried out at concentrations 5 mg no3 l and 25 mg vss l showed a reduction of no3 to no2 correlated with the biological oxidation of h2s which suggested the

volatile sulphur compounds 1 introduction nowadays the emissions of malodours represent one of the main concerns associated with wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the main cause of public environmental complaints in courts 1 in the last two decades the increase in the number of complaints from residents in adjacent areas to wwtps has resulted in the systematic evaluation of the odour impact derived from such facilities in this context the eu member states are enforcing wwtp operators to find cost effective strategies for the prevention and minimization of malodours during wastewater management 2 4 volatile sulphur compounds vscs and volatile organic compounds vocs rank among the most typical compounds that contribute to the wastewater management odour footprint 5 in particular hydrogen sulphide h2s and volatile fatty acids vfas emissions are the main responsible of odour nuisance in wwtps 6 7 h2s is a toxic compound generated from the biological reduction of sulphate so4 or thiosulfate under anaerobic conditions by sulphate reducing bacteria srb environmental parameters such as the concentration of sulphate dissolved oxygen biological oxygen demand ph temperature and retention time impact on h2s formation 8 on the other hand vfas are intermediate products from the anaerobic fermentation of easily biodegradable organic matter 9 a wide number of physical chemical methods have been previously tested and reported in literature to minimize the emission of vscs and vocs during wastewater treatment which include photocatalysis 10 the dosing of oxidizing agents 11 or chemical precipitation 12 however the high demand of energy and chemicals are important drawbacks of these conventional solutions in this context biological odour prevention methods have emerged as an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative for the minimization of odour pollution in wwtps the use of by products derived from wastewater treatment such as the recirculation to the headworks of nitrates derived from centrate oxidation and activated sludge as from the secondary settler can foster the adsorption and further oxidation of vscs and vocs in the raw wastewater more specifically activated sludge recycling asr consists of the recirculation of a fraction of waste activated sludge from the secondary clarification or mixed liquor of the nitrification tank to the wwtp headworks these activated sludge streams which contain a concentration of dissolved oxygen and volatile suspended solids of 2 3 mg o2 l and 4000 12 000 mg vss l respectively and a high microbial diversity can adsorb and biologically oxidize most biogenic dissolved odorous compounds e g sulphide volatile fatty acids in raw wastewater 13 similarly oxidized ammonium recycling oar consists of the recycling of residual streams rich in nitrate n no3 or nitrite n no2 to the wwtp headworks or upstream in the sewer system the addition of nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors to the influent wastewater promotes an in situ anoxic odorant oxidation 14 15 as n no3 and n no2 are typically not present in significant concentrations in raw domestic wastewater effluents with high nh4 concentration such as centrates from anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge could be nitrified and recycled to the plant headworks 16 despite the potential of these low cost odour prevention strategies has been successfully validated at pilot and full scale the fundamentals of these technologies remain largely unexplored this work aimed at evaluating the influence of the concentrations of fresh activated sludge nitrate and nitrite on the removal of h2s acetic acid and pinene here selected as model odorants this will set the fundamentals of asr and oar and help optimizing its use in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater in order to mimic the physico chemical characteristics and composition of a model urban wastewater a modified synthetic wastewater sw was prepared according to 17 as follows mg l in tap water 250 of glucose 110 of meat extract 160 of casein peptone 30 of nh2coh2 7 of nacl 4 of cacl2 2h2o 2 of mgso4 7h2o 112 of k2hpo4 3h2o 0 5 of cucl2 2h2o and 1100 of nahco3 the physico chemical characterization of the sw was carried out according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 18 19 the initial ph was 8 1 0 1 2 2 chemical odorants the model odorous compounds used in this study were hydrogen sulphide h2s acetic acid c2h4o2 and α pinene c10h16 h2s was supplied in a gas cylinder manufactured by linde spain at 22 in n2 acetic acid with a level of purity over 99 9 was purchased from panreac applichem spain and α pinene was acquired with a purity level of 98 from sigma aldrich co u s a table 1 shows the main characteristics of each volatile compound according to its chemical formula odour perception henry solubility hcc molecular weight and structure 2 3 experimental set up gas tight 2 1 l glass bottles were used to carry out the oar and asr experiments aliquots of 300 ml of sw supplemented with different concentrations of nitrate or nitrite see section 2 4 were added to the glass bottles which were then closed with butyl septa and aluminium caps the air atmosphere in the headspace was subsequently displaced with helium at a final pressure of 0 5 bar for 10 min in order to provide anaerobic conditions the o2 headspace composition was quantified by gas chromatography gc using a varian gc tcd to ensure an oxygen content lower than 1 in all experiments the target odorous compounds h2s acetic acid and α pinene were injected into the bottle headspace in order to mimic a septic wastewater thus a total mass of 0 07 2 10 and 0 42 mg of h2s acetic acid and α pinene respectively was injected through the butyl septum corresponding to 250 μl of gaseous h2s at 22 2 μl of liquid acetic acid and 0 5 μl of liquid α pinene a low concentration of α pinene was selected due to the lower contribution of this odorant in odour emissions derived from wwtps 24 the mass of each odorant was injected considering the thermodynamic equilibrium between the concentrations in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase under dilute solutions at a constant temperature 25 thus the henry s law constants known as air water partitioning coefficients were used to estimate the total mass of the target compounds to be injected which can be expressed as h cc c a c g where h cc is the dimensionless partitioning coefficient of the odorant c a is the odorant aqueous phase concentration mg l and c g is the odorant gas phase concentration mg l table 1 shows the dimensionless partitioning coefficient for each target odorant after injection of the target odorants each bottle was pressurized with helium at 500 mbar using a pressure gauge in order to fulfil the technical requirements of the mass spectrometer used to quantify the odorants in the headspace subsequently each bottle was vigorously shaken for 2 min to facilitate gas liquid equilibrium and the initial concentrations of each target compound was analysed in the headspace by mass spectrometry ms finally different concentrations of fresh activated sludge were injected into the aqueous phase see section 2 5 and the monitoring of odorant concentration was carried out at 30 60 180 and 270 min the glass bottles were gently incubated in a horizontal rotary incubator wsbpr8080 c wheaton science at 7 rpm and at ambient temperature 21 c the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured at time 0 and 270 min 2 4 odorant fate under abiotic conditions control experiments without n nox and activated sludge were performed following the procedure described in section 2 3 i e with the same odorant concentrations in the headspace briefly 300 ml of tap water were added into the glass bottles of 2 1 l which were then closed with butyl septa and aluminium caps the air in the headspace was displaced with helium at a final pressure of 0 5 bar for 10 min and the oxygen content in the headspace was analysed by gc tcd aliquots of 250 μl of gaseous h2s at 22 2 μl of liquid acetic acid and 0 5 μl of liquid α pinene were then injected through the butyl septum and each bottle was pressurized with helium at 500 mbar subsequently each bottle was vigorously shaken for 2 min and the concentration of each odorant was analysed in the headspace by ms at 0 120 and 270 min in order to evaluate its behaviour under abiotic conditions 2 5 influence of nitrate and nitrite concentration on odorant fate the residual stream of oxidized nitrogen n nox obtained from the nitrification of centrate was substituted in the laboratory by 2 g l stock solutions of nano3 or nano2 in this context a typical ammonia concentration of 900 1500 mg l in the centrates could be transformed into n no3 or n no2 which would entail maximum n nox concentrations of 6 10 mg n l in the influent raw wastewater assuming a typical centrate to influent raw wastewater ratio qc qo of 0 004 0 12 16 26 where q c stands for the centrate flowrate and q o is the influent raw wastewater flowrate the influence of n no3 and n no2 concentrations 0 1 5 5 7 5 10 mg n nox l on odorant removal was herein investigated table 2 2 6 influence of activated sludge concentration on odorant fate fresh activated sludge was collected from the as external recirculation line of the denitrification nitrification wwtp of valladolid spain the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of the as ranged between 6000 and 7000 mg vss l 15 vss concentrations typically present in secondary settlers average 4 000 12 000 mg vss l which would entail maximum as concentrations of 100 mg vss l in the influent raw wastewater assuming a conventional qw qo ratio of 0 002 0 13 27 where q w stands for the waste activated sludge flowrate thus the influence of biomass concentrations 0 10 25 50 100 mg vss l on odorant removal was herein investigated table 2 2 7 analytical procedures the activated sludge vss concentration was analysed following the methodology proposed by apha awwa wef 18 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured by hplc ic according to garcía 28 the concentration of o2 in the headspace was measured by gc tcd as described by posadas 29 a hiden qga mass spectrometer manufactured by hiden analytical united kingdom was used to quantify the odorant concentrations in the headspace this spectrometer consists of a simple quadrupole with an apsi ionization source an internal dual secondary electron multiplier sem and faraday

acid and α pinene in the gas phase at 440 436 and 411 ppmv respectively for this purpose 6 ml of gas h2s 22 3 μl of acetic acid and 8 μl of α pinene were injected into an empty glass bottle of 2 1 l

experiment in the absence of n nox and activated sludge was carried out in order to evaluate the fate of odorants under abiotic conditions fig 1 the initial headspace concentrations of acetic acid α pinene and h2s accounted for 26 16 and 11 ppmv a slight decrease in the concentration of α pinene and h2s down to 12 and 8 ppmv respectively was recorded after 270 min of experiment which represented a 25 loss for each odorant the fact that the gas liquid equilibrium was reached at time 0 suggests that abiotic losses were associated to odorant adsorption onto the glass surface or butyl septum

groups 30 in the particular case of acetic acid adsorption losses averaged 7 3 2 influence of n nox and activated sludge concentration on odorant fate odorant fate in the gas phase was monitored for a total experimental period of 270 min 4 5 h which corresponded with the maximum elapsed time between the reception of the raw wastewater in the wwtp headworks and its secondary treatment the biological oxidation of h2s under anoxic conditions was confirmed in the present study fig 2 a more rapid decrease in the headspace concentration of h2s was observed at increasing concentrations of no3 no2 and as more specifically a sharp decrease in h2s headspace concentration was recorded for the first 60 min of assay followed by a gradual decrease in h2s fate along with the occurrence of lower gas liquid concentrations gradients the fastest depletion of h2s was observed at 10 mg nox l and 100 mg vss l fig 2e and e in this context the supplementation of septic wastewater with 100 mg vss l reduced h2s concentration to 0 ppmv in 4 5 h even at the lowest no3 and no2 concentrations tested figs s1 and s2 however when nitrate or nitrite concentrations lower than 5 mg nox l were supplemented the complete biological oxidation of h2s was not reached at as concentrations lower than 100 mg vss l the anoxic h2s oxidation was incomplete in the tests conducted with 1 5 5 mg nox l and 10 25 mg vss l figs s1 and s2 overall no3 was more effective than no2 as electron acceptor to biodegrade h2s regardless of the as and n nox concentrations however the use of no2 for odour mitigation in wwtps would lead to a lower energy consumption during the oxidation of the ammoniacal nitrogen present in the centrate resulting from the dehydration of anaerobic digestion sludge this study showed that the combination of oar and asr was effective to oxidize biologically h2s specifically the addition of nitrate or nitrite to the influent wastewater promotes anoxic conditions where oxidized nitrogen is used as an electron acceptor by microorganisms e g chemolithotrophic bacterial species in order to oxidize dissolved sulphides and any readily biodegradable odorants thus preventing their further release as malodorous emissions 13 31 the creation of anoxic conditions via addition of n nox and the microbiological oxidation of h2s by nitrate nitrite reducing bacteria have been hypothesized as the main

concentration of no3 no2 and as supplemented reaching a maximum value of 30 31 ppmv 100 by 270 min in the absence of biomass 4a 4a and by 180 min at 10 and 25 mg vss l 4b 4b and 4c 4c respectively based on the high aqueous solubility of acetic acid table 1 this increase in acetic acid concentration could be due to the fact that the liquid gas equilibrium was not reached at time cero despite the vigorous shaking of the bottles for 2 min in the tests conducted at 50 and 100 mg vss l 4d 4d and 4e 4e respectively acetic acid concentration remained almost constant for the first 180 min and a gradual decrease in concentration was observed from 27 1 to 23 1 ppmv due to the anoxic biodegradation of this odorant figs s1 and s2 in fact most microorganisms present in activated sludge can use the electron acceptor capacity of no3 or no2 to metabolize readily biodegradable compounds such as vfas in this context acetic acid is a key substrate in the biological removal of phosphate and nitrogen in as processes feeding the biochemical routes of phosphorous accumulation and denitrification and supporting enhanced elimination rates of these nutrients 35 36 indeed a certain concentration of vfas is required in the influent raw wastewater to trigger the phosphorus release mechanism by phosphate accumulating organisms pao in wwtps 37 therefore the recycling of n nox might inhibit biological phosphorus removal by pao under carbon bod limiting conditions 7 however in the presence of dissolved h2s oar and asr did not significantly consume acetic acid even at the highest n nox and as concentrations figs s1 and s2 which would prevent a pernicious impact on biological phosphorous removal on the other hand the initial concentration of α pinene of 13 2 ppmv 100 gradually decreased to a final concentration of 8 1 5 ppmv which accounted for a removal of 20 25 of this odorant compound figs s1 and s2 based on the low aqueous solubility of α pinene table 1 and the low influence of no3 no2 and as concentrations on α pinene fate fig 5 the observed decrease in concentration could be attributed to adsorption phenomena previous studies have highlighted the high tendency of α pinene to be adsorbed to solid surfaces 38 3 3 evaluation of n nox fate during odorant oxidation n nox concentration was determined at the end of each assay in order to confirm that heterotrophic denitrification was the main mechanism responsible of odorant degradation during oar and asr a gradual reduction in the final no3 and no2 concentration was recorded when increasing the activated sludge concentration fig 6 test carried out at 1 5 and 5 mg no3 l supported a complete no3 depletion at as concentrations higher than 25 mg vss l fig 6a which was likely responsible for the incomplete biological oxidation of h2s however the reduction of no2 was considerably more pronounced than that of no3 regardless of the concentration of as fig 6b this fact explains the lower effectiveness of no2 during odorant oxidation see section 3 2 and suggests that higher concentrations of no2 are required to carry out the complete biological oxidation of h2s finally the reduction of no3 to no2 during oar and asr was also evaluated table 3 the tests carried out at concentrations 5 mg no3 l and 25 mg vss l experience a partial reduction of no3 to no2 indeed final values of 2 40 2 86 and 4 44 mg no2 l were recorded in the tests conducted with initial concentrations of nitrate of 5 7 5 and 10 mg no3 l respectively when 100 mg vss l were supplemented these environmental conditions supported a complete biological oxidation of h2s fig 3e and e in this context dutra 39 observed that concentrations above 1 mg no2 l exerted a high level of toxicity in aquatic ecosystem and were likely to occur in poorly oxygenated environments such as that prevailing in the asr and aor assays here conducted finally nitrogen compounds in wastewater play a key role in eutrophication and toxicity

nutrients from wastewater to reach acceptable levels such as anaerobic ammonium oxidation process or denitrifying phosphate removal with nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors supporting anoxic

economic benefit since oar entails a reduction in the nitrogen load to the wwtp as well as a cost effective strategy for the prevention and minimization of odours that would potentially be emitted into the atmosphere 16 26 4 conclusions asr and oar were here confirmed as an effective and low cost odour control strategy which can be integrated into wastewater treatment facilities with significant environmental and economic benefits the combination of oar and asr at concentrations of 7 5 10 mg nox l and 50 100 mg vss l respectively supported the most effective and rapid h2s abatement no3 supported a more effective odorant abatement than no2 under sulphur controlling conditions however the use of no2 would allow lower energy consumption during nitrification of the centrate with the subsequent economic benefit on the other hand acetic acid was partially metabolized by microorganisms when complete biological oxidation of h2s was reached which might inhibit biological phosphorous removal in addition the slight decrease in α pinene concentration matched the decrease observed by adsorption during the abiotic tests and with a low influence of no3 no2 and as concentrations finally a marked reduction of no2 was observed when increasing as concentration suggesting that higher concentrations of no2 compared to no3 are required to carry out the complete

12976,new odour prevention strategies in wastewater treatment facilities need to be investigated to find effective and low cost technologies for the control of malodorous emissions in this study the potential of activated sludge as and oxidized nitrogen n nox recycling as an environmentally friendly and cost effective strategy for the prevention and minimization of odour nuisance during wastewater treatment was evaluated and optimized using h2s acetic acid and α pinene as model odorants in 2 1 l gas tight bottles this approach uses by products from wastewater treatment to mitigate odour annoyance preliminary abiotic tests showed headspace concentration losses of 25 for h2s and α pinene and 7 for acetic acid due to odorant adsorption in 4 h the experiments carried out at different concentrations of as 0 10 25 50 100 mg vss l and oxidized nitrogen 1 5 5 7 5 and 10 mg n nox l revealed an effective h2s removal at 7 5 10 mg n nox l and 50 100 mg vss l interestingly no3 was more effective than no2 as electron acceptor during the biodegradation of h2s regardless of the as concentration and n nox concentrations in the presence of dissolved h2s and as concentrations of 50 100 mg vss l acetic acid was partially metabolized by microorganisms at the end of experiment from 27 to 23 ppmv in 4 5 h while α pinene concentrations experienced a similar gradual decrease than in the abiotic tests finally the assays carried out at concentrations 5 mg no3 l and 25 mg vss l showed a reduction of no3 to no2 correlated with the biological oxidation of h2s which suggested the

volatile sulphur compounds 1 introduction nowadays the emissions of malodours represent one of the main concerns associated with wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the main cause of public environmental complaints in courts 1 in the last two decades the increase in the number of complaints from residents in adjacent areas to wwtps has resulted in the systematic evaluation of the odour impact derived from such facilities in this context the eu member states are enforcing wwtp operators to find cost effective strategies for the prevention and minimization of malodours during wastewater management 2 4 volatile sulphur compounds vscs and volatile organic compounds vocs rank among the most typical compounds that contribute to the wastewater management odour footprint 5 in particular hydrogen sulphide h2s and volatile fatty acids vfas emissions are the main responsible of odour nuisance in wwtps 6 7 h2s is a toxic compound generated from the biological reduction of sulphate so4 or thiosulfate under anaerobic conditions by sulphate reducing bacteria srb environmental parameters such as the concentration of sulphate dissolved oxygen biological oxygen demand ph temperature and retention time impact on h2s formation 8 on the other hand vfas are intermediate products from the anaerobic fermentation of easily biodegradable organic matter 9 a wide number of physical chemical methods have been previously tested and reported in literature to minimize the emission of vscs and vocs during wastewater treatment which include photocatalysis 10 the dosing of oxidizing agents 11 or chemical precipitation 12 however the high demand of energy and chemicals are important drawbacks of these conventional solutions in this context biological odour prevention methods have emerged as an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative for the minimization of odour pollution in wwtps the use of by products derived from wastewater treatment such as the recirculation to the headworks of nitrates derived from centrate oxidation and activated sludge as from the secondary settler can foster the adsorption and further oxidation of vscs and vocs in the raw wastewater more specifically activated sludge recycling asr consists of the recirculation of a fraction of waste activated sludge from the secondary clarification or mixed liquor of the nitrification tank to the wwtp headworks these activated sludge streams which contain a concentration of dissolved oxygen and volatile suspended solids of 2 3 mg o2 l and 4000 12 000 mg vss l respectively and a high microbial diversity can adsorb and biologically oxidize most biogenic dissolved odorous compounds e g sulphide volatile fatty acids in raw wastewater 13 similarly oxidized ammonium recycling oar consists of the recycling of residual streams rich in nitrate n no3 or nitrite n no2 to the wwtp headworks or upstream in the sewer system the addition of nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors to the influent wastewater promotes an in situ anoxic odorant oxidation 14 15 as n no3 and n no2 are typically not present in significant concentrations in raw domestic wastewater effluents with high nh4 concentration such as centrates from anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge could be nitrified and recycled to the plant headworks 16 despite the potential of these low cost odour prevention strategies has been successfully validated at pilot and full scale the fundamentals of these technologies remain largely unexplored this work aimed at evaluating the influence of the concentrations of fresh activated sludge nitrate and nitrite on the removal of h2s acetic acid and pinene here selected as model odorants this will set the fundamentals of asr and oar and help optimizing its use in wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater in order to mimic the physico chemical characteristics and composition of a model urban wastewater a modified synthetic wastewater sw was prepared according to 17 as follows mg l in tap water 250 of glucose 110 of meat extract 160 of casein peptone 30 of nh2coh2 7 of nacl 4 of cacl2 2h2o 2 of mgso4 7h2o 112 of k2hpo4

linde spain at 22 in n2 acetic acid with a level of purity over 99 9 was purchased from panreac applichem spain and α pinene was acquired with a purity level of 98 from sigma aldrich co u s a table 1 shows the main characteristics of each volatile compound according to its chemical formula odour perception henry solubility hcc molecular weight and structure 2 3 experimental set up gas tight 2 1 l glass bottles were used to carry out the oar and asr experiments aliquots of 300 ml of sw supplemented with different concentrations of nitrate or nitrite see section 2 4 were added to the glass bottles which were then closed with butyl septa and aluminium caps the air atmosphere in the headspace was subsequently displaced with helium at a final pressure of 0 5 bar for 10 min in order to provide anaerobic conditions the o2 headspace composition was quantified by gas chromatography gc using a varian gc tcd to ensure an oxygen content lower than 1 in all experiments the target odorous compounds h2s acetic acid and α pinene were injected into the bottle headspace in order to mimic a septic wastewater thus a total mass of 0 07 2 10 and 0 42 mg of h2s acetic acid and α pinene respectively was injected through the butyl septum corresponding to 250 μl of gaseous h2s at 22 2 μl of liquid acetic acid and 0 5 μl of liquid α pinene a low concentration of α pinene was selected due to the lower contribution of this odorant in odour emissions derived from wwtps 24 the mass of each odorant was injected considering the thermodynamic equilibrium between the concentrations in the gas phase and in the aqueous phase under dilute solutions at a constant temperature 25 thus the henry s law constants known as air water partitioning coefficients were used to estimate the total mass of the target compounds to be injected which can be expressed as h cc c a c g where h cc is the dimensionless partitioning coefficient of the odorant c a is the odorant aqueous phase concentration mg l and c g is the odorant gas phase concentration mg l table 1 shows the dimensionless partitioning coefficient for each target odorant after injection of the target odorants each bottle was pressurized with helium at 500 mbar using a pressure gauge in order to fulfil the technical requirements of the mass spectrometer used to quantify the odorants in the headspace subsequently each bottle was vigorously shaken for 2 min to facilitate gas liquid equilibrium and the initial concentrations of each target compound was analysed in the headspace by mass spectrometry ms finally different concentrations of fresh activated sludge were injected into the aqueous phase see section 2 5 and the monitoring of odorant concentration was carried out at 30 60 180 and 270 min the glass bottles were gently incubated in a horizontal rotary incubator wsbpr8080 c wheaton science at 7 rpm and at ambient temperature 21 c the nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured at time 0 and 270 min 2 4 odorant fate under abiotic conditions control experiments without n nox and activated sludge were performed following the procedure described in section 2 3 i e with the same odorant concentrations in the headspace briefly 300 ml of tap water were added into the glass bottles of 2 1 l which were then closed with butyl septa and aluminium caps the air in the headspace was displaced with helium at a final pressure of 0 5 bar for 10 min and the oxygen content in the headspace was analysed by gc tcd aliquots of 250 μl of gaseous h2s at 22 2 μl of liquid acetic acid and 0 5 μl of liquid α pinene were then injected through the butyl septum and each bottle was pressurized with helium at 500 mbar subsequently each bottle was vigorously shaken for 2 min and the concentration of each odorant was analysed in the headspace by ms at 0 120 and 270 min in order to evaluate its behaviour under abiotic conditions 2 5 influence of nitrate and nitrite concentration on odorant fate the residual stream of oxidized nitrogen n nox obtained from the nitrification of centrate was substituted in the laboratory by 2 g l stock solutions of nano3 or nano2 in this context a typical ammonia concentration of 900 1500 mg l in the centrates could be transformed into n no3 or n no2 which would entail maximum n nox concentrations of 6 10 mg n l in the influent raw wastewater assuming a typical centrate to influent raw wastewater ratio qc qo of 0 004 0 12 16 26 where q c stands for the centrate flowrate and q o is the influent raw wastewater flowrate the influence of n no3 and n no2 concentrations 0 1 5 5 7 5 10 mg n nox l on odorant removal was herein investigated table 2 2 6 influence of activated sludge concentration on odorant fate fresh activated sludge was collected from the as external recirculation line of the denitrification nitrification wwtp of valladolid spain the volatile suspended solids vss concentration of the as ranged between 6000 and 7000 mg vss l 15 vss concentrations typically present in secondary settlers average 4 000 12 000 mg vss l which would entail maximum as concentrations of 100 mg vss l in the influent raw wastewater assuming a conventional

table 2 2 7 analytical procedures the activated sludge vss concentration was analysed following the methodology proposed by apha awwa wef 18 nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured by hplc ic according to garcía 28 the concentration of o2 in the headspace was measured by gc tcd as described by posadas 29 a hiden qga mass spectrometer manufactured by hiden analytical united kingdom was used to quantify the odorant concentrations in the headspace this spectrometer consists of a simple quadrupole with an apsi ionization source an internal dual secondary electron multiplier sem and faraday

abatement no3 supported a more effective odorant abatement than no2 under sulphur controlling conditions however the use of no2 would allow lower energy consumption during nitrification of the centrate with the subsequent economic benefit on the other hand acetic acid was partially metabolized by microorganisms when complete biological oxidation of h2s was reached which might inhibit biological phosphorous removal in addition the slight decrease in α pinene concentration matched the decrease observed by adsorption during the abiotic tests and with a low influence of no3 no2 and as concentrations finally a marked reduction of no2 was observed when increasing as concentration suggesting that higher concentrations of no2 compared to no3 are required to carry out the complete

and uv fluence for microorganisms the effects of flow rate baffle width and number of flow channels n are examined to elevate the efficiency of sterilizing escherichia coli e coli experimental results indicate that the four channel reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency owing to high flow uniformity sufficient exposure time and circulation elimination in the flow channel the reactor achieved 4 0 log at a flow rate of 29 ml min and a total radiative power of 80 mw the disinfection flow rate was 45 higher than that of the reactor without channel configuration increasing the number of channels helps eliminate circulations and achieve uniform flow distribution however microbial exposure time and uv fluence decrease with increased number of channels additionally when the baffle width was less than 6 mm the log inactivation increased with baffle width due to the increase in the degree of flow uniformity the flow reactor achieves optimal disinfection efficiency at baffle width 6 mm due to an optimal combination of flow variation and water velocity keywords uv c led escherichia coli planar flow reactor water sterilization 1 introduction uv light is an efficient disinfectant for water and air and is widely utilized in water purifiers air conditioners and wastewater treatment equipment 1 2 mercury lamps have been banned worldwide because they are fragile and contain mercury in recent years uv led has become a prime candidate to replace mercury lamps because they are mercury free small and long lasting 3 4 the uv leds also provide flexibility to be designed into domestic units and large commercial systems uv leds have been widely adopted in different applications owing to tunable emitting wavelengths from uv a to uv c 5 6 uv a 320 400 nm induces photodamaged and oxidative disturbance for trnas and cellular membrane respectively 7 hamamoto et al 8 used uv a leds to disinfect different strains of bacteria in water with a peak wavelength of 365 nm the damages of proteins and lipids are critical mechanisms to inactivate bacteria by uv a irradiation additionally uv b 280 320 nm has been demonstrated as an effective light source for phototherapy to treat various skin diseases 9 11 uv b treatment did not raise the risk of skin cancer uv c inactivates viruses and bacteria more efficiently than uv a and uv b because uv c irradiation can rupture cell walls and disrupt dna replication uv c led is a promising light source to reduce the amount of pathogens in water the radiation profile of a uv led should be measured accurately to predict uv doses for microorganisms 12 in addition the emitting wavelength of uv c leds dominates the impact on germicidal efficiency 13 different sensitivities were observed for various organisms after uv

dynamics to analyze the uv dose distribution in a flow reactor their simulation results revealed that surface roughness and lamp configuration significantly affected water velocity and dose distribution inside the reactor gross et al 18 indicated that quartz glass had a much higher uv transmittance than soda lime glass and obtained total reflection from the reactor wall for a specified viewing angle of uv led furthermore several studies have demonstrated that reactor configuration and flow filed significantly influenced reactor performance for water disinfection 19 22 le et al 23 identified flow rate uv transmittance and lamp power as design parameters affecting reactor performance increasing the lamp power is efficient to enhance uv dose distribution due to water absorption especially at low uv transmittance uv fluence can be treated as an indicator to treat drinking water energy consumption is also a key parameter for designing a high efficient water disinfection reactor using uv c leds 24 25 this work used to inactivate e coli in water as uv c leds are highly flexible for reactor design the planar flow reactor has a compact structure and is more convenient to carry than a conventional annular flow reactor different parallel channel configurations were integrated into the flow reactors to raise microbial exposure time and uniform flow distribution the design purpose is to improve the sterilization efficiency under the same reactor size and electric power consumption theoretical analysis was employed to analyzed fluid motion in the flow channels the effects of flow rate number of channels and baffle width were examined to improve the inactivation efficiency of e coli 2 reactor design and theoretical analysis 2 1 experiments fig 1 displays the image of water disinfection experiment using uv c leds our previous work 22 described the inactivation kinetics and the e coli ifo 3301 enumeration the log inactivation was adopted to assess the germicidal efficiency of the flow reactor which was defined by the number of colonies before and after uv irradiation a linear relationship was assumed between the log inactivation and the uv fluence to derive the inactivation rate constant 14 the irradiance distribution on the water surface was measured using a uv detector to determine the uv fluence for microorganisms the experimental setup and the measurement procedure were shown in our previous study 22 in this experiment the average irradiance on the water surface was 0 84 mw cm2 the interspace between the detector and the flow channel was 16 mm the uv module was composed of eight leds with a peak wavelength of 278 nm and a light output power of 10 mw the driving current is 100 ma for each uv led the uv module was placed on the top of the flow channel to increase the exposure area on water the uv leds was attached on an aluminum flat plate to dissipate waste heat from the uv leds an optical diffuser and a quartz glass were placed below the uv module to achieve uniform irradiance distribution on water and facilitate uv transmittance the transmittance of quartz glass is higher than 90 under an emitting wavelength of 278 nm fig 2 presents the components of the planar water disinfection reactor the flow channel was made by a 3d printer the reactor has a compact structure and small size 74 mm 44 mm 35 mm in the present study the purpose is to improve water disinfection efficiency under the same reactor size and power consumption additionally flow reactors with various parallel channel configurations n 0 2 3 4 6 were studied to improve the reactor performance as depicted in fig 3 both the number of channels and baffle width significantly affect fluid motion 26 28 2 2 simulation flow circulation vortex and turbulence influence flow trajectory and uniformity inside the flow channel various parallel channel configurations affect water distribution and exposure time thus influencing uv fluence distribution in the flow reactor the circulations inside the reactor may impede reactor performance due to improper design of the flow channel the flow pattern in the flow channel was analyzed by comsol multiphysics the governing equations of fluid dynamics are defined as follows 29 3 u 0 4 ρ u t η η t u u t ρu u p f in which ρ and η indicate the water density and viscosity respectively and p u and f represent the pressure velocity vector and volume force vector respectively because the water velocity is different is each channel the simulation was used to define the average water velocity for the fluid particles in the planar flow reactor a total of 10 000 molecules were selected to calculate the average water velocity this approach is to simulate particle trajectories from the reactor inlet to outlet and define the average microbial exposure time 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of number of channels on reactor performance different parallel channel configurations were examined to analyze the impacts of flow uniformity and exposure time on reactor performance the circulation zones also significantly affect flow trajectory inside the uv reactor in this experiment the baffle length and baffle height were 50 mm and 10 mm respectively fig 4 a e shows the simulated velocity field inside the flow channels with different channel configurations under a constant water flow rate of 60 ml min simulation results show that the flow reactor without parallel channel configuration n 0 had the largest circulation zones in the flow channel the flow pattern formed a large ineffective area inside the reactor the two channel configuration also revealed obvious circulation zones around the entrance and at the front end of the flow channel furthermore water mainly flowed through the middle channel for the three channel reactor resulting in the highest degree of nonuniformity in the water distribution the circulation and flow distribution in the four channel configuration were small and uniform compared to other parallel channel configurations the six channel configuration exhibited the highest degree of uniformity in flow distribution however the average water velocity increased with the number of channels due to a decline in flow channel area thus lowering the uv fluence for microorganisms fig 5 presents the correlations between exposure time and flow rate under various parallel channel configurations the flow rate varied between 20 ml min and 120 ml min the exposure time was derived from the average water velocity and the reactor length as shown in the figure the exposure time declined sharply between 20 ml min and 60 ml min then continuously decreased as the flow rate increased the four channel reactor had the longest exposure time among reactors with different parallel channel configurations a microorganism with a longer exposure time had a higher uv fluence the three channel reactor had the shortest microbial exposure time under various flow rates because water mainly flowed through the middle channel fig 6 illustrates the log inactivation for e coli under various flow rates the log inactivation fell as the flow rate increased in all types of reactors because of the decrease in microbial exposure time the experimental results demonstrate that the four channel reactor exhibited the highest inactivation values under various flow rates among reactors with various channel configurations because it had high flow uniformity sufficient microbial exposure time and circulation elimination in the flow channel the two channel and four channel flow reactors are able to achieve 4 0 log the maximum water disinfection flow rates approximated 26 ml min and 29 ml min for the two channel and four channel configurations respectively the disinfection flow rate in the two channel and four channel reactors was 30 and 45 higher respectively than the reactor without parallel channel configuration additionally the three channel configuration exhibited the lowest inactivation values under the investigated flow rate range because it had the highest degree of nonuniformity in the water distribution the results show that the exposure time is not sufficient to represent the sterilization efficiency of the reactor the degree of flow uniformity is also an important guidance to the reactor design 3 2 effect of baffle width on reactor performance the effect of baffle width on reactor performance of sterilizing e coli was investigated in this experiment using a four channel reactor with different baffle widths from 2 mm to 12 mm fig 7 shows the average water velocity as a function of baffle width at low flow rates 40 ml min no clear variation in water velocity was observed with rising baffle width at flow rates 80 ml min the average water velocity increased considerably when the baffle width was more than 6 mm this significant increase in water velocity reduced the microbial exposure time in turn decreasing the inactivation efficiency of the planar flow reactor fig 8 a to c displays the flow distribution under various baffle widths at flow rate 40 ml min water mainly flowed through the two middle channels when the baffle width was 2 mm the flow distribution was more uniform when the baffle width was more than 8 mm as in fig 8 b and c however the average water velocity increased with the baffle width owing to a decrease in flow channel area because the baffle width significantly influenced the fluid flow inside the parallel channels the flow variation fv was defined to analyze the flow uniformity in a planar reactor with parallel channel configuration 5 fv v ave v min v ave 100 where v ave and v min represent the average and minimum water velocities in the flow channels fig 9 shows the correlation between the fv and the baffle width the simulation results showed that fv increased obviously with water flow rate especially when baffle width was less than 8 mm in addition the fv declined sharply as the baffle width was increased from 2 mm to 8 mm for various flow rates the rate of decrease in the fv with respect to the baffle width increased with the flow rate a higher fv resulted in greater nonuniformity in the flow distribution inside the flow channels fig 10 presents the relative water velocity in the flow channel the relative water velocity is the average flow velocity in each flow channel the simulation results were normalized to the maximum water velocity in the flow channels the reactor performance was low when the baffle width was less than 6 mm because of a higher degree of nonuniformity in the water distribution the difference between the water velocities in each flow channel decreased dramatically as the baffle width was increased fig 11 illustrates the correlation between the log inactivation and the baffle width under various flow rates experimental results show that the log inactivation first increased with the baffle width and had an optimal inactivation value when the baffle width was 6 mm at various flow rates the planar flow reactor had optimal inactivation values of 4 8 log 4 0 log 3 6 log and 2 9 log at flow rates of 20 ml min 30 ml min 40 ml min and 120 ml min respectively the log inactivation decreased at baffle widths greater than 6 mm the results could be attributed to the combined effect of flow variation and average water velocity in the flow channels fig 12 shows the fv and average water velocity as a function of baffle width when the flow rate was 40 ml min when the baffle width was less than 6 mm the log inactivation increased with baffle width due to the increase in the degree of flow uniformity inside the flow channel the planar reactor performed optimally when the baffle width was 6 mm owing to uniform flow distribution and sufficient exposure time as shown in the figure fv and average water velocity showed an optimal combination at baffle width 6 mm the log inactivation decreased at baffle width more than 6 mm because of the significant decrease in exposure time fig 13 illustrates the correlation between the log inactivation and the uv fluence of the four channel reactor under various baffle widths the uv fluence is the product of the average irradiance and the exposure time under various flow rates the slope between the log inactivation and the uv fluence represents the inactivation rate constant 30 as shown in the figure the inactivation constant was derived from 0 11 to 0 12 cm2 mj by linear regression the slope between the log inactivation and the uv fluence was similar under various baffle widths the linear fluence inactivation response was observed under the investigated fluence range in this experiment the planar flow reactor achieved 4 0 log at a uv fluence of 11 9 mj cm2 the planar flow reactor achieved the highest log inactivation under the same uv fluence at baffle width 6 mm owing to high degree of flow uniformity and sufficient exposure time 4 conclusion a planar flow reactor for disinfecting water is presented to provide potable water the reactor has an innovative design and a compact structure making it easy to carry experimental results reveal that the number of channels baffle width and flow rate significantly affect the reactor performance owing to the complex effects on flow uniformity circulation and exposure time inside the flow channel the four channel reactor exhibited the highest inactivation efficiency among reactors with various channel configurations and had a disinfection flow rate 45 higher than the reactor without channel configuration furthermore the highest inactivation value was achieved when the baffle width was 6 mm under various flow rates because the fv and the average water velocity had an optimal combination the planar flow reactor achieved 4 0 log at a flow rate of 29 ml min and a total radiative power of 80 mw the results can be applied in designs of high efficient water disinfection

wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bulk liquid membrane green extractant palm kernel fatty acid distillate metal recovery selectivity 1 introduction the extensive application of cu ii in many industries including electrical and electronics metal finishing batteries paints automobiles construction etc 1 2 has led to the contamination of cu ii in water bodies that threaten the health of living organisms 1 hence throughout the last several decades numerous investigations have been devoted to removing cu ii from aqueous solutions using various methods e g chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption 3 11 among these methods membrane separation for example has a lot of potential because of its high efficiency low energy consumption flexibility and ease of operation and the need for a little floor area 12 traditional solid polymeric membranes on the other hand have a number of problems including membrane fouling limited permeability and low selectivity 13 of late there has been growing interest in using liquid membranes i e membranes made of liquid to separate various solutes from aqueous solutions 12 14 the motivation behind the choice of liquid membranes over solid membranes is the endeavor to achieve a higher membrane fluxsince the diffusion coefficient in liquids is much higher than that in

material rich in free fatty acid ffa 90 wt with its green credentials such as low vapor pressure 1 0 mmhg 75 c high flash point 150 c non flammable and low toxicity 29 previously we discovered that pkfad with ffas as the active components could extract up to 98 of cu ii from aqueous solutions by a cation exchange mechanism through a solvent extraction system 26 the optimum conditions for cu ii extraction from aqueous solutions by pkfad and for cu ii stripping from cu ii loaded pkfad had also been determined 26 herein pkfad was used to formulate the membrane phase of a blm namely pkfad based blm contributing to the development of blms based on sole green organic solvents the effects of design number of stirrer blades and baffles and operating stirring speed buffer solution concentration and operating time parameters on the simultaneous extraction and stripping of cu ii across pkfad based blm as well as its overall recovery and enrichment factor were investigated the selectivity of pkfad based blm in separating cu ii from actual electroplating wastewater was also explored 2 experimental study 2 1 materials and methods pkfad was supplied by a local vendor i e sime darby sdn bhd and was used directly as an extractant without diluting it with any organic solvent the physicochemical properties of pkfad were provided in table 1 26 27 in general pkfad consist of 92 ffa and other minor components such as triglycerides diglycerides monoglycerides and others 30 copper sulfate pentahydrate cuso4 5h2o merck 99 6 purity sodium sulfate na2so4 qrec 99 purity acetic acid ch3cooh qrec 99 purity formic acid ch2o2 qrec 85 purity and sodium acetate ch3coona qrec 99 purity were used as received 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup of pkfad based blm used in this work is shown in fig 1 it consists of a cylindrical glass vessel with a height of 10 5 cm inner diameter of 8 7 cm the vessel contains two equal volume compartments separated by a 6 0 cm high glass divider and the interior wall of each compartment was installed with a removable cylindrical glass baffle of 8 mm diameter a half cylinder glass block with a radius of 4 35 cm and a height of 3 0 cm was placed vertically in one of the compartments to reduce its volume the bigger compartment was filled with an aqueous feed phase 170 ml and the smaller one with the half cylinder glass block with an aqueous strip phase 85 ml to enhance the enrichment effect a volume of pkfad 85 ml was poured over both the aqueous feed and strip phases functioning as the organic membrane phase the feed phase contained an initial cu ii concentration of 100 mg l and na2so4 200 mm which was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of cuso4 5h2o and na2so4 in an acetate buffer solution of ph 4 7 26 whereas the strip phase was prepared using 1 m formic acid solution 26 the extraction process occurred at the feed membrane interface while the back extraction or stripping process occurred at the strip membrane interface the buffer solution was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0 2 m acetic acid and 0 2 m sodium acetate each of the phases was stirred by overhead mechanical stirrers ika rw20 at the same speed with the feed and strip phases stirred by one stirrer each while the membrane phase was by two stirrers the pkfad based blm vessel was placed in a water bath covered with aluminum foil on the top to maintain a uniform temperature of 25 2 c throughout the fluids contained in the glass vessel 2 3 experimental procedure the experimental work was started with an investigation of the design parameters number of stirrer blades and baffles of pkfad based blm the effects of its operating parameters stirring speed buffer solution concentration and operating time on cu ii separation were followed by an evaluation of its selectivity for cu ii separation from actual electroplating wastewater containing multi metal solutions co ii ni ii and cr vi during the experiments samples were taken from both the aqueous feed and strip phases and the concentration of cu ii was analyzed using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas shimadzu aa7000 by assuming that the initial concentrations of cu ii in both the membrane and strip phases as zero the percentage extraction e stripping s and overall recovery r were calculated according to eqs 1 3 respectively 1 e m i feed m f feed m i feed 100 2 s m f strip m i feed m f feed 100 3 r m f strip m i feed 100 where m i feed and m f feed are the initial and final masses of cu ii respectively in the aqueous feed phase m f strip is the final mass of cu ii in the aqueous strip phase substituted eq 1 and eq 2 into eq 3 and the final relation of e s and r were obtained as below 4 r e x s the above eq 4 shows that the r was directly depending with both e and s while the increment of e and or s will rise the r value and vice versa the enrichment factor en of cu ii was calculated by eq 5 31 5 en cu f strip cu i feed where cu f strip and cu i feed is the final concentration of cu ii in the aqueous strip phase and initial concentration of cu ii in the aqueous feed phase respectively all experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate at room temperature 25 c and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 5 2 3 1 study of design parameters two design parameters of pkfad based blm namely number of stirrer blades and use of baffles were explored into their effects on e eq 1 s eq 2 r eq 3 and en eq 5 of cu ii a glass flat blade type of stirrer was used in this study with the stirrer having the same stirrer blade diameter and blade width but different the numbers of blades i e two and four blades were used to study the effect of number of stirrer blades both of the stirrers were rotated at the same speed 150 rpm throughout the experiments two removable cylindrical glass baffles extending through the feed strip and membrane phases were mounted on the interior wall of blm to study the effect of baffles as shown in fig 1 all the experiments were run for 7 h while maintaining the ph of the feed phase at 4 7 with 0 2 m acetate buffer solution the optimum design parameters that achieved the highest e s r and en of cu ii across pkfad based blm were used for further studies 2 3 2 study of operating parameters three operating parameters of pkfad based blm namely stirring speed 110 270 rpm buffer solution concentration 0 1 1 0 m and operating time 0 24 h were investigated on their effects on e eq 1 s eq 2 r eq 3 and en eq 5 of cu ii the relationship between stirring speed and the stirrer reynold s number re is given by 32 6 re ρnd 2 μ where ρ is the fluid density kg m3 n is the stirring speed rad s d is the diameter of the stirrer m and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s 2 3 3 study of diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm system the diffusion rate of cu ii through the pkfad based blm were studied at the optimum design and operating parameters condition samples were taken from both the aqueous phases feed and strip at regular time intervals the diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm can be expressed by the following differential equations 33 34 7 d r f dt k 1 r f 8 dr m dt ξk 1 r f λk 2 r m 9 dr s dt k 2 r m where r f r m and r s are the instantaneous reduced concentrations of cu ii in the feed membrane and strip phases respectively k 1 and k 2 are the apparent first and second order rate constants for the extraction and stripping processes respectively ξ and λ are the volume ratios of the feed to membrane phase and the strip to membrane phase respectively the value of ξ 2 and λ 1 were used in this study the integration of eqs 7 to 9 gives rise to 10 r f exp k 1 t 11 r m ξ k 1 λk 2 k 1 exp k 1 t exp λk 2 t 12 r s ξ λ ξ λ λk 2 k 1 λk 2 exp k 1 t k 1 exp λk 2 t a numerical analysis by fitting a non linear curve using the solver function of the microsoft excel program microsoft office 2016 was used to determine the value of k 1 and k 2 the value k 1 was directly obtained by iteration from eq 10 this value was introduced as a constant value in eqs 11 and 12 and iterations were carried out to determine the value of k 2m and k 2s respectively the overall k 2 value was obtained from the average value of k 2m and k 2s 2 3 4 wastewater sample collection and analysis the wastewater sample was collected from a local electroplating plant and stored in a refrigerator before use the ph turbidity and conductivity of the wastewater sample were measured with a ph meter hanna instruments hi11310 a turbidity meter hach 2100q and a conductivity meter hach ec5 respectively while the concentrations of cu ii ni ii co ii and cr vi were analyzed by faas other parameters were analyzed according to the standard method american public health association apha i e apha 4500 cn c f cyanide apha 4500 cl c chloride apha 3111 b sodium potassium apha 419 d 14th nitrate and apha 4500 so4 e sulfate 35 different physicochemical characteristics of the electroplating wastewater are presented in table 2 2 3 5 selectivity study the selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation was examined with an actual electroplating wastewater sample as described in section 2 3 4 the sample was directly used without any pretreatment except the addition of an appropriate amount of sodium acetate and acetic acid which act as buffer solution at a concentration of 0 2 m and ph of 4 7 the e s r and en were calculated by eqs 1 2 3 and 5 respectively while the cu ii separation factors sf cu x was calculated by the following equation 31 13 s f cu x c cu c x f strip c cu c x i feed where c cu represents the concentration m of cu ii c x represents the concentration m of other metal ions while c f strip and c i feed are the final concentration of metal ions in the strip phase and the initial concentration of metal ions in the feed phase respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of suitable design parameters for pkfad based blm 3 1 1 the effect of the number of stirrer blades conventionally both the aqueous and organic phases of a blm require mixing to stirrer at an appropriate intensity to avoid emulsion formation moreover one of the primary factors governing the mixing intensity of a stirrer at a certain speed is its number of blades 36 in this work two similar flat blade stirrers with two and four blades respectively were employed to investigate their effects on the e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm and the obtained results are shown in fig 2 the results revealed that the e obtained by using two 92 and four 93 stirrer blades were comparable with each other but the s achieved using two stirrer blades was considerably lower 50 than that attained with four stirrer blades 62 the nearly twice as high the of e was achieved compared to the s obtained with both two and four stirrer blades suggests that the rate of the extraction process in pkfad based blm was much higher than that of the stripping process this result was consistent with the findings obtained by chang et al 21 who reported a higher rate of the extraction process than that of the stripping process in soybean oil based blms the higher rate of the extraction process was attributed to the mass transfer from a lower to a higher viscosity fluid phase while the slower rate of the stripping process was ascribed to the mass transfer from higher to lower viscosity fluid phase 21 the enhanced of s with the number of stirrer blades may be explained by the increasing the flow guidance and decreasing the slipping 37 that led to the uniformity of the flow and the homogeneous distribution of cu ii ffa complexes in the membrane phase thus improvement in the mobility of cu ii ffa complexes and accelerating their decomplexation was observed at the strip membrane interface the r was found to be increased with increasing both e and s which were consistent with eq 4 whereas the r value increased from 47 to 58 with an increase in the number of blades meanwhile the en also increase from 0 9 two blade to 1 2 four blade which was about double from the r value obtained since stirrers with four blades showed a higher r and en than the two blades fig 2 thus stirring with four blades was chosen for further studies 3 1 2 the effect of baffles baffles are commonly installed on the side of a mixing tank to prevent swirling in the bulk fluid and promote the fluid circulation between the top and bottom of the tank to enhance the mixing and process efficiencies 38 in this work the effect of baffles on the percentage of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm was investigated and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 the results showed that there was no significant difference in the e 93 obtained between cases without and with baffles but not the of s that achieved without baffles 62 was much higher than that attained with baffles 49 this could be explained due to the higher rate of extraction process than the stripping process as mention in section 3 1 1 the deterioration in the content of s observed when baffles were employed may be explained from the addition dead zones formed with the present of the buffer as illustrated in fig 4 the dead zones increased unmixed fluid volumes in pkfad based blm generating a negative impact on the mixing efficiency and reducing the transport of cu ii from the membrane to the strip phase the higher of s achieved without baffles resulting corresponding higher r 58 and en 1 2 while the lower of s was obtained with baffles led to the lower r 46 and en 0 91 since the use of baffles did not favor the r and en fig 3 the blm system without baffles was considered for next studies on operating parameters and selectivity 3 2 the effect of operating parameters on cu ii transport through pkfad based blm system 3 2 1 the effect of stirring speed there is general agreement that stirring speed plays a vital role in affecting the transport efficiency of solutes through a blm 14 39 42 hence the effect of stirring speed 110 270 rpm on the transport of cu ii through pkfad based blm was examined and the of e s r and en obtained were shown in fig 5 the buffer solution concentration of 0 2 m and operating time of 7 h were employed throughout the experiments generally the e remained virtually unchanged at about 90 from 110 to 220 rpm however it declined gradually thereafter while the of s increased dramatically from 25 at 110 rpm to 94 at 220 rpm before leveling off both the obtained corresponding of r and en exhibited a similar trend where they rose to a high point and peaked at 220 rpm r of 89 and en of 1 8 before falling steadily the variations of re with stirring speed for the feed membrane and strip phases of pkfad based blm were also computed with eq 6 and depicted in fig 6 a the results of figs 5 and 6 suggest that the higher of e and lower of s were achieved at the stirring speeds below 220 rpm it might be due to the transfer of cu ii from a higher re feed phase to a lower re membrane phase and from a lower re membrane phase to a higher re strip phase respectively intuitively the higher re feed and strip phases developed thinner feed and strip boundary layers next to the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces respectively however the lower re membrane phase induced thicker membrane boundary layers next to the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces 14 18 fig 6 b accordingly the thinner feed boundary layer facilitated the diffusion of cu ii from the feed to the membrane phase and led to a higher of e while the thicker membrane boundary layer inhibited the cu ii diffusion from the membrane to the strip phase resulting in a lower of s however there was reason to believe that the thickness of the membrane boundary layer decreased with stirring speed fig 6 b which explains the steep rise of s with stirring speed at 220 rpm fig 5 meanwhile at speed 220 rpm the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces were disrupted by the elevated stirring speeds causing the feed and strip phases to spill over the glass divider to the other compartment of pkfad based blm fig 1 consequently the ph of the feed phase altered from ph 4 4 at 110 rpm to ph 4 0 and ph 3 7 at 230 and 270 rpm not shown in this paper respectively however the ph of the aqueous strip phase reminds constant throughout the stripping process this impacted the of e negatively due to the ph dependent nature of the extraction process 43 but it was not affecting the of s owing to the insignificant change in the ph of the strip phase these findings are in good agreement with previously reported work by madaeni et al 40 and soniya and muthuraman 44 since the stirring speed of 220 rpm achieved the highest of r and en fig 5 it was selected for further studies 3 2 2 the effect of buffer solution concentration according to eq 14 two moles of h are produced when one mole of cu ii is removed from the feed phase of pkfad based blm causing a reduction in the ph of the feed phase and thus the of e as mass transfer proceeds 45 46 14 cu aq 2 2 n 2 hr 2 org k ex cur 2 hr n org 2 h aq where aq and org are the aqueous and organic phases respectively hr 2 denotes the dimeric form of ffa molecules in pkfad cur 2 hr n denotes the cu ii ffa complex produced n is a stoichiometric constant and k ex is the reaction s equilibrium constant therefore it was necessary to maintain the feed phase at the desired ph of 4 7 by adding an acetate buffer solution 47 the effect of buffer solution concentration on the of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm and the ph changes of the feed phase due to the released of h during the extraction process cation exchange is shown in fig 7 throughout the studies a 220 rpm stirring speed and a 7 hour operation time were used the obtained results revealed that the of e increased substantially from 77 to 88 at buffer solution concentrations from 0 1 to 0 2 m followed by a gradual rise to 92 at 0 3 m and then reached a plateau before falling a little to 89 at 1 0 m meanwhile the of s stayed constant at about 94 from 0 1 to 0 5 m of buffer solution concentrations but fell slightly at buffer solution concentrations of 0 7 m and above the trends of the corresponding of r and en coincided with each other where they first rose at buffer solution concentrations from 0 1 to 0 2 m then plateaued out until 0 5 m and finally declined at 1 0 m meanwhile the changes in the ph of the feed phase decreased with buffer solution concentration fig 7 this was expected since the buffer capacity increased with increasing concentration thus restricting its ph s change 47 the highest ph change 0 9 at the buffer solution concentration of 0 1 m reduced the ph of the feed phase from 4 7 to 3 8 and deteriorated the of e fig 7 and this is consistent with our previous finding 26 meanwhile the small ph changes of 0 4 at buffer solution concentrations of 0 3 0 7 m did not affect the of e 92 93 due to the insignificant ph changes in the feed phase however e declined at 1 0 m buffer solution concentration despite the slight ph change 0 1 the latter could be deduced from the increasing mass transfer resistance caused by the saturation effect of the acetate buffer solution in the feed phase at 1 0 m since buffer solution concentrations more than 0 2 m did not enhance the of r and en significantly thus buffer solution concentration of 0 2 m was selected for further studies 3 2 3 the effects of operating time the effect of operating time on the of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm is shown in fig 8 the stirring speed and buffer solution concentration of 220 rpm and 0 2 m respectively were used throughout the experiments as can be seen in fig 8 the of e achieved 87 during the first hour of operation and 90 in 3 h before reaching a plateau while the of s achieved 94 in 7 h and stabilized out these findings justify the earlier conjectures about the possibility of a higher extraction rate than the stripping rate as discussed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 since the of r and en remained steady at 87 and 1 74 respectively in 7 h of operation the operating time of 7 h was selected for further studies 3 3 investigation on the diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm system the variation of r f r m and r s with time is as shown in fig 9 in general r f reduced exponentially with time r m initially increased and reached a maximum before declining slowly and r s followed an increasing sigmoid curve table 3 shows the k 1 and k 2 values obtained from this research the k 1 value was much higher than the k 2 value implying that the stripping process limited the transport of cu ii across pkfad based blm these results agree well with the earlier conjecture about the higher cu ii extraction rate than its stripping rate through pkfad based blm discussed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the lower stripping rate might be due to the higher viscosity of the membrane phase than that of the aqueous feed phase 32 vs 0 89 mpa s 25 c 48 thus hindering the transport of the cu ii ffa complexes extracted species across the membrane phase and retarding the decomplexation reaction of cu ii at the membrane strip interface this finding agrees well with that of other works and a comparison between the kinetic constants obtained from this work with those from other previous works is as given in table 3 overall all the kinetic studies had a lower k 2 than k 1 as shown in table 3 3 4 selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from electroplating wastewater industrial wastewater usually contains multi metal such as cu ii ni ii co ii zn ii cd ii pb ii fe ii etc on top of other cations and anions depending on the specific sources and types of the industries 1 53 54 the separation selectivity of a separator for particular metal ions over others is an important trait for the purification and preconcentration of metal ions for recovery purposes hence the selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from actual electroplating wastewater was investigated using the optimum design and operating parameters as determined earlier in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and the obtained results are shown in fig 10 the results show e of cu ii increased rapidly at first and then leveled out towards a maximum of 92 while both the s and r of cu ii increased gradually until they reached to 89 and 82 respectively these results were comparable with the of e 93 s 94 and r 87 as obtained using synthetic single cu ii solution fig 8 meanwhile the of r for other metal ions were less than 10 i e 7 co ii 6 ni ii and 2 cr vi this indicates a high selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from the actual electroplating wastewater suggesting that cu ii is inclined to form more stable complexes with ffas than other metal ions co ii ni ii and cr vi under the optimum design and operating conditions based on the selectivity of pkfad based blm it can be employed quantitatively with sf cu x calculated by eq 13 the obtained values of sf cu x 1 in all experimental ranges studied indicate a good selectivity of cu ii separation from multi metal solutions containing co ii ni ii and cr vi as shown in fig 10 b in general the value of sf cu co and sf cu cr increased with operating time however sf cu ni declined with it meanwhile the highest sf cu co of 11 and sf cu cr of 43 were achieved at 7 h and sf cu ni of 30 at 1 h the increasing order of sf cu x is follows as sf cu co sf cu ni sf cu cr similar results were also reported by parhi and sarangi 55 prakorn et al 56 and park and kim 57 have separated the cu ii from co ii ni ii and cr vi using a supported or emulsion liquid membrane using lix 84 i and cyanex 301 as the extractants respectively meanwhile to quantify the preconcentration degree of cu ii in pkfad based blm en was computed with eq 5 and the results are as shown in fig 10 b the substantial increment of en from 0 4 at 1 h to 1 6 at 7 h could be ascribed to the smaller strip to feed phase volume ratio of 1 2 used fig 1 however the maximum en value of 1 6 obtained in this work is low compared to the en values reported in other previous studies e g 10 19 and 12 31 this could be attributed to the strip to feed volume ratio of 1 2 applied that was not low enough to preconcentrate cu ii in the strip phase it is suggested for further studies to reduce the strip to feed volume ratio of pkfad based blm further to enhance the en value overall pkfad was successfully applied as a sole green membrane phase in the blm system and was able to remove cu ii from a single and multi metal solution with 92 and 87 of cu ii removal and recovery respectively this result is comparable with previous studies that used sole petroleum or mixed green petroleum based membrane phases for removing cu ii in various liquid membrane systems table 4 to date no other work on liquid membrane systems using the sole green membrane phase formulation for metal removal has been reported except for this work 4 conclusions investigation of the design parameters of pkfad based blm revealed that four impeller blades improved the percentage of stripping recovery and enrichment factor moreover the system without baffles showed better results than that with baffles due to the formation of fewer dead zones improvement in the stirring speed reduced the membrane boundary layer thickness that enhanced the cu ii transport efficiency meanwhile enhancement in buffer solution concentration minimized the ph changes in the feed phase that favoured cu ii extraction pkfad based blm could separate cu ii selectively from actual electroplating wastewater containing multi metal ions with an extraction of 92 89 stripping 82 recovery and an enrichment factor of 1 6 however future studies to enhance the enrichment factor of pkfad based blm should be performed before this innovation of blm based on sole green membrane formulation could be a new prospect for minimizing the use of hazardous

12978,this study focus on the development of palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad based on a bulk liquid membrane blm as a green membrane for the separation of cu ii from wastewater pkfad was used as a sole membrane solution without the addition of extractant and or modifier which reduced the consumption of hazardous chemicals and favoured the environment the effects of design number of stirrer blades and baffles and operating stirring speed buffer solution concentration and operating time parameters on the simultaneous extraction and stripping of cu ii across pkfad based blm as well as its overall recovery were investigated to get optimal metal ions recovery to examine the practical applicability the selectivity of pkfad based blm in separating cu ii was tested using electroplating

wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bulk liquid membrane green extractant palm kernel fatty acid distillate metal recovery selectivity 1 introduction the extensive application of cu ii in many industries including electrical and electronics metal finishing batteries paints automobiles construction etc 1 2 has led to the contamination of cu ii in water bodies that threaten the health of living organisms 1 hence throughout the last several decades numerous investigations have been devoted to removing cu ii from aqueous solutions using various methods e g chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation ion exchange membrane separation and adsorption 3 11 among these methods membrane separation for example has a lot of potential because of its high efficiency low energy consumption flexibility and ease of operation and the need for a little floor area 12 traditional solid polymeric membranes on the other hand have a number of problems including membrane fouling limited permeability and low selectivity 13 of late there has been growing interest in using liquid membranes i e membranes made of liquid to separate various solutes from aqueous solutions 12 14 the motivation behind the choice of liquid membranes over solid membranes is the endeavor to achieve a higher membrane fluxsince the diffusion coefficient in liquids is much higher than that in solids 15 other strengths of liquid membranes include simultaneous extraction stripping of solutes in a single unit non equilibrium mass transfer high selectivity along with recovery and low energy consumption 16 18 among the different liquid membranes bulk liquid membrane blm consists of an aqueous feed phase and an aqueous strip phase separated by a bulk organic membrane phase which has gained immense popularity owing to its simplicity and superior membrane stability 16 it is widely used for the separation and purification of various solutes from aqueous solutions as well as for their recovery and preconcentration 19 20 blm has been used for treatment and recovery of pollutants such as cu ii 17 21 cr iv 22 mn ii 23 cd ii 24 and fe ii 23 however most of the membrane phases of blms are formulated either by sole petroleum based organic solvents or mixed petroleum based and green organic solvents 12 25 the membranes based on sole green organic solvents are relatively scarce therefore attention has been paid to the use of green organic solvents for the preparation of a bulk liquid membrane blm recently a processing residue from palm kernel oil refinery namely palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad was used successfully as a novel low cost and environmentally benign organic solvent for cu ii extraction from aqueous solutions by our research team 26 28 pkfad is a lipid material rich in free fatty acid ffa 90 wt with its green credentials such as low vapor pressure 1 0 mmhg 75 c high flash point 150 c non flammable and low toxicity 29 previously we discovered that pkfad with ffas as the active components could extract up to 98 of cu ii from aqueous solutions by a cation exchange mechanism through a solvent extraction system 26 the optimum conditions for cu ii extraction from aqueous solutions by pkfad and for cu ii stripping from cu ii loaded pkfad had also been determined 26 herein pkfad was used to formulate the membrane phase of a blm namely pkfad based blm contributing to the development of blms based on sole green organic solvents the effects of design number of stirrer blades and baffles and operating stirring speed buffer solution concentration

in fig 1 it consists of a cylindrical glass vessel with a height of 10 5 cm inner diameter of 8 7 cm the vessel contains two equal volume compartments separated by a 6 0 cm high glass divider and the interior wall of each compartment was installed with a removable cylindrical glass baffle of 8 mm diameter a half cylinder glass block with a radius of 4 35 cm and a height of 3 0 cm was placed vertically in one of the compartments to reduce its volume the bigger compartment was filled with an aqueous feed phase 170 ml and the smaller one with the half cylinder glass block with an aqueous strip phase 85 ml to enhance the enrichment effect a volume of pkfad 85 ml was poured over both the aqueous feed and strip phases functioning as the organic membrane phase the feed phase contained an initial cu ii concentration of 100 mg l and na2so4 200 mm which was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of cuso4 5h2o and na2so4 in an acetate buffer solution of ph 4 7 26 whereas the strip phase was prepared using 1 m formic acid solution 26 the extraction process occurred at the feed membrane interface while the back extraction or stripping process occurred at the strip membrane interface the buffer solution was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of 0 2 m acetic acid and 0 2 m sodium acetate each of the phases was stirred by overhead mechanical stirrers ika rw20 at the same speed with the feed and strip phases stirred by one stirrer each while the membrane phase was by two stirrers the pkfad based blm vessel was placed in a water bath covered with aluminum foil on

feed m i feed 100 2 s m f strip m i feed m f feed 100 3 r m f strip m i feed 100 where m i feed and m f feed are the initial and final masses of cu ii respectively in the aqueous feed phase m f strip is the final mass of cu ii in the aqueous strip phase substituted eq 1 and eq 2 into eq 3 and the final relation of e s and r were obtained as below 4 r e x s the above eq 4 shows that the r was directly depending with both e and s while the increment of e and or s will rise the r value and vice versa the enrichment factor en of cu ii was calculated by eq 5 31 5 en cu f strip cu i feed where cu f strip and cu i feed is the final concentration of cu ii in the aqueous strip phase and initial concentration of cu ii in the aqueous feed phase respectively all experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate at room temperature 25 c and the relative standard deviation between replicate samples within an experiment range was less than 5 2 3 1 study of design parameters two design parameters of pkfad based blm namely number of stirrer blades and use of baffles were explored into their effects on e eq 1 s eq 2 r eq 3 and en eq 5 of cu ii a glass flat blade type of stirrer was used in this study with the stirrer having the same stirrer blade diameter and blade width but different the numbers of blades i e two and four blades were used to study the effect of number of stirrer blades both of the stirrers were rotated at the same speed 150 rpm throughout the experiments two removable cylindrical glass baffles extending through the feed strip and membrane phases were mounted on the interior wall of blm to study the effect of baffles as shown in fig 1 all the experiments were run for 7 h while maintaining the ph of the feed phase at 4 7 with 0 2 m acetate buffer solution the optimum design parameters that achieved the highest e s r and en of cu ii across pkfad based blm were used for further studies 2 3 2 study of operating parameters three operating parameters of pkfad based blm namely stirring speed 110 270 rpm buffer solution concentration 0 1 1 0 m and operating time 0 24 h were investigated on their effects on e eq 1 s eq 2 r eq 3 and en eq 5 of cu ii the relationship between stirring speed and the stirrer reynold s number re is given by 32 6 re ρnd 2 μ where ρ is the fluid density kg m3 n is the stirring speed rad s d is the diameter of the stirrer m and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid pa s 2 3 3 study of diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm system the diffusion rate of cu ii through the pkfad based blm were studied at the optimum design and operating parameters condition samples were taken from both the aqueous phases feed and strip at regular time intervals the diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm can be expressed by the following differential equations 33 34 7 d r f dt k 1 r f 8 dr m dt ξk 1 r f λk 2 r m 9 dr s dt k 2 r m where r f r m and r s are the instantaneous reduced concentrations of cu ii in the feed membrane and strip phases respectively k 1 and k 2 are the apparent first and second order rate constants for the extraction and stripping processes respectively ξ and λ are the volume ratios of the feed to membrane phase and the strip to membrane phase respectively the value of ξ 2 and λ 1 were used in this study the integration of eqs 7 to 9 gives rise to 10 r f exp k 1 t 11 r m ξ k 1 λk 2 k 1 exp k 1 t exp λk 2 t 12 r s ξ λ ξ λ λk 2 k 1 λk 2 exp k 1 t k 1 exp λk 2 t a numerical analysis by fitting a non linear curve using the solver function of the microsoft excel program microsoft office 2016 was used to determine the value of k 1 and k 2 the value k 1 was directly obtained by iteration from eq 10 this value was introduced as a constant value in eqs 11 and 12 and iterations were carried out to determine the value of k 2m and k 2s respectively the overall k 2 value was obtained from the average value of k 2m and k 2s 2 3 4 wastewater sample collection and analysis the wastewater sample was collected from a local electroplating plant and stored in a refrigerator before use the ph turbidity and conductivity of the wastewater sample were measured with a ph meter hanna instruments hi11310 a turbidity meter hach 2100q and a conductivity meter hach ec5 respectively while the concentrations of cu ii ni ii co ii and cr vi were analyzed by faas other parameters were analyzed according to the standard method american public health association apha i e apha 4500 cn c f cyanide apha 4500 cl c chloride apha 3111 b sodium potassium apha 419 d 14th nitrate and apha 4500 so4 e sulfate 35 different physicochemical characteristics of the electroplating wastewater are presented in table 2 2 3 5 selectivity study the selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation was examined with an actual electroplating wastewater sample as described in section 2 3 4 the sample was directly used without any pretreatment except the addition of an appropriate amount of sodium acetate and acetic acid which act as buffer solution at a concentration of 0 2 m and ph of 4 7 the e s r and en were calculated by eqs 1 2 3 and 5 respectively while the cu ii separation factors sf cu x was calculated by the following equation 31 13 s f cu x c cu c x f strip c cu c x i feed where c cu represents the concentration m of cu ii c x represents the concentration m of other metal ions while c f strip and c i feed are the final concentration of metal ions in the strip phase and the initial concentration of metal ions in the feed phase respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of suitable design parameters for pkfad based blm 3 1 1 the effect of the number of stirrer blades conventionally both the aqueous and organic phases of a blm require mixing to stirrer at an appropriate intensity to avoid emulsion formation moreover one of the primary factors governing the mixing intensity of a stirrer at a certain speed is its number of blades 36 in this work two similar flat blade stirrers with two and four blades respectively were employed to investigate their effects on the e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm and the obtained results are shown in fig 2 the results revealed that the e obtained by using two 92 and four 93 stirrer blades were comparable with each other but the s achieved using two stirrer blades was considerably lower 50 than that attained with four stirrer blades 62 the nearly twice as high the of e was achieved compared to the s obtained with both two and four stirrer blades suggests that the rate of the extraction process in pkfad based blm was much higher than that of the stripping process this result was consistent with the findings obtained by chang et al 21 who reported a higher rate of the extraction process than that of the stripping process in soybean oil based blms the higher rate of the extraction process was attributed to the mass transfer from a lower to a higher viscosity fluid phase while the slower rate of the stripping process was ascribed to the mass transfer from higher to lower viscosity fluid phase 21 the enhanced of s with the number of stirrer blades may be explained by the increasing the flow guidance and decreasing the slipping 37 that led to the uniformity of the flow and the homogeneous distribution of cu ii ffa complexes in the membrane phase thus improvement in the mobility of cu ii ffa complexes and accelerating their decomplexation was observed at the strip membrane interface the r was found to be increased with increasing both e and s which were consistent with eq 4 whereas the r value increased from 47 to 58 with an increase in the number of blades meanwhile the en also increase from 0 9 two blade to 1 2 four blade which was about double from the r value obtained since stirrers with four blades showed a higher r and en than the two blades fig 2 thus stirring with four blades was chosen for further studies 3 1 2 the effect of baffles baffles are commonly installed on the side of a mixing tank to prevent swirling in the bulk fluid and promote the fluid circulation between the top and bottom of the tank to enhance the mixing and process efficiencies 38 in this work the effect of baffles on the percentage of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm was investigated and the obtained results are shown in fig 3 the results showed that there was no significant difference in the e 93 obtained between cases without and with baffles but not the of s that achieved without baffles 62 was much higher than that attained with baffles 49 this could be explained due to the higher rate of extraction process than the stripping process as mention in section 3 1 1 the deterioration in the content of s observed when baffles were employed may be explained from the addition dead zones formed with the present of the buffer as illustrated in fig 4 the dead zones increased unmixed fluid volumes in pkfad based blm generating a negative impact on the mixing efficiency and reducing the transport of cu ii from the membrane to the strip phase the higher of s achieved without baffles resulting corresponding higher r 58 and en 1 2 while the lower of s was obtained with baffles led to the lower r 46 and en 0 91 since the use of baffles did not favor the r and en fig 3 the blm system without baffles was considered for next studies on operating parameters and selectivity 3 2 the effect of operating parameters on cu ii transport through pkfad based blm system 3 2 1 the effect of stirring speed there is general agreement that stirring speed plays a vital role in affecting the transport efficiency of solutes through a blm 14 39 42 hence the effect of stirring speed 110 270 rpm on the transport of cu ii through pkfad based blm was examined and the of e s r and en obtained were shown in fig 5 the buffer solution concentration of 0 2 m and operating time of 7 h were employed throughout the experiments generally the e remained virtually unchanged at about 90 from 110 to 220 rpm however it declined gradually thereafter while the of s increased dramatically from 25 at 110 rpm to 94 at 220 rpm before leveling off both the obtained corresponding of r and en exhibited a similar trend where they rose to a high point and peaked at 220 rpm r of 89 and en of 1 8 before falling steadily the variations of re with stirring speed for the feed membrane and strip phases of pkfad based blm were also computed with eq 6 and depicted in fig 6 a the results of figs 5 and 6 suggest that the higher of e and lower of s were achieved at the stirring speeds below 220 rpm it might be due to the transfer of cu ii from a higher re feed phase to a lower re membrane phase and from a lower re membrane phase to a higher re strip phase respectively intuitively the higher re feed and strip phases developed thinner feed and strip boundary layers next to the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces respectively however the lower re membrane phase induced thicker membrane boundary layers next to the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces 14 18 fig 6 b accordingly the thinner feed boundary layer facilitated the diffusion of cu ii from the feed to the membrane phase and led to a higher of e while the thicker membrane boundary layer inhibited the cu ii diffusion from the membrane to the strip phase resulting in a lower of s however there was reason to believe that the thickness of the membrane boundary layer decreased with stirring speed fig 6 b which explains the steep rise of s with stirring speed at 220 rpm fig 5 meanwhile at speed 220 rpm the feed membrane and strip membrane interfaces were disrupted by the elevated stirring speeds causing the feed and strip phases to spill over the glass divider to the other compartment of pkfad based blm fig 1 consequently the ph of the feed phase altered from ph 4 4 at 110 rpm to ph 4 0 and ph 3 7 at 230 and 270 rpm not shown in this paper respectively however the ph of the aqueous strip phase reminds constant throughout the stripping process this impacted the of e negatively due to the ph dependent nature of the extraction process 43 but it was not affecting the of s owing to the insignificant change in the ph of the strip phase these findings are in good agreement with previously reported work by madaeni et al 40 and soniya and muthuraman 44 since the stirring speed of 220 rpm achieved the highest of r and en fig 5 it was selected for further studies 3 2 2 the effect of buffer solution concentration according to eq 14 two moles of h are produced when one mole of cu ii is removed from the feed phase of pkfad based blm causing a reduction in the ph of the feed phase and thus the of e as mass transfer proceeds 45 46 14 cu aq 2 2 n 2 hr 2 org k ex cur 2 hr n org 2 h aq where aq and org are the aqueous and organic phases respectively hr 2 denotes the dimeric form of ffa molecules in pkfad cur 2 hr n denotes the cu ii ffa complex produced n is a stoichiometric constant and k ex is the reaction s equilibrium constant therefore it was necessary to maintain the feed phase at the desired ph of 4 7 by adding an acetate buffer solution 47 the effect of buffer solution concentration on the of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm and the ph changes of the feed phase due to the released of h during the extraction process cation exchange is shown in fig 7 throughout the studies a 220 rpm stirring speed and a 7 hour operation time were used the obtained results revealed that the of e increased substantially from 77 to 88 at buffer solution concentrations from 0 1 to 0 2 m followed by a gradual rise to 92 at 0 3 m and then reached a plateau before falling a little to 89 at 1 0 m meanwhile the of s stayed constant at about 94 from 0 1 to 0 5 m of buffer solution concentrations but fell slightly at buffer solution concentrations of 0 7 m and above the trends of the corresponding of r and en coincided with each other where they first rose at buffer solution concentrations from 0 1 to 0 2 m then plateaued out until 0 5 m and finally declined at 1 0 m meanwhile the changes in the ph of the feed phase decreased with buffer solution concentration fig 7 this was expected since the buffer capacity increased with increasing concentration thus restricting its ph s change 47 the highest ph change 0 9 at the buffer solution concentration of 0 1 m reduced the ph of the feed phase from 4 7 to 3 8 and deteriorated the of e fig 7 and this is consistent with our previous finding 26 meanwhile the small ph changes of 0 4 at buffer solution concentrations of 0 3 0 7 m did not affect the of e 92 93 due to the insignificant ph changes in the feed phase however e declined at 1 0 m buffer solution concentration despite the slight ph change 0 1 the latter could be deduced from the increasing mass transfer resistance caused by the saturation effect of the acetate buffer solution in the feed phase at 1 0 m since buffer solution concentrations more than 0 2 m did not enhance the of r and en significantly thus buffer solution concentration of 0 2 m was selected for further studies 3 2 3 the effects of operating time the effect of operating time on the of e s r and en of cu ii through pkfad based blm is shown in fig 8 the stirring speed and buffer solution concentration of 220 rpm and 0 2 m respectively were used throughout the experiments as can be seen in fig 8 the of e achieved 87 during the first hour of operation and 90 in 3 h before reaching a plateau while the of s achieved 94 in 7 h and stabilized out these findings justify the earlier conjectures about the possibility of a higher extraction rate than the stripping rate as discussed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 since the of r and en remained steady at 87 and 1 74 respectively in 7 h of operation the operating time of 7 h was selected for further studies 3 3 investigation on the diffusion rate of cu ii through pkfad based blm system the variation of r f r m and r s with time is as shown in fig 9 in general r f reduced exponentially with time r m initially increased and reached a maximum before declining slowly and r s followed an increasing sigmoid curve table 3 shows the k 1 and k 2 values obtained from this research the k 1 value was much higher than the k 2 value implying that the stripping process limited the transport of cu ii across pkfad based blm these results agree well with the earlier conjecture about the higher cu ii extraction rate than its stripping rate through pkfad based blm discussed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 the lower stripping rate might be due to the higher viscosity of the membrane phase than that of the aqueous feed phase 32 vs 0 89 mpa s 25 c 48 thus hindering the transport of the cu ii ffa complexes extracted species across the membrane phase and retarding the decomplexation reaction of cu ii at the membrane strip interface this finding agrees well with that of other works and a comparison between the kinetic constants obtained from this work with those from other previous works is as given in table 3 overall all the kinetic studies had a lower k 2 than k 1 as shown in table 3 3 4 selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from electroplating wastewater industrial wastewater usually contains multi metal such as cu ii ni ii co ii zn ii cd ii pb ii fe ii etc on top of other cations and anions depending on the specific sources and types of the industries 1 53 54 the separation selectivity of a separator for particular metal ions over others is an important trait for the purification and preconcentration of metal ions for recovery purposes hence the selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from actual electroplating wastewater was investigated using the optimum design and operating parameters as determined earlier in sections 3 1 and 3 2 and the obtained results are shown in fig 10 the results show e of cu ii increased rapidly at first and then leveled out towards a maximum of 92 while both the s and r of cu ii increased gradually until they reached to 89 and 82 respectively these results were comparable with the of e 93 s 94 and r 87 as obtained using synthetic single cu ii solution fig 8 meanwhile the of r for other metal ions were less than 10 i e 7 co ii 6 ni ii and 2 cr vi this indicates a high selectivity of pkfad based blm for cu ii separation from the actual electroplating wastewater suggesting that cu ii is inclined to form more stable complexes with ffas than other metal ions co ii ni ii and cr vi under the optimum design and operating conditions based on the selectivity of pkfad based blm it can be employed quantitatively with sf cu x calculated by eq 13 the obtained values of sf cu x 1 in all experimental ranges studied indicate a good selectivity of cu ii separation from multi metal solutions containing co ii ni ii and cr vi as shown in fig 10 b in general the value of sf cu co and sf cu cr increased with operating time however sf cu ni declined with it meanwhile the highest sf cu co of 11 and sf cu cr of 43 were achieved at 7 h and sf cu ni of 30 at 1 h the increasing order of sf cu x is follows as sf cu co sf cu ni sf cu cr similar results were also reported by parhi and sarangi 55 prakorn et al 56 and park and kim 57 have separated the cu ii from co ii ni ii and cr vi using a supported or emulsion liquid membrane using lix 84 i and cyanex 301 as the extractants respectively meanwhile to quantify the preconcentration degree of cu ii in pkfad based blm en was computed with eq 5 and the results are as shown in fig 10 b the substantial increment of en from 0 4 at 1 h to 1 6 at 7 h could be ascribed to the smaller strip to feed phase volume ratio of 1 2 used fig 1 however the maximum en value of 1 6 obtained in this work is low compared to the en values reported in other previous studies e g 10 19 and 12 31 this could be attributed to the strip to feed volume ratio of 1 2 applied that was not low enough to preconcentrate cu ii in the strip phase it is suggested for further studies to reduce the strip to feed volume ratio of pkfad based blm further to enhance the en value overall pkfad was successfully applied as a sole green membrane phase in the blm system and was able to remove cu ii from a single and multi metal solution with 92 and 87 of cu ii removal and recovery respectively this result is comparable with previous studies that used sole petroleum or mixed green petroleum based membrane phases for removing cu ii in various liquid membrane systems table 4 to date no other work on liquid membrane systems using the sole green membrane phase formulation for metal removal has been reported except for this work 4 conclusions investigation of the design parameters of pkfad based blm revealed that four impeller blades improved the percentage of stripping recovery and enrichment factor moreover the system without baffles showed better results than that with baffles due to the formation of fewer dead zones improvement in the stirring speed reduced the membrane boundary layer thickness that enhanced the cu ii transport efficiency meanwhile enhancement in buffer solution concentration minimized the ph changes in the feed phase that favoured cu ii extraction pkfad based blm could separate cu ii selectively from actual electroplating wastewater containing multi metal ions with an extraction of 92 89 stripping 82 recovery and an enrichment factor of 1 6 however future studies to enhance the enrichment factor of pkfad based blm should be performed before this innovation of blm based on sole green membrane formulation could be a new prospect for minimizing the use of hazardous

12979,heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops are promising to generate reactive oxygen species ros for the destruction of aqueous organic pollutants via peroxymonosulfate pms activation however practical treatment suffers from both mass transfer limitations and the drawback of heterogeneous catalyst herein we overcame the challenges by dispersing cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated nitrogen doped carbon shells co n c within the pores of ultrafiltration membrane uniformly and tightly the nitrogen doped carbon shells not only provided electron to active pms but also suppressed the

remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic membrane nitrogen doped carbon instantaneous degradation advanced oxidation process 1 introduction recently with the dwindling of water the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environments has emerged as a major concern 1 2 tetracycline hydrochloride tc is widely used in veterinary medicine and is discharge to the environment

transition metals tms and metal oxides are considered to be an exciting alternative which is more economical compared to the energy based methods such as ultrasound uv etc 11 12 carbon based material catalysts were extensively studied because of the unique electron transfer properties 13 15 moreover some studies proved that doping nitrogen could adjust the chemical property of graphitic shell and provide abundant new active sites 16 17 tms nanoparticles encapsulated nitrogen doped carbon shells tms n c with elaborated structures could perform efficient catalytic performance and avoid metal ions leaching wang et al designed cobalt and nitrogen co doped porous carbon that was highly efficient than co c and homogeneous co2 for activating pms to remove phenol 18 xue et al probed the different physics and catalytic properties of co n c nanoparticles that were produced by pyrolyzing zif 67 at different temperature 19 though the carbon shells could suppress the aggregation the nanoparticles agglomerate inevitably which affects catalytic activity and the poisonous metal leaching was also the problem need to solve of the heterogeneous catalyst membrane separation is widely used in wastewater treatment owing to the advantage of easy operation and high selectivity 20 21 and due to the tortuous pathways of membrane pore size the enhanced mass transfer which depends on mass flow offers high reaction efficiency now the catalytic membrane coupling of aops and membrane separation processes has become an emerging water treatment technology 3 22 25 the catalytic membrane not only solves the shortcoming of membrane for small molecular contamination but also overcomes the aggregation and re utilization of nano catalysts for practice use li et al built poly dopamine and zif 67 decorated polypropylene membrane with catalysis property and excellent membrane properties 26 there are high loading cites of catalysts in the membrane pores improving the catalytic efficiency due to the enhanced mass transfer the mass transfer enhancement is because of the tortuous pathways of the membrane pores which could high efficiently concentrate and converse pollutants 27 constructing a membrane with suitable structure to load nano catalysts is the key to accomplish high and constant catalytic performances 28 lin et al enable in situ growth of prussian blue micro crystals in the pvdf membrane micro clusters which achieved the high degradation efficient and instantaneous decomposing of multiple pollutants 29 however due to its narrowed pore congested by nanoparticles more catalyst loading would make catalytic membrane flux lower which is an important factor in the practical operation what s more metal ion leaching of transitional metal catalyst significantly affects its stability and may cause secondly pollution embedding metal catalyst on porous carbon shell could not only optimize the stability of the catalyst but also enhance catalytic activity due to the accelerated interaction between metal sites and carbon shell besides carbon based catalytic often possesses attractive hydrophilicity which is beneficial to improve the permeability of membranes in this paper co n c nanoparticles were synthesized by pyrolyzing zif 67 nanocrystals and then doped in pvdf membrane for wastewater treatment via synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation separation and adsorption pvdf co n c catalytic membrane achieved high removal efficiency of tc with negligible leaching of co treating simulated wastewater including tc and humid acid ha simultaneously the effect of different operation conditions to the degradation was investigated we identified the ros involved and proposed reaction mechanisms of co n c for pms activation radicals and nonradicals pathways were both verified and 1o2 was major contributor finally we explored the degradation sites of tc and possible degradation pathways by dft calculation this work is meaningful for the application of these novel catalytic membranes in practical applications 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and experimental methods we pyrolyzed zif 67 to prepare co n c nanoparticles and doped the nanoparticles in the membrane scheme s1 the specific prepare processes are in the supplementary material 2 2 performance of catalyst particles the catalytic performance was evaluated by the removal ratio and removal rapid of the tc via pms activation 0 01 g catalyst was put into the 100 ml 20 ppm tc solution simultaneously with magnetic stirring under a 25 c water bath after rotated for 30 min we could get the adsorption performance of catalyst nanoparticles then we added 1 0 mm pms into the solution and withdrew quantitative solution to test at certain time intervals the concentration of tc could be measured using the uv vis spectroscope with the wavelength at 357 nm besides the tc degradation reaction could be approximated as first order reaction the kinetics equation was used to analyze the reaction rate eq 1 1 ln c c 0 kt where c 0 is the initial concentration of tc solution mg l 1 and c is the tested one k means the reaction rate constant min 1 t means the reaction time min 2 3 evaluation of membrane performance the degradation experiments of tc were used a homemade cross flow filtration device under cyclic conditions shown in fig s1 batch experiments were carried out to get the degradation efficiency of tc solution under different conditions pms dosage tc concentration ph temperature etc the water flux was measured to clarify the permeability of the cm using a homemade cross flow model after 30 min pre compaction of the membranes at 0 12 mpa the pressure was decreased to 0 1 mpa and pure water flux j of the membrane was recorded according to eq 2 2 j v a t where j

anti fouling property of membranes and calculated using 5 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology of catalytic particles the morphology of zif 67 and co n c are shown in fig 1a b it can be seen that the zif 67 were regular dodecahedron morphology with a diameter about 300 nm in addition the ft ir diagram further shows the con bonding characteristic peak of zif 67 nanoparticles shown in fig s2 after the pyrolyzing it could be observed that the dodecahedron structure of zif 67 was not collapsed and the dispersed co n c particles with a size around 20 nm were stacked on the surface compared to zif 67 the pyrolyzed catalyst provided higher surface area fig 1c shows the tem image of co n c particles further confirming the morphology it was found that nanoparticles exhibited good sphericity with a particle size around 20 nm which was consistent with the sem result fig 1d exhibits the hrtem image of co n c manifesting that co nanoparticle was well coated with a graphite carbon shell with a typical core shell structure which was beneficial for enhanced stability to suppress the leaching of metal moreover the hrtem analysis demonstrates ca 0 21

illustrate the uniform distribution of the co o n in nanocrystals the xrd patterns of the catalytic particles are displayed in fig 2a in which the peaks at 2θ 44 5 51 7 75 4 can be corresponding to 111 200 and 220 crystalline planes of the pure structure of co cx jcpds no 89 4307 respectively 32 and the existence of broad peak at 2θ 22 was due to the influence of si base in addition the peak centered at 26 can be ascribed to the typical amorphous carbon 002 plane jcpds no 75 1621 19 no other crystal peaks were discovered confirming the successful construction of co n c fig 2b displays the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of co n c particles with a typical type iv isotherm demonstrating the existence of a large number of disordered mesopores 33 the specific surface area ssa of

oxidation on the co particles surface 35 the n 1s spectrum in fig 2g was curve into three peaks located at 398 1 400 2 and 402 5 ev associating with pyridinic n 48 47 pyrrolic n 36 40 and graphitic n 15 13 respectively and of these types of n some researchers have proved that doping graphitic n can speed up the electron transfer in carbon materials which was beneficial to enhance the reactivity to activate pms 16 36 fig 2h provides the deconvolution of co 2p spectra a high resolution peaks of co 2p3 2 appeared at the binding energies of 777 9 779 5 ev corresponding to coo bond 8 73 and co0 91 27 which also indicated the weak surface oxidation of co atoms 37 the zero valent co has more rapid reaction rate with pms due to the unique electronic properties 36 3 2 catalytic evaluation of catalytic particles as shown in fig 3a the catalytic degradation efficiencies of co n c catalysts for tc removal via activation of pms were evaluated and control experiments were performed to compare the eliminating efficiencies of various catalytic system for tc the absorption of the tc on the catalyst surface was obviously neglectable with pms addition alone 40 of tc was removed in 60 min illustrating that self decomposition of pms also contributed a part to the tc degradation further in the system containing the co n c particles and pms a rapid degradation is observed with the activated pms removing 99 tc within 10 min pseudo first order kinetics equation of different system were fit to determine the kinetic constant of the tc degradation and exhibited in fig 3b the k value of co n c pms system was 0 55 min 1 larger than that of pms and only co n c system demonstrating the ultrafast catalytic efficiencies of the catalyst pms system 3 3 separation performance and permeability of cm with regards to the membrane technology to treat wastewater it is significant to examine the separation performance and the permeability which determine the cleaning efficiency of the wastewater 38 for the mixed matrix cm we should determine the effect of the addition of the mixed co n c particles therefore we carried out experiments to examine the effect of different amount of co n c on the cm fig s3 shows the sem images of the membranes cross section with different co n c content it is clearly observed that there is an asymmetric structure in the cross sectional sem images between the dense top layer and the cell pores bottom support the sublayer with finger like pores made the membrane flux larger the sem images showed that pvdf membranes loaded with co n c particles have longer finger like pores with thinner cell like bottom support as co n c introduced the viscosity of casting solution increased as a result the elongation of finger like channels and the enlargement of visible pores on surface are obtained and the surface pores are larger and denser than those of pvdf membrane too fig s4 the hydrophilicity effect of co n c could increase the exchange phase inversion making the membrane have a higher porosity fig 4a 39 40 but when the co n c content is greater than 3 wt the viscosity of the casting solution is higher reducing the porosity of the membrane 41 according to pore size distribution on the surface we could get the average pore size and size distribution table s2 the average surface pore size of pvdf co n c3 membrane was bigger than those of others the water flux of pvdf co n c3 636 0 l m 2 h 2 is larger than that of pvdf co n c5 389 5 l m 2 h 2 on account of a large number of co n c particles with a little decrease of ha rejection from 97 53 to 96 44 in addition the introduction of carbon materials also brings improvement in hydrophilicity the water contact angle decreasing from 112 to 55 fig s5 furthermore ft ir spectra of the pvdf and pvdf co n c membrane were added fig s6 it could be seen that there is no difference in the peaks between the membranes the particles of the mixed matrix membrane are embedded in the pores of the film and no obvious change after adding particles can be seen by the fi ir spectra 3 4 catalytic performance of cm the cm integrating aop and membrane process also performs excellent catalytic activity fig 5 presents the removal of tc in different systems with and without pms addition about 60 tc was removed in 60 min for the membrane in the absence of pms and the removal ratio was not much different between pvdf membrane with and without co n c we could infer that the adsorption of the membrane is the remove of tc is the main reason for the removal of tc with the existence of pms there was an increase in the removal of tc for pvdf membranes indicating that the pms self decomposition has a contribution to the tc degradation the increase in catalytic performance was mainly due to the existence of a large number of finger like pores which could enhance mass transfer of target organic matters and reactive oxygen species with the instantaneous degradation of organic contaminant the tc removal efficiency of pvdf co n c catalytic membranes increased and over 90 removal of tc was achieved in 60 min as the content of co n c increases the removal efficiency of tc for pvdf co n c membranes was enhanced no matter the pvdf co n c3 or the pvdf co n c5 uf membranes the removal of tc was all up to 99 within 40 min though the initial tc removal rate of the membranes with more co n c was higher obviously and the total organic carbon toc removal of tc solution was tested to be 12 5 shown in fig s7 the optimizations of different parameters are depicted in fig 6 the effect of the pms dosage on the tc degradation was presented in fig 6a tc removal ratio was increased with increasing the pms dosage and when excessive pms dosage was added to the reaction system no significant improvement was observed the possible reason is that so4 would self quench under the excessive conditions 42 thus the final degradation efficiency was almost same when the pms dosage is more than 1 5 mm hence 1 5 mm pms was selected to further experiment the effect of the tc concentration on its degradation was shown in fig 6b the tc removal efficiency was reduced as the concentration of pollutants increases when the tc concentration was 10 or 20 mg l 1 almost 99 of the tc could be degraded eventually however when the pollution concentration reached 30 mg l 1 the final removal rate decreased to 90 these results demonstrated that the cm still presented excellent degradation efficiency at a higher tc concentration of 20 mg l 1 the effect of the temperature on the degradation was presented in fig 6c several researchers have found that higher temperature significantly accelerated the breaking of the o o bond in pms accelerating the generation of the active free radicals 6 as a result the tc degradation rate was greatly increased under high temperature the removal efficiency of tc was up to 99 in 15 min under 45 c fig 6d displays the effect of initial ph on tc removal in the pvdf co n c3 pms system before degradation reaction the tc solution was stirred for 30 min to investigate the hydrolysis of tc the result fig s8 showed that tc would remain stable under acidic conditions while tc would be hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions the hydrolysis rate at ph 11 76 tc rapidly hydrolyzed in 5 min is about the same as that at ph 9 the removal efficiency of tc was obviously constrained under acidic conditions the formation of cooh the key intermediate for pms activation to product reactive radicals was inhibited under acidic conditions resulting in a decreased of the degradation efficiency 43 there is little difference in the catalytic degradation rate under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions so the catalytic oxidation efficiency of the membrane for tc at ph 7 is better than that at weakly alkaline conditions as for the strong alkaline conditions because excessive oh in solution was beneficial to donate electrons compared with h2o pms activation could be facilitated 44 45 although the hydrolysis degree of tc under alkaline conditions is about the same an enhanced degradation performance also occurred at ph 11 3 5 stability recyclability and antifouling performance of cm to better demonstrate the superiorities of the cm in practical operation experiments were carried out to test the performance of cm fig 7a showed the excellent stability of the cm removing above 99 of the tc in the first cycle in the subsequent experiments the degradation efficiency of tc decreased slightly above 90 of tc still could be removed within 60 min in 5th cycle which reveals the good stability of the cm the decent stability of the cm not only comes from the stability of the co n c catalyst but because the catalysts can be adhered to the membrane channels making the catalysts difficult to lose as fig 7b shown the antifouling performance of the pvdf membrane and pvdf co n c3 catalytic membrane was studied by comparing the membrane flux recoveries after pms cleaning compared with that of pure water the normalized ha solution flux of pvdf membrane and cm decline significantly indicating that serious membrane fouling was caused by the blockage of pores deposited by pollutants in the membrane operation the reversible fouling can be easily removed and the irreversible fouling is tightly attached to the membrane surface and channels which is robust to remove 46 obviously after the intermittent cleaning process with pms the cm had a higher value of frr 85 3 in the first cycle than that of pvdf membrane 43 1 after 3 consecutive cycles the frr of cm is still larger than 70 proving that cm has good long term antifouling performance based on the antifouling experimental we could surmise that the strongly bound foulant were effectively degraded by the free radical that generated by the pms activation 3 6 evaluation of metal leaching property for cobalt based catalysts the leaching of cobalt ions would cause the secondary pollution issue toxic and carcinogenic the degradation performance of cm via pms activation and the leaching of ions were compared with other co based catalyst shown in table s3 as seen pvdf co n c membrane showed better catalytic performance than most of reported cobalt based catalysts and the co leaching of the cm is 0 07 mg l 1 better than most of supported co based catalysts we could prove that the composite membrane and the carbon shell were favorable for the declining of metal ions leaching 3 7 quenching experiments since pms activation can generate the radical and nonradical the useful pathways in the degradation processes should be identified we could use several scavengers to get the dominant ros in the further quenching experiments methanol meoh could be employed to scavenge so4 and oh because it could react to the radicals with high rate kso4 1 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 9 7 109 m 1 s 1 17 while tert butyl alcohol tba only could be used to quench oh because it has a good reactivity with oh k oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 47 furthermore p benzoquinone p bq was employed to scavenge o2 with the reaction rate constant of k 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 48 the quenching experiments adding different concentrate gradient scavenger was to get the main ros when amount of meoh and tba increased from 500 mm to 2000 mm 65 85 removed tc were reduced to 55 and 80 within 60 min respectively about 75 of removal efficiency was retained with 2 mm p bq and 70 tc was removed with 10 mm p bq added it was demonstrated that so4 was the dominant free radical for the nonradical species 1o2 was generally considered to be scavenged by ffa k 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 49 approximately 70 of tc was removed within 60 min with the addition of 2 mm ffa when the ffa was increased to 10 mm only 33 tc was removed the electron transfer between pms and carbon materials has been also regarded as an alternative pathway to active pms without radicals 46 50 yun et al demonstrated that the carbon nanotube cnt mediated electron transfer from contaminants to pms played major role for the degradation of contaminants 51 in order to examine the electron transfer pathway of pvdf co n c pms system we investigated the reaction between membrane and pms pms was added to the membrane system and tc was added after some minutes as shown in fig 8h the removal efficiency of tc was reduced after membrane operation only with pms if the electron transfer between tc and pms was the main pathway the pre reaction would not have a signification impact on the removal efficiency 47 the decreasing efficiency shown that co n c would activate pms to generate 1o2 which could be continuously consumed the results further confirmed that 1o2 dominated the non radical pathway besides it s confirmed that the doping nitrogen in carbon improving the conductivity is beneficial to generate 1o2 compared with the cnt pms system 36 epr spectra in co n c pms system using dmpo for so4 oh and o2 and temp for 1o2 were shown in fig 8d f we could propose that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were all produced in the cm pms system in general the quenching experiments and epr spectra suggested that the pvdf co n c pms activates pms through two paths the pms accept an electron from catalyst to generate sulfate radicals so4 or hydroxyl radicals oh in the free radical pathway in the nonradical pathway the electron transfer process happens on carbon shell surface and singlet oxygen 1o2 is the dominant one what s more it could be detected that the nonradical degradation was the main pathway to degrade tc in the cm pms system 3 8 catalytic reaction mechanism and pathway based on the previous discussion we could get the contribution of free radicals and non radicals to the process of co n c activation of pms some previous studies have proved that the different nitrogen doped in carbon are favorable for the absorption of different substance graphitic n with high electronegativity could facilitate the adsorption of negatively charged hso5 52 and pyrrolic n could capture organic pollutants to react with radicals rapidly 36 besides the membrane pore could further concentrate the pollutants and oxidative radicals to enhance the catalytic efficiency the possible catalytic mechanisms of co n c were investigate through xps spectra of co n c before and after reaction for co 2p xps spectrum the proportion of zero valent cobalt decreased from 91 27 to 5 66 implying co0 was almost completely transformed into co2 fig 9a meanwhile the peak of co3 appeared and the relative content of co2 co3 after reaction was 57 62 36 71 indicating the existence of the redox cycle for n 1s the peak of graphitic n disappeared and the peak of oxidized n appeared after the reaction fig 9b the content of pyrrolic n increased from 36 40 to 59 43 while that of pyridinic n decreased from 48 47 to 21 95 relatively the change of relative content of different n states indicated that n species played an important role during the pms activation the zero valent cobalt could directly active pms to accelerate the generation of radicals releasing co2 eq 6 co2 reacted with pms and so4 was generated eq 7 and co3 could react with pms to generate co2 to accomplish the periodic cycle of co2 co3 what s more the core shell structure and membrane pores made that co3 was deposited with co0 to further obtain sufficient co2 eqs 8 and 9 so4 in aqueous solution would react with h2o oh to generate amount of oh eq 10 in addition the π electrons from the sp2 c could be activated by the lone pair electrons of the doping n 36 the n doped carbon shell was favor to enhance the catalytic activity to stimulate pms eq 11 electron transfer is an important reason for the formation process of o2 the reaction happened between oh and h2o2 which were intermediates in the pms activation process to generate perhydroxyl radicals ho2 eqs 12 and 13 then ho2 decomposed to generate radical o2 eq 14 pms anion radicals so5 were produced by the reduction of co3 eq 8 and then so5 could be further combined to form so4 2 ions and meanwhile produce 1o2 eq 15 moreover o2 could also interact with oh to generate 1o2 eqs 16 and 17 17 6 co 0 2 hso 5 co 2 2 so 4 2 oh 7 co 2 hso 5 co 3 so 4 oh 8 co 3 hso 5 co 2 so 5 h 9 co 0 2 co 3 3 co 2 10 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 oh 11 h so 5 e so 4 oh 12 hso 5 h 2 o h 2 o 2 hso 4 13 h 2 o 2 oh h 2 o ho 2 14 ho 2 h o 2 15 2 so 5 2 so 4 2 1 o 2 16 o 2 oh oh 1 o 2 17 2 o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 oh 1 o 2 18 ros tc intermediates co 2 h 2 o previous studies proved that the anions in the actual wastewater could react with the generated ros thereby affecting the catalytic activity of tc 53 the inhibitory effect of anions is due to not only the complex reaction with metal ions reducing the formation and substitution of intermediate products but also the reaction with free radicals to generate new free radicals with lower activity fig 10 shows that the effect of anions on the tc degradation the degradation efficiency of tc displayed the order of inhibitory effect on free radicals h2po4 cl hco3 the anions would quench the hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals and to produce weaker radicals while h2po4 could produce po4 2 in aops eqs 19 23 54 56 however the initial high degradation rate in the initial reaction may be due to the alkalinity of the solution with bicarbonate anion 19 cl oh so 4 so 4 2 cl hclo 20 cl cl cl 2 21 hco 3 oh so 4 2 co 3 22 hco 3 so 4 so 4 2 co 3 23 h 2 po 4 oh so 4 oh so 4 2 po 4 2 to better find out the possible degradation pathway of tc lc ms was carried out to analyze the intermediates of tc integrated with the favorable primary degradation sites from dft calculations we used b3lyp 6 3ug d p method by gaussian to conduct geometry optimization of tc and the three dimensional model of homo and lumo frontier orbits could indicate the orbital esp distribution fig s9 meanwhile theoretical calculation results reveal that co co and cn of tc have higher fukui function and lower esp value which were preferential attacked by ros table s4 integrated with the intermediates conducted by lc ms analysis the possible degradation pathways of tc were deduced as shown in fig s10 firstly tc is attacked by 1o2 and is converted into compound p1 m z 453 through demethylation p4 m z 436 p7 m z 340 p10 m z 274 and p13 m z 222 are generated through demethylation deamidation and ring opening reactions for second pathway p2 m z 430 and p5 m z 417 are produced by n demethylation of tc and through further ring opening p8 m z 362 p11 m z 318 p14 m z 222 are generated in third pathway p3 m z 432 is generated through dehydration process and p9 m z 316 p12 m z 274 p15 m z 206 are generated through the further n demethylation reaction and ring opening finally the intermediates would be further oxidized to generate small molecular organics even mineralized co2 and h2o 4 conclusion in this paper co n c nanocatalyst was synthesized via pyrolyzing zif 67 nano particles then co n c nanocatalyst was anchored in confined membrane pores for water instantaneous flowing decontamination the pvdf co c3 membrane was used to remediate wastewater by the combination of cross flow filtration and catalytic oxidation contaminant and ros were confined in the membrane pore to enhance mass transfer realizing the excellent instant degradation rate correspondingly the pvdf co c3 membrane was proved to possess excellent catalytic oxidation ability and separation performance with water flux 636 0 l m 2 h 1 the active species of so4 and 1o2 played dominate roles in catalytic oxidation the degradation sites were explored with density functional theory meanwhile the pvdf co c3 membrane also possessed good cycle stability and antifouling performance the pvdf co c3 pms system with catalyst constructed on pore has showed a prospective foreground for efficient wastewater treatment declaration of competing

12979,heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops are promising to generate reactive oxygen species ros for the destruction of aqueous organic pollutants via peroxymonosulfate pms activation however practical treatment suffers from both mass transfer limitations and the drawback of heterogeneous catalyst herein we overcame the challenges by dispersing cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated nitrogen doped carbon shells co n c within the pores of ultrafiltration membrane uniformly and tightly the nitrogen doped carbon shells not only provided electron to active pms but also suppressed the aggregation of the nanoparticles furthermore the co n c nanocatalysts were anchored in confined membrane pores to enhance the catalytic efficiency as expected the membrane pores concentrated the pollutant and reactive oxygen species leading excellent instantaneous decomposing rate the co n c doped polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf co n c membrane attained 99 3 tetracycline hydrochloride tc 20 mg l 1 degradation in 60 min remarkably since the higher hydrophilicity the permeation flux of pvdf co n c membrane was enhanced to 636 0 l m 2 h 1 improving the wastewater treatment efficiency the membrane flux recoveries rate was 85 and the degradation stability was excellent after pms based cleaning process in addition the degradation sites of tc and possible degradation pathways were explored with density functional theory dft calculations and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis this work provides the potential application of the catalytic membrane in water remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic membrane nitrogen doped carbon instantaneous degradation advanced oxidation process 1 introduction recently with the dwindling of water the presence of antibiotics in the aquatic environments has emerged as a major concern 1 2 tetracycline hydrochloride tc is widely used in veterinary medicine and is discharge to the environment from both human and agricultural sources because of the non biodegradable characters 3 4 the residues left in environment can develop antibiotic resistant pathogens and cause serious problems to human health 5 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are aqueous phase oxidation methods leading to partial oxidation and mineralization of pollutant 6 8 because of the redox cycle through the transition of electronic state the multivalent transition metals could accelerate peroxymonosulfate pms activation to generate reactive oxygen species ros 9 10 to generate the radical transition metals tms and metal oxides are considered to be an exciting alternative which is more economical compared to the energy based methods such as ultrasound uv etc 11 12 carbon based material catalysts were extensively studied because of the unique electron transfer properties 13 15 moreover some studies proved that doping nitrogen could adjust the chemical property of graphitic shell and provide abundant new active sites 16 17 tms nanoparticles encapsulated nitrogen doped carbon shells tms n c with elaborated structures could perform efficient catalytic performance and avoid metal ions leaching wang et al designed cobalt and nitrogen co doped porous carbon that was highly efficient than co c and homogeneous co2 for activating pms to remove phenol 18 xue et al probed the different physics and catalytic properties of co n c nanoparticles that were produced by pyrolyzing zif 67 at different temperature 19 though the carbon shells could suppress the aggregation the nanoparticles agglomerate inevitably which affects catalytic activity and the poisonous metal leaching was also the problem need to solve of the heterogeneous catalyst membrane separation is widely used in wastewater treatment owing to the advantage of easy operation and high selectivity 20 21 and due to the tortuous pathways of membrane pore size the enhanced mass transfer which depends on mass flow offers high reaction efficiency now the catalytic membrane coupling of aops and membrane separation processes has become an emerging water treatment technology 3 22 25 the catalytic membrane not only solves the shortcoming of membrane for small molecular contamination but also overcomes the aggregation and re utilization of nano catalysts for practice use li et al built poly dopamine and zif 67 decorated polypropylene membrane with catalysis property and excellent membrane properties 26 there are high loading cites of catalysts in the membrane pores improving the catalytic efficiency due to the enhanced mass transfer the mass transfer enhancement is because of the tortuous pathways of the membrane pores which could high efficiently concentrate and converse pollutants 27 constructing a membrane with suitable structure to load nano catalysts is the key to accomplish high and constant catalytic performances 28 lin et al enable in situ growth of prussian blue micro crystals in the pvdf membrane micro clusters which achieved the high degradation efficient and instantaneous decomposing of multiple pollutants 29 however due to its narrowed pore congested by nanoparticles more catalyst loading would make catalytic membrane flux lower which is an important factor in the practical operation what s more metal ion leaching of transitional metal catalyst significantly affects its stability and may cause secondly pollution embedding metal catalyst on porous carbon shell could not only optimize the stability of the catalyst but also enhance catalytic activity due to the accelerated interaction between metal sites and carbon shell besides carbon based catalytic often possesses attractive hydrophilicity which is beneficial to improve the permeability of membranes in this paper co n c nanoparticles were synthesized by pyrolyzing zif 67 nanocrystals and then doped in pvdf membrane for wastewater treatment via synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation separation and adsorption pvdf co n c catalytic membrane achieved high removal efficiency of tc with negligible leaching of co treating simulated wastewater including tc and humid acid ha simultaneously the effect of different operation conditions to the degradation was investigated we identified the ros involved and proposed reaction mechanisms of co n c for pms activation radicals and nonradicals pathways were both verified and 1o2 was major contributor finally we explored the degradation sites of tc and possible degradation pathways by dft calculation this work is meaningful for the application of these novel catalytic membranes in practical applications 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and experimental methods we pyrolyzed zif 67 to prepare co n c nanoparticles and doped the nanoparticles in the membrane scheme s1 the specific prepare processes are in the supplementary material 2 2 performance of catalyst particles the catalytic performance was evaluated by the removal ratio and removal rapid of the tc via pms activation 0 01 g catalyst was put into the 100 ml 20 ppm tc solution simultaneously with magnetic stirring under a 25 c water bath after rotated for 30 min we could get the adsorption performance of catalyst nanoparticles then we added 1 0 mm pms into the solution and withdrew quantitative solution to test at certain time intervals the concentration of tc could be measured using the uv vis spectroscope with the wavelength at 357 nm besides the tc degradation reaction could be approximated as first order reaction the kinetics equation was used to analyze the reaction rate eq 1 1 ln c c 0 kt where c 0 is the initial concentration of tc solution mg l 1 and c is the tested one k means the reaction rate constant min 1 t means the reaction time min 2 3 evaluation of membrane performance the degradation experiments of tc were used a homemade cross flow filtration device under cyclic conditions shown in fig s1 batch experiments were carried out to get the degradation efficiency of tc solution under different conditions pms dosage tc concentration ph temperature etc the water flux was measured to clarify the permeability of the cm using a homemade cross flow model after 30 min pre compaction of the membranes at 0 12 mpa the pressure was decreased to 0 1 mpa and pure water flux j of the membrane was recorded according to eq 2 2 j v a t where j is the water flux of membrane l m 2 h 1 v is the volume of permeate water l t is the filtration time h a is the effective membrane area 4 9 10 4 m2 membrane porosity φ was obtained using eq 3 3 φ m w m d ρ w ad where m w and m d g are the weight of wet and dry membrane respectively ρ w g cm 3 is the density of pure water a cm2 is the membrane area and d cm is the membrane thickness the ha rejection ratio of the catalytic membrane elucidated the separating performance to the wastewater treatment the ha solution was circulated in a cross flow model the concentration of ha could be measured using the uv vis spectroscope with the wavelength at 254 nm the ha rejection ratio r was calculated by 4 r c o c c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration of ha solution mg l 1 and c is the tested in the anti fouling experiments after 30 min pre compacted at 0 12 mpa the deionized water flux of membrane j w1 was measured at 0 1 mpa for 30 min then ha solution flux was measured for 30 min afterwards the fouled membrane was rinsed by pms solution the pure water flux of the recuperated membrane j w2 was recorded for another 30 min flux recovery rate frr was introduced to evaluate the anti fouling property of membranes and calculated using 5 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and morphology of catalytic particles the morphology of zif 67 and co n c are shown in fig 1a b it can be seen that the zif 67 were regular dodecahedron morphology with a diameter about 300 nm in addition the ft ir diagram further shows the con bonding characteristic peak of zif 67 nanoparticles shown in fig s2 after the pyrolyzing it could be observed that the dodecahedron structure of zif 67 was not collapsed and the dispersed co n c particles with a size around 20 nm were stacked on the surface compared to zif 67 the pyrolyzed catalyst provided higher surface area fig 1c shows the tem image of co n c particles further confirming the morphology it was found that nanoparticles exhibited good sphericity with a particle size around 20 nm which was consistent with the sem result fig 1d exhibits the hrtem image of co n c manifesting that co nanoparticle was well coated with a graphite carbon shell with a typical core shell structure which was beneficial for enhanced stability to suppress the leaching of metal moreover the hrtem analysis demonstrates ca 0 21 nm and 0 35 nm of the interplanar spacing corresponding to the 111 crystalline plane of zero valence co and the 002 crystalline plane of graphitic carbon 30 31 eds mappings of co n c shown in fig 1e illustrate the uniform distribution of the co o n in nanocrystals the xrd patterns of the catalytic particles are displayed in fig 2a in which the peaks at 2θ 44 5 51 7 75 4 can be corresponding to 111 200 and 220 crystalline planes of the pure structure of co cx jcpds no 89 4307 respectively 32 and the existence of broad peak at 2θ 22 was due to the influence of si base in addition the peak centered at 26 can be ascribed to the typical amorphous carbon 002 plane jcpds no 75 1621 19 no other crystal peaks were discovered confirming the successful construction of co n c fig 2b displays the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms of co n c particles with a typical type iv isotherm demonstrating the existence of a large number of disordered mesopores 33 the specific surface area ssa of the nanoparticles was given as 258 9 m2 g besides the pore size of co n c exhibited a range from 2 to 80 nm fig 2c the nanoparticles with high ssa exposed more active sites improving the catalytic efficiency the surface elemental composition and chemical states of co n c were further researched by xps analysis fig 2d it revealed that the prepared co n c mainly consisted of c 87 1 at n 5 18 at o 5 75 at and co 1 98 at elements as revealed in fig 2e the c 1s xps spectrum was deconvoluted into three peaks located at 284 78 285 3 and 287 1 ev corresponding to graphitic c cn and co respectively 34 as shown in fig 2f the high resolution spectrum peaks of o 1s located at 531 6 and 529 2 ev corresponding to hydroxyl oxygen oh 86 51 and lattice oxygen olatt 13 49 which indicates the slight oxidation on the co particles surface 35 the n 1s spectrum in fig 2g was curve into three peaks located at 398 1 400 2 and 402 5 ev associating with pyridinic n 48 47 pyrrolic n 36 40 and graphitic n 15 13 respectively and of these types of n some researchers have proved that doping graphitic n can speed up the electron transfer in carbon materials which was beneficial to enhance the reactivity to activate pms 16 36 fig 2h provides the deconvolution of co 2p spectra a high resolution peaks of co 2p3 2 appeared at the binding energies of 777 9 779 5 ev corresponding to coo bond 8 73 and co0 91 27 which also indicated the weak surface oxidation of co atoms 37 the zero valent co has more rapid reaction rate with pms due to the unique electronic properties 36 3 2 catalytic evaluation of catalytic particles as shown in fig 3a the catalytic degradation efficiencies of co n c catalysts for tc removal via activation of pms were evaluated and control experiments were performed to compare the eliminating efficiencies of various catalytic system for tc the absorption of the tc on the catalyst surface was obviously neglectable with pms addition alone 40 of tc was removed in 60 min illustrating that self decomposition of pms also contributed a part to the tc degradation further in the system containing the co n c particles and pms a rapid degradation is observed with the activated pms removing 99 tc within 10 min pseudo first order kinetics equation of different system were fit to determine the kinetic constant of the tc degradation and exhibited in fig 3b the k value of co n c pms system was 0 55 min 1 larger than that of pms and only co n c system demonstrating the ultrafast catalytic efficiencies of the catalyst pms system 3 3 separation performance and permeability of cm with regards to the membrane technology to treat wastewater it is significant to examine the separation performance and the permeability which determine the cleaning efficiency of the wastewater 38 for the mixed matrix cm we should determine the effect of the addition of the mixed co n c particles therefore we carried out experiments to examine the effect of different amount of co n c on the cm fig s3 shows the sem images of the membranes cross section with different co n c content it is clearly observed that there is an asymmetric structure in the cross sectional sem images between the dense top layer and the cell pores bottom support the sublayer with finger like pores made the membrane flux larger the sem images showed that pvdf membranes loaded with co n c particles have longer finger like pores with thinner cell like bottom support as co n c introduced the viscosity of casting solution increased as a result the elongation of finger like channels and the enlargement of visible pores on surface are obtained and the surface pores are larger and denser than those of pvdf membrane too fig s4 the hydrophilicity effect of co n c could increase the exchange phase inversion making the membrane have a higher porosity fig 4a 39 40 but when the co n c content is greater than 3 wt the viscosity of the casting solution is higher reducing the porosity of the membrane 41 according to pore size distribution on the surface we could get the average pore size and size distribution table s2 the average surface pore size of pvdf co n c3 membrane was bigger than those of others the water flux of pvdf co n c3 636 0 l m 2 h 2 is larger than that of pvdf co n c5 389 5 l m 2 h 2 on account of a large number of co n c particles with a little decrease of ha rejection from 97 53 to 96 44 in addition the introduction of carbon materials also brings improvement in hydrophilicity the water contact angle decreasing from 112 to 55 fig s5 furthermore ft ir spectra of the pvdf and pvdf co n c membrane were added fig s6 it could be seen that there is no difference in the peaks between the membranes the particles of the mixed matrix membrane are embedded in the pores of the film and no obvious change after adding particles can be seen by the fi ir spectra 3 4 catalytic performance of cm the cm integrating aop and membrane process also performs excellent catalytic activity fig 5 presents the removal of tc in different systems with and without pms addition about 60 tc was removed in 60 min for the membrane in the absence of pms and the removal ratio was not much different between pvdf membrane with and without co n c we could infer that the adsorption of the membrane is the remove of tc is the main reason for the removal of tc with the existence of pms there was an increase in the removal of tc for pvdf membranes indicating that the pms self decomposition has a contribution to the tc degradation the increase in catalytic performance was mainly due to the existence of a large number of finger like pores which could enhance mass transfer of target organic matters and reactive oxygen species with the instantaneous degradation of organic contaminant the tc removal efficiency of pvdf co n c catalytic membranes increased and over 90 removal of tc was achieved in 60 min as the content of co n c increases the removal efficiency of tc for pvdf co n c membranes was enhanced no matter the pvdf co n c3 or the pvdf co n c5 uf membranes the removal of tc was all up to 99 within 40 min though the initial tc removal rate of the membranes with more co n c was higher obviously and the total organic carbon toc removal of tc solution was tested to be 12 5 shown in fig s7 the optimizations of different parameters are depicted in fig 6 the effect of the pms dosage on the tc degradation was presented in fig 6a tc removal ratio was increased with increasing the pms dosage and when excessive pms dosage was added to the reaction system no significant improvement was observed the possible reason is that so4 would self quench under the excessive conditions 42 thus the final degradation efficiency was almost same when the pms dosage is more than 1 5 mm hence 1 5 mm pms was selected to further experiment the effect of the tc concentration on its degradation was shown in fig 6b the tc removal efficiency was reduced as the concentration of pollutants increases when the tc concentration was 10 or 20 mg l 1 almost 99 of the tc could be degraded eventually however when the pollution concentration reached 30 mg l 1 the final removal rate decreased to 90 these results demonstrated that the cm still presented excellent degradation efficiency at a higher tc concentration of 20 mg l 1 the effect of the temperature on the degradation was presented in fig 6c several researchers have found that higher temperature significantly accelerated the breaking of the o o bond in pms accelerating the generation of the active free radicals 6 as a result the tc degradation rate was greatly increased under high temperature the removal efficiency of tc was up to 99 in 15 min under 45 c fig 6d displays the effect of initial ph on tc removal in the pvdf co n c3 pms system before degradation reaction the tc solution was stirred for 30 min to investigate the hydrolysis of tc the result fig s8 showed that tc would remain stable under acidic conditions while tc would be hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions the hydrolysis rate at ph 11 76 tc rapidly hydrolyzed in 5 min is about the same as that at ph 9 the removal efficiency of tc was obviously constrained under acidic conditions the formation of cooh the key intermediate for pms activation to product reactive radicals was inhibited under acidic conditions resulting in a decreased of the degradation efficiency 43 there is little difference in the catalytic degradation rate under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions so the catalytic oxidation efficiency of the membrane for tc at ph 7 is better than that at weakly alkaline conditions as for the strong alkaline conditions because excessive oh in solution was beneficial to donate electrons compared with h2o pms activation could be facilitated 44 45 although the hydrolysis degree of tc under alkaline conditions is about the same an enhanced degradation performance also occurred at ph 11 3 5 stability recyclability and antifouling performance of cm to better demonstrate the superiorities of the cm in practical operation experiments were carried out to test the performance of cm fig 7a showed the excellent stability of the cm removing above 99 of the tc in the first cycle in the subsequent experiments the degradation efficiency of tc decreased slightly above 90 of tc still could be removed within 60 min in 5th cycle which reveals the good stability of the cm the decent stability of the cm not only comes from the stability of the co n c catalyst but because the catalysts can be adhered to the membrane channels making the catalysts difficult to lose as fig 7b shown the antifouling performance of the pvdf membrane and pvdf co n c3 catalytic membrane was studied by comparing the membrane flux recoveries after pms cleaning compared with that of pure water the normalized ha solution flux of pvdf membrane and cm decline significantly indicating that serious membrane fouling was caused by the blockage of pores deposited by pollutants in the membrane operation the reversible fouling can be easily removed and the irreversible fouling is tightly attached to the membrane surface and channels which is robust to remove 46 obviously after the intermittent cleaning process with pms the cm had a higher value of frr 85 3 in the first cycle than that of pvdf membrane 43 1 after 3 consecutive cycles the frr of cm is still larger than 70 proving that cm has good long term antifouling performance based on the antifouling experimental we could surmise that the strongly bound foulant were effectively degraded by the free radical that generated by the pms activation 3 6 evaluation of metal leaching property for cobalt based catalysts the leaching of cobalt ions would cause the secondary pollution issue toxic and carcinogenic the degradation performance of cm via pms activation and the leaching of ions were compared with other co based catalyst shown in table s3 as seen pvdf co n c membrane showed better catalytic performance than most of reported cobalt based catalysts and the co leaching of the cm is 0 07 mg l 1 better than most of supported co based catalysts we could prove that the composite membrane and the carbon shell were favorable for the declining of metal ions leaching 3 7 quenching experiments since pms activation can generate the radical and nonradical the useful pathways in the degradation processes should be identified we could use several scavengers to get the dominant ros in the further quenching experiments methanol meoh could be employed to scavenge so4 and oh because it could react to the radicals with high rate kso4 1 107 m 1 s 1 k oh 9 7 109 m 1 s 1 17 while tert butyl alcohol tba only could be used to quench oh because it has a good reactivity with oh k oh 6 108 m 1 s 1 47 furthermore p benzoquinone p bq was employed to scavenge o2 with the reaction rate constant of k 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 48 the quenching experiments adding different concentrate gradient scavenger was to get the main ros when amount of meoh and tba increased from 500 mm to 2000 mm 65 85 removed tc were reduced to 55 and 80 within 60 min respectively about 75 of removal efficiency was retained with 2 mm p bq and 70 tc was removed with 10 mm p bq added it was demonstrated that so4 was the dominant free radical for the nonradical species 1o2 was generally considered to be scavenged by ffa k 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 49 approximately 70 of tc was removed within 60 min with the addition of 2 mm ffa when the ffa was increased to 10 mm only 33 tc was removed the electron transfer between pms and carbon materials has been also regarded as an alternative pathway to active pms without radicals 46 50 yun et al demonstrated that the carbon nanotube cnt mediated electron transfer from contaminants to pms played major role for the degradation of contaminants 51 in order to examine the electron transfer pathway of pvdf co n c pms system we investigated the reaction between membrane and pms pms was added to the membrane system and tc was added after some minutes as shown in fig 8h the removal efficiency of tc was reduced after membrane operation only with pms if the electron transfer between tc and pms was the main pathway the pre reaction would not have a signification impact on the removal efficiency 47 the decreasing efficiency shown that co n c would activate pms to generate 1o2 which could be continuously consumed the results further confirmed that 1o2 dominated the non radical pathway besides it s confirmed that the doping nitrogen in carbon improving the conductivity is beneficial to generate 1o2 compared with the cnt pms system 36 epr spectra in co n c pms system using dmpo for so4 oh and o2 and temp for 1o2 were shown in fig 8d f we could propose that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were all produced in the cm pms system in general the quenching experiments and epr spectra suggested that the pvdf co n c pms activates pms through two paths the pms accept an electron from catalyst to generate sulfate radicals so4 or hydroxyl radicals oh in the free radical pathway in the nonradical pathway the electron transfer process happens on carbon shell surface and singlet oxygen 1o2 is the dominant one what s more it could be detected that the nonradical degradation was the main pathway to degrade tc in the cm pms system 3 8 catalytic reaction mechanism and pathway based on the previous discussion we could get the contribution of free radicals and non radicals to the process of co n c activation of pms some previous studies have proved that the different nitrogen doped in carbon are favorable for the absorption of different substance graphitic n with high electronegativity could facilitate the adsorption of negatively charged hso5 52 and pyrrolic n could capture organic pollutants to react with radicals rapidly 36 besides the membrane pore could further concentrate the pollutants and oxidative radicals to enhance the catalytic efficiency the possible catalytic mechanisms of co n c were investigate through xps spectra of co n c before and after reaction for co 2p xps spectrum the proportion of zero valent cobalt decreased from 91 27 to 5 66 implying co0 was almost completely transformed into co2 fig 9a meanwhile the peak of co3 appeared and the relative content of co2 co3 after reaction was 57 62 36 71 indicating the existence of the redox cycle for n 1s the peak of graphitic n disappeared and the peak of oxidized n appeared after the reaction fig 9b the content of pyrrolic n increased from 36 40 to 59 43 while that of pyridinic n decreased from 48 47 to 21 95 relatively the change of relative content of different n states indicated that n species played an important role during the pms activation the zero valent cobalt could directly active pms to accelerate the generation of radicals releasing co2 eq 6 co2 reacted with pms and so4 was generated eq 7 and co3 could react with pms to generate co2 to accomplish the periodic cycle of co2 co3 what s more the core shell structure and membrane pores made that co3 was deposited with co0 to further obtain sufficient co2 eqs 8 and 9 so4 in aqueous solution would react with h2o oh to generate amount of oh eq 10 in addition the π electrons from the sp2 c could be activated by the lone pair electrons of the doping n 36 the n doped carbon shell was favor to enhance the catalytic activity to stimulate pms eq 11 electron transfer is an important reason for the formation process of o2 the reaction happened between oh and h2o2 which were intermediates in the pms activation process to generate perhydroxyl radicals ho2 eqs 12 and 13 then ho2 decomposed to generate radical o2 eq 14 pms anion radicals so5 were produced by the reduction of co3 eq 8 and then so5 could be further combined to form so4 2 ions and meanwhile produce 1o2 eq 15 moreover o2 could also interact with oh to generate 1o2 eqs 16 and 17 17 6 co 0 2 hso 5 co 2 2 so 4 2 oh 7 co 2 hso 5 co 3 so 4 oh 8 co 3 hso 5 co 2 so 5 h 9 co 0 2 co 3 3 co 2 10 so 4 h 2 o oh so 4 2 oh 11 h so 5 e so

studies proved that the anions in the actual wastewater could react with the generated ros thereby affecting the catalytic activity of tc 53 the inhibitory effect of anions is due to not only the complex reaction with metal ions reducing the formation and substitution of intermediate products but also the reaction with free radicals to generate new free radicals with lower activity fig 10 shows that the effect of anions on the tc degradation the degradation efficiency of tc displayed the order of inhibitory effect on free radicals h2po4 cl hco3 the anions would quench the hydroxyl radicals and sulfate radicals and to produce weaker radicals while h2po4 could produce po4 2 in aops eqs 19 23 54 56 however the initial high degradation rate in the initial reaction may be due to the alkalinity of the solution with bicarbonate anion 19 cl oh so 4 so 4 2 cl hclo 20 cl cl cl 2 21 hco 3 oh so 4 2 co 3 22 hco 3 so 4 so 4 2 co 3 23 h 2 po 4 oh so 4 oh so 4 2 po 4 2 to better find out the possible degradation pathway of tc lc ms was carried out to analyze the intermediates of tc integrated with the favorable primary degradation sites from dft calculations we used b3lyp 6 3ug d p method by gaussian to conduct geometry optimization of tc and the three dimensional model of homo and lumo frontier orbits could indicate the orbital esp distribution fig s9 meanwhile theoretical calculation results reveal that co co and cn of tc have higher fukui function and lower esp value which were preferential attacked by ros table s4 integrated with the intermediates conducted by lc ms analysis the possible degradation pathways of tc were deduced as shown in fig s10 firstly tc is attacked by 1o2 and is converted into compound p1 m z 453 through demethylation p4 m z 436 p7 m z 340 p10 m z 274 and p13 m z 222 are generated through demethylation deamidation and ring opening reactions for second pathway p2 m z 430 and p5 m z 417 are produced by n demethylation of tc and through further ring opening p8 m z 362 p11 m z 318 p14 m z 222 are generated in third pathway p3 m z 432 is generated through dehydration process and p9 m z 316 p12 m z 274 p15 m z 206 are generated through the further n demethylation reaction and ring opening finally the intermediates would be further oxidized to generate small molecular organics even mineralized co2 and h2o 4 conclusion in this paper co n c nanocatalyst was synthesized via pyrolyzing zif 67 nano particles then co n c nanocatalyst was anchored in confined membrane pores for water instantaneous flowing decontamination the pvdf co c3 membrane was used to remediate wastewater by the combination of cross flow filtration and catalytic oxidation contaminant and ros were confined in the membrane pore to enhance mass transfer realizing the excellent instant degradation rate correspondingly the pvdf co c3 membrane was proved to possess excellent catalytic oxidation ability and separation performance with water flux 636 0 l m 2 h 1 the active species of so4 and 1o2 played dominate roles in catalytic oxidation the degradation sites were explored with density functional theory meanwhile the pvdf co c3 membrane also possessed good cycle stability and antifouling performance the pvdf co c3 pms system with catalyst constructed on pore has showed a prospective foreground for efficient wastewater treatment declaration of competing
