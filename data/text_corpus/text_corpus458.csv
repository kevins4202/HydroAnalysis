2290,hydraulic profiling tool hpt and hydraulic tomography ht have been developed as promising techniques for the high resolution characterization of surficial aquifer systems hpt surveys can be rapidly conducted at a resolution of 1 5 cm but provide only one dimensional vertical profiles and require site specific formulae to relate hpt measurements to k geostatistics based ht can estimate three dimensional distributions of hydraulic parameters but may fail to provide detailed information and can be smooth when pumping observation data density is sparse and usually are constrained to the area enclosed by the pumping and observation network in this study hpt and ht surveys were conducted at the north campus research site ncrs in waterloo ontario canada to characterize a glaciofluvial multi aquifer aquitard system with permeameter k values spanning nearly seven orders of magnitude we first performed the geostatistical analysis of k values derived from 11 hpt surveys using the power law model developed for the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b then the benefits of incorporating hpt k profiles into ht were evaluated for the reconstruction of hydraulic parameter fields results showed that the arithmetic mean of 11 hpt k profiles was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the 544 permeameter test k measurements the k fields interpolated by ordinary kriging captured the vertical alternating layering patterns of aquifer and aquitard layers while they over predicted the values by nearly one order of magnitude than permeameter k for the top part of the aquifer system by incorporating the kriged k values as prior means for the geostatistics based ht improvements were found in capturing spatial heterogeneity of k fields for areas both inside and outside the well cluster and in drawdown predictions than the inversion case using only pressure head data the inclusion of vertical variation information of k derived from hpt into ht was also helpful in refining the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and introducing intralayer variation patterns of k for both aquifer and aquitard layers this study demonstrates the potential ability of ht and hpt and advocates the joint use of both techniques for the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity at highly heterogeneous sites such as the ncrs keywords subsurface heterogeneity hydraulic profiling tool geostatistical analysis hydraulic tomography hydraulic conductivity high resolution characterization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction three dimensional distributions of hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss are critical for groundwater flow and contaminant transport related issues thus numerous efforts have been made to characterize their spatial variations e g sudicky 1986 eaton 2006 kitanidis 2015 cho et al 2020 among the developed approaches laboratory measurements such as grain size analysis schad and teutsch 1995 and permeameter tests sudicky 1986 hess et al 1992 and in situ measurements with slug tests bjerg et al 1992 pumping tests el idrysy and de smedt 2007 alexander et al 2011 and borehole flowmeter tests rehfeldt et al 1992 genereux and guardiario 2001 have been frequently adopted to obtain spatially averaged or discretized point measurements to resolve subsurface heterogeneity at higher resolutions direct push techniques e g cho et al 2000 butler et al 2002 maliva 2016 and hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 have been advocated and widely validated as promising approaches for the spatial characterization of various aquifer systems over the last two decades the direct push based hydraulic profiling tool hpt has been developed to probe the in situ vertical variations of k at the 1 5 cm resolution in surficial unconsolidated sediments e g geoprobe 2007 bohling et al 2016 borden et al 2021 sun et al 2022 zhao and illman 2022a compared to conventional site characterization approaches major advantages of the direct push based hpt technique are the higher speed lower financial cost and the ability to obtain cm scale vertical resolution in k estimates dietrich et al 2008 lessoff et al 2010 maliva 2016 typically k profiles are inferred from hpt measurements based on the empirical relationship proposed by mccall and christy 2010 which was derived through compiling hpt and slug test data from seven field sites in central united states alternatively site specific relationships could be developed for the conversion of hpt measurements to k profiles for example after relating direct push injection logging one of the built in modules of hpt data to k estimates from direct push slug tests lessoff et al 2010 developed a site specific model to infer k values for the lauswiesen field test site in germany liu et al 2009 and bohling et al 2012 adopted the model calibration approach to estimate coefficients for empirical models which converted direct push injection logging measurements to k estimates by minimizing the differences between observed and simulated pressure responses of direct push permeameter tests at the macrodispersion experiment made site in mississippi usa later bohling et al 2016 proposed a revised model using an inverse modeling approach which relied solely on hpt measurements for the made site through numerical modeling analyses of hpt surveys borden et al 2021 also developed a physically based equation with an empirically determined hydraulic efficiency factor that can be varied at different sites in a recent hpt study zhao and illman 2022b used an inverse modeling approach and developed a site specific power law model to estimate k profiles for the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs waterloo canada although the hpt technique can probe k variations at an unprecedentedly high resolution liu et al 2009 it is important to recognize that measurements are one dimensional in the vertical direction and sampling locations are relatively sparse in the horizontal directions to provide k information needed by three dimensional 3 d groundwater flow and solute transport models in highly heterogeneous systems various approaches were utilized to generate k values for required spatial locations mccall et al 2009 bohling et al 2012 dogan et al 2014 for example bohling et al 2012 and bohling et al 2016 performed ordinary kriging to interpolate data along three cross sections and compared the large scale patterns of k to those of interpolated flowmeter k estimates based on the k data set of bohling et al 2012 dogan et al 2014 utilized a multi scale fractal approach to populate high resolution 3 d k fields for flow and transport simulations at the made site in a parallel study meerschaert et al 2013 combined the survey results from ground penetrating radar and high resolution k profiles to simulate k fields specifically ground penetrating radar reflections were used to delineate facies boundaries and high resolution k profiles were segregated by facies and interpolated within each unit to simulate a non gaussian lnk field these above field studies demonstrated the potential for 3 d characterization of highly heterogeneous aquifers by the hpt at a speed and resolution higher than conventional techniques however there are only a limited number of studies that evaluated the performance of 3 d groundwater flow and solute transport models built with high resolution k values derived from hpt surveys in particular dogan et al 2014 showed that when the k fields interpolated from high resolution hpt k profiles were used for groundwater flow and transport simulations the classical advective dispersion equation accurately predicted solute transport at the made site hpt has also been used with other direct push and laboratory approaches e g direct push slug test grain size analysis to provide k data for the construction of a 3 d regional groundwater flow model rogiers et al 2014 which reproduced the heterogeneous flow fields better than a spatially uniform model moreover curry et al 2020 and quinnan et al 2021 demonstrated the utility of k fields interpolated from hpt k values for the high resolution evaluations of contaminant mass flux distributions to date the usefulness of hpt k estimates has not been rigorously evaluated for the predictions of groundwater flow fields generated through multiple cross hole pumping tests therefore the first main purpose of this study is to investigate this research gap with datasets recently collected at the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial ncrs by sun et al 2022 unlike the hpt approach that can provide one dimensional high resolution k profiles ht yields 3 d distributions of k and or ss through sequential or simultaneous interpretations of data obtained from multiple cross hole pumping injection tests e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 when the observation data density of hydraulic responses transient or steady state is relatively sparse the recovered k and or ss fields by ht could be smooth in revealing heterogeneity details illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 wen et al 2020 stated that observation wells at new locations can provide non redundant information needed by model calibration of ht to reveal additional details of aquifer heterogeneity through a field study of transient ht zhao and illman 2018 demonstrated that the joint interpretation of observation data from pumping tests measured in both aquifer and aquitard layers were necessary for mapping the full heterogeneous patterns of hydraulic parameters at the ncrs other than using dense observation networks the fusion of various types of information e g flowmeter measurements geological data tracer test data and geophysics data with pressure head data have been proposed to improve the performance of ht for example through a cross correlation analysis zha et al 2014 stated that flux measurements carried non redundant information about subsurface heterogeneity and joint interpretation of pressure head and flux measurements yielded a higher resolution k field zhao and illman 2018 concluded that using geological data as prior information for ht preserved geological features and connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns zhu et al 2009 reported that first moment data from tracer tests contained information on hydraulic parameters along a narrow strip between the injection and measurement locations when the tracer test data were utilized with pressure heads for ht inversions lee and kitanidis 2014 found clear improvements in small scale features of estimated transmissivity fields geophysical data such as self potential signals were suggested to be jointly inverted with hydraulic heads to provide useful information to improve the reconstruction of hydraulic parameter fields yeh et al 2008 straface et al 2011 soueid ahmed et al 2016 during previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2015 showed that conditioning the geostatistical inversion model with in situ permeameter k data correctly identified clay layers in the estimated k tomogram through two dimensional synthetic experiments zhao and illman 2022b demonstrated that integration of hpt inverted k values into steady state ht analyses yielded k tomograms that were significantly better than the geostatistical inversion results relying only on pumping test data so far field studies are still lacking to show the potential benefits of integrating high resolution k profiles derived from hpt surveys with ht for the reconstruction of 3 d hydraulic parameter fields which is the second main purpose of this study in this paper hpt and ht techniques were jointly utilized for the 3 d characterization of hydraulic parameter fields at the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial multi aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs we first qualitatively evaluated the k profiles from hpt surveys in representing the subsurface heterogeneity at the ncrs by adopting the newly developed site specific power law model by zhao and illman 2022b then geostatistical analyses of cm scale hpt k profiles were performed to generate 3 d k fields which were compared with previously collected site data next groundwater flow models were constructed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the hpt k dataset in predicting groundwater flow fields generated through multiple pumping tests the spatially interpolated k fields were later integrated into the geostatistics based ht analysis to show the benefits of combining hpt and ht in terms of improving k field reconstructions and through validation pumping tests our field evaluation of hpt k estimates provided one of the first studies on the topics of evaluating hpt k for groundwater flow modeling as well as the fusion of hpt data with ht for high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity which added critical insights for future implementations of both techniques at highly heterogeneous field sites 2 site data 2 1 site geology and experimental setup the ncrs is situated at the university of waterloo waterloo canada and extensive research has been carried out to investigate the surficial geology and hydrogeology of this highly heterogeneous site over the last forty years karrow 1979 robertson et al 2000 alexander et al 2011 sun et al 2022 studies at the site reported that the ncrs consists of alternating layers of glaciofluvial deposits which belong to the waterloo moraine karrow 1979 sebol 2000 with the main aquifer unit reported to be generally confined by an extensive layer of clay material alexander et al 2011 drilling and core sampling suggested that an aquifer zone is located approximately 8 to 13 m below the ground surface mbgs and composed mainly of sand sandy silt and sandy gravel units situated below and above the main aquifer zone are low permeable silt and clay layers as illustrated by the borehole log in fig 1 b at approximately 18 mbgs is the dense clayey material of the catfish creek till which is difficult to drill through and usually treated as a regional hydraulic barrier alexander et al 2011 a 3 d pumping and observation network has been installed by alexander et al 2011 and berg and illman 2011 at the ncrs four continuous multichannel tubing wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 and cmt4 three multi screened wells pw1 pw3 and pw5 and two well clusters pw2 and pw4 were instrumented in an area of 15 m by 15 m as shown in fig 1a details regarding the wells at the ncrs were provided in the supplementary information section s1 during previous site characterization efforts 471 core samples from five wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 and pw1 were tested by alexander et al 2011 and 73 core samples from the other four locations pw2 pw3 pw4 and pw5 were tested by zhao and illman 2017 through a falling head permeameter to obtain local scale estimates of k the borehole logs of the above nine wells together with soil types and depth information from nine additional wells nc3 nc6 nc30 nc45 nc65 nc69 nc75 nc104 and nc105 located outside the 15 m by 15 m area sebol 2000 were compiled by zhao and illman 2017 and used to construct a 19 layer geological model representing seven different material types for the ncrs to consistently represent elevations of wells at the site the base of the 19 layer geological model with an elevation of 323 4 m above sea level was adopted as the bottom of the modeling domain for hpt surveys and groundwater flow models in later sections a 3 d perspective view of various wells and corresponding intervals at the ncrs was shown in fig 1e 2 2 hpt surveys at the ncrs a total of 11 hpt surveys were conducted by sun et al 2022 from july 30th to august 1st of 2019 to investigate the subsurface heterogeneity to an approximate depth of 17 m by using the hpt probe model k6050 geoprobe a plan view of hpt survey locations was shown in fig 1a during the continuous advancement of hpt probe water was injected through a screen 1 cm in diameter installed on the side of the probe water pressure injection flow rate qinj as well as electrical conductivity ec over time were recorded at a 1 5 cm vertical interval the water pressure was measured by the hpt pressure sensor installed closely behind the injection screen inside the probe while qinj was measured at the ground surface due to the highly heterogeneous nature of ncrs sediments the hpt probe was advanced with a minimum rate of approximately 0 2 mm s in the low k layers and at a maximum rate of about 5 cm s in the high k units liu et al 2019 reported that the speed of probe advancement may have a major impact on measured pressure responses through affecting 1 the magnitude of pore water pressure generated at the probe tip 2 the dissipation of the advancement generated pressure and 3 the amount of water injected per interval they also stated that when k is larger than 5 10 7 m s the advancement speed showed little impact on the ratio of measured qinj over water pressure during the development of a site specific model for the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b variations in probe speeds were explicitly considered during the inverse modeling procedure and the estimated k values used for fitting the linear model were generally larger than 5 10 7 m s we therefore consider the hpt measurements and corresponding k estimates to be practically speaking reasonable to be utilized in this study at selected depths with low water injection pressures dissipation tests were conducted to measure the hydrostatic pressure of the tested formation the measured pressure is a combination of hydrostatic pressure atmospheric pressure water injection pressure and pressure caused by probe advancement borden et al 2021 usually after accounting for atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures the corrected pressure pc was utilized to represent the water injection pressure to estimate k assuming that the pressure generated by the probe advancement is negligible mccall and christy 2010 the same assumption was followed for the current study and the hpt3 survey closely located with the cmt1 well was selected to facilitate the comparison with existing site data figs 1b d calculated pc values from hpt3 were shown in fig 1c and the qinj profile was plotted in fig 1d to show the changes in injection flow rates caused by subsurface heterogeneity elevated pressure readings usually indicate the presence of low k material and vice versa the underlying principle is that pc values during hpt surveys depend on the characteristics of materials of different grain sizes with high pc values required for fine grained materials such as silts and clays for water injection while coarse grained unconsolidated materials such as sands and gravels require significantly less pressure mccall et al 2017 quinnan et al 2021 in fig 1c we have added the location of the groundwater level recorded during the hpt3 survey the relatively low pc values at above 13 m were due to the existence of unsaturated low k zone during hpt surveys the light blue shaded zones in figs 1c and d indicate high k layers identified by the fuzzy clustering analysis of the hpt3 pc profile by zhao and illman 2022a we have also separately plotted the ec profile of the hpt3 survey as fig s1 in the supplementary information to show the changes of ec of unconsolidated materials at the ncrs a 3 d view of 11 hpt surveys at the ncrs with identified high k layers was plotted in fig 1e 2 3 pumping test data to stress the multi aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs a total of 15 pumping injection tests have been conducted to date at different depths and locations details of these pumping injection tests were summarized in table s1 nine pumping tests were conducted by berg and illman 2011 at wells pw1 ports pw1 3 pw1 4 and pw1 5 pw3 ports pw3 3 and pw3 4 pw4 3 and pw5 ports pw5 3 pw5 4 and pw5 5 to stress high k units later zhao and illman 2017 conducted additional pumping pw1 6 pw1 7 and pw2 3 and injection pw1 1 pw3 1 and pw5 1 tests to directly stress the low k zones at flow rates generally less than 2 0 l min during each pumping injection test pressure changes were recorded at all available observation intervals within the dense monitoring network of ncrs specifically most intervals of four cmt wells were monitored with 0 to 15 psig pressure transducers model mp100 micron systems while water level changes at the bottom screens of cmt wells were manually measured with an electronic water level tape water level changes in each well of pw2 and pw4 well clusters were monitored with 0 to 5 psig or 0 to 10 psig pressure transducers model 3001 lt leveloggers junior solinst in the multi screened wells i e pw1 pw3 and pw5 flute water systems flute ltd specially designed for the ncrs were installed to seal off the wells and to prevent short circuiting of pressure across different open screens five vented pressure transducers level troll in situ were pre installed in each flute liners to record water level variations during pumping injection tests 3 geostatistical assessment of hpt k profiles 3 1 k estimates by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b preliminary hpt studies at the highly heterogeneous ncrs revealed that k estimates for low k sediments obtained from the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 are more than one order of magnitude higher than the mean k values obtained from permeameter tests at adjacent locations sun et al 2022 zhao and illman 2022a therefore to convert k values from qinj pc profiles zhao and illman 2022b developed a site specific power law model as log10 k 1 41log10 qinj pc 4 25 with an upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s when qinj pc is larger than 5 5 10 6 m2 s this model was reported to produce a generally improved match between k estimates from hpt data with k values of the permeameter tests than the results of using the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 specifically the downward decreasing trend in k values was better captured by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b for the low k sediments at a depth of approximately 13 m while k values at the same locations were estimated as a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 k profiles estimated from the 11 hpt surveys were plotted as black dots total number of data n 8667 in fig 2 together with the light blue shaded zones identified as high k layers based on the fuzzy clustering analysis of the pc profiles by zhao and illman 2022a we see from fig 2 that the high k values generally matched well with the light blue shaded depth intervals for all 11 profiles although k values at some intervals were not so different from those values at other intervals for example k values from 5 0 to 6 0 m above the bottom of the domain in hpt1 were more than two orders of magnitude higher than k values in adjacent layers while k values in the identified high k layer from 5 5 to 6 0 m in hpt5 were less than one order of magnitude higher than k values compared to adjacent layers in the estimated k profiles of hpt4 and hpt8 the upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s was reached for the lower high k layer suggesting the need in expanding the functional range of the hpt tool for future studies at highly heterogeneous sites mccall and christy 2010 liu et al 2012 bohling et al 2016 we also see from fig 2 that hpt k values show both sharp e g around 5 0 6 0 and 8 5 m in hpt1 5 0 m in hpt2 5 5 m in hpt4 and gradual e g from 9 0 to 10 0 m in hpt1 from 5 5 to 6 5 m in hpt2 from 6 0 to 7 0 m in hpt4 transitions in vertical profiles which highlighted the advantage of hpt surveys in capturing inter and intra layer variation features of k values as well as the need for the high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity 3 2 descriptive statistics of hpt k versus permeameter k to further evaluate the ability of hpt in characterizing the k distribution at the ncrs we compared the probability density function from that generated with permeameter k values fig 3 a shows histograms of the probability densities for log10 k data set derived from hpt surveys and permeameter tests visual inspection of the histograms reveals that the distributions of both histograms more or less follow the bell shaped dashed curves representing the fitted normal distribution of the sample histograms the fitted sample mean of hpt log10 k is nearly one order of magnitude higher than the sample mean value for the permeameter log10 k the sample standard deviation of the former is slightly smaller than that of the latter the histogram of the permeameter k data set reveals a bimodal feature at the high k value ranges with a large peak in the interval of 7 log10 k 6 m s and another peak in the interval of 5 log10 k 4 m s the histogram of the hpt k data set estimated by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b can generally be described to be unimodal with a large peak in the interval of 6 log10 k 5 m s and k values extending lower than 3 5 10 7 m s defined by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 there is also a higher peak resulting from the technical limitation of the hpt probe in resolving variations above the upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s another noticeable difference between the two histograms is that they generally share a similar upper limit whereas the lower limit of the hpt is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the permeameter k data set the quantile quantile plot was then utilized to compare the sample distributions with the standard normal distribution as shown in fig 3b generally the central portions of hpt and permeameter k distributions were similar and fell along the 45 degree lines which indicated two exactly same distributions as the sample k values decreased both hpt and permeameter k data departed above the 45 degree lines showing the possible lower limits bohling et al 2016 which also suggest that the data sets contain significantly more extreme values than a standard normal distribution would predict as the sample k values increased k values from hpt shifted below the 45 degree line showing one readily apparent upper limit of k values provided by the hpt probe the hpt k values were summarized by its mean and variance computed for each 11 hpt surveys an arithmetic mean of log10 k 5 31 and a sample variance σ 2 log10 k of 0 88 were calculated for the entire data set n 8667 and plotted in figs 4 a and b respectively we also calculated lnk statistics of the entire data set as table s3 in the supplementary information it is noted here that the means and sample variances of individual hpt survey scattered along the dashed lines of the entire data set without showing apparent trends for either the mean or variance values of log10 k therefore it can be concluded that the stationarity assumption for the ncrs multi aquifer aquitard system is reasonable at least over the volume for which measurements were available 3 3 geostatistical analysis of hpt k during a previous site investigation alexander et al 2011 performed the geostatistical analysis of point scale k estimates from permeameter tests and grain size analyses the variogram revealed cyclic changes in the vertical direction known as a hole effect that resulted from the layered nature of the parameter fields pyrcz and deutsch 2014 berg and illman 2015 for the current study ordinary kriging was adopted to interpolate the spatial distribution of k from 11 hpt k profiles detrending was first performed to remove the redundant variability in the variogram kitanidis 1996 spatial correlation of the high resolution k values was characterized through variogram analysis using detrended lnk data fig 5 shows the horizontal and vertical variograms here we only presented the main steps of the geostatistical analysis while additional details were provided in the supplementary information section s2 to obtain parameters for ordinary kriging two scenarios were considered for this study in scenario 1 the experimental variogram in horizontal and vertical directions were first fitted to the exponential model kitanidis 1997 1 γ exp c 0 c 1 1 exp h where γexp is the exponential variogram c0 is the nugget and assumed here to be zero c1 is the sill h is the separation vector h h 1 λ x 2 h 2 λ y 2 h 3 λ z 2 and λx λy and λz are the correlation lengths in x y and z directions respectively the exponential model neglects the cyclic behavior of vertical experimental variogram shown in fig 5b thus in scenario 2 a nested model consisting of an exponential model and a hole effect model pyrcz and deutsch 2014 was adopted which has the following form 2 γ γ exp γ hole e f f e c t γ hole e f f e c t c 2 1 cos h π where c 2 is the sill of the hole effect model during the calculation of γhole effect the correlation lengths λx and λy were assumed to be positive infinity salamon et al 2007 to account for cyclic changes of the variogram only in the vertical direction fitting of the experimental variogram was performed using the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 the fitted model variograms were shown in fig 5 and estimated parameters of both scenarios 1 and 2 were summarized in table 1 we see from fig 5 that the vertical variogram can be well reproduced by the nested model a 3 d grid with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m was used for interpolating the hpt k data to create the k field for the ncrs and used for subsequent forward and inverse groundwater flow simulations the 70 m 70 m 17 m domain was discretized into 31 713 rectangular finite elements with varying sizes from the four outside boundaries to the central 15 m 15 m 17 m well cluster area the element size was gradually refined from 5 m 5 m 0 5 m to 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m this grid was kept the same as the one used in the groundwater flow model by zhao and illman 2018 to facilitate the comparison of results in subsequent sections we then interpolated the spatial distribution of k values by performing the ordinary kriging using the python module pykrige murphy et al 2022 fenced diagrams in figs 6 a and b display the kriged k fields and their variance maps figs s3a and b providing uncertainty estimates for scenario 1 using the exponential variogram model and scenario 2 using the nested variogram model respectively overall both figs 6a and b reveal the lower k zone at the bottom of the modeling domain and alternating high and low k layers in the vertical directions the d d cross section was extracted from fig 6 and plotted as figs 9b and c visual inspection showed that both k fields shared very similar distributions a comparison of kriged values from figs 6a and b through a scatterplot showed a linear model fit with a slope of 0 955 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 973 in fig s4 in figs 9b and c we also see some discernible differences in the locations of high and low k zones for example the k values of the area near the bottom of pw1 well in fig 9b seem much lower than the k values in fig 9c although the shapes of the low k areas were similar these k fields will be more quantitatively evaluated in subsequent sections for their performances in predicting independent pumping tests 4 integrating k data from the hydraulic profiling tool with hydraulic tomography when the density of observation wells is sparse k fields reconstructed by ht were reported to be smooth and lacked fine scale details illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 therefore various types of data other than pressure heads were explored to obtain non redundant information needed by ht analysis and to reveal additional details of aquifer heterogeneity yeh et al 2008 zhu et al 2009 zha et al 2014 berg and illman 2015 soueid ahmed et al 2016 as hpt surveys can be efficiently conducted to provide high resolution k profiles the following section will evaluate the integration of high resolution profiles of k derived from hpt surveys into ht for the reconstructions of 3 d hydraulic parameter fields at the ncrs 4 1 transient ht analysis for the current study eight pumping injection tests conducted at ports pw1 1 pw1 4 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 3 pw4 3 and pw5 3 were selected for transient ht analyses four tests conducted at ports pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 were used to evaluate the validation performances of groundwater models we adopted the temporal sampling strategy of pressure head data for ht sun et al 2013 and manually chose three to five data points from each transient drawdown curve covering the early intermediate and late times in total 522 pressure head data were chosen for the calibration of geostatistical models while 348 pressure head data were selected for model validation to simulate the cross hole pumping tests performed at the ncrs a groundwater flow model was constructed using the same gridding scheme as the one used for kriging introduced in section 3 3 the top and bottom faces of the modeling domain were defined as no flow boundaries while constant head boundaries were assigned to the remaining four faces geostatistical inversion of eight pumping injection tests was conducted using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 in simsle both the lnk and lnss fields were treated as stochastic processes assuming a prior knowledge of the corresponding unconditional means spatial covariance functions and structure parameters i e correlation lengths λx λy λz and the variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss the inversion process of simsle starts with cokriging to produce the conditional property field using available measurements of the hydraulic property and pressure heads obtained from ht surveys the stochastic conditional means of these parameters are used to solve governing equations of the 3 d groundwater flow model for pressure heads then a linear estimator is used to iteratively update the cokriged parameter fields to minimize the differences between simulated and observed heads in this study the exponential covariance model was adopted to estimate the k and ss fields to facilitate the comparison of results with previous ht studies at the ncrs values of correlation lengths λx λy 4 m and λz 0 5 m and variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss 5 0 were used as initial inputs for the simsle inversion process for k and ss fields which were identical to those used by zhao and illman 2018 in the case simsle uniform by zhao and illman 2018 the geostatistical inversion started with homogeneous mean fields of k 8 0 10 6 m s and ss 1 0 10 4 m to integrate k information derived from hpt surveys into ht we considered two scenarios using the heterogeneous k fields kriged using 11 hpt k profiles as initial guesses for the geostatistical inversion approach specifically inverse modeling of k and ss for geostatistical inversion cases started with k fields interpolated by kriging using the exponential and the nested models namely simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested respectively 4 2 geostatistical inversion results calibration results of eight pumping tests for two geostatistical modeling cases were first evaluated with linear model fits between simulated versus observed drawdowns the performances were compared to the model calibration results of the case when a homogeneous mean k and ss fields were used for ht analysis with simsle by zhao and illman 2018 specifically the mean absolute error norm l1 mean square error norm l2 and r2 were calculated as 3 l 1 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 4 l 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 2 5 r 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i μ ψ i ψ i μ

i and μ ψ i were corresponding means of the observed and simulated heads respectively as shown in fig 7 by using the interpolated k fields from kriging as prior mean k distributions the linear fit results improved compared to the inversion results in fig 7c specifically values of r2 were higher while the l1 and l2 norms were relatively lower in figs 7a and b with the case simsle hpt krig exp performing the best in terms of r2 l1 and l2 norms the estimated k and ss distributions from two scenarios by the geostatistical inversion approach were shown in fig 8 with corresponding residual variance values plotted in fig s5 compared to the k fields in fig 6 interpolated from hpt k profiles the estimated k distributions in figs 8a and b by the simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested cases revealed that 1 the low k aquitard layers were more profoundly preserved at the bottom area of the modeling domain 2 two high k layers shown in the shallow depth of the fig 6 became less obvious and 3 two thin low k layers were reconstructed in the central to top areas of the modeling domain the overall heterogeneous patterns of the recovered k fields shown in figs 8a and b were also quite similar both inside and outside the 15 m by 15 m well cluster area fig s5 shows that the variance values for both k and ss fields were lower in the central region than those in the outside areas near model boundaries showing impacts of model calibrations using pumping test data by ht the estimated ss tomograms of the two geostatistical inversion cases were shown in figs 8c and d in both tomograms relatively higher values were estimated for the aquitard zones near both top and bottom boundaries of the modeling domain which were physically reasonable and similar to the results estimated by zhao and illman 2018 when the homogeneous initial distribution was used for geostatistical inversions fig s6 through the analysis of laboratory sandbox experiments zhao and illman 2021 demonstrated that using heterogeneous k distribution as the initial mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach did not necessarily benefit the accurate estimation of ss field thus future uses of additional non redundant pumping test data wen et al 2020 or reliable prior information regarding the ss field will be needed to further improve the estimation of inter and intra layer ss heterogeneity 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of estimated k fields versus site data based on previous site characterization efforts of surficial geology at the ncrs karrow 1979 sebol 2000 alexander et al 2011 a 19 layer geological model was constructed by zhao and illman 2017 to evaluate the k fields interpolated from hpt k profiles and estimated through geostatistical inversion modeling k estimates along the d d cross sections were extracted from figs 6 and 8 the corresponding cross sections of the k distribution estimated by zhao and illman 2018 and the stratigraphy model created by zhao and illman 2017 were jointly plotted as figs 9 a and f respectively the vertical ranges of high k zones obtained through the fuzzy clustering analysis by zhao and illman 2022a along three hpt surveys hpt6 hpt7 and hpt8 were also shown in fig 9 for the direct comparison with the spatial variation of estimated k values comparison of estimated k distributions in figs 9a c with the stratigraphy map in fig 9f showed that the k distributions interpolated from hpt k figs 9b and c and estimated by ht fig 9a can both correctly reconstruct the low k features for the clay layer near the bottom boundary while the low k zone in fig 9a was only constrained to the 15 m by 17 m area where pumping and observation data were available in contrast the low k zone reconstructed by interpolations of hpt profiles extended to a larger area both inside and outside the 15 m by 17 m area because hpt surveys were conducted over a larger area compared to the extent of the 15 m by 17 m wellfield area utilized for the ht survey figs 1a and e similar results can be found for the high k zone located at the area in the range of z 4 7 m which corresponds well to the high k layer composed of sand and gravel in the stratigraphy map from z 7 m and upward alternative layering of low and high k zones was reconstructed in the simsle uniform case by zhao and illman 2018 although the same varying trends were also reconstructed in figs 9b and c k values of silt and clay layers were not as clearly estimated as shown in fig 9a these results suggested that different information regarding subsurface heterogeneity can be retrieved by hpt and ht which also revealed the potential benefits of integrating the two techniques for characterizing this highly heterogeneous site consisting of a multi aquifer aquitard system with the further use of kriged k fields in figs 9b and c as prior mean fields for the geostatistical inversion approach ht analysis yielded k distributions figs 9d and e that preserved both k layering features inside the 15 m by 17 m area of fig 9a and k variations for the areas outside the pumping and observation network in fig 9b and c specifically the middle low k layer was more extensively estimated in figs 9d and e than in fig 9a and the geometry of the top low k zone in fig 9a was also clearly refined due to the use of heterogeneous prior k mean field in addition the vertical distributions of high and low k zones in figs 9d and e were also updated to match the zone boundary information indicated along the hpt6 hpt7 and hpt8 profiles another noticeable finding from fig 9f is that some inconsistencies were observed among the geological zone boundaries and the high and low k zone depth information provided by hpt surveys for example along hpt6 and hpt7 profiles the layer composed of sand to sand and silt shown over a range of z 7 11 m of the stratigraphy map fig 9f were identified as low k layers black line segments by hpt surveys given the fact that hpt surveys were conducted at a 1 5 cm interval which was believed to provide high resolution information regarding hydrostratigraphy such inconsistency could be attributed to the imperfect recovery of core samples during borehole logging campaigns alexander et al 2011 these results together with the improved matches of zone boundaries shown in figs 9d and e highlighted the benefits of integrating hpt data into ht to improve the characterization of k heterogeneity which is also unique since hpt can obtain such information at an unprecedentedly high resolution in the vertical direction compared to existing techniques dietrich et al 2008 liu et al 2009 mccall and christy 2010 maliva 2016 to provide a more in depth evaluation of k fields in figs 6 and 8 the estimated k values were extracted along nine wells where core samples were analyzed and compared to permeameter k data we only plotted results for the kriging case hpt krig exp and geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig exp as shown in fig 10 results obtained for the other two cases hpt krig nested and geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig nested were similar to fig 10 thus were shown as fig s7 in the supplementary information in fig 10 k values blue lines interpolated from hpt profiles captured the variation pattern of permeameter k although the interpolated k values were overall higher than those estimated by the latter these results clearly explained the order of magnitude higher mean log10 k value derived from hpt than that estimated by the permeameter tests shown in the two histograms in fig 3a by using the kriged field as the prior mean k distribution variations of k values in the low k zones were more closely captured by the geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig exp as indicated by the red lines in fig 10 compared to the permeameter k measurements the lowering trend between the blue and red lines also suggested the impact of groundwater model calibration using multiple pumping tests on the kriged field when integrating hpt data and ht analysis these results suggest the validity of estimating k values for the high k zones while having some limitations in estimating k values for the low k sediments as clearly shown over the depth ranges of 5 0 to 15 0 m fig 10 5 2 evaluation of various k fields by groundwater flow models we next simulated four pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 not used in model calibration to further evaluate the performances of various k fields derived from hpt data and estimated by ht in groundwater flow modeling specifically 348 observed drawdowns covering the early intermediate and late time of four pumping tests were selected and compared to the simulated drawdowns for the simulation of transient pumping tests using the interpolated k fields from hpt k a homogeneous ss field with a value of 9 34 10 6 m estimated by zhao and illman 2018 was assumed fig 11 shows the scatterplots of observed versus simulated drawdowns the linear fit results as well as l1 and l2 norms were calculated for each case results of the geostatistical inversion case named as simsle uniform from zhao and illman 2018 were also included to compare the performance among different modeling cases drawdown predictions in figs 11a and b for the cases of hpt krig exp and hpt krig nested showed biased results that consistently under estimated the observed drawdowns larger than 0 5 m the linear fit results in terms of slopes and r2 values were also significantly poorer than those in fig 11c these results suggested that additional work is still needed to relate hpt profiles to k for the surveys conducted at the ncrs to account for the overestimation of k values in fig 10 when comparing the blue lines to permeameter k values by using the interpolated k values in figs 6a and b as prior mean k fields for simsle the geostatistical inversion approach yielded similar drawdown predictions that were clearly better than the results of the simsle uniform case fig 11c these improved performances suggested the potential benefits of integrating the hpt and ht techniques for high resolution site characterization and groundwater modeling purposes drawdown predictions of the pw1 3 pumping test by various modeling cases were shown in fig 12 and compared to the drawdowns observed from both aquifer and aquitard layers when the kriged k fields and homogeneous ss field were used for groundwater flow modeling the kriging cases hpt krig exp and hpt krig nested consistently over predicted the early time drawdowns observed from the ports located in the top layers 1 and 2 screens of cmt and pw wells and under predicted the late time drawdowns observed at the ports located in the middle layers 3 and 4 screens of cmt and pw wells with the k and ss fields estimated by the geostatistical inversion approach drawdown predictions for all three cases were significantly improved resulting in better linear model fits between the simulated and observed drawdown curves compared to the case simsle uniform simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested yielded better predictions at some ports such as cmt1 4 cmt2 2 and cmt2 4 while improvements were minor for other ports in fig 12 these results again demonstrated the benefits of integrating hpt and ht for subsurface heterogeneity characterization and groundwater flow modeling 5 3 implications for the high resolution characterization of highly heterogeneous sites by hpt and ht as a promising technique developed to provide high resolution information on subsurface heterogeneity along direct push locations hpt has been applied to demonstrate its validity in providing k profiles of cm scale resolution at multiple field sites such as at the made site mean of k 4 2 10 5 m s σ2 lnk 4 4 by flowmeter in mississippi usa liu et al 2009 bohling et al 2016 the magilligan test site northern ireland k 5 79 10 5 2 89 10 4 m s águila et al 2022 seven field sites k 2 12 10 7 about 1 06 10 3 m s

for most hpt studies hydrostratigraphy models and one dimensional k profiles were usually derived from hpt measurements for the purposes of initial diagnosis of site hydrogeology and guiding contaminant risk assessment e g köber et al 2009 mccall et al 2009 vienken et al 2012 mccall et al 2014 mousavi et al 2020 dutta et al 2021 quinnan et al 2021 compared to these field applications current work at the ncrs revealed several important aspects regarding the combined use of hpt and ht at highly heterogeneous sites due to the co existence of dense clay sand gravel at the ncrs the estimated k values of 544 core samples by permeameter tests span nearly seven orders of magnitudes with a variance of σ2 lnk 7 3 based on 544 samples as opposed to σ2 lnk 6 5 based on 471 samples by alexander et al 2011 which is significantly higher than those of other well investigated aquifer systems such as the made site σ2 lnk 4 4 bohling et al 2016 the north bay site σ2 lnk 1 79 sudicky et al 2010 and the canadian forces base borden site σ2 lnk 0 29 sudicky 1986 and the cape cod site σ2 lnk 0 14 wolf 1988 the reported k range at ncrs is much wider than the lower and upper boundaries 3 5 10 7 and 2 6 10 4 m s respectively defined by the formula of mccall and christy 2010 and the functional range of 0 001 60 m d 1 2 10 8 6 9 10 4 m s of the hpt probe suggested by liu et al 2012 and bohling et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 although intralayer k variations in high k layers along hpt3 were revealed fig 13b when the empirical formula of mccall and christy 2010 was adopted a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s was assigned to the clay layers in the middle and bottom areas of the aquifer system with the site specific model developed for hpt surveys at the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b k variations along hpt3 were better captured especially for the area at the bottom of the profile fig 13d while variations of k in the light blue shaded high k zones of fig 13d were similar to those in fig 13b through calibrating a seven layer geological model taking advantage of the stratigraphy information determined from the fuzzy c means clustering analyses the hpt 7layer fcm the estimated k and ss fields yielded better model validation results r2 0 62 l1 0 076 and l2 0 013 in zhao and illman 2022a than the results in figs 11a and b meanwhile the profile in fig 13c extracted from the k field estimated by zhao and illman 2022a showed k values lower than those in figs 13b and d for the area from 10 to 13 5 m above the bottom of the domain these results together with findings in fig 12 on one hand showed the reliability of the zonation model derived from cm resolution pc profiles on the other hand suggested that caution should be taken when uncalibrated cm scale k values estimated from hpt surveys were used for groundwater flow modeling at sites like the highly heterogeneous ncrs when only pressure heads were used for ht analysis the geostatistical inversion yielded a k profile that generally reflected the vertically alternating pattern of high and low k layers along hpt3 in fig 13e with the smooth transition of k values between the aquifer and aquitard layers for example the estimated k values in the identified lower high k layer from 5 5 to 7 0 m of fig 13e were one to two orders of magnitude lower than the arithmetic mean of permeameter k values and varied in a range similar to the estimated k values for the bottom low k layers by using the k field of the calibrated hpt 7layer fcm geological model as prior means zhao and illman 2022a the geostatistical model yielded a k profile fig 13f that better matched the permeameter k data and the layer boundaries were also better characterized still k variations were lacking in the identified aquifer layers which were more clearly reconstructed in fig 13g when the kriged k field was used as the heterogeneous k mean field for simsle differences among the estimated k profiles in figs 13e g clearly revealed the unique benefits of integrating high resolution k profiles from hpt and ht for site characterization in providing valuable information to refine the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and capturing intralayer variations to k fields 6 summary and conclusions the direct push based hpt technique has been increasingly applied at surficial aquifer systems for environmental site characterization purposes through obtaining cm resolution measurements that can be related to in situ variations of k usually site specific formulae were needed to perform such conversions and one dimensional k profiles were derived to gain limited knowledge of the 3 d distribution of heterogeneous k fields from spatially discretized locations ht on the other hand was developed to estimate the 3 d distribution of hydraulic parameters which however could yield k and ss fields between boreholes lacking fine scale details when pumping and observation data density was insufficient so far the performances of hpt inferred k profiles in representing the subsurface heterogeneity and simulating groundwater flow in highly heterogeneous aquifer systems such as the ncrs σ2 lnk 7 3 as well as their combined use with geostatistics based ht have not been evaluated to address these issues we first performed the geostatistical assessment of 11 k profiles which were converted from hpt surveys recently conducted at the ncrs by sun et al 2022 using the site specific relationship developed by zhao and illman 2022b in representing the spatial variations of k the results were compared to existing k measurements from permeameter tests of core samples from both aquifer and aquitard layers and evaluated in predicting drawdowns of four cross hole pumping tests that were not used in model calibration in addition k fields based on ordinary kriging of 11 hpt k profiles were used by the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach to characterize the subsurface heterogeneity of ncrs our study leads to the following major findings and conclusions 1 the 11 k profiles derived from hpt measurements using the site specific relationship developed by zhao and illman 2022b were useful in revealing both the sharp and gradual transitions of k values across high and low k layers at the ncrs due to the highly heterogeneous nature of glaciofluvial sediments at the site the upper limit of the hpt probe was exceeded at some high k areas and the derived hpt k data set yielded an arithmetic mean value which was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the 544 permeameter test k measurements therefore additional efforts were needed to extend the functional range of the hpt probe as previously advocated by bohling et al 2011 liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2018 for further development of the technique 2 the experimental variogram of hpt derived k values revealed cyclic variation features in the vertical direction that was also reported for permeameter test k measurements alexander et al 2011 berg and illman 2015 performing the ordinary kriging of hpt k based on the exponential model and a nested model consisting of the exponential model and hole effect model yielded similar alternating layering patterns of high and low k value zones groundwater flow models using kriged k fields and assuming a homogeneous ss field consistently produced biased predictions for drawdowns larger than 0 5 m these findings suggested that caution should be exercised in the direct use of hpt k values for groundwater flow and solute transport simulations at highly heterogeneous sites 3 although the kriged k values were nearly one order of magnitude higher than the permeameter k measurements along nine wells in the upper area of the aquifer system the general variation patterns of individual permeameter k profiles were correctly captured by the interpolated k fields by further using these kriged k fields as prior mean fields geostatistical inversion models yielded better results of drawdown predictions than the case using only pressure head data more importantly the structure information explicitly shown in the kriged 3 d k fields and the k value trends were incorporated into ht analyses the inverted k fields revealed both inter and intra layer heterogeneity as well as sharp k variations across layer boundaries both of which could have significant impacts on groundwater flow and contaminant transport predictions 4 finally our results showed that the inclusion of vertical variation information of k derived from hpt surveys is critical in refining the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and introducing intralayer variation patterns of k for both aquifer and aquitard layers which could be attributed to the unique advantage of the hpt technique in providing unprecedentedly high resolution information in the vertical direction still the density of hpt measurements in the horizontal direction is much lower than the vertical resolutions which may limit the performance of kriging in inferring k variations in the horizontal directions therefore additional research on the joint use of hpt profiles and geological and geophysical data for interpolations of uncalibrated k fields schmelzbach et al 2011 meerschaert et al 2013 or extracting multi scale structural information from hpt survey data and fusing various types of information with geostatistics based ht e g zha et al 2017 would be attractive in improving the ability of ht and hpt techniques in the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity at sites

2290,hydraulic profiling tool hpt and hydraulic tomography ht have been developed as promising techniques for the high resolution characterization of surficial aquifer systems hpt surveys can be rapidly conducted at a resolution of 1 5 cm but provide only one dimensional vertical profiles and require site specific formulae to relate hpt measurements to k geostatistics based ht can estimate three dimensional distributions of hydraulic parameters but may fail to provide detailed information and can be smooth when pumping observation data density is sparse and usually are constrained to the area enclosed by the pumping and observation network in this study hpt and ht surveys were conducted at the north campus research site ncrs in waterloo ontario canada to characterize a glaciofluvial multi aquifer aquitard system with permeameter k values spanning nearly seven orders of magnitude we first performed the geostatistical analysis of k values derived from 11 hpt surveys using the power law model developed for the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b then the benefits of incorporating hpt k profiles into ht were evaluated for the reconstruction of hydraulic parameter fields results showed that the arithmetic mean of 11 hpt k profiles was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the 544 permeameter test k measurements the k fields interpolated by ordinary kriging captured the vertical alternating layering patterns of aquifer and aquitard layers while they over predicted the values by nearly one order of magnitude than permeameter k for the top part of the aquifer system by incorporating the kriged k values as prior means for the geostatistics based ht improvements were found in capturing spatial heterogeneity of k fields for areas both inside and outside the well cluster and in drawdown predictions than the inversion case using only pressure head data the inclusion of vertical variation information of k derived from hpt into ht was also helpful in refining the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and introducing intralayer variation patterns of k for both aquifer and aquitard layers this study demonstrates the potential ability of ht and hpt and advocates the joint use of both techniques for the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity at highly heterogeneous sites such as the ncrs keywords subsurface heterogeneity hydraulic profiling tool geostatistical analysis hydraulic tomography hydraulic conductivity high resolution characterization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction three dimensional distributions of hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss are critical for groundwater flow and contaminant transport related issues thus numerous efforts have been made to characterize their spatial variations e g sudicky 1986 eaton 2006 kitanidis 2015 cho et al 2020 among the developed approaches laboratory measurements such as grain size analysis schad and teutsch 1995 and permeameter tests sudicky 1986 hess et al 1992 and in situ measurements with slug tests bjerg et al 1992 pumping tests el idrysy and de smedt 2007 alexander et al 2011 and borehole flowmeter tests rehfeldt et al 1992 genereux and guardiario 2001 have been frequently adopted to obtain spatially averaged or discretized point measurements to resolve subsurface heterogeneity at higher resolutions direct push techniques e g cho et al 2000 butler et al 2002 maliva 2016 and hydraulic tomography ht e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 have been advocated and widely validated as promising approaches for the spatial characterization of various aquifer systems over the last two decades the direct push based hydraulic profiling tool hpt has been developed to probe the in situ vertical variations of k at the 1 5 cm resolution in surficial unconsolidated sediments e g geoprobe 2007 bohling et al 2016 borden et al 2021 sun et al 2022 zhao and illman 2022a compared to conventional site characterization approaches major advantages of the direct push based hpt technique are the higher speed lower financial cost and the ability to obtain cm scale vertical resolution in k estimates dietrich et al 2008 lessoff et al 2010 maliva 2016 typically k profiles are inferred from hpt measurements based on the empirical relationship proposed by mccall and christy 2010 which was derived through compiling hpt and slug test data from seven field sites in central united states alternatively site specific relationships could be developed for the conversion of hpt measurements to k profiles for example after relating direct push injection logging one of the built in modules of hpt data to k estimates from direct push slug tests lessoff et al 2010 developed a site specific model to infer k values for the lauswiesen field test site in germany liu et al 2009 and bohling et al 2012 adopted the model calibration approach to estimate coefficients for empirical models which converted direct push injection logging measurements to k estimates by minimizing the differences between observed and simulated pressure responses of direct push permeameter tests at the macrodispersion experiment made site in mississippi usa later bohling et al 2016 proposed a revised model using an inverse modeling approach which relied solely on hpt measurements for the made site through numerical modeling analyses of hpt surveys borden et al 2021 also developed a physically based equation with an empirically determined hydraulic efficiency factor that can be varied at different sites in a recent hpt study zhao and illman 2022b used an inverse modeling approach and developed a site specific power law model to estimate k profiles for the highly heterogeneous north campus research site ncrs waterloo canada although the hpt technique can probe k variations at an unprecedentedly high resolution liu et al 2009 it is important to recognize that measurements are one dimensional in the vertical direction and sampling locations are relatively sparse in the horizontal directions to provide k information needed by three dimensional 3 d groundwater flow and solute transport models in highly heterogeneous systems various approaches were utilized to generate k values for required spatial locations mccall et al 2009 bohling et al 2012 dogan et al 2014 for example bohling et al 2012 and bohling et al 2016 performed ordinary kriging to interpolate data along three cross sections and compared the large scale patterns of k to those of interpolated flowmeter k estimates based on the k data set of bohling et al 2012 dogan et al 2014 utilized a multi scale fractal approach to populate high resolution 3 d k fields for flow and transport simulations at the made site in a parallel study meerschaert et al 2013 combined the survey results from ground penetrating radar and high resolution k profiles to simulate k fields specifically ground penetrating radar reflections were used to delineate facies boundaries and high resolution k profiles were segregated by facies and interpolated within each unit to simulate a non gaussian lnk field these above field studies demonstrated the potential for 3 d characterization of highly heterogeneous aquifers by the hpt at a speed and resolution higher than conventional techniques however there are only a limited number of studies that evaluated the performance of 3 d groundwater flow and solute transport models built with high resolution k values derived from hpt surveys in particular dogan et al 2014 showed that when the k fields interpolated from high resolution hpt k profiles were used for groundwater flow and transport simulations the classical advective dispersion equation accurately predicted solute transport at the made site hpt has also been used with other direct push and laboratory approaches e g direct push slug test grain size analysis to provide k data for the construction of a 3 d regional groundwater flow model rogiers et al 2014 which reproduced the heterogeneous flow fields better than a spatially uniform model moreover curry et al 2020 and quinnan et al 2021 demonstrated the utility of k fields interpolated from hpt k values for the high resolution evaluations of contaminant mass flux distributions to date the usefulness of hpt k estimates has not been rigorously evaluated for the predictions of groundwater flow fields generated through multiple cross hole pumping tests therefore the first main purpose of this study is to investigate this research gap with datasets recently collected at the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial ncrs by sun et al 2022 unlike the hpt approach that can provide one dimensional high resolution k profiles ht yields 3 d distributions of k and or ss through sequential or simultaneous interpretations of data obtained from multiple cross hole pumping injection tests e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 when the observation data density of hydraulic responses transient or steady state is relatively sparse the recovered k and or ss fields by ht could be smooth in revealing heterogeneity details illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 wen et al 2020 stated that observation wells at new locations can provide non redundant information needed by model calibration of ht to reveal additional details of aquifer heterogeneity through a field study of transient ht zhao and illman 2018 demonstrated that the joint interpretation of observation data from pumping tests measured in both aquifer and aquitard layers were necessary for mapping the full heterogeneous patterns of hydraulic parameters at the ncrs other than using dense observation networks the fusion of various types of information e g flowmeter measurements geological data tracer test data and geophysics data with pressure head data have been proposed to improve the performance of ht for example through a cross correlation analysis zha et al 2014 stated that flux measurements carried non redundant information about subsurface heterogeneity and joint interpretation of pressure head and flux measurements yielded a higher resolution k field zhao and illman 2018 concluded that using geological data as prior information for ht preserved geological features and connectivity in k heterogeneity patterns zhu et al 2009 reported that first moment data from tracer tests contained information on hydraulic parameters along a narrow strip between the injection and measurement locations when the tracer test data were utilized with pressure heads for ht inversions lee and kitanidis 2014 found clear improvements in small scale features of estimated transmissivity fields geophysical data such as self potential signals were suggested to be jointly inverted with hydraulic heads to provide useful information to improve the reconstruction of hydraulic parameter fields yeh et al 2008 straface et al 2011 soueid ahmed et al 2016 during previous ht studies at the ncrs berg and illman 2015 showed that conditioning the geostatistical inversion model with in situ permeameter k data correctly identified clay layers in the estimated k tomogram through two dimensional synthetic experiments zhao and illman 2022b demonstrated that integration of hpt inverted k values into steady state ht analyses yielded k tomograms that were significantly better than the geostatistical inversion results relying only on pumping test data so far field studies are still lacking to show the potential benefits of integrating high resolution k profiles derived from hpt surveys with ht for the reconstruction of 3 d hydraulic parameter fields which is the second main purpose of this study in this paper hpt and ht techniques were jointly utilized for the 3 d characterization of hydraulic parameter fields at the highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial multi aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs we first qualitatively evaluated the k profiles from hpt surveys in representing the subsurface heterogeneity at the ncrs by adopting the newly developed site specific power law model by zhao and illman 2022b then geostatistical analyses of cm scale hpt k profiles were performed to generate 3 d k fields which were compared with previously collected site data next groundwater flow models were constructed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the hpt k dataset in predicting groundwater flow fields generated through multiple pumping tests the spatially interpolated k fields were later integrated into the geostatistics based ht analysis to show the benefits of combining hpt and ht in terms of improving k field reconstructions and through validation pumping tests our field evaluation of hpt k estimates provided one of the first studies on the topics of evaluating hpt k for groundwater flow modeling as well as the fusion of hpt data with ht for high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity which added critical insights for future implementations of both techniques at highly heterogeneous field sites 2 site data 2 1 site geology and experimental setup the ncrs is situated at the university of waterloo waterloo canada and extensive research has been carried out to investigate the surficial geology and hydrogeology of this highly heterogeneous site over the last forty years karrow 1979 robertson et al 2000 alexander et al 2011 sun et al 2022 studies at the site reported that the ncrs consists of alternating layers of glaciofluvial deposits which belong to the waterloo moraine karrow 1979 sebol 2000 with the main aquifer unit reported to be generally confined by an extensive layer of clay material alexander et al 2011 drilling and core sampling suggested that an aquifer zone is located approximately 8 to 13 m below the ground surface mbgs and composed mainly of sand sandy silt and sandy gravel units situated below and above the main aquifer zone are low permeable silt and clay layers as illustrated by the borehole log in fig 1 b at approximately 18 mbgs is the dense clayey material of the catfish creek till which is difficult to drill through and usually treated as a regional hydraulic barrier alexander et al 2011 a 3 d pumping and observation network has been installed by alexander et al 2011 and berg and illman 2011 at the ncrs four continuous multichannel tubing wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 and cmt4 three multi screened wells pw1 pw3 and pw5 and two well clusters pw2 and pw4 were instrumented in an area of 15 m by 15 m as shown in fig 1a details regarding the wells at the ncrs were provided in the supplementary information section s1 during previous site characterization efforts 471 core samples from five wells cmt1 cmt2 cmt3 cmt4 and pw1 were tested by alexander et al 2011 and 73 core samples from the other four locations pw2 pw3 pw4 and pw5 were tested by zhao and illman 2017 through a falling head permeameter to obtain local scale estimates of k the borehole logs of the above nine wells together with soil types and depth information from nine additional wells nc3 nc6 nc30 nc45 nc65 nc69 nc75 nc104 and nc105 located outside the 15 m by 15 m area sebol 2000 were compiled by zhao and illman 2017 and used to construct a 19 layer geological model representing seven different material types for the ncrs to consistently represent elevations of wells at the site the base of the 19 layer geological model with an elevation of 323 4 m above sea level was adopted as the bottom of the modeling domain for hpt surveys and groundwater flow models in later sections a 3 d perspective view of various wells and corresponding intervals at the ncrs was shown in fig 1e 2 2 hpt surveys at the ncrs a total of 11 hpt surveys were conducted by sun et al 2022 from july 30th to august 1st of 2019 to investigate the subsurface heterogeneity to an approximate depth of 17 m by using the hpt probe model k6050 geoprobe a plan view of hpt survey locations was shown in fig 1a during the continuous advancement of hpt probe water was injected through a screen 1 cm in diameter installed on the side of the probe water pressure injection flow rate qinj as well as electrical conductivity ec over time were recorded at a 1 5 cm vertical interval the water pressure was measured by the hpt pressure sensor installed closely behind the injection screen inside the probe while qinj was measured at the ground surface due to the highly heterogeneous nature of ncrs sediments the hpt probe was advanced with a minimum rate of approximately 0 2 mm s in the low k layers and at a maximum rate of about 5 cm s in the high k units liu et al 2019 reported that the speed of probe advancement may have a major impact on measured pressure responses through affecting 1 the magnitude of pore water pressure generated at the probe tip 2 the dissipation of the advancement generated pressure and 3 the amount of water injected per interval they also stated that when k is larger than 5 10 7 m s the advancement speed showed little impact on the ratio of measured qinj over water pressure during the development of a site specific model for the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b variations in probe speeds were explicitly considered during the inverse modeling procedure and the estimated k values used for fitting the linear model were generally larger than 5 10 7 m s we therefore consider the hpt measurements and corresponding k estimates to be practically speaking reasonable to be utilized in this study at selected depths with low water injection pressures dissipation tests were conducted to measure the hydrostatic pressure of the tested formation the measured pressure is a combination of hydrostatic pressure atmospheric pressure water injection pressure and pressure caused by probe advancement borden et al 2021 usually after accounting for atmospheric and hydrostatic pressures the corrected pressure pc was utilized to represent the water injection pressure to estimate k assuming that the pressure generated by the probe advancement is negligible mccall and christy 2010 the same assumption was followed for the current study and the hpt3 survey closely located with the cmt1 well was selected to facilitate the comparison with existing site data figs 1b d calculated pc values from hpt3 were shown in fig 1c and the qinj profile was plotted in fig 1d to show the changes in injection flow rates caused by subsurface heterogeneity elevated pressure readings usually indicate the presence of low k material and vice versa the underlying principle is that pc values during hpt surveys depend on the characteristics of materials of different grain sizes with high pc values required for fine grained materials such as silts and clays for water injection while coarse grained unconsolidated materials such as sands and gravels require significantly less pressure mccall et al 2017 quinnan et al 2021 in fig 1c we have added the location of the groundwater level recorded during the hpt3 survey the relatively low pc values at above 13 m were due to the existence of unsaturated low k zone during hpt surveys the light blue shaded zones in figs 1c and d indicate high k layers identified by the fuzzy clustering analysis of the hpt3 pc profile by zhao and illman 2022a we have also separately plotted the ec profile of the hpt3 survey as fig s1 in the supplementary information to show the changes of ec of unconsolidated materials at the ncrs a 3 d view of 11 hpt surveys at the ncrs with identified high k layers was plotted in fig 1e 2 3 pumping test data to stress the multi aquifer aquitard system of the ncrs a total of 15 pumping injection tests have been conducted to date at different depths and locations details of these pumping injection tests were summarized in table s1 nine pumping tests were conducted by berg and illman 2011 at wells pw1 ports pw1 3 pw1 4 and pw1 5 pw3 ports pw3 3 and pw3 4 pw4 3 and pw5 ports pw5 3 pw5 4 and pw5 5 to stress high k units later zhao and illman 2017 conducted additional pumping pw1 6 pw1 7 and pw2 3 and injection pw1 1 pw3 1 and pw5 1 tests to directly stress the low k zones at flow rates generally less than 2 0 l min during each pumping injection test pressure changes were recorded at all available observation intervals within the dense monitoring network of ncrs specifically most intervals of four cmt wells were monitored with 0 to 15 psig pressure transducers model mp100 micron systems while water level changes at the bottom screens of cmt wells were manually measured with an electronic water level tape water level changes in each well of pw2 and pw4 well clusters were monitored with 0 to 5 psig or 0 to 10 psig pressure transducers model 3001 lt leveloggers junior solinst in the multi screened wells i e pw1 pw3 and pw5 flute water systems flute ltd specially designed for the ncrs were installed to seal off the wells and to prevent short circuiting of pressure across different open screens five vented pressure transducers level troll in situ were pre installed in each flute liners to record water level variations during pumping injection tests 3 geostatistical assessment of hpt k profiles 3 1 k estimates by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b preliminary hpt studies at the highly heterogeneous ncrs revealed that k estimates for low k sediments obtained from the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 are more than one order of magnitude higher than the mean k values obtained from permeameter tests at adjacent locations sun et al 2022 zhao and illman 2022a therefore to convert k values from qinj pc profiles zhao and illman 2022b developed a site specific power law model as log10 k 1 41log10 qinj pc 4 25 with an upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s when qinj pc is larger than 5 5 10 6 m2 s this model was reported to produce a generally improved match between k estimates from hpt data with k values of the permeameter tests than the results of using the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 specifically the downward decreasing trend in k values was better captured by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b for the low k sediments at a depth of approximately 13 m while k values at the same locations were estimated as a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 k profiles estimated from the 11 hpt surveys were plotted as black dots total number of data n 8667 in fig 2 together with the light blue shaded zones identified as high k layers based on the fuzzy clustering analysis of the pc profiles by zhao and illman 2022a we see from fig 2 that the high k values generally matched well with the light blue shaded depth intervals for all 11 profiles although k values at some intervals were not so different from those values at other intervals for example k values from 5 0 to 6 0 m above the bottom of the domain in hpt1 were more than two orders of magnitude higher than k values in adjacent layers while k values in the identified high k layer from 5 5 to 6 0 m in hpt5 were less than one order of magnitude higher than k values compared to adjacent layers in the estimated k profiles of hpt4 and hpt8 the upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s was reached for the lower high k layer suggesting the need in expanding the functional range of the hpt tool for future studies at highly heterogeneous sites mccall and christy 2010 liu et al 2012 bohling et al 2016 we also see from fig 2 that hpt k values show both sharp e g around 5 0 6 0 and 8 5 m in hpt1 5 0 m in hpt2 5 5 m in hpt4 and gradual e g from 9 0 to 10 0 m in hpt1 from 5 5 to 6 5 m in hpt2 from 6 0 to 7 0 m in hpt4 transitions in vertical profiles which highlighted the advantage of hpt surveys in capturing inter and intra layer variation features of k values as well as the need for the high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity 3 2 descriptive statistics of hpt k versus permeameter k to further evaluate the ability of hpt in characterizing the k distribution at the ncrs we compared the probability density function from that generated with permeameter k values fig 3 a shows histograms of the probability densities for log10 k data set derived from hpt surveys and permeameter tests visual inspection of the histograms reveals that the distributions of both histograms more or less follow the bell shaped dashed curves representing the fitted normal distribution of the sample histograms the fitted sample mean of hpt log10 k is nearly one order of magnitude higher than the sample mean value for the permeameter log10 k the sample standard deviation of the former is slightly smaller than that of the latter the histogram of the permeameter k data set reveals a bimodal feature at the high k value ranges with a large peak in the interval of 7 log10 k 6 m s and another peak in the interval of 5 log10 k 4 m s the histogram of the hpt k data set estimated by the power law model of zhao and illman 2022b can generally be described to be unimodal with a large peak in the interval of 6 log10 k 5 m s and k values extending lower than 3 5 10 7 m s defined by the empirical relationship of mccall and christy 2010 there is also a higher peak resulting from the technical limitation of the hpt probe in resolving variations above the upper limit of k 6 9 10 4 m s another noticeable difference between the two histograms is that they generally share a similar upper limit whereas the lower limit of the hpt is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the permeameter k data set the quantile quantile plot was then utilized to compare the sample distributions with the standard normal distribution as shown in fig 3b generally the central portions of hpt and permeameter k distributions were similar and fell along the 45 degree lines which indicated two exactly same distributions as the sample k values decreased both hpt and permeameter k data departed above the 45 degree lines showing the possible lower limits bohling et al 2016 which also suggest that the data sets contain significantly more extreme values than a standard normal distribution would predict as the sample k values increased k values from hpt shifted below the 45 degree line showing one readily apparent upper limit of k values provided by the hpt probe the hpt k values were summarized by its mean and variance computed for each 11 hpt surveys an arithmetic mean of log10 k 5 31 and a sample variance σ 2 log10 k of 0 88 were calculated for the entire data set n 8667 and plotted in figs 4 a and b respectively we also calculated lnk statistics of the entire data set as table s3 in the supplementary information it is noted here that the means and sample variances of individual hpt survey scattered along the dashed lines of the entire data set without showing apparent trends for either the mean or variance values of log10 k therefore it can be concluded that the stationarity assumption for the ncrs multi aquifer aquitard system is reasonable at least over the volume for which measurements were available 3 3 geostatistical analysis of hpt k during a previous site investigation alexander et al 2011 performed the geostatistical analysis of point scale k estimates from permeameter tests and grain size analyses the variogram revealed cyclic changes in the vertical direction known as a hole effect that resulted from the layered nature of the parameter fields pyrcz and deutsch 2014 berg and illman 2015 for the current study ordinary kriging was adopted to interpolate the spatial distribution of k from 11 hpt k profiles detrending was first performed to remove the redundant variability in the variogram kitanidis 1996 spatial correlation of the high resolution k values was characterized through variogram analysis using detrended lnk data fig 5 shows the horizontal and vertical variograms here we only presented the main steps of the geostatistical analysis while additional details were provided in the supplementary information section s2 to obtain parameters for ordinary kriging two scenarios were considered for this study in scenario 1 the experimental variogram in horizontal and vertical directions were first fitted to the exponential model kitanidis 1997 1 γ exp c 0 c 1 1 exp h where γexp is the exponential variogram c0 is the nugget and assumed here to be zero c1 is the sill h is the separation vector h h 1 λ x 2 h 2 λ y 2 h 3 λ z 2 and λx λy and λz are the correlation lengths in x y and z directions respectively the exponential model neglects the cyclic behavior of vertical experimental variogram shown in fig 5b thus in scenario 2 a nested model consisting of an exponential model and a hole effect model pyrcz and deutsch 2014 was adopted which has the following form 2 γ γ exp γ hole e f f e c t γ hole e f f e c t c 2 1 cos h π where c 2 is the sill of the hole effect model during the calculation of γhole effect the correlation lengths λx and λy were assumed to be positive infinity salamon et al 2007 to account for cyclic changes of the variogram only in the vertical direction fitting of the experimental variogram was performed using the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 the fitted model variograms were shown in fig 5 and estimated parameters of both scenarios 1 and 2 were summarized in table 1 we see from fig 5 that the vertical variogram can be well reproduced by the nested model a 3 d grid with dimensions of 70 m 70 m 17 m was used for interpolating the hpt k data to create the k field for the ncrs and used for subsequent forward and inverse groundwater flow simulations the 70 m 70 m 17 m domain was discretized into 31 713 rectangular finite elements with varying sizes from the four outside boundaries to the central 15 m 15 m 17 m well cluster area the element size was gradually refined from 5 m 5 m 0 5 m to 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m this grid was kept the same as the one used in the groundwater flow model by zhao and illman 2018 to facilitate the comparison of results in subsequent sections we then interpolated the spatial distribution of k values by performing the ordinary kriging using the python module pykrige murphy et al 2022 fenced diagrams in figs 6 a and b display the kriged k fields and their variance maps figs s3a and b providing uncertainty estimates for scenario 1 using the exponential variogram model and scenario 2 using the nested variogram model respectively overall both figs 6a and b reveal the lower k zone at the bottom of the modeling domain and alternating high and low k layers in the vertical directions the d d cross section was extracted from fig 6 and plotted as figs 9b and c visual inspection showed that both k fields shared very similar distributions a comparison of kriged values from figs 6a and b through a scatterplot showed a linear model fit with a slope of 0 955 and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 973 in fig s4 in figs 9b and c we also see some discernible differences in the locations of high and low k zones for example the k values of the area near the bottom of pw1 well in fig 9b seem much lower than the k values in fig 9c although the shapes of the low k areas were similar these k fields will be more quantitatively evaluated in subsequent sections for their performances in predicting independent pumping tests 4 integrating k data from the hydraulic profiling tool with hydraulic tomography when the density of observation wells is sparse k fields reconstructed by ht were reported to be smooth and lacked fine scale details illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao and illman 2018 therefore various types of data other than pressure heads were explored to obtain non redundant information needed by ht analysis and to reveal additional details of aquifer heterogeneity yeh et al 2008 zhu et al 2009 zha et al 2014 berg and illman 2015 soueid ahmed et al 2016 as hpt surveys can be efficiently conducted to provide high resolution k profiles the following section will evaluate the integration of high resolution profiles of k derived from hpt surveys into ht for the reconstructions of 3 d hydraulic parameter fields at the ncrs 4 1 transient ht analysis for the current study eight pumping injection tests conducted at ports pw1 1 pw1 4 pw1 6 pw1 7 pw2 3 pw3 3 pw4 3 and pw5 3 were selected for transient ht analyses four tests conducted at ports pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 were used to evaluate the validation performances of groundwater models we adopted the temporal sampling strategy of pressure head data for ht sun et al 2013 and manually chose three to five data points from each transient drawdown curve covering the early intermediate and late times in total 522 pressure head data were chosen for the calibration of geostatistical models while 348 pressure head data were selected for model validation to simulate the cross hole pumping tests performed at the ncrs a groundwater flow model was constructed using the same gridding scheme as the one used for kriging introduced in section 3 3 the top and bottom faces of the modeling domain were defined as no flow boundaries while constant head boundaries were assigned to the remaining four faces geostatistical inversion of eight pumping injection tests was conducted using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 in simsle both the lnk and lnss fields were treated as stochastic processes assuming a prior knowledge of the corresponding unconditional means spatial covariance functions and structure parameters i e correlation lengths λx λy λz and the variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss the inversion process of simsle starts with cokriging to produce the conditional property field using available measurements of the hydraulic property and pressure heads obtained from ht surveys the stochastic conditional means of these parameters are used to solve governing equations of the 3 d groundwater flow model for pressure heads then a linear estimator is used to iteratively update the cokriged parameter fields to minimize the differences between simulated and observed heads in this study the exponential covariance model was adopted to estimate the k and ss fields to facilitate the comparison of results with previous ht studies at the ncrs values of correlation lengths λx λy 4 m and λz 0 5 m and variances σ2 lnk σ2 lnss 5 0 were used as initial inputs for the simsle inversion process for k and ss fields which were identical to those used by zhao and illman 2018 in the case simsle uniform by zhao and illman 2018 the geostatistical inversion started with homogeneous mean fields of k 8 0 10 6 m s and ss 1 0 10 4 m to integrate k information derived from hpt surveys into ht we considered two scenarios using the heterogeneous k fields kriged using 11 hpt k profiles as initial guesses for the geostatistical inversion approach specifically inverse modeling of k and ss for geostatistical inversion cases started with k fields interpolated by kriging using the exponential and the nested models namely simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested respectively 4 2 geostatistical inversion results calibration results of eight pumping tests for two geostatistical modeling cases were first evaluated with linear model fits between simulated versus observed drawdowns the performances were compared to the model calibration results of the case when a homogeneous mean k and ss fields were used for ht analysis with simsle by zhao and illman 2018 specifically the mean absolute error norm l1 mean square error norm l2 and r2 were calculated as 3 l 1 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 4 l 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i ψ i 2 5 r 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i μ ψ i ψ i μ ψ i 1 n i 1 n ψ i μ ψ i 2 1 n i 1 n ψ i μ ψ i 2 2 where n was the number of pressure heads used for calibration or validation ψ i and ψ i were the i th observation and simulated heads respectively μ ψ i and μ ψ i were corresponding means of the observed and simulated heads respectively as shown in fig 7 by using the interpolated k fields from kriging as prior mean k distributions the linear fit results improved compared to the inversion results in fig 7c specifically values of r2 were higher while the l1 and l2 norms were relatively lower in figs 7a and b with the case simsle hpt krig exp performing the best in terms of r2 l1 and l2 norms the estimated k and ss distributions from two scenarios by the geostatistical inversion approach were shown in fig 8 with corresponding residual variance values plotted in fig s5 compared to the k fields in fig 6 interpolated from hpt k profiles the estimated k distributions in figs 8a and b by the simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested cases revealed that 1 the low k aquitard layers were more profoundly preserved at the bottom area of the modeling domain 2 two high k layers shown in the shallow depth of the fig 6 became less obvious and 3 two thin low k layers were reconstructed in the central to top areas of the modeling domain the overall heterogeneous patterns of the recovered k fields shown in figs 8a and b were also quite similar both inside and outside the 15 m by 15 m well cluster area fig s5 shows that the variance values for both k and ss fields were lower in the central region than those in the outside areas near model boundaries showing impacts of model calibrations using pumping test data by ht the estimated ss tomograms of the two geostatistical inversion cases were shown in figs 8c and d in both tomograms relatively higher values were estimated for the aquitard zones near both top and bottom boundaries of the modeling domain which were physically reasonable and similar to the results estimated by zhao and illman 2018 when the homogeneous initial distribution was used for geostatistical inversions fig s6 through the analysis of laboratory sandbox experiments zhao and illman 2021 demonstrated that using heterogeneous k distribution as the initial mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach did not necessarily benefit the accurate estimation of ss field thus future uses of additional non redundant pumping test data wen et al 2020 or reliable prior information regarding the ss field will be needed to further improve the estimation of inter and intra layer ss heterogeneity 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of estimated k fields versus site data based on previous site characterization efforts of surficial geology at the ncrs karrow 1979 sebol 2000 alexander et al 2011 a 19 layer geological model was constructed by zhao and illman 2017 to evaluate the k fields interpolated from hpt k profiles and estimated through geostatistical inversion modeling k estimates along the d d cross sections were extracted from figs 6 and 8 the corresponding cross sections of the k distribution estimated by zhao and illman 2018 and the stratigraphy model created by zhao and illman 2017 were jointly plotted as figs 9 a and f respectively the vertical ranges of high k zones obtained through the fuzzy clustering analysis by zhao and illman 2022a along three hpt surveys hpt6 hpt7 and hpt8 were also shown in fig 9 for the direct comparison with the spatial variation of estimated k values comparison of estimated k distributions in figs 9a c with the stratigraphy map in fig 9f showed that the k distributions interpolated from hpt k figs 9b and c and estimated by ht fig 9a can both correctly reconstruct the low k features for the clay layer near the bottom boundary while the low k zone in fig 9a was only constrained to the 15 m by 17 m area where pumping and observation data were available in contrast the low k zone reconstructed by interpolations of hpt profiles extended to a larger area both inside and outside the 15 m by 17 m area because hpt surveys were conducted over a larger area compared to the extent of the 15 m by 17 m wellfield area utilized for the ht survey figs 1a and e similar results can be found for the high k zone located at the area in the range of z 4 7 m which corresponds well to the high k layer composed of sand and gravel in the stratigraphy map from z 7 m and upward alternative layering of low and high k zones was reconstructed in the simsle uniform case by zhao and illman 2018 although the same varying trends were also reconstructed in figs 9b and c k values of silt and clay layers were not as clearly estimated as shown in fig 9a these results suggested that different information regarding subsurface heterogeneity can be retrieved by hpt and ht which also revealed the potential benefits of integrating the two techniques for characterizing this highly heterogeneous site consisting of a multi aquifer aquitard system with the further use of kriged k fields in figs 9b and c as prior mean fields for the geostatistical inversion approach ht analysis yielded k distributions figs 9d and e that preserved both k layering features inside the 15 m by 17 m area of fig 9a and k variations for the areas outside the pumping and observation network in fig 9b and c specifically the middle low k layer was more extensively estimated in figs 9d and e than in fig 9a and the geometry of the top low k zone in fig 9a was also clearly refined due to the use of heterogeneous prior k mean field in addition the vertical distributions of high and low k zones in figs 9d and e were also updated to match the zone boundary information indicated along the hpt6 hpt7 and hpt8 profiles another noticeable finding from fig 9f is that some inconsistencies were observed among the geological zone boundaries and the high and low k zone depth information provided by hpt surveys for example along hpt6 and hpt7 profiles the layer composed of sand to sand and silt shown over a range of z 7 11 m of the stratigraphy map fig 9f were identified as low k layers black line segments by hpt surveys given the fact that hpt surveys were conducted at a 1 5 cm interval which was believed to provide high resolution information regarding hydrostratigraphy such inconsistency could be attributed to the imperfect recovery of core samples during borehole logging campaigns alexander et al 2011 these results together with the improved matches of zone boundaries shown in figs 9d and e highlighted the benefits of integrating hpt data into ht to improve the characterization of k heterogeneity which is also unique since hpt can obtain such information at an unprecedentedly high resolution in the vertical direction compared to existing techniques dietrich et al 2008 liu et al 2009 mccall and christy 2010 maliva 2016 to provide a more in depth evaluation of k fields in figs 6 and 8 the estimated k values were extracted along nine wells where core samples were analyzed and compared to permeameter k data we only plotted results for the kriging case hpt krig exp and geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig exp as shown in fig 10 results obtained for the other two cases hpt krig nested and geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig nested were similar to fig 10 thus were shown as fig s7 in the supplementary information in fig 10 k values blue lines interpolated from hpt profiles captured the variation pattern of permeameter k although the interpolated k values were overall higher than those estimated by the latter these results clearly explained the order of magnitude higher mean log10 k value derived from hpt than that estimated by the permeameter tests shown in the two histograms in fig 3a by using the kriged field as the prior mean k distribution variations of k values in the low k zones were more closely captured by the geostatistical inversion case simsle hpt krig exp as indicated by the red lines in fig 10 compared to the permeameter k measurements the lowering trend between the blue and red lines also suggested the impact of groundwater model calibration using multiple pumping tests on the kriged field when integrating hpt data and ht analysis these results suggest the validity of estimating k values for the high k zones while having some limitations in estimating k values for the low k sediments as clearly shown over the depth ranges of 5 0 to 15 0 m fig 10 5 2 evaluation of various k fields by groundwater flow models we next simulated four pumping tests pw1 3 pw1 5 pw5 4 and pw5 5 not used in model calibration to further evaluate the performances of various k fields derived from hpt data and estimated by ht in groundwater flow modeling specifically 348 observed drawdowns covering the early intermediate and late time of four pumping tests were selected and compared to the simulated drawdowns for the simulation of transient pumping tests using the interpolated k fields from hpt k a homogeneous ss field with a value of 9 34 10 6 m estimated by zhao and illman 2018 was assumed fig 11 shows the scatterplots of observed versus simulated drawdowns the linear fit results as well as l1 and l2 norms were calculated for each case results of the geostatistical inversion case named as simsle uniform from zhao and illman 2018 were also included to compare the performance among different modeling cases drawdown predictions in figs 11a and b for the cases of hpt krig exp and hpt krig nested showed biased results that consistently under estimated the observed drawdowns larger than 0 5 m the linear fit results in terms of slopes and r2 values were also significantly poorer than those in fig 11c these results suggested that additional work is still needed to relate hpt profiles to k for the surveys conducted at the ncrs to account for the overestimation of k values in fig 10 when comparing the blue lines to permeameter k values by using the interpolated k values in figs 6a and b as prior mean k fields for simsle the geostatistical inversion approach yielded similar drawdown predictions that were clearly better than the results of the simsle uniform case fig 11c these improved performances suggested the potential benefits of integrating the hpt and ht techniques for high resolution site characterization and groundwater modeling purposes drawdown predictions of the pw1 3 pumping test by various modeling cases were shown in fig 12 and compared to the drawdowns observed from both aquifer and aquitard layers when the kriged k fields and homogeneous ss field were used for groundwater flow modeling the kriging cases hpt krig exp and hpt krig nested consistently over predicted the early time drawdowns observed from the ports located in the top layers 1 and 2 screens of cmt and pw wells and under predicted the late time drawdowns observed at the ports located in the middle layers 3 and 4 screens of cmt and pw wells with the k and ss fields estimated by the geostatistical inversion approach drawdown predictions for all three cases were significantly improved resulting in better linear model fits between the simulated and observed drawdown curves compared to the case simsle uniform simsle hpt krig exp and simsle hpt krig nested yielded better predictions at some ports such as cmt1 4 cmt2 2 and cmt2 4 while improvements were minor for other ports in fig 12 these results again demonstrated the benefits of integrating hpt and ht for subsurface heterogeneity characterization and groundwater flow modeling 5 3 implications for the high resolution characterization of highly heterogeneous sites by hpt and ht as a promising technique developed to provide high resolution information on subsurface heterogeneity along direct push locations hpt has been applied to demonstrate its validity in providing k profiles of cm scale resolution at multiple field sites such as at the made site mean of k 4 2 10 5 m s σ2 lnk 4 4 by

current work at the ncrs revealed several important aspects regarding the combined use of hpt and ht at highly heterogeneous sites due to the co existence of dense clay sand gravel at the ncrs the estimated k values of 544 core samples by permeameter tests span nearly seven orders of magnitudes with a variance of σ2 lnk 7 3 based on 544 samples as opposed to σ2 lnk 6 5 based on 471 samples by alexander et al 2011 which is significantly higher than those of other well investigated aquifer systems such as the made site σ2 lnk 4 4 bohling et al 2016 the north bay site σ2 lnk 1 79 sudicky et al 2010 and the canadian forces base borden site σ2 lnk 0 29 sudicky 1986 and the cape cod site σ2 lnk 0 14 wolf 1988 the reported k range at ncrs is much wider than the lower and upper boundaries 3 5 10 7 and 2 6 10 4 m s respectively defined by the formula of mccall and christy 2010 and the functional range of 0 001 60 m d 1 2 10 8 6 9 10 4 m s of the hpt probe suggested by liu et al 2012 and bohling et al 2016 as shown in fig 13 although intralayer k variations in high k layers along hpt3 were revealed fig 13b when the empirical formula of mccall and christy 2010 was adopted a constant value of 3 5 10 7 m s was assigned to the clay layers in the middle and bottom areas of the aquifer system with the site specific model developed for hpt surveys at the ncrs by zhao and illman 2022b k variations along hpt3 were better captured especially for the area at the bottom of the profile fig 13d while variations of k in the light blue shaded high k zones of fig 13d were similar to those in fig 13b through calibrating a seven layer geological model taking advantage of the stratigraphy information determined from the fuzzy c means clustering analyses the hpt 7layer fcm the estimated k and ss fields yielded better model validation results r2 0 62 l1 0 076 and l2 0 013 in zhao and illman 2022a than the results in figs 11a and b meanwhile the profile in fig 13c extracted from the k field estimated by zhao and illman 2022a showed k values lower than those in figs 13b and d for the area from 10 to 13 5 m above the bottom of the domain these results together with findings in fig 12 on one hand showed the reliability of the zonation model derived from cm resolution pc profiles on the other hand suggested that caution should be taken when uncalibrated cm scale k values estimated from hpt surveys were used for groundwater flow modeling at sites like the highly heterogeneous ncrs when only pressure heads were used for ht analysis the geostatistical inversion yielded a k profile that generally reflected the vertically alternating pattern of high and low k layers along hpt3 in fig 13e with the smooth transition of k values between the aquifer and aquitard layers for example the estimated k values in the identified lower high k layer from 5 5 to 7 0 m of fig 13e were one to two orders of magnitude lower than the arithmetic mean of permeameter k values and varied in a range similar to the estimated k values for the bottom low k layers by using the k field of the calibrated hpt 7layer fcm geological model as prior means zhao and illman 2022a the geostatistical model yielded a k profile fig 13f that better matched the permeameter k data and the layer boundaries were also better characterized still k variations were lacking in the identified aquifer layers which were more clearly reconstructed in fig 13g when the kriged k field was used as the heterogeneous k mean field for simsle differences among the estimated k profiles in figs 13e g clearly revealed the unique benefits of integrating high resolution k profiles from hpt and ht for site characterization in providing valuable information to refine the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and capturing intralayer variations to k fields 6 summary and conclusions the direct push based hpt technique has been increasingly applied at surficial aquifer systems for environmental site characterization purposes through obtaining cm resolution measurements that can be related to in situ variations of k usually site specific formulae were needed to perform such conversions and one dimensional k profiles were derived to gain limited knowledge of the 3 d distribution of heterogeneous k fields from spatially discretized locations ht on the other hand was developed to estimate the 3 d distribution of hydraulic parameters which however could yield k and ss fields between boreholes lacking fine scale details when pumping and observation data density was insufficient so far the performances of hpt inferred k profiles in representing the subsurface heterogeneity and simulating groundwater flow in highly heterogeneous aquifer systems such as the ncrs σ2 lnk 7 3 as well as their combined use with geostatistics based ht have not been evaluated to address these issues we first performed the geostatistical assessment of 11 k profiles which were converted from hpt surveys recently conducted at the ncrs by sun et al 2022 using the site specific relationship developed by zhao and illman 2022b in representing the spatial variations of k the results were compared to existing k measurements from permeameter tests of core samples from both aquifer and aquitard layers and evaluated in predicting drawdowns of four cross hole pumping tests that were not used in model calibration in addition k fields based on ordinary kriging of 11 hpt k profiles were used by the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach to characterize the subsurface heterogeneity of ncrs our study leads to the following major findings and conclusions 1 the 11 k profiles derived from hpt measurements using the site specific relationship developed by zhao and illman 2022b were useful in revealing both the sharp and gradual transitions of k values across high and low k layers at the ncrs due to the highly heterogeneous nature of glaciofluvial sediments at the site the upper limit of the hpt probe was exceeded at some high k areas and the derived hpt k data set yielded an arithmetic mean value which was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the 544 permeameter test k measurements therefore additional efforts were needed to extend the functional range of the hpt probe as previously advocated by bohling et al 2011 liu et al 2012 and liu et al 2018 for further development of the technique 2 the experimental variogram of hpt derived k values revealed cyclic variation features in the vertical direction that was also reported for permeameter test k measurements alexander et al 2011 berg and illman 2015 performing the ordinary kriging of hpt k based on the exponential model and a nested model consisting of the exponential model and hole effect model yielded similar alternating layering patterns of high and low k value zones groundwater flow models using kriged k fields and assuming a homogeneous ss field consistently produced biased predictions for drawdowns larger than 0 5 m these findings suggested that caution should be exercised in the direct use of hpt k values for groundwater flow and solute transport simulations at highly heterogeneous sites 3 although the kriged k values were nearly one order of magnitude higher than the permeameter k measurements along nine wells in the upper area of the aquifer system the general variation patterns of individual permeameter k profiles were correctly captured by the interpolated k fields by further using these kriged k fields as prior mean fields geostatistical inversion models yielded better results of drawdown predictions than the case using only pressure head data more importantly the structure information explicitly shown in the kriged 3 d k fields and the k value trends were incorporated into ht analyses the inverted k fields revealed both inter and intra layer heterogeneity as well as sharp k variations across layer boundaries both of which could have significant impacts on groundwater flow and contaminant transport predictions 4 finally our results showed that the inclusion of vertical variation information of k derived from hpt surveys is critical in refining the vertical locations of estimated layer boundaries and introducing intralayer variation patterns of k for both aquifer and aquitard layers which could be attributed to the unique advantage of the hpt technique in providing unprecedentedly high resolution information in the vertical direction still the density of hpt measurements in the horizontal direction is much lower than the vertical resolutions which may limit the performance of kriging in inferring k variations in the horizontal directions therefore additional research on the joint use of hpt profiles and geological and geophysical data for interpolations of uncalibrated k fields schmelzbach et al 2011 meerschaert et al 2013 or extracting multi scale structural information from hpt survey data and fusing various types of information with geostatistics based ht e g zha et al 2017 would be attractive in improving the ability of ht and hpt techniques in the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity at sites

2291,dams are vital infrastructure for water resource management and their safety is threatened by the complex interplay of multiple risk factors consequently for dam safety maintenance it is significant to conduct dam risk analysis by detecting the relationship between dam failure and risk factors and identifying the critical risk factors bayesian network bn is an effective tool for this issue and has been widely used in previous studies however there is still a lack of variable selection methods in bn that can automatically select predictors from numerous candidates by considering both predictability and parsimony herein an optimized variable selection is proposed for bn and used in the risk analysis of widespread earth dams in the united states the results showed that the proposed method can automatically determine the optimal predictor set the bn with selected predictors not only exhibits good performance but also has a significantly more concise network than the bn without variable selection and significantly weakens overfitting using the established bn the clear causal network of earth dam failure and 12 risk factors were quantified through influence strength analysis the three foremost risk factors based on their sensitivity analysis were identified to be insufficient spillway capacity extreme flood and slope instability which can serve as a reference for the safety maintenance of earth dams in the united states our study highlights that the proposed variable selection is a powerful step of bn for dam risk analysis and contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework keywords dam risk analysis bayesian network variable selection earth dam failure data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction dams are one of the most important components of water resource infrastructure with multiple benefits such as flood control irrigation and electrical generation as a nonlinear system dams are threatened by the complex interplay of extreme external loads outdated designs material aging and other risk factors kalinina et al 2018 wang et al 2022 with climate change and human interference some dams are exposed to high risk and even fail leading to catastrophic consequences lempérière 2017 fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 the failures of dams have caused immense property damage taken thousands of lives and had profound impacts on social development and ecological environment garcia de leaniz et al 2019 cornwall 2020 ge et al 2022 therefore it is significant of dam risk analysis to detect the relationship between dam failure and risk factors and to identify the critical risk factors for dam failure which can be fundamental for dam safety governance and failure prevention and has gained increasing attention in recent years wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 many efforts have been devoted towards dam risk analysis traditional risk analysis methods such as failure mode and effect analysis fmea analytic hierarchy process ahp and fault tree analysis fta have made significant contributions in improving the understanding of dam risk systems peyras et al 2006 jing et al 2018 liu et al 2021 for instance liu et al 2021 constructed the risk assessment indicator and detected the major failure path of ice dams based on the fuzzy fta method a critical limitation of the above methods is that the complex relationships in dam systems with multiple interacting risk factors may not be fully expressed bayesian network bn combines the advantages of graph and probability theory and is one of the most efficient theoretical models for representing uncertainty and reasoning pearl 2009 compared to fmea ahp and fta bn has proven to be a more flexible method that provides a comprehensive visual representation and precise quantitative assessment of nonlinear sophisticated relationships li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 consequently bn is an effective tool for modeling dam systems and has been increasingly used in dam risk analysis for example andreini et al 2019 analyzed the risk of dam failure caused by internal erosion by developing probabilistic models for the erosion parameters and pipe radius based on the bn method kalinina et al 2018 investigated the causes of dam incidents to identify the risk factors for different dam types by applying a bayesian hierarchical model however the performance of bn modeling can be apparently affected by selected predictors leading to uncertain results of dam risk analysis when modeling dam systems exposed to multiple risk factors i e predictors a strategy is to consider as many risk factors as possible to improve the performance of established bn models zhang et al 2011 however in practice the numerous variable bn model has a complex structure that is difficult to understand and requires high cost of observations for predictors besides an excessive input of predictors may lead to overfitting problems and reduce the predictability of models lever et al 2016 huang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 therefore variable selection which aims to select appropriate predictors has been an important part of bn modeling for dam risk analysis a commonly used method of variable selection is to qualitatively select influential risk factors based on domain knowledge dk e g published scientific evidence and expert opinion morales nápoles et al 2014 chen and lin 2019 xu et al 2022a dk based selection is particularly useful in the absence of observations however it is affected by the subjectivity of experts and may fall into a dilemma when dealing with the conflicting opinions of different experts a more objective method is to select risk factors with a high frequency of occurrence kalinina et al 2018 frequency based selection does not consider the interaction of risk factors also called collinearity for numeric risk factors and may miss critical risk factors when the candidate predictors have a close frequency consequently a more advanced variable selection method is required to optimize bn modeling given the increasing number and variety of candidate predictors more objectively and intelligently such as considering risk factor interactions and removing some insignificant risk factors that may cause overfitting recently machine learning ml has been successfully applied to the prediction of engineering systems hegde and rokseth 2020 novellino et al 2021 wen et al 2022 for example yang et al 2020 predicted the probability of tailings dam failure by integrating long short term memory lstm and convolutional neural network cnn ml methods are effective at modeling nonlinearity and providing accurate predictions for dam systems however due to their complicated structure and low interpretability most ml methods have generally been regarded as black box that do not provide a visual representation of the underlying relationships thus reducing their applicability in dam risk analysis ryo et al 2021 dieber and kirrane 2022 specifically some ml models such as boosted regression tree brt can identify redundant or noisy variables according to their influences on model prediction elith et al 2008 liu et al 2022 after removing these variables the optimized brt model generally shows better predictive performance which provides a reference for variable selection in bn thus it can be expected that the bn model established from optimized variable selection using ml may produce a better prediction and benefit dam risk analysis the safety of earth dams is a major concern in dam risk analysis morales nápoles et al 2014 wang et al 2018 andreini et al 2019 earth dams are the most numerous and widely distributed type of dams accounting for 65 of 58 713 large dams dams with a height of more than 15 m or dams impounding more than 3 million cubic meters registered worldwide updated on april 2020 icold 2021 as they are constructed with natural earth material earth dams are also the type with the highest frequency of failures in the united states approximately 70 of dam failure cases recorded over the past 150 years are earth dams graham 2009 although previous studies based on bn have acknowledged the general effects of risk factors on earth dams the difference between these bns based on different variable selections remains an uncertainty in the risk analysis of earth dams in this study an optimized variables selection method was proposed to improve the performance of bn for dam risk analysis the established bn based on optimized variable selection was then applied in the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states based on the incident dataset of 760 earth dams the primary objectives of this study were to 1 select predictors using the optimized variable selection method 2 establish a bn model with the optimally selected predictors and evaluate its performance 3 conduct risk analysis of earth dams in the united states 2 bayesian network bn bns are probabilistic graphical models that express conditional dependencies between a set of variables in an unknown system pearl 2009 a bn consists of two parts a network structure in the form of a directed acyclic graph dag and probability parameters in the form of conditional probability tables cpts for discrete variables jensen and nielsen 2007 the dag defined as g v l whose nodes v correspond to the variables classified into different states and edges l are the directed arrows connecting these variables intuitively reflect the relationship between paired variables heckerman 1997 the node at the tail of the edge is called the parent node and the node at the head is called the child node the node without a child node is called the leaf node node c in fig 1 whose states respond to the change in the other nodes i e a b e and d and is called the response variable specifically node d has no parent node and is generally the input variable used to predict the other variables called the predictor for a more complex system e g earth dams the network structure of the bn contains many predictors which fundamentally drive the states of the response variable therefore identifying the most appropriate predictors i e variable selection is crucial for the prediction of response variables the cpts which are composed of a set of conditional probabilities define the behavior of each node given its parents in the network fig 1 given the cpt corresponding to each node the relationships between any set of variables in the bn can be measured using the joint probability distribution based on the chain rule of probability heckerman et al 1995 the joint probability distribution over the variable set x 1 x 2 x n for a bn is factored as a product of the conditional probability entries 1 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i x 1 x i 1 owing to the d separation criteria pearl 1986 the joint probability distribution is simplified as the multiplication of the conditional probabilities of the child nodes given their immediate parents hence eq 1 can be written as 2 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i π i where π i is the parent set of variable x i and p x i π i represents the conditional probabilities between the child nodes and their parents for the bn shown in fig 1 the joint probability distributions of the five nodes can be expressed as 3 p a b c d e p d p e d p b e p a b e p c a 3 methodology herein the bn modeling process for dam risk analysis consists of the following four stages principle and approach of optimized variable selection model establishment based on structure and parameter learning model evaluation on predictability and parsimony and dam risk analysis by influence strength and sensitivity analysis fig 2 3 1 optimized variable selection 3 1 1 principle of variable selection all of the candidate predictors involved in the data are seldom equally relevant for prediction shi et al 2019 some predictors do not substantially contribute to the model performance whose existence can not only increases complexity of bn but also more seriously leads to overfitting and reduces model prediction lever et al 2016 an optimized variable selection is to find a minimum predictor subset with great predictive power by removing redundant predictors also called noisy variables drugan and wiering 2010 consider a system with a response variable y e g dam failure and a set of candidate predictors x x 1 x 2 x n e g risk factors the contribution of a candidate predictor to prediction can be measured by the change in predictive deviance caused by removing the predictor the set of i candidate predictors can be considered redundant and be removed if their contribution to prediction δ d i is less than that of random error i e error caused by noise in the data which can be reflected by rajeswaran and blackstone 2017 hence the se d 0 can serve as a noise threshold to remove redundant predictors and the principle of variable selection based on the noise threshold can be expressed as 4 δ d i s e d 0 the se d 0 can be calculated through repeatedly sampling the observed data mchugh 2008 a common practice is to divide the observed data into equally sized subsets in this case δ d i can be calculated using the average change in deviance with variable removal based on each data subset 5 s e d 0 λ 1 k d λ 0 d 0 2 k 1 k 6 d 0 1 k λ 1 k d λ 0 7 δ d i 1 k λ 1 k d λ i d λ 0 where k denotes the number of data subsets d λ 0 is the original deviance produced by all inputs of predictors based on the λ th subset d 0 is the mean of d λ 0 and d λ i is the deviance with the removal of i variables based on the λ th subset the variable selection process involves two main procedures first the original deviance d 0 using the full predictor set is calculated and the contribution of each predictor to the original deviance is measured by dropping one predictor at a time then the predictors are dropped successively from the full predictor set in the order of their contribution to predictive deviance which is analogous to the backward elimination procedure the first dropped predictor has the smallest contribution to the original deviance which will be removed if its contribution is less than the random error measured by se this process is repeated until the total contribution of the removed predictors δ d i are greater than the random error se d 0 of the observed data deviance represents the difference between the prediction and observation of the response variable which can be measured using the loss function of a fitted model for a binary response variable such as dam failure that satisfies the bernoulli distribution the loss function l y u x can be calculated using binary cross entropy the binary cross entropy is a concept in the field of information theory and is a measure that generally calculates the distance between the actual and predicted probability distributions for a given binary variable ho and wookey 2019 the binary cross entropy loss function can be expressed as 8 l y u x j 1 n y j log u j j 1 n 1 y j log 1 u j where u x is the function of the fitted model n is the number of cases in the observed data y j and u j are the observation and prediction of the response variable in the j th case respectively the smaller the value of binary cross entropy the better the fit of a given model to the observed data 3 1 2 boosted regression tree brt the brt method was used to provide predictions i e u x and complete the variable selection process brt is a machine learning method that combines the strengths of decision trees or regression trees and boosting process schapire 2003 elith et al 2008 as a tree based model brt can handle different types of variables binary numeric and categorical with no need for data processing elith et al 2008 müller et al 2013 brt is efficient for handling interactions between predictors and is applicable to nonlinear relationships besides the performance of brt is highly robust to the inclusion of a large number of redundant predictors friedman and meulman 2003 the above features of brt provide prerequisites for the variable selection of dam risk systems decision trees provide preliminary predictions for brt which fit the variation in the response variable by identifying the partitioned predictor space that has the most homogeneous responses to the predictors as shown in fig 3 boosting fits an ensemble of decision trees to produce more robust predictions than a single decision tree schapire 2003 the function of brt is defined as the sum of the base learner t x γ m 9 u x m 0 m ω m t x γ m where t x γ m represents a decision tree determined by predictors x and split points γ m m is the number of decision trees participating in boosting and ω m is the weight of the base learner t x γ m for the m th decision tree given the brt model u x predictor matrix x and loss function l y u x the variable selection process using brt can be expressed as estimate the original prediction deviance d 0 l y u x orin based on original predictor matrix x orin for each candidate predictor x x 1 x 2 x n generate predictor matrix x drop by successively dropping predictor x i from x orin estimate prediction deviance d i l y u x drop based on the predictor matrix x drop calculate the deviation of prediction deviance δ d i d i d 0 remove predictor x i if δ d i is smaller than s e d 0 in this study the variable selection process based on brt was performed using the dismo package in r software 4 1 2 the brt calibration was determined by three critical hyper parameters namely tree complexity learning rate and bag fraction which controlled the maximum number of splits for fitting each decision tree the speed at which the boosting algorithm proceeded down the gradient descent and the proportion of the available training data at each iteration respectively hastie et al 2009 herein the values of the tree complexity learning rate and bag faction were set as 5 0 005 and 0 6 to minimize overfitting and maintain a relatively reasonable calculation time elith et al 2008 meanwhile the sampling and variable selection process was run within a k fold cross validation k was set to 10 procedure rodriguez et al 2009 3 2 bn model establishment the process of establishing a bn from a dataset includes two phases structure learning and parameter learning structure learning consists in finding an appropriate network structure i e dag with a good fitting of the data parameter learning is to estimate the probability parameter i e cpts given the determined dag from structure learning in this study structure learning was conducted using the peter clark pc algorithm which is a widely used structure learning algorithm for bn models because of its high computational efficiency spirtes et al 2000 kalisch and bühlman 2007 scanagatta et al 2019 the pc algorithm identifies the skeleton of the network based on conditional independence ci tests and orients the undirected edges under the constraint that no cycles are produced by prioritizing the execution of low level ci tests the computational efficiency in the iteration process is improved which allows the pc algorithm to have an obvious advantage of operating rate parameter learning was accomplished using the expectation maximum em algorithm the em algorithm is an iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation mle of parameters in the presence of latent variables which has been widely used in bn modeling because of its robustness to datasets with missing values in the parameter learning process dempster et al 1977 do and batzoglou 2008 hu et al 2016 herein the dataset was randomly divided into a training set 70 of the data and a validation set 30 of the data the bn model establishment i e structure and parameter learning was performed using the training set and was conducted in genie a general purpose bayesian network commercial software that integrates multiple modules e g the pc algorithm and the em algorithm with visual interface and convenient operation bayes fusion 2017 considering the reduction of data size after partitioning a 10 fold cross validation function was adopted to make effective use of the data 3 3 model evaluation the constructed bn models were evaluated in terms of predictability and parsimony the predictive performance of the bn models was evaluated on both the training and validation sets using three common measure indices area under the curve auc of receiver operating characteristic roc overall accuracy oa and f1 score the roc curve is a two dimensional graphical plot presenting an intuitive view of predictive performance and the auc is the area between the horizontal axis and roc curve carter et al 2016 the oa is a common index used to describe the overall prediction accuracy the percentage of correctly predicted samples oommen et al 2010 the f1 score is used to comprehensively describe the predictability of different classes of a variable for a given model hu et al 2016 all of the three measurement indices i e auc oa and f1 score have the same range from 0 to 1 and values close to 1 represent the best predictability parsimony requires the model to have a reasonable complexity to fit the data vandekerckhove et al 2015 the parsimony of the bn models was evaluated using akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic both the aic and bic are the most popular information criteria used to quantify the trade off between the goodness of fit and complexity of candidate models burnham and anderson 2004 the aic involves a goodness of fit term and a penalty term which quantify the improved goodness of fit and complexity arising from an increase in model size respectively akaike 1974 the bic shares the same goodness of fit term with aic but imposes a larger penalty on the model size schwarz 1978 liu et al 2012 the values of aic and bic for bn models can be computed as follows 10 aic i 1 n j 1 q i k 1 r i n ijk log n ijk n ij i 1 n q i r i 1 11 bic i 1 n j 1 q i k 1 r i n ijk log n ijk n ij 1 2 i 1 n q i r i 1 log n 12 n ij k 1 r i n ijk where n is the number of variables n is the number of cases in the observed data q i is a feasible configuration for the parents of the i th variable x i r i is the number of states of x i and n ijk is the number of cases in which the parent nodes of x i take the j th value and x i takes the k th value both the aic and bic positively reflect the parsimony performance of the bn model in other words the larger the aic or bic the more parsimonious is the bn model 3 4 dam risk analysis based on the established bn the risk analysis of dam failure is conducted by influence strength is and sensitivity analysis the is represents the impact level of each parent node on its child nodes the purpose of which is to reveal the causal network of dam risk system and to detect the major failure path the value of is can be calculated from the cpt of the child node which measures the distance between various conditional probability distributions over the child node conditional on the states of the parent node koiter 2006 sensitivity analysis is a technique that investigates the effect of the variations in probability parameters of variables i e risk factors on the probability of target variables i e earth dam failure the sensitivity value reflects the importance of risk factors to the uncertainty of dam risk systems and thus allows to identify the critical risk factors for earth dam failure kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 herein both the values of is and sensitivity were calculated by genie using euclidean distance koiter 2006 and the algorithm proposed by kjaerulff and van der gaag kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 respectively 4 case study 4 1 data source and candidate predictors this study was carried out using the earth dam incident dataset derived from dam incident investigations conducted by the association of state dam safety officials asdso https damsafety org incidents the earth dam incident dataset records basic information on the safety incidents of 760 earth dams in the united states from 1874 to 2020 including the incident type risk factor failure mode and a description of the incident according to the incident type the states of earth dams were divided into two categories of which 238 were failure cases and 522 were non failure cases the spatial distribution of these dams is shown in fig 4 the risk factors in the dataset were divided into 25 categories such as extreme flood efd insufficient spillway capacity isc and slope instability spi some unknown or under investigated risk factors were classified under the term other factors the occurrence frequencies of all the 25 risk factors are given in table 1 failure mode triggered by several risk factors is the ultimate cause of dam failure df in the dataset the three major failure modes are overtopping ot seepage damage spd and structural instability srt with frequencies of 47 5 24 9 and 15 5 respectively table 1 these three failure modes are related to the impact resistance seepage resistance and shear resistance of earth dams and have been generally employed in previous studies zhang et al 2011 fu et al 2018 li et al 2019 for earth dam systems the state of earth dams corresponds to the response variable the risk factors were regarded as candidate predictors which varied with different variable selection methods the optimized variable selection was performed by brt and compared with the other two sets of predictors constructed using different methods the failure modes ot spd and srt i e mot mspd and msrt were incorporated as intermediate variables to better clarify the causal network of earth dam failure and risk factors these three failure modes and partial risk factors selected by different methods were employed in the subsequent bn modeling process 4 2 selection of predictors among the 25 risk factors in the earth dam incident dataset 12 were identified as the dominant predictors upon the brt based variable selection fig 5 a shows the average relative influence of individual risk factors on the original predictive deviance among the 25 risk factors isc had the most significant influence on predictive deviance greater than 20 followed by efd spi spillway failure sf reservoir overfilling rof and foundation instability fdi whose influence on predictive deviance was over 5 the influence of the other eight risk factors that is piping pg sinkhole se internal erosion ite poor construction quality pcq abutment failure atf gate failure gf failure of seepage control spc and animal activity amt were between 1 and 5 the remaining risk factors had the least influence with relative predictive deviance close to 0 fig 5 b shows the change in the predictive deviance of the trained brt with the number of removed risk factors the change in predictive deviance was close to 0 when the number of removed variables was less than 14 while the deviance change jumped to nearly 0 02 when the 14th variable was removed the remaining 11 variables had increasing effects on the predictive deviance of the model the blue horizontal line represents the se of the original deviance of the model it can be seen that the se 0 016 was higher than the deviance change caused by removal of the first 13 risk factors which showed that the contribution of the first 13 risk factors to predictive deviance is less than that of random error these results indicated that the first 13 risk factors had no significant effect on model prediction and the 14th 25th risk factors were the 12 dominant risk factors these are isc efd spi sf rof fdi pg se ite pcq atf and gf the other two sets of predictors one consisting of all 25 risk factors and the other consisting of risk factors with a high frequency top 12 were given in table 1 the three sets of predictors determined by the different methods contained eight identical risk factors efd sf isc pcq pg ite se and spi these eight risk factors had a significant effect on prediction while maintaining a relatively high frequency of occurrence the brt based and frequency based methods differed in the selection of the four predictors the frequency based method selected four risk factors amt spc foundation deficiency fdc and malfunction of drain systems dst whereas the brt based method selected the other four risk factors with a relatively low frequency i e rof fdi gf atf 4 3 comparison of bn models the three bn models with predictors selected by different methods are shown in fig 6 g1 and g3 represented the bn models with 12 risk factors selected by the brt method fig 6 a and frequency statistics fig 6 c respectively g2 represented the bn model with all 25 risk factors fig 6 b the structures of all three bn models were composed of three layers that is risk factors blue nodes triggered failure modes yellow nodes and then led to dam failure orange nodes which intuitively reflected the causal network of earth dam failure and risk factors it can also be noticed that there were some apparent differences in the structures of the three models in particular the structure of model g2 which contained all 25 risk factors was much more complicated than that of models g1 and g3 although models g1 and g3 were established using the same number of predictors their structures revealed different relationship between the risk factors and earth dam failure for example in model g1 mot was the major failure mode because it was affected by seven of the 12 risk factors as seen the edges in fig 6 a in model g3 mspd was the major mode affected by eight of the 12 risk factors fig 6 c the performances of the three bn models were compared in term of predictability auc oa and f1 and parsimony aic and bic as shown in fig 7 and table 2 in terms of predictability the mean auc values based on 50 runs of the three models using the training set were g2 0 895 g1 0 855 g3 0 783 fig 7 however for the validation set the mean auc value of model g1 was the highest 0 789 followed by those of models g3 0 692 and g2 0 548 similar results were also observed in the mean oa values model g2 exhibited the best oa performance in the training set 0 906 but for the validation set model g1 showed the best prediction evaluated by oa 0 794 followed by model g3 and model g2 had the worst prediction with an oa equal to 0 564 even in the failure and non failure classes of mean f1 the main results of oa and auc still exist for example in the case of the failure class model g1 achieved a mean f1 score of 0 789 on the validation set significantly higher than that of model g2 0 494 the above comparison indicated that model g2 with all 25 risk factors had a serious overfitting problem and that model g1 based on the optimized or brt based variable selection had the best prediction the parsimony of the three bn models was measured by aic and bic as shown in table 2 model g1 had the highest aic score 1945 39 followed by model g2 1803 78 model g3 received a slightly lower aic 1797 58 than model g2 although the bic of all three bn models was lower than the corresponding aic the difference between models g1 and g2 is more apparent when bic was considered the bic score of model g1 was still the highest 1922 05 followed by model g3 whose bic score 1775 12 was higher than that of model g2 1715 69 both the aic and bic highlighted that model g1 had the best performance on parsimony in summary the optimized variable selection based on the brt method can effectively improve bn modeling for the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states 4 4 risk analysis of earth dam failure the risk analysis of earth dam failure in the united states was conducted through is and sensitivity analysis based on the best performing model g1 i e optimized variable selection the causal network of earth dam failure three failure modes and 12 risk factors was revealed through the calculation of is fig 8 shows the average is labelled on each edge between the paired nodes in model g1 as shown in fig 8 the risk factors imposed different effects on the failure modes among the risk factors triggering mot the value of isc was the highest 0 905 followed by efd 0 787 and rof 0 771 indicating strong causal relationships between these three risk factors and mot considering msrt spi had the greatest impact compared to the other risk factors with the highest value of is 0 828 fdi whose is value 0 652 was second to that of spi also had an important influence on msrt for mspd the risk factor with the highest is value 0 846 was pg indicating a significant influence on mspd the impacts of se and ite were non negligible with is values of 0 622 and 0 605 respectively among these three failure modes mot had the highest is value 0 836 compared to msrt 0 609 and mspd 0 673 reflecting that mot was the primary failure mode that caused df basically isc mot df was the major failure path of earth dam systems in the causal network the importance of the 12 risk factors for earth dam failure was given by sensitivity analysis presented in fig 9 and table 3 among all the risk factors isc was the most important risk factor to df with the highest sensitivity value 14 6 followed by efd and spi with their sensitivity over 10 indicating that the perturbations of their probability parameter can cause a change in the probability of earth dam failure by more than 10 and further demonstrated that they were the critical risk factors controlling the states of earth dams to a great extent the sensitivity values of the other risk factors i e sf fdi rof pg se pcq gf ite and atf were relatively small all less than 10 reflecting that they were the secondary risk factors of earth dam failure 5 discussion 5 1 advantages of optimized variable selection in bn modeling in this study the comparison results of bn models established with different predictors showed that the optimized variable selection based on brt was an effective approach for improving the performance of bn modeling and prediction compared to the bn model using all candidate predictors i e model g2 the bn model with brt based selection i e model g1 not only had a more concise network structure but also more important performed well in prediction indicating that the proposed approach was useful for eliminating noise in the dataset and weakening overfitting as observations of dam failure and potential risk factors increase it is necessary to identify dominant risk factors to maintain the parsimony of bn models at a reasonable degree the most outstanding advantage of brt based selection over frequency based selection is that brt can automatically determine a certain number of predictors according to the noise threshold that is δ d i s e d 0 frequency based selection has difficulty in identifying the importance of predictors especially when they have a close frequency such as dst 3 56 and rof 3 32 in this case study a similar difficulty can also be encountered in dk based selection in addition brt based selection contributed to an overall better performance i e prediction in both the training and validation sets and parsimony of bn models than frequency based selection even though the two selection methods were controlled with the same number of predictors a possible reason lies in that brt based selection considers the interaction between predictors based on the identification of the underlying data distribution and tends to select relatively important and independent variables for bn models to obtain great predictive power in other words frequency based selection is likely to select those predictors affected by others e g spc and dst used in model g2 were affected by pcq seen in fig 6 c which might be unfavorable for prediction indeed some studies had found the effects of independence between selected predictors on model prediction dormann et al 2013 xu et al 2022b basically the brt based selection is a powerful step of bn that contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework 5 2 controls of identified risk factors on earth dam failure based on the established bn model with optimized variable selection i e model g1 the controls of the identified risk factors on earth dam failure in the united states were elucidated from two aspects identifying the causal network of risk factors and earth dam failure and determining the critical risk factors for earth dam failure from the perspective of the causal network of risk factors and earth dam failure different risk factors tend to cause earth dam failure by imposing different effects on failure modes mot was affected by the uncertainty of seven risk factors such as efd isc and rof fig 8 the impact of efd on mot has been emphasized in several previous studies and the requirement of flood control operations is expected to increase owing to climate change lempérière 2017 nakamura and shimatani 2021 isc had the most significant impact is 0 905 on mot among all the risk factors as demonstrated by tiwari and sharma 2015 mot is considered avoidable for a dam with sufficient spillway capacity even in the face of an efd the effect of rof on mot can be attributed to the fact that it increases the probability of mot by raising initial water levels during the discharge period goodarzi et al 2013 interestingly it was found that spi and fdi were two other important risk factors affecting mot which were generally related to msrt because they have enormous destructive power to earth dam structures özer and bromwell 2012 wang et al 2020 some studies have explained that spi and fdi increase the probability of mot through giving rise to landslide induced surge waves in reservoirs and a drop in the height of the dam crest with inclination or uneven settlement of the dam body respectively liu et al 2018 tang et al 2022 indeed spi and fdi were the major risk factors affecting msrt which reflected that one risk factor may cause df by triggering multiple failure modes among the risk factors affecting mspd three i e pg se and ite play a relatively important role is 0 6 which have been investigated by researchers from different perspectives including statistical analysis and numerical simulation al ansari et al 2015 saliba et al 2019 efd and rof also contribute to mspd which increase the seepage pressure by improving the water level in the reservoir su et al 2021 the importance of the risk factors for earth dam failure showed that the three foremost risk factors were isc efd and spi table 3 this result is supported by previous studies on earth dam failures for example several observational and modeling studies have acknowledged the significance of these three risk factors i e isc efd and spi in controlling earth dam systems foster et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 ashraf et al 2018 these above corroborations of identified relationships and critical risk factors restate the reasonability of the optimized variable selection however in other countries and regions e g china europe and australia there are some difference in the identification of the dominant risk factors and their effects on earth dams zhang et al 2011 morales nápoles et al 2014 this can be caused by the spatial variation in climate terrain geology runoff human interference and so on which calls for further studies on identifying the fundamental risk factors based on worldwide database we acknowledge that there are two main uncertainties associated with our study but believe that such uncertainties do not change the main results first the division of the training and validation sets might bring a certain effect on bn model establishment and causal network identification the effects of data division were minimized by imposing the constraint that both training and validation sets have a similar distribution of failure samples therefore the main conclusions e g model g1 performs the best and the most critical risk factor is identified as isc are relatively reliable second the pc algorithm was used to establish the structure of bn models which achieved satisfactory performance in the risk analysis of earth dam failure in the united states the other two widely used structure learning algorithms i e bayesian search bs and greedy thick thinning gtt were also used for bn model establishment and evaluating the robustness of the optimized variable selection for bn models the details can be found in supplementary information structure learning algorithms e g pc bs gtt had some effects in the structure and performance of the bn models but they do not change the superiority of the optimized variable selection for bn modeling 6 conclusion in this study an optimized variable selection method was introduced into bn modeling for dam risk analysis the principle of this method is to remove redundant variables from numerous candidates according to the noise threshold a ml method i e brt was used to conduct the optimized variable selection which is applicable to the complex dam systems and the binary attributes of dam failure the bn model with optimized variable selection not only had a significantly more concise network structure than the bn without variable selection and significantly weakened overfitting but also had more appropriate predictors and better predictability than the bn model with traditional variable selection e g frequency based selection the results indicated that the proposed variable selection is an effective approach for optimizing the performance of bn models based on the established bn model the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states was conducted through influence strength and sensitivity analysis the causal network of the 12 selected risk factors three failure modes and earth dam failure was revealed and the major failure path of earth dam systems was isc mot df with the influence strength value 0 905 and 0 836 respectively the three foremost risk factors were identified as isc efd and spi whose perturbations of probability parameter can induce a change on the probability of earth dam failure by 14 6 11 5 10 9 respectively the findings obtained herein offer a robust mechanistic understanding towards the failure mechanisms of earth dams in the united states which can provide valuable guidance for safety management decisions and risk control measures related to earth dams the optimized variable selection contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework which can serve as a reference for risk analysis of other water conservancy projects credit

2291,dams are vital infrastructure for water resource management and their safety is threatened by the complex interplay of multiple risk factors consequently for dam safety maintenance it is significant to conduct dam risk analysis by detecting the relationship between dam failure and risk factors and identifying the critical risk factors bayesian network bn is an effective tool for this issue and has been widely used in previous studies however there is still a lack of variable selection methods in bn that can automatically select predictors from numerous candidates by considering both predictability and parsimony herein an optimized variable selection is proposed for bn and used in the risk analysis of widespread earth dams in the united states the results showed that the proposed method can automatically determine the optimal predictor set the bn with selected predictors not only exhibits good performance but also has a significantly more concise network than the bn without variable selection and significantly weakens overfitting using the established bn the clear causal network of earth dam failure and 12 risk factors were quantified through influence strength analysis the three foremost risk factors based on their sensitivity analysis were identified to be insufficient spillway capacity extreme flood and slope instability which can serve as a reference for the safety maintenance of earth dams in the united states our study highlights that the proposed variable selection is a powerful step of bn for dam risk analysis and contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework keywords dam risk analysis bayesian network variable selection earth dam failure data availability i have shared the link to my data 1 introduction dams are one of the most important components of water resource infrastructure with multiple benefits such as flood control irrigation and electrical generation as a nonlinear system dams are threatened by the complex interplay of extreme external loads outdated designs material aging and other risk factors kalinina et al 2018 wang et al 2022 with climate change and human interference some dams are exposed to high risk and even fail leading to catastrophic consequences lempérière 2017 fluixá sanmartín et al 2018 the failures of dams have caused immense property damage taken thousands of lives and had profound impacts on social development and ecological environment garcia de leaniz et al 2019 cornwall 2020 ge et al 2022 therefore it is significant of dam risk analysis to detect the relationship between dam failure and risk factors and to identify the critical risk factors for dam failure which can be fundamental for dam safety governance and failure prevention and has gained increasing attention in recent years wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 zhong et al 2021 many efforts have been devoted towards dam risk analysis traditional risk analysis methods such as failure mode and effect analysis fmea analytic hierarchy process ahp and fault tree analysis fta have made significant contributions in improving the understanding of dam risk systems peyras et al 2006 jing et al 2018 liu et al 2021 for instance liu et al 2021 constructed the risk assessment indicator and detected the major failure path of ice dams based on the fuzzy fta method a critical limitation of the above methods is that the complex relationships in dam systems with multiple interacting risk factors may not be fully expressed bayesian network bn combines the advantages of graph and probability theory and is one of the most efficient theoretical models for representing uncertainty and reasoning pearl 2009 compared to fmea ahp and fta bn has proven to be a more flexible method that provides a comprehensive visual representation and precise quantitative assessment of nonlinear sophisticated relationships li et al 2020 lu et al 2020 consequently bn is an effective tool for modeling dam systems and has been increasingly used in dam risk analysis for example andreini et al 2019 analyzed the risk of dam failure caused by internal erosion by developing probabilistic models for the erosion parameters and pipe radius based on the bn method kalinina et al 2018 investigated the causes of dam incidents to identify the risk factors for different dam types by applying a bayesian hierarchical model however the performance of bn modeling can be apparently affected by selected predictors leading to uncertain results of dam risk analysis when modeling dam systems exposed to multiple risk factors i e predictors a strategy is to consider as many risk factors as possible to improve the performance of established bn models zhang et al 2011 however in practice the numerous variable bn model has a complex structure that is difficult to understand and requires high cost of observations for predictors besides an excessive input of predictors may lead to overfitting problems and reduce the predictability of models lever et al 2016 huang et al 2018 shi et al 2019 therefore variable selection which aims to select appropriate predictors has been an important part of bn modeling for dam risk analysis a commonly used method of variable selection is to qualitatively select influential risk factors based on domain knowledge dk e g published scientific evidence and expert opinion morales nápoles et al 2014 chen and lin 2019 xu et al 2022a dk based selection is particularly useful in the absence of observations however it is affected by the subjectivity of experts and may fall into a dilemma when dealing with the conflicting opinions of different experts a more objective method is to select risk factors with a high frequency of occurrence kalinina et al 2018 frequency based selection does not consider the interaction of risk factors also called collinearity for numeric risk factors and may miss critical risk factors when the candidate predictors have a close frequency consequently a more advanced variable selection method is required to optimize bn modeling given the increasing number and variety of candidate predictors more objectively and intelligently such as considering risk factor interactions and removing some insignificant risk factors that may cause overfitting recently machine learning ml has been successfully applied to the prediction of engineering systems hegde and rokseth 2020 novellino et al 2021 wen et al 2022 for example yang et al 2020 predicted the probability of tailings dam failure by integrating long short term memory lstm and convolutional neural network cnn ml methods are effective at modeling nonlinearity and providing accurate predictions for dam systems however due to their complicated structure and low interpretability most ml methods have generally been regarded as black box that do not provide a visual representation of the underlying relationships thus reducing their applicability in dam risk analysis ryo et al 2021 dieber and kirrane 2022 specifically some ml models such as boosted regression tree brt can identify redundant or noisy variables according to their influences on model prediction elith et al 2008 liu et al 2022 after removing these variables the optimized brt model generally shows better predictive performance which provides a reference for variable selection in bn thus it can be expected that the bn model established from optimized variable selection using ml may produce a better prediction and benefit dam risk analysis the safety of earth dams is a major concern in dam risk analysis morales nápoles et al 2014 wang et al 2018 andreini et al 2019 earth dams are the most numerous and widely distributed type of dams accounting for 65 of 58 713 large dams dams with a height of more than 15 m or dams impounding more than 3 million cubic meters registered worldwide updated on april 2020 icold 2021 as they are constructed with natural earth material earth dams are also the type with the highest frequency of failures in the united states approximately 70 of dam failure cases recorded over the past 150 years are earth dams graham 2009 although previous studies based on bn have acknowledged the general effects of risk factors on earth dams the difference between these bns based on different variable selections remains an uncertainty in the risk analysis of earth dams in this study an optimized variables selection method was proposed to improve the performance of bn for dam risk analysis the established bn based on optimized variable selection was then applied in the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states based on the incident dataset of 760 earth dams the primary objectives of this study were to 1 select predictors using the optimized variable selection method 2 establish a bn model with the optimally selected predictors and evaluate its performance 3 conduct risk analysis of earth dams in the united states 2 bayesian network bn bns are probabilistic graphical models that express conditional dependencies between a set of variables in an unknown system pearl 2009 a bn consists of two parts a network structure in the form of a directed acyclic graph dag and probability parameters in the form of conditional probability tables cpts for discrete variables jensen and nielsen 2007 the dag defined as g v l whose nodes v correspond to the variables classified into different states and edges l are the directed arrows connecting these variables intuitively reflect the relationship between paired variables heckerman 1997 the node at the tail of the edge is called the parent node and the node at the head is called the child node the node without a child node is called the leaf node node c in fig 1 whose states respond to the change in the other nodes i e a b e and d and is called the response variable specifically node d has no parent node and is generally the input variable used to predict the other variables called the predictor for a more complex system e g earth dams the network structure of the bn contains many predictors which fundamentally drive the states of the response variable therefore identifying the most appropriate predictors i e variable selection is crucial for the prediction of response variables the cpts which are composed of a set of conditional probabilities define the behavior of each node given its parents in the network fig 1 given the cpt corresponding to each node the relationships between any set of variables in the bn can be measured using the joint probability distribution based on the chain rule of probability heckerman et al 1995 the joint probability distribution over the variable set x 1 x 2 x n for a bn is factored as a product of the conditional probability entries 1 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i x 1 x i 1 owing to the d separation criteria pearl 1986 the joint probability distribution is simplified as the multiplication of the conditional probabilities of the child nodes given their immediate parents hence eq 1 can be written as 2 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i π i where π i is the parent set of variable x i and p x i π i represents the conditional probabilities between the child nodes and their parents for the bn shown in fig 1 the joint probability distributions of the five nodes can be expressed as 3 p a b c d e p d p e d p b e p a b e p c a 3 methodology herein the bn modeling process for dam risk analysis consists of the following four stages principle and approach of optimized variable selection model establishment based on structure and parameter learning model evaluation on predictability and parsimony and dam risk analysis by influence strength and sensitivity analysis fig 2 3 1 optimized variable selection 3 1 1 principle of variable selection all of the candidate predictors involved in the data are seldom equally relevant for prediction shi et al 2019 some predictors do not substantially contribute to the model performance whose existence can not only increases complexity of bn but also more seriously leads to overfitting and reduces model prediction lever et al 2016 an optimized variable selection is to find a minimum predictor subset with great predictive power by removing redundant predictors also called noisy variables drugan and wiering 2010 consider a system with a response variable y e g dam failure and a set of candidate predictors x x 1 x 2 x n e g risk factors the contribution of a candidate predictor to prediction can be measured by the change in predictive deviance caused by removing the predictor the set of i candidate predictors can be considered redundant and be removed if their contribution to prediction δ d i is less than that of random error i e error caused by noise in the data which can be reflected by rajeswaran and blackstone 2017 hence the se d 0 can serve as a noise threshold to remove redundant predictors and the principle of variable selection based on the noise threshold can be expressed as 4 δ d i s e d 0 the se d 0 can be calculated through repeatedly sampling the observed data mchugh 2008 a common practice is to divide the observed data into equally sized subsets in this case δ d i can be calculated using the average change in deviance with variable removal based on each data subset 5 s e d 0 λ 1 k d λ 0 d 0 2 k 1 k 6 d 0 1 k λ 1 k d λ 0 7 δ d i 1 k λ 1 k d λ i d λ 0 where k denotes the number of data subsets d λ 0 is the original deviance produced by all inputs of predictors based on the λ th subset d 0 is the mean of d λ 0 and d λ i is the deviance with the removal of i variables based on the λ th subset the variable selection process involves two main procedures first the original deviance d 0 using the full predictor set is calculated and the contribution of each predictor to the original deviance is measured by dropping one predictor at a time then the predictors are dropped successively from the full predictor set in the order of their contribution to predictive deviance which is analogous to the backward elimination procedure the first dropped predictor has the smallest contribution to the original deviance which will be removed if its contribution is less than the random error measured by se this process is repeated until the total contribution of the removed predictors δ d i are greater than the random error se d 0 of the observed data deviance represents the difference between the prediction and observation of the response variable which can be measured using the loss function of a fitted model for a binary response variable such as dam failure that satisfies the bernoulli distribution the loss function l y u x can be calculated using binary cross entropy the binary cross entropy is a concept in the field of information theory and is a measure that generally calculates the distance between the actual and predicted probability distributions for a given binary variable ho and wookey 2019 the binary cross entropy loss function can be expressed as 8 l y u x j 1 n y j log u j j 1 n 1 y j log 1 u j where u x is the function of the fitted model n is the number of cases in the observed data y j and u j are the observation and prediction of the response variable in the j th case respectively the smaller the value of binary cross entropy the better the fit of a given model to the observed data 3 1 2 boosted regression tree brt the brt method was used to provide predictions i e u x and complete the variable selection process brt is a machine learning method that combines the strengths of decision trees or regression trees and boosting process schapire 2003 elith et al 2008 as a tree based model brt can handle different types of variables binary numeric and categorical with no need for data processing elith et al 2008 müller et al 2013 brt is efficient for handling interactions between predictors and is applicable to nonlinear relationships besides the performance of brt is highly robust to the inclusion of a large number of redundant predictors friedman and meulman 2003 the above features of brt provide prerequisites for the variable selection of dam risk systems decision trees provide preliminary predictions for brt which fit the variation in the response variable by identifying the partitioned predictor space that has the most homogeneous responses to the predictors as shown in fig 3 boosting fits an ensemble of decision trees to produce more robust predictions than a single decision tree schapire 2003 the function of brt is defined as the sum of the base learner t x γ m 9 u x m 0 m ω m t x γ m where t x γ m represents a decision tree determined by predictors x and split points γ m m is the number of decision trees participating in boosting and ω m is the weight of the base learner t x γ m for the m th decision tree given the brt model u x predictor matrix x and loss function l y u x the variable selection process using brt can be expressed as estimate the original prediction deviance d 0 l y u x orin based on original predictor matrix x orin for each candidate predictor x x 1 x 2 x n generate predictor matrix x drop by successively dropping predictor x i from x orin estimate prediction deviance d i l y u x drop based on the predictor matrix x drop calculate the deviation of prediction deviance δ d i d i d 0 remove predictor x i if δ d i is smaller than s e d 0 in this study the variable selection process based on brt was performed using the dismo package in r software 4 1 2 the brt calibration was determined by three critical hyper parameters namely tree complexity learning rate and bag fraction which controlled the maximum number of splits for fitting each decision tree the speed at which the boosting algorithm proceeded down the gradient descent and the proportion of the available training data at each iteration respectively hastie et al 2009 herein the values of the tree complexity learning rate and bag faction were set as 5 0 005 and 0 6 to minimize overfitting and maintain a relatively reasonable calculation time elith et al 2008 meanwhile the sampling and variable selection process was run within a k fold cross validation k was set to 10 procedure rodriguez et al 2009 3 2 bn model establishment the process of establishing a bn from a dataset includes two phases structure learning and parameter learning structure learning consists in finding an appropriate network structure i e dag with a good fitting of the data parameter learning is to estimate the probability parameter i e cpts given the determined dag from structure learning in this study structure learning was conducted using the peter clark pc algorithm which is a widely used structure learning algorithm for bn models because of its high computational efficiency spirtes et al 2000 kalisch and bühlman 2007 scanagatta et al 2019 the pc algorithm identifies the skeleton of the network based on conditional independence ci tests and orients the undirected edges under the constraint that no cycles are produced by prioritizing the execution of low level ci tests the computational efficiency in the iteration process is improved which allows the pc algorithm to have an obvious advantage of operating rate parameter learning was accomplished using the expectation maximum em algorithm the em algorithm is an iterative algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation mle of parameters in the presence of latent variables which has been widely used in bn modeling because of its robustness to datasets with missing values in the parameter learning process dempster et al 1977 do and batzoglou 2008 hu et al 2016 herein the dataset was randomly divided into a training set 70 of the data and a validation set 30 of the data the bn model establishment i e structure and parameter learning was performed using the training set and was conducted in genie a general purpose bayesian network commercial software that integrates multiple modules e g the pc algorithm and the em algorithm with visual interface and convenient operation bayes fusion 2017 considering the reduction of data size after partitioning a 10 fold cross validation function was adopted to make effective use of the data 3 3 model evaluation the constructed bn models were evaluated in terms of predictability and parsimony the predictive performance of the bn models was evaluated on both the training and validation sets using three common measure indices area under the curve auc of receiver operating characteristic roc overall accuracy oa and f1 score the roc curve is a two dimensional graphical plot presenting an intuitive view of predictive performance and the auc is the area between the horizontal axis and roc curve carter et al 2016 the oa is a common index used to describe the overall prediction accuracy the percentage of correctly predicted samples oommen et al 2010 the f1 score is used to comprehensively describe the predictability of different classes of a variable for a given model hu et al 2016 all of the three measurement indices i e auc oa and f1 score have the same range from 0 to 1 and values close to 1 represent the best predictability parsimony requires the model to have a reasonable complexity to fit the data vandekerckhove et al 2015 the parsimony of the bn models was evaluated using akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic both the aic and bic are the most popular information criteria used to quantify the trade off between the goodness of fit and complexity of candidate models burnham and anderson 2004 the aic involves a goodness of fit term and a penalty term which quantify the improved goodness of fit and complexity arising from an increase in model size respectively akaike 1974 the bic shares the same goodness of fit term with aic but imposes a larger penalty on the model size schwarz 1978 liu et al 2012 the values of aic and bic for bn models can be computed as follows 10 aic i 1 n j 1 q i k 1 r i n ijk log n ijk n ij i 1 n q i r i 1 11 bic i 1 n j 1 q i k 1 r i n ijk log n ijk n ij 1 2 i 1 n q i r i 1 log n 12 n ij k 1 r i n ijk where n is the number of variables n is the number of cases in the observed data q i is a feasible configuration for the parents of the i th variable x i r i is the number of states of x i and n ijk is the number of cases in which the parent nodes of x i take the j th value and x i takes the k th value both the aic and bic positively reflect the parsimony performance of the bn model in other words the larger the aic or bic the more parsimonious is the bn model 3 4 dam risk analysis based on the established bn the risk analysis of dam failure is conducted by influence strength is and sensitivity analysis the is represents the impact level of each parent node on its child nodes the purpose of which is to reveal the causal network of dam risk system and to detect the major failure path the value of is can be calculated from the cpt of the child node which measures the distance between various conditional probability distributions over the child node conditional on the states of the parent node koiter 2006 sensitivity analysis is a technique that investigates the effect of the variations in probability parameters of variables i e risk factors on the probability of target variables i e earth dam failure the sensitivity value reflects the importance of risk factors to the uncertainty of dam risk systems and thus allows to identify the critical risk factors for earth dam failure kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 herein both the values of is and sensitivity were calculated by genie using euclidean distance koiter 2006 and the algorithm proposed by kjaerulff and van der gaag kjærulff and van der gaag 2000 respectively 4 case study 4 1 data source and candidate predictors this study was carried out using the earth dam incident dataset derived from dam incident investigations conducted by the association of state dam safety officials asdso https damsafety org incidents the earth dam incident dataset records basic information on the safety incidents of 760 earth dams in the united states from 1874 to 2020 including the incident type risk factor failure mode and a description of the incident according to the incident type the states of earth dams were divided into two categories of which 238 were failure cases and 522 were non failure cases the spatial distribution of these dams is shown in fig 4 the risk factors in the dataset were divided into 25 categories such as extreme flood efd insufficient spillway capacity isc and slope instability spi some unknown or under investigated risk factors were classified under the term other factors the occurrence frequencies of all the 25 risk factors are given in table 1 failure mode triggered by several risk factors is the ultimate cause of dam failure df in the dataset the three major failure modes are overtopping ot seepage damage spd and structural instability srt with frequencies of 47 5 24 9 and 15 5 respectively table 1 these three failure modes are related to the impact resistance seepage resistance and shear resistance of earth dams and have been generally employed in previous studies zhang et al 2011 fu et al 2018 li et al 2019 for earth dam systems the state of earth dams corresponds to the response variable the risk factors were regarded as candidate predictors which varied with different variable selection methods the optimized variable selection was performed by brt and compared with the other two sets of predictors constructed using different methods the failure modes ot spd and srt i e mot mspd and msrt were incorporated as intermediate variables to better clarify the causal network of earth dam failure and risk factors these three failure modes and partial risk factors selected by different methods were employed in the subsequent bn modeling process 4 2 selection of predictors among the 25 risk factors in the earth dam incident dataset 12 were identified as the dominant predictors upon the brt based variable selection fig 5 a shows the average relative influence of individual risk factors on the original predictive deviance among the 25 risk factors isc had the most significant influence on predictive deviance greater than 20 followed by efd spi spillway failure sf reservoir overfilling rof and foundation instability fdi whose influence on predictive deviance was over 5 the influence of the other eight risk factors that is piping pg sinkhole se internal erosion ite poor construction quality pcq abutment failure atf gate failure gf failure of seepage control spc and animal activity amt were between 1 and 5 the remaining risk factors had the least influence with relative predictive deviance close to 0 fig 5 b shows the change in the predictive deviance of the trained brt with the number of removed risk factors the change in predictive deviance was close to 0 when the number of removed variables was less than 14 while the deviance change jumped to nearly 0 02 when the 14th variable was removed the remaining 11 variables had increasing effects on the predictive deviance of the model the blue horizontal line represents the se of the original deviance of the model it can be seen that the se 0 016 was higher than the deviance change caused by removal of the first 13 risk factors which showed that the contribution of the first 13 risk factors to predictive deviance is less than that of random error these results indicated that the first 13 risk factors had no significant effect on model prediction and the 14th 25th risk factors were the 12 dominant risk factors these are isc efd spi sf rof fdi pg se ite pcq atf and gf the other two sets of predictors one consisting of all 25 risk factors and the other consisting of risk factors with a high frequency top 12 were given in table 1 the three sets of predictors determined by the different methods contained eight identical risk factors efd sf isc pcq pg ite se and spi these eight risk factors had a significant effect on prediction while maintaining a relatively high frequency of occurrence the brt based and frequency based methods differed in the selection of the four predictors the frequency based method selected four risk factors amt spc foundation deficiency fdc and malfunction of drain systems dst whereas the brt based method selected the other four risk factors with a relatively low frequency i e rof fdi gf atf 4 3 comparison of bn models the three bn models with predictors selected by different methods are shown in fig 6 g1 and g3 represented the bn models with 12 risk factors selected by the brt method fig 6 a and frequency statistics fig 6 c respectively g2 represented the bn model with all 25 risk factors fig 6 b the structures of all three bn models were composed of three layers that is risk factors blue nodes triggered failure modes yellow nodes and then led to dam failure orange nodes which intuitively reflected the causal network of earth dam failure and risk factors it can also be noticed that there were some apparent differences in the structures of the three models in particular the structure of model g2 which contained all 25 risk factors was much more complicated than that of models g1 and g3 although models g1 and g3 were established using the same number of predictors their structures revealed different relationship between the risk factors and earth dam failure for example in model g1 mot was the major failure mode because it was affected by seven of the 12 risk factors as seen the edges in fig 6 a in model g3 mspd was the major mode affected by eight of the 12 risk factors fig 6 c the performances of the three bn models were compared in term of predictability auc oa and f1 and parsimony aic and bic as shown in fig 7 and table 2 in terms of predictability the mean auc values based on 50 runs of the three models using the training set were g2 0 895 g1 0 855 g3 0 783 fig 7 however for the validation set the mean auc value of model g1 was the highest 0 789 followed by those of models g3 0 692 and g2 0 548 similar results were also observed in the mean oa values model g2 exhibited the best oa performance in the training set 0 906 but for the validation set model g1 showed the best prediction evaluated by oa 0 794 followed by model g3 and model g2 had the worst prediction with an oa equal to 0 564 even in the failure and non failure classes of mean f1 the main results of oa and auc still exist for example in the case of the failure class model g1 achieved a mean f1 score of 0 789 on the validation set significantly higher than that of model g2 0 494 the above comparison indicated that model g2 with all 25 risk factors had a serious overfitting problem and that model g1 based on the optimized or brt based variable selection had the best prediction the parsimony of the three bn models was measured by aic and bic as shown in table 2 model g1 had the highest aic score 1945 39 followed by model g2 1803 78 model g3 received a slightly lower aic 1797 58 than model g2 although the bic of all three bn models was lower than the corresponding aic the difference between models g1 and g2 is more apparent when bic was considered the bic score of model g1 was still the highest 1922 05 followed by model g3 whose bic score 1775 12 was higher than that of model g2 1715 69 both the aic and bic highlighted that model g1 had the best performance on parsimony in summary the optimized variable selection based on the brt method can effectively improve bn modeling for the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states 4 4 risk analysis of earth dam failure the risk analysis of earth dam failure in the united states was conducted through is and sensitivity analysis based on the best performing model g1 i e optimized variable selection the causal network of earth dam failure three failure modes and 12 risk factors was revealed through the calculation of is fig 8 shows the average is labelled on each edge between the paired nodes in model g1 as shown in fig 8 the risk factors imposed different effects on the failure modes among the risk factors triggering mot the value of isc was the highest 0 905 followed by efd 0 787 and rof 0 771 indicating strong causal relationships between these three risk factors and mot considering msrt spi had the greatest impact compared to the other risk factors with the highest value of is 0 828 fdi whose is value 0 652 was second to that of spi also had an important influence on msrt for mspd the risk factor with the highest is value 0 846 was pg indicating a significant influence on mspd the impacts of se and ite were non negligible with is values of 0 622 and 0 605 respectively among these three failure modes mot had the highest is value 0 836 compared to msrt 0 609 and mspd 0 673 reflecting that mot was the primary failure mode that caused df basically isc mot df was the major failure path of earth dam systems in the causal network the importance of the 12 risk factors for earth dam failure was given by sensitivity analysis presented in fig 9 and table 3 among all the risk factors isc was the most important risk factor to df with the highest sensitivity value 14 6 followed by efd and spi with their sensitivity over 10 indicating that the perturbations of their probability parameter can cause a change in the probability of earth dam failure by more than 10 and further demonstrated that they were the critical risk factors controlling the states of earth dams to a great extent the sensitivity values of the other risk factors i e sf fdi rof pg se pcq gf ite and atf were relatively small all less than 10 reflecting that they were the secondary risk factors of earth dam failure 5 discussion 5 1 advantages of optimized variable selection in bn modeling in this study the comparison results of bn models established with different predictors showed that the optimized variable selection based on brt was an effective approach for improving the performance of bn modeling and prediction compared to the bn model using all candidate predictors i e model g2 the bn model with brt based selection i e model g1 not only had a more concise network structure but also more important performed well in prediction indicating that the proposed approach was useful for eliminating noise in the dataset and weakening overfitting as observations of dam failure and potential risk factors increase it is necessary to identify dominant risk factors to maintain the parsimony of bn models at a reasonable degree the most outstanding advantage of brt based selection over frequency based selection is that brt can automatically determine a certain number of predictors according to the noise threshold that is δ d i s e d 0 frequency based selection has difficulty in identifying the importance of predictors especially when they have a close frequency such as dst 3 56 and rof 3 32 in this case study a similar difficulty can also be encountered in dk based selection in addition brt based selection contributed to an overall better performance i e prediction in both the training and validation sets and parsimony of bn models than frequency based selection even though the two selection methods were controlled with the same number of predictors a possible reason lies in that brt based selection considers the interaction between predictors based on the identification of the underlying data distribution and tends to select relatively important and independent variables for bn models to obtain great predictive power in other words frequency based selection is likely to select those predictors affected by others e g spc and dst used in model g2 were affected by pcq seen in fig 6 c which might be unfavorable for prediction indeed some studies had found the effects of independence between selected predictors on model prediction dormann et al 2013 xu et al 2022b basically the brt based selection is a powerful step of bn that contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework 5 2 controls of identified risk factors on earth dam failure based on the established bn model with optimized variable selection i e model g1 the controls of the identified risk factors on earth dam failure in the united states were elucidated from two aspects identifying the causal network of risk factors and earth dam failure and determining the critical risk factors for earth dam failure from the perspective of the causal network of risk factors and earth dam failure different risk factors tend to cause earth dam failure by imposing different effects on failure modes mot was affected by the uncertainty of seven risk factors such as efd isc and rof fig 8 the impact of efd on mot has been emphasized in several previous studies and the requirement of flood control operations is expected to increase owing to climate change lempérière 2017 nakamura and shimatani 2021 isc had the most significant impact is 0 905 on mot among all the risk factors as demonstrated by tiwari and sharma 2015 mot is considered avoidable for a dam with sufficient spillway capacity even in the face of an efd the effect of rof on mot can be attributed to the fact that it increases the probability of mot by raising initial water levels during the discharge period goodarzi et al 2013 interestingly it was found that spi and fdi were two other important risk factors affecting mot which were generally related to msrt because they have enormous destructive power to earth dam structures özer and bromwell 2012 wang et al 2020 some studies have explained that spi and fdi increase the probability of mot through giving rise to landslide induced surge waves in reservoirs and a drop in the height of the dam crest with inclination or uneven settlement of the dam body respectively liu et al 2018 tang et al 2022 indeed spi and fdi were the major risk factors affecting msrt which reflected that one risk factor may cause df by triggering multiple failure modes among the risk factors affecting mspd three i e pg se and ite play a relatively important role is 0 6 which have been investigated by researchers from different perspectives including statistical analysis and numerical simulation al ansari et al 2015 saliba et al 2019 efd and rof also contribute to mspd which increase the seepage pressure by improving the water level in the reservoir su et al 2021 the importance of the risk factors for earth dam failure showed that the three foremost risk factors were isc efd and spi table 3 this result is supported by previous studies on earth dam failures for example several observational and modeling studies have acknowledged the significance of these three risk factors i e isc efd and spi in controlling earth dam systems foster et al 2000 zhang et al 2009 ashraf et al 2018 these above corroborations of identified relationships and critical risk factors restate the reasonability of the optimized variable selection however in other countries and regions e g china europe and australia there are some difference in the identification of the dominant risk factors and their effects on earth dams zhang et al 2011 morales nápoles et al 2014 this can be caused by the spatial variation in climate terrain geology runoff human interference and so on which calls for further studies on identifying the fundamental risk factors based on worldwide database we acknowledge that there are two main uncertainties associated with our study but believe that such uncertainties do not change the main results first the division of the training and validation sets might bring a certain effect on bn model establishment and causal network identification the effects of data division were minimized by imposing the constraint that both training and validation sets have a similar distribution of failure samples therefore the main conclusions e g model g1 performs the best and the most critical risk factor is identified as isc are relatively reliable second the pc algorithm was used to establish the structure of bn models which achieved satisfactory performance in the risk analysis of earth dam failure in the united states the other two widely used structure learning algorithms i e bayesian search bs and greedy thick thinning gtt were also used for bn model establishment and evaluating the robustness of the optimized variable selection for bn models the details can be found in supplementary information structure learning algorithms e g pc bs gtt had some effects in the structure and performance of the bn models but they do not change the superiority of the optimized variable selection for bn modeling 6 conclusion in this study an optimized variable selection method was introduced into bn modeling for dam risk analysis the principle of this method is to remove redundant variables from numerous candidates according to the noise threshold a ml method i e brt was used to conduct the optimized variable selection which is applicable to the complex dam systems and the binary attributes of dam failure the bn model with optimized variable selection not only had a significantly more concise network structure than the bn without variable selection and significantly weakened overfitting but also had more appropriate predictors and better predictability than the bn model with traditional variable selection e g frequency based selection the results indicated that the proposed variable selection is an effective approach for optimizing the performance of bn models based on the established bn model the risk analysis of earth dams in the united states was conducted through influence strength and sensitivity analysis the causal network of the 12 selected risk factors three failure modes and earth dam failure was revealed and the major failure path of earth dam systems was isc mot df with the influence strength value 0 905 and 0 836 respectively the three foremost risk factors were identified as isc efd and spi whose perturbations of probability parameter can induce a change on the probability of earth dam failure by 14 6 11 5 10 9 respectively the findings obtained herein offer a robust mechanistic understanding towards the failure mechanisms of earth dams in the united states which can provide valuable guidance for safety management decisions and risk control measures related to earth dams the optimized variable selection contributes to the development of an intelligent bn modeling framework which can serve as a reference for risk analysis of other water conservancy projects credit

2292,compact dual polarization doppler x band weather radars x wrs have recently gained attention in scandinavia for sub km and minute scale rainfall observations this study develops a method for merging data from two x wrs in dalby and helsingborg southern sweden operated at five and one elevation angle levels respectively to improve the accuracy of rainfall observations in total 87 rainfall events from may september 2021 observed by 38 tipping bucket gauges in the overlapping coverage of the x wrs were used for ground truth the gauges were classified into four zones an artificial neural network using doppler and dual polarization variables ann and a regression based hybrid of rates single level rainfall products built in to the x wrs based on the marshall palmer equation rmp were calibrated for each zone the calibrated models at 5 min scale significantly outperformed rates for all zones verified by gilbert skill score gss relative bias rbias mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse not using the calibration data quantile quantile plots confirmed a considerable improvement of the statistical distribution of the merged rainfall estimates for zone i closest to dalby ii mid way between dalby and helsingborg and iv similar range as ii for dalby but farthest to helsingborg especially using ann zone iii farthest to dalby and closest to helsingborg was problematic for all rates ann and rmp the lowest level elevation angle for both x wrs showed the most erroneous rates consequently the problems with zone iii can be solved if multiple levels of helsingborg x wr at higher levels are available keywords artificial intelligence ai furuno prediction quantitative precipitation estimation qpe skåne urban hydrology data availability all the data used in this study were obtained from external data providers va syd and nsva as described in section 2 and acknowledgements of the paper 1 introduction sub kilometre and minute rainfall observations are necessary to investigate microscale weather and climate variation for advanced hydrometeorological research and applications in urban hydrology e g due to the dominance of impervious surfaces and heterogeneity of the land cover the accuracy of runoff response simulation and forecast depends highly on the accuracy of the spatiotemporal rainfall observations einfalt et al 2004 gires et al 2014 hou et al 2020 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 thorndahl et al 2017 the need is further highlighted under the climate change condition forcing more frequent extreme events such as cloudburst and pluvial flooding axelsson et al 2021 rosenzweig et al 2019 thus the misrepresentation of spatiotemporal rainfall in the planning and real time measures for stormwater management is at least problematic and can threaten liveability of the communities through poor design and unpreparedness to flooding hosseini 2019 kaiser et al 2021 mobini et al 2021 rain gauges are the only means for direct measuring of rainfall depth at individual sites thus the accuracy of the spatiotemporal rainfall data based on a rain gauge network relies on the network density and temporal aggregation of the observations morbidelli et al 2020 reviewed over 25 000 rain gauges worldwide and found that the number of in situ instruments operating at as low as 1 5 min aggregations started to grow by the advent of the digital data loggers in the mid 20th century however the number of gauges for several regions dropped significantly after several decades probably due to high maintenance cost the prevalence of the centralized observations by ground based weather radars wrs in the last decades kumjian 2013 thorndahl et al 2017 may be another reason for the lowered pace of investments in high resolution in situ instruments according to berne et al 2004 the required spatiotemporal resolution of rainfall data for urban hydrological applications is summarised as about 3 km 5 min 2 km 2 min and 1 5 km 1 min for catchment sizes of the order of 1000 100 and 10 ha respectively notaro et al 2013 suggested stricter resolutions of 1 7 km and 5 min or higher for an urban catchment of about 700 ha in italy even higher resolutions seem necessary for smaller urban catchments otherwise the timing and magnitude of peak runoff can be shifted and smoothed by spatiotemporal aggregation of rainfall inputs bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 for example bruni et al 2015 studied 11 sub areas of an urban catchment of 3 4 km2 size with a variable resolution of rainfall data 100 2000 m and 1 10 min they showed a conceivably higher sensitivity of timing of the maximum in sewer water depth at 10 min vs 5 min aggregations and related that to the small concentration time of the sub catchments 10 min a wr can monitor rainfall over larger area at a more regular and higher resolution compared to a usual rain gauge network due to the indirect measuring techniques however wr observations are prone to multiple error sources such as non meteorological echoes signal attenuation ground clutter and overshooting einfalt et al 2004 van de beek et al 2016 hosseini et al 2020 there are different types of wrs x band wrs x wrs compared to the more prevalent c band wrs c wrs operate at a higher frequency 8 12 vs 4 8 ghz and shorter wavelength 2 5 4 vs 4 8 cm s band wrs operate at longer wavelengths compared to c band wrs as a result of sampling more raindrops x wrs could at least theoretically provide more precise rainfall estimation compared to c and s wr though at the cost of more attenuation this fact generally limits the use of x wrs to shorter ranges while allowing the use of a smaller antenna and therefore lower installation and operation cost as compared to conventional c wrs in view of the above the low cost high frequency x wrs have gained attention for urban hydrological applications lengfeld et al 2014 thorndahl et al 2017 to diminish the erroneous estimations causing inconsistent performance of a single x wr operation at its nominal range 50 70 km recent studies suggest the combined use of several x wrs together with observations from rain gauges wang et al 2013 or other radars hosseini et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2014 lengfeld et al 2016 modern wrs can transmit and receive signals in two orthogonal polarizations horizontal and vertical which allow calculation of additional radar variables to describe the targets thus more accurate estimates of raindrop size distribution dsd and improved methods for attenuation correction as compared to the single polarization radar are provided cifelli and chandrasekar 2010 wang and chandrasekar 2010 lim et al 2013 kumjian 2013 li and willems 2017 for example simpson and fox 2018 studied over 300 h of rainfall data by three radars of the next generation radar nexrad system and 15 tipping bucket gauges as ground truth in the us for different rainfall regimes summer and winter they showed better performance of long range rainfall estimation using dual polarization rather than single polarization equations although dual polarization techniques were introduced several decades ago dual polarization x wrs have rather recently become popular and therefore require further studies in addition the preliminary study of the first dual polarization x wr in sweden hosseini et al 2020 showed different performance of the rainfall estimations by range at different elevation angle scans observing the vertical profile in several levels and suggested the combination of x wr levels as a necessary step for a consistent rainfall estimation in view of the above this study aims to develop a methodology to combine the wealth of multiple level dual polarization and doppler data available from two permanent x wrs in southern sweden into a unified improved rainfall product in their overlapping area the goal is to prepare with the required methodology for the future x wr networks that are likely to increase in number in sweden and abroad therefore some procedures are considered to generalize the developed methods such as by dividing the study area based on the ranges from each of the two x wrs into a few zones the methods used in this study for merging the x wrs include a hybrid scheme using linear regression of marshall palmer marshall and palmer 1948 type rainfall estimates rmp from the single x wr levels rates and a purely data driven artificial neural network ann using dual polarization and doppler variables of two x wrs as input to the authors knowledge the use of artificial intelligence for merging dual polarimetric data from a system of x wrs is novel to improve highly necessary high resolution quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in urban hydrology and flood prediction the underlying methods for ann modelling were introduced mainly in the late 20th century e g hagan et al 1997 foresee and hagan 1997 however the use of ann for merging the sate of the art polarimetric x wrs is new the main novelty of the present study lies in merging x wr data from multiple level scans at different zones to address the qpe inconsistency caused by the elevation angle and range related errors particularly the importance of the levels was recently considered for qpe using conventional radars e g s wr in taiwan wei and hsu 2020 and c wr in the uk husnoo et al 2021 thus improved data reliability by combining different x wrs especially by incorporating dual polarization variables is necessary for the advancement of microscale qpe necessary for urban flood protection the study period was may september 2021 that covers the entire summer season considering the importance of the summer rainfalls for the case study area the ground truth data were obtained from 38 tipping bucket gauges that provided rather satisfactory reference data length for modelling as described below furthermore the study of the empirically based regression model rmp provides an additional reference to evaluate the reliability of the purely data driven model developed by ann note that the term ground truth does not mean that the rain gauges are flawless references for the qpe modelling by merging x wrs therefore the paper discusses the radar gauge data scale difference as an uncertainty source whilst acknowledging that the use of 5 min vs hourly aggregations at the x wrs bins scale could provide interesting merging models for improved high resolution qpe at the nominal ranges of the single x wrs 2 background and case study sweden is a north european country that has experienced significant increase of both annual and summer june july august precipitation since 1960 european environment agency 2021 the swedish portal for climate change adaptation 2021 reports that during the past three decades the greatest precipitation increase was observed in summer climate projections based on the medium and extreme emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 suggest further increase by the end of the 21st century for majority of the country jacob et al 2014 regardless of the generally drier and earlier summers projected for southern sweden the united nation s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc predicts heavier rainfalls usually occurring in summer throughout the country most of these findings however are obtained based on the daily rain gauge or regional climate model data thus assumptions about future local events could be more uncertain than those of the regional projections and therefore require improvements of high resolution observations the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi is a national organization interested in the development of rainfall observations and products at different resolutions e g at 15 min and 2 km scale berg et al 2016 the smhi s nationwide c wrs were gradually upgraded to dual polarizations in the past years in addition recently va syd and nsva two water utility companies in southern sweden with the collaboration of lth faculty of engineering of lund university invested in the country s first network of dual polarization doppler x wrs sweden water research and smhi have been additional partners in the evaluation of the new technology since a pilot test in 2018 hosseini et al 2020 south et al 2019 consequently two x wrs were installed in dalby and helsingborg in 2019 and 2020 respectively the network was recently under consideration to join the veva collaboration https www veva dk initiated in the neighbouring country denmark to have a shared benefit over the greater copenhagen area that partly includes southern sweden 2 1 study area the area of focus for the current study is the overlapping coverage area of the two x wrs located in dalby and helsingborg cities fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the observation radius of the two radars is different 50 and 70 km due to different settings by the operators for the same devices and the study area covers several municipalities such as eslöv landskrona and malmö to name some as an example of the vulnerability of the study area to extreme rainfall one can refer to the severe pluvial flooding in late august 2014 with the direct economic loss of about 600 million sek for malmö city malmö stad 2016 2 2 rain gauge data fig 1 denotes the location of all rain gauges operated by nsva and va syd within and outside the study area the rain gauges used in the study were 38 tipping buckets within the overlapping coverage area of the x wrs of which 29 are operated by va syd and the rest by nsva fig 2 illustrates the distance distribution of the 38 gauges to each of the x wrs for example teckomatorp the nsva s gauge located in svalöv municipality in fig 1 that roughly lays on an imaginary line connecting the two x wrs is at a range of about 28 km from both x wrs fig 2 the gauges had a constant volumetric resolution of 0 2 mm equivalent to one tipping but a variable temporal resolution during a storm usually from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the sequence of the temporal rainfall intensity for a consistent use of the gauges as ground truth for the temporally regular radar rainfall estimates therefore both data were temporally aggregated to a constant time step here 5 min the matter is further discussed in the methodology section 2 3 radar data from may 2021 the built in binary data produced by the x wrs were converted to hdf5 hierarchical data format version 5 for a more convenient data storage and processing according to the standard of the radar program of the european meteorological services network called eumetnet opera michelson et al 2019 each hdf5 file contains all measurements from one or more scans of an x wr at a minute depending on the settings by the operator a scan at a given x wr level was equivalent to a 360 rotation of the antenna at sweeps azimuthal intervals of about 0 4 0 5 each giving a scanline with multiple observations at constant range resolutions of 50 and 75 m for dalby and helsingborg x wr respectively the scans available for the study were from one level of helsingborg x wr at a 2 elevation angle and multiple levels of dalby x wr at 1 5 2 4 6 and 8 elevation angles the x wr built in software provided by the manufacturer translates a single observation of an x wr at a given radar bin the projection of a radar sampling volume over the cartesian plane to a few features of targets called radar variables the x wr variables relevant here included dbzh horizontal reflectivity in db also referred to as zh in some literature zdr differential reflectivity between horizontal and vertical polarizations in db vrad radial velocity in m s 1 rhohv correlation between horizontal and vertical reflectivity variable between 0 and 1 phidp differential phase and kdp specific differential phase in degrees km 1 the radar software then calculates a built in rainfall intensity product rate rain rate in mm h 1 the x wr built in method for calculating rate uses a similar equation as the marshall palmer equation type exponential relation between rainfall intensity and reflectivity but uses corrected horizontal reflectivity for signal attenuation based on the dual polarization variables zdr and kdp as described in hosseini et al 2020 a comprehensive discussion of dual polarization radar variables is found in kumjian 2013 3 methodology the methodology initially describes two necessary steps concerning the division of the study data and area into events and zones respectively then it explains the methods used for the rainfall estimation modelling by merging of the two sets of x wr data finally the verification scores or performance criteria used for the ground truth evaluations of the estimated rainfall are presented 3 1 rain gauge based event detection and event selection 3 1 1 event detection to lower the load of data handling and processing the study primarily focused on the rainfall events based on observations from the 38 ground truth gauges rather than several hundreds of radar bins over the study area during the study period may september 2021 this period covers the late spring to early autumn rainfalls that are typically known for their high spatiotemporal variability by focusing on the gauge detected events the rainstorms occurring outside of the gauges were missed however with the 38 gauges within the overlapping coverage of the two x wrs it was possible to include enough events in the study the event extraction was based on the wet periods of the gauges non zero values that could be useful for the evaluation of the rainfall estimates by specific performance criteria such as probability of detection pod however to evaluate other criteria such as false alarm ratio far observations in the dry periods of the gauges were also required thus the study defined a more comprehensive meaning for an event by monitoring the aggregation of rainfall at half hourly time steps of all gauges rather than the exact tipping minutes at single gauges accordingly one tipping at one out of the 38 gauges during a 30 min time step was enough to attribute the event to the entire study area and the 30 min period in other words as shown in fig 3 the events could be separated only when there was no tipping at any of the 38 gauges for at least 30 consecutive minutes according to this definition the extracted events could be further extended e g by 5 min from each side of every event without exceeding the limits of the adjacent events the defined events including the extensions led to an unknown extent to inclusion of the time spent on the accumulation of rainfall in a gauge before it tips similarly for an imaginary catchment in the study area the events could consider to an unknown extent the time interval between the moments when the first or last raindrop of any given event falls on a catchment and when the first or last tipping of the event is recorded in the gauges as seen in fig 3 the duration of rainfall at the individual gauges could typically and on average be shorter than the duration of the defined events it was likely to have many zero values at 1 or 5 min scale along with the non zero values for the radar gauge data pairs from both the dry gauges e g g1 g2 g3 and g5 for e4 and dry periods of the wet gauges e g g4 for e4 based on the definition above for the example of the event e4 in fig 3 the only wet gauge is g4 this imaginary event could represent a transient and local rain cell accordingly if we assumed that there was a few tips at a single 5 min step during e4 and the extension period was a 5 min step from both sides of the event then we actually had one non zero value i e 0 2 mm and seven 30 5 1 2 zero values at g4 and 8 30 5 2 zero values at each of g1 g2 g3 and g5 for the radar gauge data comparisons from this specific event due to the use of 38 gauges in our study the number of zero values could be usually less dominating than that was described for the imaginary event e4 it is noted that the corresponding data from an x wr are from a bin rather than a regularly sized grid including several bins to lower the uncertainties due to the incomparable spatial scale of the observed estimated rainfall data for the merging models the equivalent bin for a gauge was the one whose centre was closest to the location of the gauge then different sizes of merged bins from the system of multiple radars are inevitable but not problematic for the data driven merging modelling in the present study it is however noted that the different spatial scales of a rain gauge and a radar bin still may introduce uncertainty that can generally increase by range for a single radar thus this uncertainty can be moderated by using a system of multiple radars viewing a site at different ranges for having a temporally comparable radar gauge data however 5 min aggregations were preferred over the original 1 min resolution of the x wrs because the tipping bucket observations had irregular temporal resolution according to previous studies as discussed in the introduction the 5 min scale seems to be an upper limit for rainfall data considered interesting for many typical urban catchments e g when timing and magnitude of peak runoff regarding pluvial flooding or combined sewer overflow are of interest nevertheless due to the different gauge radar data nature we provided further analyses using hourly data to evaluate possible uncertainties in using 5 min scale qpe as undertaken in the study 3 1 2 event selection using the maximum gauge intensity mgi threshold the study aimed to select as many events as possible in the merging modelling at an efficient data processing time therefore the events were screened based on a local intensity threshold that assures keeping moderate to heavy events the threshold was based on the maximum 30 min gauge intensity mgi rather than the average areal intensity over the entire period of the event as a measure for the local severity of rainfall mgi was the highest 30 min intensity of an event observed by one or more of the 38 gauges due to the 0 2 mm resolution of the tipping buckets the minimum mgi could be 0 4 mm h 1 rainfall events with an mgi less than or equal to 2 mm h 1 i e mgi 2 4 mm h 1 were excluded from the x wr merging modelling this threshold is comparable to the upper limit of 2 5 mm h 1 considered for the light rainfall according to some literature e g american meteorological society 2012 meteorological service of canada 2015 in practice such events might cause runoff if it continues raining for hours therefore some literature differed between rain generally humid weather with non stop rainfall for hours and showers intermittent rainstorms of variable intensities and used different thresholds of 0 5 mm h 1 and 2 mm h 1 for rain and shower respectively met office 2011 the primary focus of the present study on summer rainfalls that are typically of the shower type can justify the use of mgi threshold here it is worth highlighting that the 2 mm h 1 threshold used in the current study was calculated based on the 30 min intervals equivalent to 1 mm rain depth at half an hour therefore the corresponding threshold based on the hourly data could vary between 1 and 2 mm h 1 since the recorded rainfall of the gauge related to the mgi for the other half of an hour of the event could be any value between zero and 1 mm finally with the event classification based on the mgi only those events where none of the 38 gauges had an intensity above 2 mm h 1 were excluded therefore the study did not exclude altogether the data from gauges with lower intensity even dry gauges into the merging modelling 3 2 dividing the study area into zones the influence of the range on the quality of the rainfall estimation was highlighted in the radar literature e g simpson and fox 2018 as discussed by hosseini et al 2020 the attenuation and overshooting are among the main causes of the performance deterioration for a single x wr operation the current study attempted to consider the range effect in the merging modelling by dividing the study area into several zones and developing a separate model for each zone as a generalized method the overlapping area of x wrs was divided into a few sub areas bounded by the one third two third and full range radiuses of the x wrs as in fig 4 the delimited sub areas were named by the capital letters a b c d and e and the primed capital letters e f and g the presence of a prime sign in the name of a sub area e g e indicates its symmetry with another sub area with the same name but without the prime sign e g e on either side of an imagined axis that connects the two x wrs then an assumption could be that a merging model developed for e can be imitated for e if we accept that range is a dominant factor in the rainfall estimation of an x wr this assumption is useful for this example because otherwise no rain gauge in the e means no ways to develop a specific merging model for it such hypotheses however are out of the scope of the current study to test and should be investigated elsewhere among the delimited sub areas in fig 4 a b c d and e included the 38 ground truth gauges also the sub area b was quite small and encompassed only three of these gauges to have a high number of radar gauge data pairs for the generalization of the merging models the smallest sub area b was dissolved in a to give a bigger area hereinafter named as zone i consequently zone ii zone iii and zone iv were used to refer to the sub areas c d and e respectively hence the four zones used for the merging models can be summarized as zone i a and b in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third range of dalby x wr and maximum range of helsingborg x wr zone i represents areas for which the closer radar i e dalby x wr can play a substantial role zone ii c in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third and two thirds ranges of both x wrs zone ii encompasses roughly the areas in the mid way between the two x wrs so can represent a comparable role from both x wrs zone iii d in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third range of helsingborg x wr and maximum range of dalby x wr zone iii represents areas for which the closer radar i e helsingborg x wr can play a substantial role zone iv e in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third and two thirds ranges of dalby x wr and the two thirds and maximum ranges of helsingborg x wr zone iv represents areas that are compared to the other zones far from the imagined line connecting the two radars while being closer to one of the radars i e dalby x wr so a rather smaller role of helsingborg x wr compared to dalby x wr is estimated for this zone the boundaries of the zones above could however be considered as an approximation therefore it should be acceptable to extend the use of a zone model to adjacent locations outside the specific zone in case there is not any good model for them otherwise considering the sharp borders for the zones may although not necessarily or always result in unpleasant visual effects such as unsmooth transition between zones over the borders when producing a complete radar map that can be addressed to fix by a range of solutions from purely image analysing tools to more sophisticated interpolation techniques however this falls outside of the scope of the present paper and can be investigated elsewhere 3 3 rainfall estimation models by merging data from two x wrs after the event selection based on the mgi threshold available data from the six levels of the two x wrs one scanning level of the helsingborg x wr and five scanning levels of the dalby x wr per minute were read for the desired bins from the hdf5 files as discussed earlier the corresponding gauge and radar data were rescaled from the original 1 min to the 5 min scale in detail at every gauge site the variables rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr were averaged while the built in rainfall intensity product rate was converted to rainfall depth and aggregated over the regular 5 min time steps for the selected events this slightly coarser resolution rather than too larger aggregations used in the merging modelling can keep them useful for urban applications by avoiding too much smoothing of data then the zone specific merging models were developed based on two methods ann and rmp as described in the following as an introduction from the available data of the six levels the inputs to the ann and rmp models were the radar polarimetric and doppler variables and the radar built in rate products respectively 3 3 1 ann model ann model is one of the most popular types of the computationally advanced artificial intelligence techniques successfully used for data driven solutions such as non linear function fitting in hydrometeorological applications e g alqudah et al 2013 beusch et al 2018 hosseini et al 2022 kou et al 2022 ann is well known for the effective modelling of complex non linear systems therefore may provide parsimonious ways for merging x wrs and improved local rainfall estimations 3 3 1 1 ann architecture an ann has a mathematical structure resembling the neural network of a human brain this structure or network architecture comprises several connected neurons spreading over one or more hidden layers for the shallow to deep learning between an input layer and an output layer fig 5 here we refer to the neurons on the input layer as nodes black circles and the rest of them as neurons blue circles to indicate that a node has a simpler functioning compared to the neurons also in fig 5 the direction of the arrows denotes the data flow direction for a feedforward ann each node on an input layer contains a long vector of data for an input variable xi here rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr from the six x wr levels which were independent from the rain gauge measurements and is connected to all neurons in the first hidden layer then each neuron on the first hidden layer multiplies every input vector by a scalar weight w and sums the weighted inputs together and with a scalar bias b finally an activation transfer function is applied as f w i x i b where i 1 2 m equal to the number of input variables and xi is the data vector for the ith input variable the resultant vectors for the neurons on the first hidden layer are then treated as input vectors to the neurons on the next hidden layer and so forth the neurons on the final hidden layer are connected to a single neuron on the output layer for the problems with one output variable here the output variable was a long vector of the target values of the spatiotemporal rainfall data obtained from the ground truth gauge observations thus it was necessary that all the input output data pairs include synchronized observations here 5 min time series with removed time steps that corresponded to a missing value in one of the input vectors or in the output vector the study used two different transfer functions a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function for the hidden layers and a linear function for the output layer as a usual practice as commented by matlab the tool used here for the development of the anns therefore for the output layer f n n whereas for the hidden layers f n 1 e x p 2 n 1 e x p 2 n where n f w i x i b these functions are necessarily differentiable with respect to the parameters w and b to be calibrated using a gradient decent or jacobian method after some iterations where the first iteration is initiated by a random set of parameters hagan et al 1997 note that all the data introduced to the anns were normalized over 1 and 1 similar to the range of data for the parameters 3 3 1 2 ann calibration and generalization the calibration of an ann requires a loss function that is usually a function of the mean of sum of squares of errors mse to be minimized to optimize parameters w and b overfitting due to the use of many parameters is a challenge during the parameterization via ann there are several methods for addressing the overfitting issue for a generalized modelling the most common method uses an early stop rule that monitors during the iterations of the optimization epochs the mse variation for a portion of data validation other than the data used for the direct calibration called training then successive worsening of mse in validation for a certain number of epoch called maximum validation fail that was 10 in this study is considered as an indication for overfitting that can terminate the training and calibration then the calibration that involved the training data directly and the validation data indirectly in the parameterization via ann will be finalized with the parameter values obtained from the iteration with minimum mse in validation this study further verified the calibrated parameterized anns with an additional data portion called testing other than training and validation another problem regarding the parameterization is that it can get stuck in a local minimum as in hosseini et al 2022 repeating the parameterization under a given ann architecture and input variable combination by different random initial parameters and selecting the parameterization with the best performance in validation is desirable to find the best model in addition it is difficult to have a prior knowledge on the suitable number of neurons and hidden layers to use for a problem here merging data from two x wrs in a specific zone therefore the selection of the ann architecture can also be considered as trial and error here among one or two hidden layers and 6 30 neurons using additional repeats to a reasonable extent depending on the speed of the training algorithm among others the current study used the backpropagation levenberg marquardt lm training algorithm that often converges quicker and results in a smaller mse compared to the other algorithms used in the function fitting problems according to the matlab recommendations the study used a constant combination of input variables including rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr in the repeats however the choices for dataset partitioning were changed over the ranges of 50 60 20 25 and 15 30 for training testing and validation respectively subject to their sum equals to 100 prior to distribution of data into the portions according to the above ratios the available dataset for modelling was classified based on the following rainfall classes for each parameterization repeat 95 percentile 95 97 5 percentile 97 5 99 percentile 99 99 9 percentile 99 9 percentile then the data in each class were randomly allocated to the training validation and testing portions according to the given ratios e g 60 20 and 20 respectively for fair parameterization and verification testing in total the study used 6000 parameterization repeats for selecting the best merging model by ann for each zone table 1 summarizes the independent choices that were made at each repeat for example the chance to select either of the three training data portion choices 50 55 and 60 table 1 at a given parameterization repeat for the merging modelling of any zone was 1 3 0 333 3 3 2 rmp model the marshall palmer equation of the type z a rb is a well known empirical relationship consistent with an exponential drop size distribution marshall and palmer 1948 yangang 1993 it is used for the estimation of rainfall intensity r from the radar reflectivity z here dbzh as a measure of the backscattered signal power the parameters a and b are usually constant but can also be adjusted depending on the rainfall condition stratiform or convective a built in x wr software uses a similar equation with corrected dbzh for attenuation based on the dual polarization variables zdr and kdp to give rate the techniques for removing non rain detections can benefit from rhohv the details of the x wrs built in equations can be found in hosseini et al 2020 to combine the six rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 3 rd 4 and rd 5 which were independent from the rain gauge measurements by rmp the present study used a linear regression function 1 r m p α r h l 1 5 β l r d l where α and β 1 β 5 are coefficients of the regression equation obtained from the least square method rh denotes rate from the only single level of helsingborg x wr and rd 1 rd 2 rd 3 rd 4 and rd 5 are rates from the single levels 1 5 of dalby x wr for the sake of comparability of the rainfall estimates from rmp and ann eq 1 was calibrated using the same calibration portion training and validation not testing as that used in the selected ann model variable by zone 3 3 3 performance criteria for verification scores eight statistical measures as defined below were used for the evaluation of the single level products rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 as well as modelled rainfall ann and rmp at the location of the 38 ground truth data the corresponding radar data for a gauge was from the closest bin encompassing the gauge location the study reports the resultant scores during testing not used for calibration of models 2 r b i a s 100 e t o t o t 3 m

1 2 n that was equal to the number of 5 min steps in the selected events multiplied by the number of gauges in a given zone after excluding the data with a missing value in either input or target variables from all the single level and merged model rainfall estimation so the term estimated rainfall could be used for both single level products rates and merging models ann and rmp μ and σ are

discussed in knoben et al 2019 regardless of the similar range of values for nse and kge they cannot be interpreted similarly particularly nse 0 indicates a comparable condition to the use of μ o as a simple estimator while it is not the case for kge knoben et al 2019 however the interpretation of positive values of both kge and nse as an improvement upon the μ o benchmark would be acceptable mae pcc nse and kge were calculated for o e data pairs subject to o t 0 2 pod is probability of detection far is false alarm ratio h m f and r are frequency values related to four possible rainfall

statistical criteria presented in eqns 2 9 is designated to investigate a feature of the modelling performance for example rbias indicates the overall magnitude of the under or over estimation based on the negative or positive sign without information about the magnitude of the individual errors that can be cancelled out mae represents the average magnitude of the individual errors pcc usually represents the linear relationship between the datasets but without considering the bias in the mean and standard deviation of the observed and modelled rainfall while nse and kge considers these as well finally pod far and gss present statistics concerning different aspects of the frequency of the detection problem by the products these statistics are frequently used in studies of remotely sensed precipitation and they facilitate comparison to other studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 events detection and specifications during may september 2021 in total 307 events were detected based on the 30 min scale aggregations of the 38 rain gauges observations in the study area during may september 2021 according to methodology as summarized in table 2 minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd of the duration of these events were 0 5 28 2 4 and 4 1 h respectively the events were on average observed by around 8 gauges average rainfall depth of the events for the wet gauges ranged over 0 2 32 3 mm with mean and sd of 1 3 and 3 3 mm respectively table 2 as mentioned earlier in the introduction the may september period is believed to include the usually most extreme events for the study area fig 6 exemplifies the fact by showing a generally higher variation and values of mgi for the 307 events observed during may september 2021 compared to the other events occurred in the past months back to september 2020 the number of events according to the horizontal axis of fig 6 was 1081 during the period september 2020 september 2021 so 28 of these 1081 events occurred during may september 2021 307 1081 28 while the period may september 2021 covered 38 of the longer period 13 month shown in fig 6 5 13 38 so the relative frequency of the may september 2021 events due to the inclusion of summer months was lower compared to the september 2020 april 2021 events 4 2 selected events for the x wr based merging modelling for the rainfall estimation models all available radar gauge rainfall data pairs for the events with an mgi 2 4 mm h 1 were selected as shown in fig 7 the selected events were 87 out of the entire 307 gauge detected events during may september 2021 each having a variable set of maximum 30 min rainfall intensity according to the values given on the right axis according to the definition the mgi denotes the maximum 30 min step rainfall intensity among all gauges for an event so the blue plus markers on the top of the stems dashed blue lines for each event in fig 7 indicate mgi while the lower plus markers on the stems denote the maximum 30 min step rainfall intensity at individual gauges thus for instance the presence of two plus markers for the event no 3 fig 7 with the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of 0 4 and 2 4 mm h 1 indicates that there were at least two wet gauges because multiple gauges could have exactly the same maximum 30 min rainfall intensity for an event to indicate the exact number of wet gauges thus the red columns were depicted in the background of the stems so there was three wet gauges for event no 3 with corresponding values on the left vertical axis in addition fig 7 can give an overview of the spatial variability of the events too for example event no 78 alike event no 8 was observed in two gauges though with a much larger range between their maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 0 4 23 2 vs 0 4 2 8 mm h 1 for event no 9 there is only one plus marker visible on fig 7 however it was among the few events observed by all the 38 gauges all having the same maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of 2 8 mm h 1 therefore the underlying storms during event no 9 was quite uniformly distributed across the study area looking at fig 7 it can be observed that the underlying storms during events with a mediocre mgi had higher tendency to be recorded at more gauges so cover larger areas particularly events no 52 60 with an mgi 8 11 2 mm h 1 were recorded by a comparably high number of wet gauges i e 28 37 however there was no obvious relationship between the number of wet gauges and magnitude of the mgi for the other events in other words the spatial coverage of the underlying storms for both lower intensity and higher intensity events other than the discussed mediocre events could range from small such as for event no 8 and 78 that were recorded by only two gauges to large such as for event no 4 and 87 that were both recorded by 37 gauges it is noted that this result is obtained under the assumptions of the study for the definition of comprehensive events based on the half hourly aggregations and therefore not necessarily valid for other locations and temporal resolutions 4 3 the merging models rmp and ann based on the selected 87 events above the size of input output data vectors after excluding missing values from both radar and gauge data for the merging modelling at 5 min scale varied as follows including calibration and testing data 16 500 from 11 gauges for zone i 14 200 from 9 gauges for zone ii 9 200 from 7 gauges for zone iii 14 500 from 11 gauges for zone iv in the following additional specifications of the merging models such as analysing the ann weights and rmp coefficients are discussed 4 3 1 ann specifications as described in section 3 3 1 each ann parameterization repeat for a zone corresponds to an optimization problem that minimizes the loss function mse for the training data as long as a stopping criterion e g maximum validation fail here 10 consecutive epochs that fail to result in improved mse for the validation data is reached as soon as the ann stops the given repeat gives one parameter set for the ann based on the optimization epoch including minimum validation mse accordingly after repeating this procedure for 6000 times table 1 the selected ann is from the repeat with the minimum validation mse among all as a result the training validation testing ratios and network architectures for the selected ann models were 60 20 20 and net 22 18 for zone i 60 20 20 and net 27 15 for zone ii 50 25 25 and net 23 14 for zone iii 60 20 20 and net 7 26 for zone iv where net hl1 hl2 indicates the number of neurons on the first and second hidden layers as a result zone iii selected the shortest training and longest validation and testing ratios among the few possible choices table 1 in contrary to the other zones according to the assumptions for the dataset partitioning and calibration of ann after validation check under 6000 parameterization repeats it is likely that a more generalized ann prefers to choose a longer training if overfitting is not dominant therefore the apparent preference of zone iii to take a shorter training and longer validation may show that the chance for overfitting was higher for zone iii compared to the other zones as listed earlier the available data for zone iii was shorter 9 200 vs 14 200 16 500 and based on fewer number of gauges 7 vs 9 11 which might explain the possible disruption of the generalization for this zone also a lower number of neurons for zone iv suggests that fewer number of parameters were required for the merging modelling of this zone compared to the others as discussed by heaton et al 2017 the corresponding weights between each of the nodes on the input layer and the neurons on the first hidden layer of an ann can be used as an indication of the relative importance of the input variables fig 8 represents the sum of absolute value of the weights w simply referred to as weight in fig 8 for the 15 top ranked input variables in the selected ann models for zones i iv fig 8a d thus the top longest horizontal bars in the subplots of fig 8 indicate the variables with the highest importance for different zones fig 8a d in this figure the bars are labelled with the variables name and the subscripts denote the corresponding x wr and level e g h helsingborg and d 1 lowest level of dalby as a result the generally lower values of weights i e sum of absolute weights for zone iv is due to the lower number of neurons on the first hidden layer of ann for this zone compared to the other zones as listed earlier 7 vs 22 27 in the sub plots of fig 8 related to zones i ii the first ranked variable was dbzhh horizontal reflectivity from helsingborg x wr followed by kdp from two levels of dalby x wr kdpd 2 and kdpd 1 for zone i and kdpd 1 and kdpd 3 for zone ii as the second and the third ranked variables for zone iii and iv the top ranked variables are dbzhd 3 with a slight difference after kdpd 2 and dbzhd 5 respectively this indicates the importance of the reflectivity for qpe as could be expected from the experimental methods such as the widely used marshall palmer equation marshall and palmer 1948 uijlenhoet 2001 yangang 1993 however the x wr and scanning level corresponding to the selected variables are arguable further discussion on this is given below after reviewing the importance of other variables among different x wr variables vrad and kdp was the least and most frequently appearing variables 0 2 vs 5 6 among the 15 top ranked input variables for ann modelling in the zones particularly kdp constituted five of the six and the eight top ranked variables for zone ii and zone iv fig 8 respectively kdp is the range derivative of the differential phase and is theoretically independent of signal power and is not affected by attenuation and partial beam blockage so kdp is believed to be the most useful dual polarization variable for attenuation correction of both c and x wrs bringi and chandrasekar 2001 kumjian 2013 vrad was never among the 11 top ranked variables for any of the zones according to the literature doppler velocity is used for tornadic vortex signature e g torres and curtis 2015 rather than for qpe among the other polarimetric variables the importance of differential reflectivity zdr is obviously lower than kdp this may be related to the fact that zdr is sensitive to attenuation also zdr in contrast to kdp and dbzh is independent of concentration of the raindrops which is an important measure in qpe kumjian 2013 however zdr gives useful information about the raindrop size thus combining zdr together with other relevant variables is interesting in view of the above the relatively higher importance of kdp and dbzh among the x wr variables observed by the selected ann models for the zones fig 8 imply the ability of ann to represent the physical expectations however as mentioned earlier interpretation of the importance of the selected x wr and levels for these variables requires careful justification due to the complexity of the underlying system weather that is modelled with a purely data driven approach for example in zone i the top dbzh is from helsingborg x wr while the top kdp is from dalby x wr fig 8 although this combination implies benefits of combining a system of x wrs by ann the interpretation is not straightforward the lower importance of dbzh from the closer x wr could be related to the x wr error at short range where the sampling volumes become smaller thus the same size and number of unfavourable particles biological and ground clutter smoke etc could cause larger errors for shorter ranges hosseini et al 2020 another explanation is related to the underlying difference between the two variables dbzh in contrast to kdp is affected by partial beam blockage thus at long ranges where sampling volumes are larger more raindrops are sampled for a better dbzh estimation as discussed in the introduction long range observations are more susceptible to attenuation which may contradict the above finding regarding the importance of dbzhh for zone i however it could be argued that the frequency of a temporally variable attenuation at a specific direction e g for zone i an imaginary line connecting the two x wrs could be a matter of the areal storm size and direction as well in conclusion knowledge of the underlying physical characteristics of the radar observations and knowledge of the areal appearance of the typical storms for a region are desired for developing a data driven qpe and the interpretation of results 4 3 2 rmp specifications the coefficients of eq 1 α β 1 β 2 β 5 for the calibrated rmp models were 0 114 0 080 0 298 0 183 0 003 and 0 016 for zone i 0 042 0 106 0 322 0 003 0 127 and 0 019 for zone ii 0 204 0 020 0 039 0 028 0 205 and 0 002 for zone iii 0 066 0 037 0 242 0 233 0 049 and 0 129 for zone iv accordingly the highest coefficients for zones i ii and iv were obtained for β 2 corresponding to rd 2 while β 4 and α corresponding to rd 4 and rh were almost equally the highest coefficients for zone iii if we accept that the magnitude of the coefficients shows the importance of the input variables the rmp model for zone iii is not following the expectations because rd 4 belongs to a high elevation angle of dalby x wr 6 that had a high range and altitude in this zone this evidence could support the similar inconsistency of ann modelling properties discussed earlier for zone iii in the following more will be discussed about the performance of the merging models and single level products for the zones 4 4 statistical performance criteria of the 5 min rainfall estimates training and validation portions for ann models are together considered as calibration portion accordingly the calibration portion used for the selected ann model and rmp model were the same this section includes the statistical analyses of the 5 min qpe performance in the testing data portion which was not used in calibration of the selected ann and rmp tables 3 6 corresponding to zones i iv present the verification scores obtained for the single level x wr rainfall products rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 and the merged x wr rainfall estimation models rmp and ann generally improved verification scores from rates to rmp and ann was observed based on most of the performance criteria with a few exceptions that are discussed after a review of the difference between rates for all zones among the rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 the highest far and rbias magnitude were observed by rd 1 tables 3 6 meaning that the highest false alarm ratio and biggest relative bias were related to the lowest level scan of the dalby x wr among possible causes ground clutter due to the scanning of dalby x wr at the lowest altitude for rd 1 could be the main a far as big as 34 57 for rd 1 at different zones table 3 6 means that 34 57 of the detected rainfalls at 5 min scale were wrong by this level thus the higher pod for rd 1 compared to the other levels and models e g 95 for zone iv in table 6 is to be considered partly as an artifact and attributed to the high far similarly the lower far for the higher levels e g 14 29 for rd 5 in different zones could be attributed to the low pod thus a proper detection ability must be confirmed by both high pod and low far at the same time as is the case for rmp and ann compared to most of rates for example in zone i table 3 regardless of the comparable pod far for ann and rmp was considerably lower than that for rd 1 3 4 vs 34 similar results could be discussed for the other zones an alternative more independent criterion to evaluate the detection ability of the x wr estimates could be based on gss that takes into account the number of hits due to chance in tables 3 6 gss for ann and rmp was always higher than that for rates for all zones among the zones the highest gss for ann and rmp was 84 and 87 respectively which were obtained in zone i table 3 while the lowest gss was obtained in zone iii for all rates rmp and ann zone iii generally was shown to be the most problematic region for x wr based rainfall estimation it was the only zone where e g no positive nse was obtained for any of the rates rmp ann during testing table 5 for ann and rmp the mae for zone iii 0 4 mm was almost twice the mae for the other zones 0 17 0 23 mm not only rmp and ann models but also all rates were prone to higher errors in zone iii from the considerably lower pod for rates rmp ann in zone iii it is believed that there is mainly a problem related to the rainfall detection at the worst level i e 8 elevation angle of the dalby x wr rd 5 in table 5 only observed 5 5 of the gauged rainfall 0 2 mm correctly this level is related to the highest elevation angle of the studied levels of the two x wrs zone iii is at the farthest distance from the dalby x wr and so was affected most from overshooting by rd 5 referring to fig 8 for zone i dbzh from the only level of the farther radar helsingborg wr and kdp from level 1 and 2 dbzh from level 3 and rhohv from level 5 of the closer radar dalby wr appeared as the five top ranked variables for qpe by ann perhaps better rainfall estimation could have been achieved for zone iii if multiple level x wr data were available from its closer radar helsingborg x wr for merging models from the above tables the highest mae was for the lowest level rates rh or rd 1 which together with the largest positive rbias shows significant overestimation for ground close scans for all zones the overestimation could be related to less exposure to overshooting and thus an intrinsic tendency to overestimation by the radar built in equations of rates that may be corrected however the lower pcc obtained for rh and rd 1 in comparison to the other levels for all zones except for the apparently problematic zone iii rejects the higher potential of bias correction of the lowest level rates at least by a linear bias correction based on this assumption then the higher mae and rbias for rh and rd 1 could be attributed to the error sources such as signal contamination and clutter which are more likely for near ground scans regarding the merging models both ann and rmp showed improvement in all zones compared to rates tables 3 6 and the differences between the mae values of ann and rmp were insignificant slightly smaller mae for ann based on rbias there were three exceptions where the single levels could outperform ann and rmp including rd 2 and rd 3 for zone i table 3 and rd 3 in zone iii table 5 regardless of zone iii that generally was problematic none of these outperformances based on rbias could be supported by any of the other verification scores in zone i however in zone i table 3 pcc for rd 2 and rd 3 was quite close to pcc for ann and rmp looking at the variations of the pcc for rates rmp ann and zones in tables 3 5 it seems pcc cannot signify the differences between the merging models as the other indices such as nse do as an example pcc for rd 2 and rmp in zone iv table 6 were 0 77 and 0 79 while the corresponding values for nse were 0 39 and 0 57 respectively the considerably big difference between these two nse values was supported by the corresponding other criteria such as rbias mae far and gss table 6 therefore nse is believed to be a more independently interpretable criteria compared to pcc fig 9 shows the values of nse among the efficiency indexes and gss among the detection indexes together with the error and bias indexes mae and rbias for an easier inter zone comparison of the verification scores discussed earlier according to fig 9 zone iii was the most problematic zone for all rates rmp ann based on gss and mae in addition in all sub plots of this figure the improvement of the scores by rmp and ann compared to the rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 5 as well as the problematic rd 1 in zone iv are easily observed the ground truth gauges in zone iv were quite densely located in northern areas of the malmö municipality see the maps in figs 1 and 4 thus this lowest level of dalby x wr was probably affected by ground clutter between dalby and malmö cities the overestimations supported by high positive rbias 800 in fig 9a for rd 1 in zone iv while gss was quite small 26 in fig 9b could also be attributed to the contaminated radar signals at low altitudes 4 5 statistical performance criteria of the hourly rainfall estimates so far the presented results are based on the modelling of the aggregated 1 min x wr data and temporally irregular tipping bucket data to 5 min data the reason for this was to make the radar gauge observations temporally more comparable while keeping the resultant data interesting for typical urban hydrological applications here to evaluate the accuracy of the produced data at larger time scales the observed and estimated 5 min rainfall data were aggregated to hourly data in addition a new regression based merging model namely rmpm was developed using the hourly input variables i e the aggregated rates to directly estimate hourly rainfall thus the results of the four statistical criteria i e those in fig 9 were calculated using hourly data and summarized in fig 10 from fig 10a rmpm generally shows overestimation while rmp and ann show underestimation in different zones at an hourly scale however the magnitude of the over and under estimation by the hourly aggregated estimates from the 5 min merging models rmp and ann and the direct hourly rainfall estimates from rmpm are comparable in fig 10b rmpm shows better rainfall detection for zone i and iv but worse detection for zone ii and iii compared to rmp and ann however in none of the zones rmpm could outperform rmp and ann based on the nse and mae criteria according to fig 10c d therefore rmpm performed rather equivalent to or even worse than rmp and ann in hourly qpe regardless of the desired high resolution data for urban hydrology we can alternatively conclude that the direct use of 5 min data scale for merging data from a system of x wrs was equivalent to or even better than using hourly data for the coarser scale applications while one would expect lower uncertainty due to the smaller difference between radar gauge data at 60 vs 5 min the better performance of the developed model at finer resolution might be attributed to the fact that the benefit of combining information from multiple radar levels makes more sense at the event scales 4 6 qq plots of the 5 min gauged vs estimated rainfall an interesting use of high resolution rainfall data could be in design storm problems where the accurate distribution of rainfall data especially related to the extreme values is important to evaluate the statistical distribution of the estimated vs observed rainfall data based on the single level products rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 5 and merging models rmp and ann the study used the quantile quantile qq plots as presented in fig 11 the qq plot is a visual method that checks the agreement of the equivalent quantiles of the observed and estimated data similar 5 min rainfall data testing as those used in the analyses of the merging modelling earlier i e the 20 of 16 500 20 of 14 200 25 of 9 200 and 20 of 14 500 for zones i ii iii and iv respectively were used fig 11 accordingly the estimated quantiles for rmp and ann are plotted in the left column fig 11a d and the estimated quantiles for rates are plotted in the right column fig 11e h of the figure then the four rows are corresponding to the zones fig 11a and 11e for zone i fig 11b and 11f for zone ii and so on regarding the merging models left column zone iii fig 11c showed high discrepancies in form of obvious underestimation of the observed quantiles of above 0 2 mm 5min however for the other zones there were better agreements for both ann and rmp models rmp showed higher tendency to underestimation of extreme quantiles e g above 2 mm 5min compared to ann fig 11a b d for the rates right column different levels showed quite close distributional behaviour in zone i with apparent overestimation that is maximum for the observed quantiles near 4 mm 5min fig 11e then the farther we go from the dalby x wr zones ii iv and iii respectively the higher discrepancies appear between the qq plots of different levels so that some reveal overestimations and the other reveal underestimation especially in zone iii the farthest location to the dalby x wr the underestimations by rd 4 and rd 5 are substantial fig 11h these two highest levels of the dalby x wr could easily overshoot many of the events at that far locations the same levels also revealed underestimations for the zone iii and ii but to lesser extent finally as discussed earlier based on the rbias and gss results in table 6 and fig 9 about rd 1 rate for the lowest level of the dalby x wr it revealed here also the highest overestimation of the rainfall quantiles for zone iv fig 11h the most overestimating rate products for zone iii fig 11g were rh related to the 2 elevation angle of helsingborg radar followed by rd 1 and rd 2 related to the 1 5 and 2 elevation angles of dalby x wr that could be the most prone to contaminated radar signals and ground clutter the overestimations by the lower elevation angles where the overshooting could not be a common source of error may also suggest that the built in equations for x wrs generally overestimate the rainfall so the underestimations are mostly related to the detection problem consequently one reason for the improvement of a simple linear regression model almost as good as ann could be related to the bias correction of the single level products rates by weighting them variably depending on the radar range zones as formulated in the study therefore as assumed before hosseini et al 2020 it was shown in the present study that the wealth of data from multiple elevation angles can be leveraged by merging them as noted earlier the success of the merging models here was achieved based on combining five levels of the dalby x wr and only one level of the helsingborg x wr since the worst performance of the models were obtained for the zone located farthest to the former x wr and closest to the latter one the role of multiple levels should be emphasized regarding the merging of x wrs 4 7 qq plots of the hourly gauged vs estimated rainfall according to fig 12 a d the qq plots show generally good agreement between observed and modelled quantiles for the hourly aggregated data based on the tipping bucket data and the 5 min estimates by the merging models rmp and ann for all zones except zone iii fig 12c therefore the hourly qq plots fig 12 generally resemble the 5 min qq plots fig 11 for ann and rmp models however a slightly higher tendency to underestimation could stem from the rain values 0 2 that could have been recorded as zero by gauges at 5 min scale regardless of the spatial scale difference between a gauge and radar bins in addition rmpm that was developed directly for an hourly scale showed obviously higher overestimation where the cross markers in fig 12a d are barely below the dashed 45 degree line for any of the zones these results are consistent with the results of the rbias criteria discussed earlier regarding the hourly qpe modelling fig 10a note that we did not use ann for direct modelling of hourly qpe because the length of our input output data was 12 times shorter compared to the 5 min modelling which was unfavourable for ai assisted data driven modelling based on the generally comparable results of the rmp and ann at the 5 min scale we do not expect the hourly ann model to result in a much different performance compared to the hourly regression based model rmpm however future studies could evaluate these assumptions based on longer data series 5 summary and conclusions with future scopes considering the inconsistent rainfall estimation at different ranges and elevations by a single x wr operation a generalized data driven scheme for merging data from a system of x wrs operating at multiple elevation angles was designed ann and multi linear regression were used as reference models to evaluate the designed scheme for a case study in southern sweden accordingly data from two x wrs in dalby and helsingborg operated at 50 and 70 km respectively were studied during the study period may september 2021 each scan of an x wr was equivalent to a 360 rotation of the antenna round to azimuth at a specific elevation angle the available data in this study included 1 5 2 4 6 and 8 elevation angle levels from the dalby x wr and a 2 elevation angle level from the helsingborg x wr at a minute due to the different settings by the operators the radar measurements included five variables rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr at every level that were used as inputs for the merging models based on ann also the single level rainfall products built in to the x wrs rates calculated based on the marshall palmer equation adjusted for attenuation were used as inputs to a regression model named rmp then data from 38 tipping bucket rain gauges in the overlapping area of the two x wrs were used as ground truth for the merging models as a preliminary step to efficiently reduce the data processing time for the purpose of the study the gauge detected rainfall events with an mgi higher than 2 mm h 1 were studied in addition the study area was divided with a simple geometric method into a few sub areas among which zones i iv included all the gauges the merging models by ann and rmp were calibrated based on a major part of the data for comparability of the radar gauge data pairs the temporally irregular tipping bucket data and regular 1 min x wr data were aggregated to 5 min steps the calibration of ann was based on a randomly repeated procedure to find an optimum ann architecture with lower chance of stuck in local minima finally four separate rainfall estimation models equivalent to the zones were developed for each modelling type ann and rmp the 20 25 of the data that were kept out of the calibration testing were used for the evaluation of the modelling performance as a result the accuracy of the rainfall estimation and detection at the overlapping area by the merging models substantially improved compared to the rates therefore merging x wrs can help improve the consistency of high resolution observations at longer ranges however at zone iii the farthest to dalby and closest to the helsingborg x wr the accuracy of the estimations also the estimated quantiles by all rates ann and rmp were not favourable in the current study the data from the helsingborg x wr were only available from one elevation angle 2 elevation angle generally the lowest levels from the x wrs especially rd 1 1 5 elevation angle scan of dalby x wr revealed the most erroneous estimates for some of the zones that are suggested to be attributed to the ground clutter and radar data contamination at low altitude scans so it is suggested that the lack of multiple level scans from the closer radar helsingborg x wr 23 km is the main reason for the worst accuracy in zone iii where naturally we did not expect a high benefit from the farther radar dalby x wr 33 km due to higher significance of attenuation and overshooting problems in addition to the attenuation overshooting and ground clutter a source of inconsistency in single level x wr scans could relate to the storm characteristics itself usually a convective compared to stratiform storm can result in significantly different vertical profile that could thus be reflected in the multiple level scans from a system of x wrs therefore the emphasis of this study on the role of range and level for merging x wrs is reasonable in addition the nature of these inconsistency sources could be non linear and complex this fact supports the use of computationally advanced ann models such models however are prone to overfitting and this study introduced some generalization procedures that were shown successful conceivably there was no sign of overfitting for ann as it resulted in the best or at least comparable verification scores during the testing periods not used in calibration in comparison to corresponding scores by the empirically and regression based rmp model this was while ann used a shorter data for training since a part of the calibration data was used only for an early stop rule as an in process validation this study had some limitations that can be considered in the future studies for example the study data included summer months so didn t let investigate other forms of precipitation such as snow while the studied data were significantly useful as a proof of concept of merging data from multiple levels of a network of dual polarization x wrs for improved high resolution qpe using data driven modelling longer data series considering higher variability from more events and radar network conditions are needed to enhance future uses another limitation was related to the use of tipping buckets with irregular temporal resolution as for the ground truth thus the models were developed at a 5 min scale rather than a 1 min scale the original resolution for the x wrs it was possible to use a coarser resolution e g 10 15 and 30 min to further lower the modelling uncertainty due to the incomparability of the radar gauge data however coarser resolutions results in smoother data which are unfavourable for urban hydrology where scales as low as 1 5 min seems necessary in addition current study showed a comparable or even better performance of hourly qpe by aggregating 5 min estimates from the ann and rmp models compared to a regression based model that was directly developed using hourly data rmpm the better performance of a model that is developed at finer resolution 5 min vs hourly can be related to the expected benefits of combining information from multiple radar levels at the storm scales although the results of the current study showed improvement of high resolution qpe by merging multi level dual polarization variables from a system of x wrs the quality of the achieved products seems to be more reliable for short and heavy rains when the uncertainties due to the incomparable temporal scale of the radar gauge observations are at minimum such events are typically relevant during summer for excess runoff management therefore optimal temporal aggregation for a more general purpose product needs to be investigated considering the data limitations application and catchment characteristics in future studies for such investigations the use of alternative ground truth data sources with a regular resolution or higher precision are recommended recent developments of rainfall measuring instruments in the overlapping area of the two x wrs in southern sweden include three disdrometers and a vertically oriented micro rain radar that may help increase the temporal resolution of the ground truth and merging products among other benefits such as considering bright band effect due to scanning the melting layer or improving hydrometeor phase detection in the future the study indicated a high potential for improving x wr rainfall estimation by generalized data driven models that can be extended to include the additional data sources the use of catchment runoff response as a ground truth data source could have its own limitations but let use both radar and gauge data as inputs for further improvements such as by real time adjustment of the calibrated models as a necessary step towards a reliable use in practical problems for water

2292,compact dual polarization doppler x band weather radars x wrs have recently gained attention in scandinavia for sub km and minute scale rainfall observations this study develops a method for merging data from two x wrs in dalby and helsingborg southern sweden operated at five and one elevation angle levels respectively to improve the accuracy of rainfall observations in total 87 rainfall events from may september 2021 observed by 38 tipping bucket gauges in the overlapping coverage of the x wrs were used for ground truth the gauges were classified into four zones an artificial neural network using doppler and dual polarization variables ann and a regression based hybrid of rates single level rainfall products built in to the x wrs based on the marshall palmer equation rmp were calibrated for each zone the calibrated models at 5 min scale significantly outperformed rates for all zones verified by gilbert skill score gss relative bias rbias mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse not using the calibration data quantile quantile plots confirmed a considerable improvement of the statistical distribution of the merged rainfall estimates for zone i closest to dalby ii mid way between dalby and helsingborg and iv similar range as ii for dalby but farthest to helsingborg especially using ann zone iii farthest to dalby and closest to helsingborg was problematic for all rates ann and rmp the lowest level elevation angle for both x wrs showed the most erroneous rates consequently the problems with zone iii can be solved if multiple levels of helsingborg x wr at higher levels are available keywords artificial intelligence ai furuno prediction quantitative precipitation estimation qpe skåne urban hydrology data availability all the data used in this study were obtained from external data providers va syd and nsva as described in section 2 and acknowledgements of the paper 1 introduction sub kilometre and minute rainfall observations are necessary to investigate microscale weather and climate variation for advanced hydrometeorological research and applications in urban hydrology e g due to the dominance of impervious surfaces and heterogeneity of the land cover the accuracy of runoff response simulation and forecast depends highly on the accuracy of the spatiotemporal rainfall observations einfalt et al 2004 gires et al 2014 hou et al 2020 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 thorndahl et al 2017 the need is further highlighted under the climate change condition forcing more frequent extreme events such as cloudburst and pluvial flooding axelsson et al 2021 rosenzweig et al 2019 thus the misrepresentation of spatiotemporal rainfall in the planning and real time measures for stormwater management is at least problematic and can threaten liveability of the communities through poor design and unpreparedness to flooding hosseini 2019 kaiser et al 2021 mobini et al 2021 rain gauges are the only means for direct measuring of rainfall depth at individual sites thus the accuracy of the spatiotemporal rainfall data based on a rain gauge network relies on the network density and temporal aggregation of the observations morbidelli et al 2020 reviewed over 25 000 rain gauges worldwide and found that the number of in situ instruments operating at as low as 1 5 min aggregations started to grow by the advent of the digital data loggers in the mid 20th century however the number of gauges for several regions dropped significantly after several decades probably due to high maintenance cost the prevalence of the centralized observations by ground based weather radars wrs in the last decades kumjian 2013 thorndahl et al 2017 may be another reason for the lowered pace of investments in high resolution in situ instruments according to berne et al 2004 the required spatiotemporal resolution of rainfall data for urban hydrological applications is summarised as about 3 km 5 min 2 km 2 min and 1 5 km 1 min for catchment sizes of the order of 1000 100 and 10 ha respectively notaro et al 2013 suggested stricter resolutions of 1 7 km and 5 min or higher for an urban catchment of about 700 ha in italy even higher resolutions seem necessary for smaller urban catchments otherwise the timing and magnitude of peak runoff can be shifted and smoothed by spatiotemporal aggregation of rainfall inputs bruni et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 for example bruni et al 2015 studied 11 sub areas of an urban catchment of 3 4 km2 size with a variable resolution of rainfall data 100 2000 m and 1 10 min they showed a conceivably higher sensitivity of timing of the maximum in sewer water depth at 10 min vs 5 min aggregations and related that to the small concentration time of the sub catchments 10 min a wr can monitor rainfall over larger area at a more regular and higher resolution compared to a usual rain gauge network due to the indirect measuring techniques however wr observations are prone to multiple error sources such as non meteorological echoes signal attenuation ground clutter and overshooting einfalt et al 2004 van de beek et al 2016 hosseini et al 2020 there are different types of wrs x band wrs x wrs compared to the more prevalent c band wrs c wrs operate at a higher frequency 8 12 vs 4 8 ghz and shorter wavelength 2 5 4 vs 4 8 cm s band wrs operate at longer wavelengths compared to c band wrs as a result of sampling more raindrops x wrs could at least theoretically provide more precise rainfall estimation compared to c and s wr though at the cost of more attenuation this fact generally limits the use of x wrs to shorter ranges while allowing the use of a smaller antenna and therefore lower installation and operation cost as compared to conventional c wrs in view of the above the low cost high frequency x wrs have gained attention for urban hydrological applications lengfeld et al 2014 thorndahl et al 2017 to diminish the erroneous estimations causing inconsistent performance of a single x wr operation at its nominal range 50 70 km recent studies suggest the combined use of several x wrs together with observations from rain gauges wang et al 2013 or other radars hosseini et al 2020 lengfeld et al 2014 lengfeld et al 2016 modern wrs can transmit and receive signals in two orthogonal polarizations horizontal and vertical which allow calculation of additional radar variables to describe the targets thus more accurate estimates of raindrop size distribution dsd and improved methods for attenuation correction as compared to the single polarization radar are provided cifelli and chandrasekar 2010 wang and chandrasekar 2010 lim et al 2013 kumjian 2013 li and willems 2017 for example simpson and fox 2018 studied over 300 h of rainfall data by three radars of the next generation radar nexrad system and 15 tipping bucket gauges as ground truth in the us for different rainfall regimes summer and winter they showed better performance of long range rainfall estimation using dual polarization rather than single polarization equations although dual polarization techniques were introduced several decades ago dual polarization x wrs have rather recently become popular and therefore require further studies in addition the preliminary study of the first dual polarization x wr in sweden hosseini et al 2020 showed different performance of the rainfall estimations by range at different elevation angle scans observing the vertical profile in several levels and suggested the combination of x wr levels as a necessary step for a consistent rainfall estimation in view of the above this study aims to develop a methodology to combine the wealth of multiple level dual polarization and doppler data available from two permanent x wrs in southern sweden into a unified improved rainfall product in their overlapping area the goal is to prepare with the required methodology for the future x wr networks that are likely to increase in number in sweden and abroad therefore some procedures are considered to generalize the developed methods such as by dividing the study area based on the ranges from each of the two x wrs into a few zones the methods used in this study for merging the x wrs include a hybrid scheme using linear regression of marshall palmer marshall and palmer 1948 type rainfall estimates rmp from the single x wr levels rates and a purely data driven artificial neural network ann using dual polarization and doppler variables of two x wrs as input to the authors knowledge the use of artificial intelligence for merging dual polarimetric data from a system of x wrs is novel to improve highly necessary high resolution quantitative precipitation estimation qpe in urban hydrology and flood prediction the underlying methods for ann modelling were introduced mainly in the late 20th century e g hagan et al 1997 foresee and hagan 1997 however the use of ann for merging the sate of the art polarimetric x wrs is new the main novelty of the present study lies in merging x wr data from multiple level scans at different zones to address the qpe inconsistency caused by the elevation angle and range related errors particularly the importance of the levels was recently considered for qpe using conventional radars e g s wr in taiwan wei and hsu 2020 and c wr in the uk husnoo et al 2021 thus improved data reliability by combining different x wrs especially by incorporating dual polarization variables is necessary for the advancement of microscale qpe necessary for urban flood protection the study period was may september 2021 that covers the entire summer season considering the importance of the summer rainfalls for the case study area the ground truth data were obtained from 38 tipping bucket gauges that provided rather satisfactory reference data length for modelling as described below furthermore the study of the empirically based regression model rmp provides an additional reference to evaluate the reliability of the purely data driven model developed by ann note that the term ground truth does not mean that the rain gauges are flawless references for the qpe modelling by merging x wrs therefore the paper discusses the radar gauge data scale difference as an uncertainty source whilst acknowledging that the use of 5 min vs hourly aggregations at the x wrs bins scale could provide interesting merging models for improved high resolution qpe at the nominal ranges of the single x wrs 2 background and case study sweden is a north european country that has experienced significant increase of both annual and summer june july august precipitation since 1960 european environment agency 2021 the swedish portal for climate change adaptation 2021 reports that during the past three decades the greatest precipitation increase was observed in summer climate projections based on the medium and extreme emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 suggest further increase by the end of the 21st century for majority of the country jacob et al 2014 regardless of the generally drier and earlier summers projected for southern sweden the united nation s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc predicts heavier rainfalls usually occurring in summer throughout the country most of these findings however are obtained based on the daily rain gauge or regional climate model data thus assumptions about future local events could be more uncertain than those of the regional projections and therefore require improvements of high resolution observations the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi is a national organization interested in the development of rainfall observations and products at different resolutions e g at 15 min and 2 km scale berg et al 2016 the smhi s nationwide c wrs were gradually upgraded to dual polarizations in the past years in addition recently va syd and nsva two water utility companies in southern sweden with the collaboration of lth faculty of engineering of lund university invested in the country s first network of dual polarization doppler x wrs sweden water research and smhi have been additional partners in the evaluation of the new technology since a pilot test in 2018 hosseini et al 2020 south et al 2019 consequently two x wrs were installed in dalby and helsingborg in 2019 and 2020 respectively the network was recently under consideration to join the veva collaboration https www veva dk initiated in the neighbouring country denmark to have a shared benefit over the greater copenhagen area that partly includes southern sweden 2 1 study area the area of focus for the current study is the overlapping coverage area of the two x wrs located in dalby and helsingborg cities fig 1 as shown in fig 1 the observation radius of the two radars is different 50 and 70 km due to different settings by the operators for the same devices and the study area covers several municipalities such as eslöv landskrona and malmö to name some as an example of the vulnerability of the study area to extreme rainfall one can refer to the severe pluvial flooding in late august 2014 with the direct economic loss of about 600 million sek for malmö city malmö stad 2016 2 2 rain gauge data fig 1 denotes the location of all rain gauges operated by nsva and va syd within and outside the study area the rain gauges used in the study were 38 tipping buckets within the overlapping coverage area of the x wrs of which 29 are operated by va syd and the rest by nsva fig 2 illustrates the distance distribution of the 38 gauges to each of the x wrs for example teckomatorp the nsva s gauge located in svalöv municipality in fig 1 that roughly lays on an imaginary line connecting the two x wrs is at a range of about 28 km from both x wrs fig 2 the gauges had a constant volumetric resolution of 0 2 mm equivalent to one tipping but a variable temporal resolution during a storm usually from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the sequence of the temporal rainfall intensity for a consistent use of the gauges as ground truth for the temporally regular radar rainfall estimates therefore both data were temporally aggregated to a constant time step here 5 min the matter is further discussed in the methodology section 2 3 radar data from may 2021 the built in binary data produced by the x wrs were converted to hdf5 hierarchical data format version 5 for a more convenient data storage and processing according to the standard of the radar program of the european meteorological services network called eumetnet opera michelson et al 2019 each hdf5 file contains all measurements from one or more scans of an x wr at a minute depending on the settings by the operator a scan at a given x wr level was equivalent to a 360 rotation of the antenna at sweeps azimuthal intervals of about 0 4 0 5 each giving a scanline with multiple observations at constant range resolutions of 50 and 75 m for dalby and helsingborg x wr respectively the scans available for the study were from one level of helsingborg x wr at a 2 elevation angle and multiple levels of dalby x wr at 1 5 2 4 6 and 8 elevation angles the x wr built in software provided by the manufacturer translates a single observation of an x wr at a given radar bin the projection of a radar sampling volume over the cartesian plane to a few features of targets called radar variables the x wr variables relevant here included dbzh horizontal reflectivity in db also referred to as zh in some literature zdr differential reflectivity between horizontal and vertical polarizations in db vrad radial velocity in m s 1 rhohv correlation between horizontal and vertical reflectivity variable between 0 and 1 phidp differential phase and kdp specific differential phase in degrees km 1 the radar software then calculates a built in rainfall intensity product rate rain rate in mm h 1 the x wr built in method for calculating rate uses a similar equation as the marshall palmer equation type exponential relation between rainfall intensity and reflectivity but uses corrected horizontal reflectivity for signal attenuation based on the dual polarization variables zdr and kdp as described in hosseini et al 2020 a comprehensive discussion of dual polarization radar variables is found in kumjian 2013 3 methodology the methodology initially describes two necessary steps concerning the division of the study data and area into events and zones respectively then it explains the methods used for the rainfall estimation modelling by merging of the two sets of x wr data finally the verification scores or performance criteria used for the ground truth evaluations of the estimated rainfall are presented 3 1 rain gauge based event detection and event selection 3 1 1 event detection to lower the load of data handling and processing the study primarily focused on the rainfall events based on observations from the 38 ground truth gauges rather than several hundreds of radar bins over the study area during the study period may september 2021 this period covers the late spring to early autumn rainfalls that are typically known for their high spatiotemporal variability by focusing on the gauge detected events the rainstorms occurring outside of the gauges were missed however with the 38 gauges within the overlapping coverage of the two x wrs it was possible to include enough events in the study the event extraction was based on the wet periods of the gauges non zero values that could be useful for the evaluation of the rainfall estimates by specific performance criteria such as probability of detection pod however to evaluate other criteria such as false alarm ratio far observations in the dry periods of the gauges were also required thus the study defined a more comprehensive meaning for an event by monitoring the aggregation of rainfall at half hourly time steps of all gauges rather than the exact tipping minutes at single gauges accordingly one tipping at one out of the 38 gauges during a 30 min time step was enough to attribute the event to the entire study area and the 30 min period in other words as shown in fig 3 the events could be separated only when there was no tipping at any of the 38 gauges for at least 30 consecutive minutes according to this definition the extracted events could be further extended e g by 5 min from each side of every event without exceeding the limits of the adjacent events the defined events including the extensions led to an unknown extent to inclusion of the time spent on the accumulation of rainfall in a gauge before it tips similarly for an imaginary catchment in the study area the events could consider to an unknown extent the time interval between the moments when the first or last raindrop of any given event falls on a catchment and when the first or last tipping of the event is recorded in the gauges as seen in fig 3 the duration of rainfall at the individual gauges could typically and on average be shorter than the duration of the defined events it was likely to have many zero values at 1 or 5 min scale along with the non zero values for the radar gauge data pairs from both the dry gauges e g g1 g2 g3 and g5 for e4 and dry periods of the wet gauges e g g4 for e4 based on the definition above for the example of the event e4 in fig 3 the only wet gauge is g4 this imaginary event could represent a transient and local rain cell accordingly if we assumed that there was a few tips at a single 5 min step during e4 and the extension period was a 5 min step from both sides of the event then we actually had one non zero value i e 0 2 mm and seven 30 5 1 2 zero values at g4 and 8 30 5 2 zero values at each of g1 g2 g3 and g5 for the radar gauge data comparisons from this specific event due to the use of 38 gauges in our study the number of zero values could be usually less dominating than that was described for the imaginary event e4 it is noted that the corresponding data from an x wr are from a bin rather than a regularly sized grid including several bins to lower the uncertainties due to the incomparable spatial scale of the observed estimated rainfall data for the merging models the equivalent bin for a gauge was the one whose centre was closest to the location of the gauge then different sizes of merged bins from the system of multiple radars are inevitable but not problematic for the data driven merging modelling in the present study it is however noted that the different spatial scales of a rain gauge and a radar bin still may introduce uncertainty that can generally increase by range for a single radar thus this uncertainty can be moderated by using a system of multiple radars viewing a site at different ranges for having a temporally comparable radar gauge data however 5 min aggregations were preferred over the original 1 min resolution of the x wrs because the tipping bucket observations had irregular temporal resolution according to previous studies as discussed in the introduction the 5 min scale seems to be an upper limit for rainfall data considered interesting for many typical urban catchments e g when timing and magnitude of peak runoff regarding pluvial flooding or combined sewer overflow are of interest nevertheless due to the different gauge radar data nature we provided further analyses using hourly data to evaluate possible uncertainties in using 5 min scale qpe as undertaken in the study 3 1 2 event selection using the maximum gauge intensity mgi threshold the study aimed to select as many events as possible in the merging modelling at an efficient data processing time therefore the events were screened based on a local intensity threshold that assures keeping moderate to heavy events the threshold was based on the maximum 30 min gauge intensity mgi rather than the average areal intensity over the entire period of the event as a measure for the local severity of rainfall mgi was the highest 30 min intensity of an event observed by one or more of the 38 gauges due to the 0 2 mm resolution of the tipping buckets the minimum mgi could be 0 4 mm h 1 rainfall events with an mgi less than or equal to 2 mm h 1 i e mgi 2 4 mm h 1 were excluded from the x wr merging modelling this threshold is comparable to the upper limit of 2 5 mm h 1 considered for the light rainfall according to some literature e g american meteorological society 2012 meteorological service of canada 2015 in practice such events might cause runoff if it continues raining for hours therefore some literature differed between rain generally humid weather with non stop rainfall for hours and showers intermittent rainstorms of variable intensities and used different thresholds of 0 5 mm h 1 and 2 mm h 1 for rain and shower respectively met office 2011 the primary focus of the present study on summer rainfalls that are typically of the shower type can justify the use of mgi threshold here it is worth highlighting that the 2 mm h 1 threshold used in the current study was calculated based on the 30 min intervals equivalent to 1 mm rain depth at half an hour therefore the corresponding threshold based on the hourly data could vary between 1 and 2 mm h 1 since the recorded rainfall of the gauge related to the mgi for the other half of an hour of the event could be any value between zero and 1 mm finally with the event classification based on the mgi only those events where none of the 38 gauges had an intensity above 2 mm h 1 were excluded therefore the study did not exclude altogether the data from gauges with lower intensity even dry gauges into the merging modelling 3 2 dividing the study area into zones the influence of the range on the quality of the rainfall estimation was highlighted in the radar literature e g simpson and fox 2018 as discussed by hosseini et al 2020 the attenuation and overshooting are among the main causes of the performance deterioration for a single x wr operation the current study attempted to consider the range effect in the merging modelling by dividing the study area into several zones and developing a separate model for each zone as a generalized method the overlapping area of x wrs was divided into a few sub areas bounded by the one third two third and full range radiuses of the x wrs as in fig 4 the delimited sub areas were named by the capital letters a b c d and e and the primed capital letters e f and g the presence of a prime sign in the name of a sub area e g e indicates its symmetry with another sub area with the same name but without the prime sign e g e on either side of an imagined axis that connects the two x wrs then an assumption could be that a merging model developed for e can be imitated for e if we accept that range is a dominant factor in the rainfall estimation of an x wr this assumption is useful for this example because otherwise no rain gauge in the e means no ways to develop a specific merging model for it such hypotheses however are out of the scope of the current study to test and should be investigated elsewhere among the delimited sub areas in fig 4 a b c d and e included the 38 ground truth gauges also the sub area b was quite small and encompassed only three of these gauges to have a high number of radar gauge data pairs for the generalization of the merging models the smallest sub area b was dissolved in a to give a bigger area hereinafter named as zone i consequently zone ii zone iii and zone iv were used to refer to the sub areas c d and e respectively hence the four zones used for the merging models can be summarized as zone i a and b in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third range of dalby x wr and maximum range of helsingborg x wr zone i represents areas for which the closer radar i e dalby x wr can play a substantial role zone ii c in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third and two thirds ranges of both x wrs zone ii encompasses roughly the areas in the mid way between the two x wrs so can represent a comparable role from both x wrs zone iii d in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third range of helsingborg x wr and maximum range of dalby x wr zone iii represents areas for which the closer radar i e helsingborg x wr can play a substantial role zone iv e in fig 4 an area bounded by the one third and two thirds ranges of dalby x wr and the two thirds and maximum ranges of helsingborg x wr zone iv represents areas that are compared to the other zones far from the imagined line connecting the two radars while being closer to one of the radars i e dalby x wr so a rather smaller role of helsingborg x wr compared to dalby x wr is estimated for this zone the boundaries of the zones above could however be considered as an approximation therefore it should be acceptable to extend the use of a zone model to adjacent locations outside the specific zone in case there is not any good model for them otherwise considering the sharp borders for the zones may although not necessarily or always result in unpleasant visual effects such as unsmooth transition between zones over the borders when producing a complete radar map that can be addressed to fix by a range of solutions from purely image analysing tools to more sophisticated interpolation techniques however this falls outside of the scope of the present paper and can be investigated elsewhere 3 3 rainfall estimation models by merging data from two x wrs after the event selection based on the mgi threshold available data from the six levels of the two x wrs one scanning level of the helsingborg x wr and five scanning levels of the dalby x wr per minute were read for the desired bins from the hdf5 files as discussed earlier the corresponding gauge and radar data were rescaled from the original 1 min to the 5 min scale in detail at every gauge site the variables rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr were averaged while the built in rainfall intensity product rate was converted to rainfall depth and aggregated over the regular 5 min time steps for the selected events this slightly coarser resolution rather than too larger aggregations used in the merging modelling can keep them useful for urban applications by avoiding too much smoothing of data then the zone specific merging models were developed based on two methods ann and rmp as described in the following as an introduction from the available data of the six levels the inputs to the ann and rmp models were the radar polarimetric and doppler variables and the radar built in rate products respectively 3 3 1 ann model ann model is one of the most popular types of the computationally advanced artificial intelligence techniques successfully used for data driven solutions such as non linear function fitting in hydrometeorological applications e g alqudah et al 2013 beusch et al 2018 hosseini et al 2022 kou et al 2022 ann is well known for the effective modelling of complex non linear systems therefore may provide parsimonious ways for merging x wrs and improved local rainfall estimations 3 3 1 1 ann architecture an ann has a mathematical structure resembling the neural network of a human brain this structure or network architecture comprises several connected neurons spreading over one or more hidden layers for the shallow to deep learning between an input layer and an output layer fig 5 here we refer to the neurons on the input layer as nodes black circles and the rest of them as neurons blue circles to indicate that a node has a simpler functioning compared to the neurons also in fig 5 the direction of the arrows denotes the data flow direction for a feedforward ann each node on an input layer contains a long vector of data for an input variable xi here rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr from the six x wr levels which were independent from the rain gauge measurements and is connected to all neurons in the first hidden layer then each neuron on the first hidden layer multiplies every input vector by a scalar weight w and sums the weighted inputs together and with a scalar bias b finally an activation transfer function is applied as f w i x i b where i 1 2 m equal to the number of input variables and xi is the data vector for the ith input variable the resultant vectors for the neurons on the first hidden layer are then treated as input vectors to the neurons on the next hidden layer and so forth the neurons on the final hidden layer are connected to a single neuron on the output layer for the problems with one output variable here the output variable was a long vector of the target values of the spatiotemporal rainfall data obtained from the ground truth gauge observations thus it was necessary that all the input output data pairs include synchronized observations here 5 min time series with removed time steps that corresponded to a missing value in one of the input vectors or in the output vector the study used two different transfer functions a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function for the hidden layers and a linear function for the output layer as a usual practice as commented by matlab the tool used here for the development of the anns therefore for the output layer f n n whereas for the hidden layers f n 1 e x p 2 n 1 e x p 2 n where n f w i x i b these functions are necessarily differentiable with respect to the parameters w and b to be calibrated using a gradient decent or jacobian method after some iterations where the first iteration is initiated by a random set of parameters hagan et al 1997 note that all the data introduced to the anns were normalized over 1 and 1 similar to the range of data for the parameters 3 3 1 2 ann calibration and generalization the calibration of an ann requires a loss function that is usually a function of the mean of sum of squares of errors mse to be minimized to optimize parameters w and b overfitting due to the use of many parameters is a challenge during the parameterization via ann there are several methods for addressing the overfitting issue for a generalized modelling the most common method uses an early stop rule that monitors during the iterations of the optimization epochs the mse variation for a portion of data validation other than the data used for the direct calibration called training then successive worsening of mse in validation for a certain number of epoch called maximum validation fail that was 10 in this study is considered as an indication for overfitting that can terminate the training and calibration then the calibration that involved the training data directly and the validation data indirectly in the parameterization via ann will be finalized with the parameter values obtained from the iteration with minimum mse in validation this study further verified the calibrated parameterized anns with an additional data portion called testing other than training and validation another problem regarding the parameterization is that it can get stuck in a local minimum as in hosseini et al 2022 repeating the parameterization under a given ann architecture and input variable combination by different random initial parameters and selecting the parameterization with the best performance in validation is desirable to find the best model in addition it is difficult to have a prior knowledge on the suitable number of neurons and hidden layers to use for a problem here merging data from two x wrs in a specific zone therefore the selection of the ann architecture can also be considered as trial and error here among one or two hidden layers and 6 30 neurons using additional repeats to a reasonable extent depending on the speed of the training algorithm among others the current study used the backpropagation levenberg marquardt lm training algorithm that often converges quicker and results in a smaller mse compared to the other algorithms used in the function fitting problems according to the matlab recommendations the study used a constant combination of input variables including rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr in the repeats however the choices for dataset partitioning were changed over the ranges of 50 60 20 25 and 15 30 for training testing and validation respectively subject to their sum equals to 100 prior to distribution of data into the portions according to the above ratios the available dataset for modelling was classified based on the following rainfall classes for each parameterization repeat 95 percentile 95 97 5 percentile 97 5 99 percentile 99 99 9 percentile 99 9 percentile then the data in each class were randomly allocated to the training validation and testing portions according to the given ratios e g 60 20 and 20 respectively for fair parameterization and verification testing in total the study used 6000 parameterization repeats for selecting the best merging model by ann for each zone table 1 summarizes the independent choices that were made at each repeat for example the chance to select either of the three training data portion choices 50 55 and 60 table 1 at a given parameterization repeat for the merging modelling of any zone was 1 3 0 333 3 3 2 rmp model the marshall palmer equation of the type z a rb is a well known empirical relationship consistent with an exponential drop size distribution marshall and palmer 1948 yangang 1993 it is used for the estimation of rainfall intensity r from the radar reflectivity z here dbzh as a measure of the backscattered signal power the parameters a and b are usually constant but can also be adjusted depending on the rainfall condition stratiform or convective a built in x wr software uses a similar equation with corrected dbzh for attenuation based on the dual polarization variables zdr and kdp to give rate the techniques for removing non rain detections can benefit from rhohv the details of the x wrs built in equations can be found in hosseini et al 2020 to combine the six rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 3 rd 4 and rd 5 which were independent from the rain gauge measurements by rmp the present study used a linear regression function 1 r m p α r h l 1 5 β l r d l where α and β 1 β 5 are coefficients of the regression equation obtained from the least square method rh denotes rate from the only single level of helsingborg x wr and rd 1 rd 2 rd 3 rd 4 and rd 5 are rates from the single levels 1 5 of dalby x wr for the sake of comparability of the rainfall estimates from rmp and ann eq 1 was calibrated using the same calibration portion training and validation not testing as that used in the selected ann model variable by zone 3 3 3 performance criteria for verification scores eight statistical measures as defined below were used for the evaluation of the single level products rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 as well as modelled rainfall ann and rmp at the location of the 38 ground truth data the corresponding radar data for a gauge was from the closest bin encompassing the gauge location the study reports the resultant scores during testing not used for calibration of models 2 r b i a s 100 e t o t o t 3 m

1 2 n that was equal to the number of 5 min steps in the selected events multiplied by the number of gauges in a given zone after excluding the data with a missing value in either input or target variables from all the single level and merged model rainfall estimation so the term estimated rainfall could be used for both single level products rates and merging models ann and rmp μ and σ are mean and standard deviations indexed by e and o for estimated and observed rainfall respectively rbias is relative bias that varies between and and rbias 0 shows a perfect score mae is mean absolute

sutcliffe efficiency and kge kling gupta efficiency could vary between worst and 1 perfect according to the eqs 5 and 6 nse and kge could be formulated as a function of pcc μ and σ gupta et al 2009 as discussed in knoben et al 2019 regardless of the similar range of values for nse and kge they cannot be interpreted similarly particularly nse 0 indicates a comparable condition to the use of μ o as a simple estimator while it is not the case for kge knoben et al 2019 however the interpretation of positive values of both kge and nse as an improvement upon the μ o benchmark would be acceptable mae pcc nse and kge were calculated for o e data pairs subject to o t 0 2 pod is probability of detection far is false alarm ratio h m f and r are frequency values related to four possible rainfall

statistical criteria presented in eqns 2 9 is designated to investigate a feature of the modelling performance for example rbias indicates the overall magnitude of the under or over estimation based on the negative or positive sign without information about the magnitude of the individual errors that can be cancelled out mae represents the average magnitude of the individual errors pcc usually represents the linear relationship between the datasets but without considering the bias in the mean and standard deviation of the observed and modelled rainfall while nse and kge considers these as well finally pod far and gss present statistics concerning different aspects of the frequency of the detection problem by the products these statistics are frequently used in studies of remotely sensed precipitation and they facilitate comparison to other studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 events detection and specifications during may september 2021 in total 307 events were detected based on the 30 min scale aggregations of the 38 rain gauges observations in the study area during may september 2021 according to methodology as summarized in table 2 minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd of the duration of these events were 0 5 28 2 4 and 4 1 h respectively the events were on average observed by around 8 gauges average rainfall depth of the events for the wet gauges ranged over 0 2 32 3 mm with mean and sd of 1 3 and 3 3 mm respectively table 2 as mentioned earlier in the introduction the may september period is believed to include the usually most extreme events for the study area fig 6 exemplifies the fact by showing a generally higher variation and values of mgi for the 307 events observed during may september 2021 compared to the other events occurred in the past months back to september 2020 the number of events according to the horizontal axis of fig 6 was 1081 during the period september 2020 september 2021 so 28 of these 1081 events occurred during may september 2021 307 1081 28 while the period may september 2021 covered 38 of the longer period 13 month shown in fig 6 5 13 38 so the relative frequency of the may september 2021 events due to the inclusion of summer months was lower compared to the september 2020 april 2021 events 4 2 selected events for the x wr based merging modelling for the rainfall estimation models all available radar gauge rainfall data pairs for the events with an mgi 2 4 mm h 1 were selected as shown in fig 7 the selected events were 87 out of the entire 307 gauge detected events during may september 2021 each having a variable set of maximum 30 min rainfall intensity according to the values given on the right axis according to the definition the mgi denotes the maximum 30 min step rainfall intensity among all gauges for an event so the blue plus markers on the top of the stems dashed blue lines for each event in fig 7 indicate mgi while the lower plus markers on the stems denote the maximum 30 min step rainfall intensity at individual gauges thus for instance the presence of two plus markers for the event no 3 fig 7 with the maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of 0 4 and 2 4 mm h 1 indicates that there were at least two wet gauges because multiple gauges could have exactly the same maximum 30 min rainfall intensity for an event to indicate the exact number of wet gauges thus the red columns were depicted in the background of the stems so there was three wet gauges for event no 3 with corresponding values on the left vertical axis in addition fig 7 can give an overview of the spatial variability of the events too for example event no 78 alike event no 8 was observed in two gauges though with a much larger range between their maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 0 4 23 2 vs 0 4 2 8 mm h 1 for event no 9 there is only one plus marker visible on fig 7 however it was among the few events observed by all the 38 gauges all having the same maximum 30 min rainfall intensity of 2 8 mm h 1 therefore the underlying storms during event no 9 was quite uniformly distributed across the study area looking at fig 7 it can be observed that the underlying storms during events with a mediocre mgi had higher tendency to be recorded at more gauges so cover larger areas particularly events no 52 60 with an mgi 8 11 2 mm h 1 were recorded by a comparably high number of wet gauges i e 28 37 however there was no obvious relationship between the number of wet gauges and magnitude of the mgi for the other events in other words the spatial coverage of the underlying storms for both lower intensity and higher intensity events other than the discussed mediocre events could range from small such as for event no 8 and 78 that were recorded by only two gauges to large such as for event no 4 and 87 that were both recorded by 37 gauges it is noted that this result is obtained under the assumptions of the study for the definition of comprehensive events based on the half hourly aggregations and therefore not necessarily valid for other locations and temporal resolutions 4 3 the merging models rmp and ann based on the selected 87 events above the size of input output data vectors after excluding missing values from both radar and gauge data for the merging modelling at 5 min scale varied as follows including calibration and testing data 16 500 from 11 gauges for zone i 14 200 from 9 gauges for zone ii 9 200 from 7 gauges for zone iii 14 500 from 11 gauges for zone iv in the following additional specifications of the merging models such as analysing the ann weights and rmp coefficients are discussed 4 3 1 ann specifications as described in section 3 3 1 each ann parameterization repeat for a zone corresponds to an optimization problem that minimizes the loss function mse for the training data as long as a stopping criterion e g maximum validation fail here 10 consecutive epochs that fail to result in improved mse for the validation data is reached as soon as the ann stops the given repeat gives one parameter set for the ann based on the optimization epoch including minimum validation mse accordingly after repeating this procedure for 6000 times table 1 the selected ann is from the repeat with the minimum validation mse among all as a result the training validation testing ratios and network architectures for the selected ann models were 60 20 20 and net 22 18 for zone i 60 20 20 and net 27 15 for zone ii 50 25 25 and net 23 14 for zone iii 60 20 20 and net 7 26 for zone iv where net hl1 hl2 indicates the number of neurons on the first and second hidden layers as a result zone iii selected the shortest training and longest validation and testing ratios among the few possible choices table 1 in contrary to the other zones according to the assumptions for the dataset partitioning and calibration of ann after validation check under 6000 parameterization repeats it is likely that a more generalized ann prefers to choose a longer training if overfitting is not dominant therefore the apparent preference of zone iii to take a shorter training and longer validation may show that the chance for overfitting was higher for zone iii compared to the other zones as listed earlier the available data for zone iii was shorter 9 200 vs 14 200 16 500 and based on fewer number of gauges 7 vs 9 11 which might explain the possible disruption of the generalization for this zone also a lower number of neurons for zone iv suggests that fewer number of parameters were required for the merging modelling of this zone compared to the others as discussed by heaton et al 2017 the corresponding weights between each of the nodes on the input layer and the neurons on the first hidden layer of an ann can be used as an indication of the relative importance of the input variables fig 8 represents the sum of absolute value of the weights w simply referred to as weight in fig 8 for the 15 top ranked input variables in the selected ann models for zones i iv fig 8a d thus the top longest horizontal bars in the subplots of fig 8 indicate the variables with the highest importance for different zones fig 8a d in this figure the bars are labelled with the variables name and the subscripts denote the corresponding x wr and level e g h helsingborg and d 1 lowest level of dalby as a result the generally lower values of weights i e sum of absolute weights for zone iv is due to the lower number of neurons on the first hidden layer of ann for this zone compared to the other zones as listed earlier 7 vs 22 27 in the sub plots of fig 8 related to zones i ii the first ranked variable was dbzhh horizontal reflectivity from helsingborg x wr followed by kdp from two levels of dalby x wr kdpd 2 and kdpd 1 for zone i and kdpd 1 and kdpd 3 for zone ii as the second and the third ranked variables for zone iii and iv the top ranked variables are dbzhd 3 with a slight difference after kdpd 2 and dbzhd 5 respectively this indicates the importance of the reflectivity for qpe as could be expected from the experimental methods such as the widely used marshall palmer equation marshall and palmer 1948 uijlenhoet 2001 yangang 1993 however the x wr and scanning level corresponding to the selected variables are arguable further discussion on this is given below after reviewing the importance of other variables among different x wr variables vrad and kdp was the least and most frequently appearing variables 0 2 vs 5 6 among the 15 top ranked input variables for ann modelling in the zones particularly kdp constituted five of the six and the eight top ranked variables for zone ii and zone iv fig 8 respectively kdp is the range derivative of the differential phase and is theoretically independent of signal power and is not affected by attenuation and partial beam blockage so kdp is believed to be the most useful dual polarization variable for attenuation correction of both c and x wrs bringi and chandrasekar 2001 kumjian 2013 vrad was never among the 11 top ranked variables for any of the zones according to the literature doppler velocity is used for tornadic vortex signature e g torres and curtis 2015 rather than for qpe among the other polarimetric variables the importance of differential reflectivity zdr is obviously lower than kdp this may be related to the fact that zdr is sensitive to attenuation also zdr in contrast to kdp and dbzh is independent of concentration of the raindrops which is an important measure in qpe kumjian 2013 however zdr gives useful information about the raindrop size thus combining zdr together with other relevant variables is interesting in view of the above the relatively higher importance of kdp and dbzh among the x wr variables observed by the selected ann models for the zones fig 8 imply the ability of ann to represent the physical expectations however as mentioned earlier interpretation of the importance of the selected x wr and levels for these variables requires careful justification due to the complexity of the underlying system weather that is modelled with a purely data driven approach for example in zone i the top dbzh is from helsingborg x wr while the top kdp is from dalby x wr fig 8 although this combination implies benefits of combining a system of x wrs by ann the interpretation is not straightforward the lower importance of dbzh from the closer x wr could be related to the x wr error at short range where the sampling volumes become smaller thus the same size and number of unfavourable particles biological and ground clutter smoke etc could cause larger errors for shorter ranges hosseini et al 2020 another explanation is related to the underlying difference between the two variables dbzh in contrast to kdp is affected by partial beam blockage thus at long ranges where sampling volumes are larger more raindrops are sampled for a better dbzh estimation as discussed in the introduction long range observations are more susceptible to attenuation which may contradict the above finding regarding the importance of dbzhh for zone i however it could be argued that the frequency of a temporally variable attenuation at a specific direction e g for zone i an imaginary line connecting the two x wrs could be a matter of the areal storm size and direction as well in conclusion knowledge of the underlying physical characteristics of the radar observations and knowledge of the areal appearance of the typical storms for a region are desired for developing a data driven qpe and the interpretation of results 4 3 2 rmp specifications the coefficients of eq 1 α β 1 β 2 β 5 for the calibrated rmp models were 0 114 0 080 0 298 0 183 0 003 and 0 016 for zone i 0 042 0 106 0 322 0 003 0 127 and 0 019 for zone ii 0 204 0 020 0 039 0 028 0 205 and 0 002 for zone iii 0 066 0 037 0 242 0 233 0 049 and 0 129 for zone iv accordingly the highest coefficients for zones i ii and iv were obtained for β 2 corresponding to rd 2 while β 4 and α corresponding to rd 4 and rh were almost equally the highest coefficients for zone iii if we accept that the magnitude of the coefficients shows the importance of the input variables the rmp model for zone iii is not following the expectations because rd 4 belongs to a high elevation angle of dalby x wr 6 that had a high range and altitude in this zone this evidence could support the similar inconsistency of ann modelling properties discussed earlier for zone iii in the following more will be discussed about the performance of the merging models and single level products for the zones 4 4 statistical performance criteria of the 5 min rainfall estimates training and validation portions for ann models are together considered as calibration portion accordingly the calibration portion used for the selected ann model and rmp model were the same this section includes the statistical analyses of the 5 min qpe performance in the testing data portion which was not used in calibration of the selected ann and rmp tables 3 6 corresponding to zones i iv present the verification scores obtained for the single level x wr rainfall products rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 and the merged x wr rainfall estimation models rmp and ann generally improved verification scores from rates to rmp and ann was observed based on most of the performance criteria with a few exceptions that are discussed after a review of the difference between rates for all zones among the rates rh and rd 1 rd 5 the highest far and rbias magnitude were observed by rd 1 tables 3 6 meaning that the highest false alarm ratio and biggest relative bias were related to the lowest level scan of the dalby x wr among possible causes ground clutter due to the scanning of dalby x wr at the lowest altitude for rd 1 could be the main a far as big as 34 57 for rd 1 at different zones table 3 6 means that 34 57 of the detected rainfalls at 5 min scale were wrong by this level thus the higher pod for rd 1 compared to the other levels and models e g 95 for zone iv in table 6 is to be considered partly as an artifact and attributed to the high far similarly the lower far for the higher levels e g 14 29 for rd 5 in different zones could be attributed to the low pod thus a proper detection ability must be confirmed by both high pod and low far at the same time as is the case for rmp and ann compared to most of rates for example in zone i table 3 regardless of the comparable pod far for ann and rmp was considerably lower than that for rd 1 3 4 vs 34 similar results could be discussed for the other zones an alternative more independent criterion to evaluate the detection ability of the x wr estimates could be based on gss that takes into account the number of hits due to chance in tables 3 6 gss for ann and rmp was always higher than that for rates for all zones among the zones the highest gss for ann and rmp was 84 and 87 respectively which were obtained in zone i table 3 while the lowest gss was obtained in zone iii for all rates rmp and ann zone iii generally was shown to be the most problematic region for x wr based rainfall estimation it was the only zone where e g no positive nse was obtained for any of the rates rmp ann during testing table 5 for ann and rmp the mae for zone iii 0 4 mm was almost twice the mae for the other zones 0 17 0 23 mm not only rmp and ann models but also all rates were prone to higher errors in zone iii from the considerably lower pod for rates rmp ann in zone iii it is believed that there is mainly a problem related to the rainfall detection at the worst level i e 8 elevation angle of the dalby x wr rd 5 in table 5 only observed 5 5 of the gauged rainfall 0 2 mm correctly this level is related to the highest elevation angle of the studied levels of the two x wrs zone iii is at the farthest distance from the dalby x wr and so was affected most from overshooting by rd 5 referring to fig 8 for zone i dbzh from the only level of the farther radar helsingborg wr and kdp from level 1 and 2 dbzh from level 3 and rhohv from level 5 of the closer radar dalby wr appeared as the five top ranked variables for qpe by ann perhaps better rainfall estimation could have been achieved for zone iii if multiple level x wr data were available from its closer radar helsingborg x wr for merging models from the above tables the highest mae was for the lowest level rates rh or rd 1 which together with the largest positive rbias shows significant overestimation for ground close scans for all zones the overestimation could be related to less exposure to overshooting and thus an intrinsic tendency to overestimation by the radar built in equations of rates that may be corrected however the lower pcc obtained for rh and rd 1 in comparison to the other levels for all zones except for the apparently problematic zone iii rejects the higher potential of bias correction of the lowest level rates at least by a linear bias correction based on this assumption then the higher mae and rbias for rh and rd 1 could be attributed to the error sources such as signal contamination and clutter which are more likely for near ground scans regarding the merging models both ann and rmp showed improvement in all zones compared to rates tables 3 6 and the differences between the mae values of ann and rmp were insignificant slightly smaller mae for ann based on rbias there were three exceptions where the single levels could outperform ann and rmp including rd 2 and rd 3 for zone i table 3 and rd 3 in zone iii table 5 regardless of zone iii that generally was problematic none of these outperformances based on rbias could be supported by any of the other verification scores in zone i however in zone i table 3 pcc for rd 2 and rd 3 was quite close to pcc for ann and rmp looking at the variations of the pcc for rates rmp ann and zones in tables 3 5 it seems pcc cannot signify the differences between the merging models as the other indices such as nse do as an example pcc for rd 2 and rmp in zone iv table 6 were 0 77 and 0 79 while the corresponding values for nse were 0 39 and 0 57 respectively the considerably big difference between these two nse values was supported by the corresponding other criteria such as rbias mae far and gss table 6 therefore nse is believed to be a more independently interpretable criteria compared to pcc fig 9 shows the values of nse among the efficiency indexes and gss among the detection indexes together with the error and bias indexes mae and rbias for an easier inter zone comparison of the verification scores discussed earlier according to fig 9 zone iii was the most problematic zone for all rates rmp ann based on gss and mae in addition in all sub plots of this figure the improvement of the scores by rmp and ann compared to the rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 5 as well as the problematic rd 1 in zone iv are easily observed the ground truth gauges in zone iv were quite densely located in northern areas of the malmö municipality see the maps in figs 1 and 4 thus this lowest level of dalby x wr was probably affected by ground clutter between dalby and malmö cities the overestimations supported by high positive rbias 800 in fig 9a for rd 1 in zone iv while gss was quite small 26 in fig 9b could also be attributed to the contaminated radar signals at low altitudes 4 5 statistical performance criteria of the hourly rainfall estimates so far the presented results are based on the modelling of the aggregated 1 min x wr data and temporally irregular tipping bucket data to 5 min data the reason for this was to make the radar gauge observations temporally more comparable while keeping the resultant data interesting for typical urban hydrological applications here to evaluate the accuracy of the produced data at larger time scales the observed and estimated 5 min rainfall data were aggregated to hourly data in addition a new regression based merging model namely rmpm was developed using the hourly input variables i e the aggregated rates to directly estimate hourly rainfall thus the results of the four statistical criteria i e those in fig 9 were calculated using hourly data and summarized in fig 10 from fig 10a rmpm generally shows overestimation while rmp and ann show underestimation in different zones at an hourly scale however the magnitude of the over and under estimation by the hourly aggregated estimates from the 5 min merging models rmp and ann and the direct hourly rainfall estimates from rmpm are comparable in fig 10b rmpm shows better rainfall detection for zone i and iv but worse detection for zone ii and iii compared to rmp and ann however in none of the zones rmpm could outperform rmp and ann based on the nse and mae criteria according to fig 10c d therefore rmpm performed rather equivalent to or even worse than rmp and ann in hourly qpe regardless of the desired high resolution data for urban hydrology we can alternatively conclude that the direct use of 5 min data scale for merging data from a system of x wrs was equivalent to or even better than using hourly data for the coarser scale applications while one would expect lower uncertainty due to the smaller difference between radar gauge data at 60 vs 5 min the better performance of the developed model at finer resolution might be attributed to the fact that the benefit of combining information from multiple radar levels makes more sense at the event scales 4 6 qq plots of the 5 min gauged vs estimated rainfall an interesting use of high resolution rainfall data could be in design storm problems where the accurate distribution of rainfall data especially related to the extreme values is important to evaluate the statistical distribution of the estimated vs observed rainfall data based on the single level products rates rh rd 1 rd 2 rd 5 and merging models rmp and ann the study used the quantile quantile qq plots as presented in fig 11 the qq plot is a visual method that checks the agreement of the equivalent quantiles of the observed and estimated data similar 5 min rainfall data testing as those used in the analyses of the merging modelling earlier i e the 20 of 16 500 20 of 14 200 25 of 9 200 and 20 of 14 500 for zones i ii iii and iv respectively were used fig 11 accordingly the estimated quantiles for rmp and ann are plotted in the left column fig 11a d and the estimated quantiles for rates are plotted in the right column fig 11e h of the figure then the four rows are corresponding to the zones fig 11a and 11e for zone i fig 11b and 11f for zone ii and so on regarding the merging models left column zone iii fig 11c showed high discrepancies in form of obvious underestimation of the observed quantiles of above 0 2 mm 5min however for the other zones there were better agreements for both ann and rmp models rmp showed higher tendency to underestimation of extreme quantiles e g above 2 mm 5min compared to ann fig 11a b d for the rates right column different levels showed quite close distributional behaviour in zone i with apparent overestimation that is maximum for the observed quantiles near 4 mm 5min fig 11e then the farther we go from the dalby x wr zones ii iv and iii respectively the higher discrepancies appear between the qq plots of different levels so that some reveal overestimations and the other reveal underestimation especially in zone iii the farthest location to the dalby x wr the underestimations by rd 4 and rd 5 are substantial fig 11h these two highest levels of the dalby x wr could easily overshoot many of the events at that far locations the same levels also revealed underestimations for the zone iii and ii but to lesser extent finally as discussed earlier based on the rbias and gss results in table 6 and fig 9 about rd 1 rate for the lowest level of the dalby x wr it revealed here also the highest overestimation of the rainfall quantiles for zone iv fig 11h the most overestimating rate products for zone iii fig 11g were rh related to the 2 elevation angle of helsingborg radar followed by rd 1 and rd 2 related to the 1 5 and 2 elevation angles of dalby x wr that could be the most prone to contaminated radar signals and ground clutter the overestimations by the lower elevation angles where the overshooting could not be a common source of error may also suggest that the built in equations for x wrs generally overestimate the rainfall so the underestimations are mostly related to the detection problem consequently one reason for the improvement of a simple linear regression model almost as good as ann could be related to the bias correction of the single level products rates by weighting them variably depending on the radar range zones as formulated in the study therefore as assumed before hosseini et al 2020 it was shown in the present study that the wealth of data from multiple elevation angles can be leveraged by merging them as noted earlier the success of the merging models here was achieved based on combining five levels of the dalby x wr and only one level of the helsingborg x wr since the worst performance of the models were obtained for the zone located farthest to the former x wr and closest to the latter one the role of multiple levels should be emphasized regarding the merging of x wrs 4 7 qq plots of the hourly gauged vs estimated rainfall according to fig 12 a d the qq plots show generally good agreement between observed and modelled quantiles for the hourly aggregated data based on the tipping bucket data and the 5 min estimates by the merging models rmp and ann for all zones except zone iii fig 12c therefore the hourly qq plots fig 12 generally resemble the 5 min qq plots fig 11 for ann and rmp models however a slightly higher tendency to underestimation could stem from the rain values 0 2 that could have been recorded as zero by gauges at 5 min scale regardless of the spatial scale difference between a gauge and radar bins in addition rmpm that was developed directly for an hourly scale showed obviously higher overestimation where the cross markers in fig 12a d are barely below the dashed 45 degree line for any of the zones these results are consistent with the results of the rbias criteria discussed earlier regarding the hourly qpe modelling fig 10a note that we did not use ann for direct modelling of hourly qpe because the length of our input output data was 12 times shorter compared to the 5 min modelling which was unfavourable for ai assisted data driven modelling based on the generally comparable results of the rmp and ann at the 5 min scale we do not expect the hourly ann model to result in a much different performance compared to the hourly regression based model rmpm however future studies could evaluate these assumptions based on longer data series 5 summary and conclusions with future scopes considering the inconsistent rainfall estimation at different ranges and elevations by a single x wr operation a generalized data driven scheme for merging data from a system of x wrs operating at multiple elevation angles was designed ann and multi linear regression were used as reference models to evaluate the designed scheme for a case study in southern sweden accordingly data from two x wrs in dalby and helsingborg operated at 50 and 70 km respectively were studied during the study period may september 2021 each scan of an x wr was equivalent to a 360 rotation of the antenna round to azimuth at a specific elevation angle the available data in this study included 1 5 2 4 6 and 8 elevation angle levels from the dalby x wr and a 2 elevation angle level from the helsingborg x wr at a minute due to the different settings by the operators the radar measurements included five variables rhohv kdp vrad dbzh and zdr at every level that were used as inputs for the merging models based on ann also the single level rainfall products built in to the x wrs rates calculated based on the marshall palmer equation adjusted for attenuation were used as inputs to a regression model named rmp then data from 38 tipping bucket rain gauges in the overlapping area of the two x wrs were used as ground truth for the merging models as a preliminary step to efficiently reduce the data processing time for the purpose of the study the gauge detected rainfall events with an mgi higher than 2 mm h 1 were studied in addition the study area was divided with a simple geometric method into a few sub areas among which zones i iv included all the gauges the merging models by ann and rmp were calibrated based on a major part of the data for comparability of the radar gauge data pairs the temporally irregular tipping bucket data and regular 1 min x wr data were aggregated to 5 min steps the calibration of ann was based on a randomly repeated procedure to find an optimum ann architecture with lower chance of stuck in local minima finally four separate rainfall estimation models equivalent to the zones were developed for each modelling type ann and rmp the 20 25 of the data that were kept out of the calibration testing were used for the evaluation of the modelling performance as a result the accuracy of the rainfall estimation and detection at the overlapping area by the merging models substantially improved compared to the rates therefore merging x wrs can help improve the consistency of high resolution observations at longer ranges however at zone iii the farthest to dalby and closest to the helsingborg x wr the accuracy of the estimations also the estimated quantiles by all rates ann and rmp were not favourable in the current study the data from the helsingborg x wr were only available from one elevation angle 2 elevation angle generally the lowest levels from the x wrs especially rd 1 1 5 elevation angle scan of dalby x wr revealed the most erroneous estimates for some of the zones that are suggested to be attributed to the ground clutter and radar data contamination at low altitude scans so it is suggested that the lack of multiple level scans from the closer radar helsingborg x wr 23 km is the main reason for the worst accuracy in zone iii where naturally we did not expect a high benefit from the farther radar dalby x wr 33 km due to higher significance of attenuation and overshooting problems in addition to the attenuation overshooting and ground clutter a source of inconsistency in single level x wr scans could relate to the storm characteristics itself usually a convective compared to stratiform storm can result in significantly different vertical profile that could thus be reflected in the multiple level scans from a system of x wrs therefore the emphasis of this study on the role of range and level for merging x wrs is reasonable in addition the nature of these inconsistency sources could be non linear and complex this fact supports the use of computationally advanced ann models such models however are prone to overfitting and this study introduced some generalization procedures that were shown successful conceivably there was no sign of overfitting for ann as it resulted in the best or at least comparable verification scores during the testing periods not used in calibration in comparison to corresponding scores by the empirically and regression based rmp model this was while ann used a shorter data for training since a part of the calibration data was used only for an early stop rule as an in process validation this study had some limitations that can be considered in the future studies for example the study data included summer months so didn t let investigate other forms of precipitation such as snow while the studied data were significantly useful as a proof of concept of merging data from multiple levels of a network of dual polarization x wrs for improved high resolution qpe using data driven modelling longer data series considering higher variability from more events and radar network conditions are needed to enhance future uses another limitation was related to the use of tipping buckets with irregular temporal resolution as for the ground truth thus the models were developed at a 5 min scale rather than a 1 min scale the original resolution for the x wrs it was possible to use a coarser resolution e g 10 15 and 30 min to further lower the modelling uncertainty due to the incomparability of the radar gauge data however coarser resolutions results in smoother data which are unfavourable for urban hydrology where scales as low as 1 5 min seems necessary in addition current study showed a comparable or even better performance of hourly qpe by aggregating 5 min estimates from the ann and rmp models compared to a regression based model that was directly developed using hourly data rmpm the better performance of a model that is developed at finer resolution 5 min vs hourly can be related to the expected benefits of combining information from multiple radar levels at the storm scales although the results of the current study showed improvement of high resolution qpe by merging multi level dual polarization variables from a system of x wrs the quality of the achieved products seems to be more reliable for short and heavy rains when the uncertainties due to the incomparable temporal scale of the radar gauge observations are at minimum such events are typically relevant during summer for excess runoff management therefore optimal temporal aggregation for a more general purpose product needs to be investigated considering the data limitations application and catchment characteristics in future studies for such investigations the use of alternative ground truth data sources with a regular resolution or higher precision are recommended recent developments of rainfall measuring instruments in the overlapping area of the two x wrs in southern sweden include three disdrometers and a vertically oriented micro rain radar that may help increase the temporal resolution of the ground truth and merging products among other benefits such as considering bright band effect due to scanning the melting layer or improving hydrometeor phase detection in the future the study indicated a high potential for improving x wr rainfall estimation by generalized data driven models that can be extended to include the additional data sources the use of catchment runoff response as a ground truth data source could have its own limitations but let use both radar and gauge data as inputs for further improvements such as by real time adjustment of the calibrated models as a necessary step towards a reliable use in practical problems for water

manmade structures at a very high resolution with the same radar sensor characteristics over a period crosetto et al 2016 conventionally it has been challenging to use synthetic aperture radar sar data before the launch of sentinel 1 due to the longer time interval between the images of the order of months which leads to temporal decorrelation in the sar signal the c band sentinel 1 began operations in 2014 with a repeat interval of 12 days improving temporal coherence a total of 400 interferometric wide iw sar images of the sentinel 1 satellite were acquired alaska satellite facility 2022 in single look complex slc level 1 format over 200 sar images were downloaded in descending and ascending mode between 2014 and 2022 along with precise orbital data alaska orbit files 2022 an increase in the number of scenes i e two acquisitions per month provides consistency in measuring spatial subsidence distribution 3 1 interferometric point target analysis ipta interferometric point target analysis ipta is a gamma software procedure that utilizes interferometric signatures obtained from point targets fig 2 werner et al 2003 wegmüller et al 2010 point targets such as artificial structures remain stable during the data acquisition point targets allow the interpretation of interferometric pairs with a longer baseline even above the critical baseline which permits more interpretation of data sets larger data sets result in minimal error from the atmospheric path delay and better temporal coverage ipta is a very successful technique in urban areas due to the larger availability of stable targets and can map the spatial and temporal characteristics of the deformation phenomenon better the ipta method employs vector data format instead of raster drastically

pixels show similar annual subsidence rates ranging from 40 mm yr to 5 mm yr and maximum subsidence in the order of 65 to 60 mm yr respectively the variation is expected due to differences in satellite look directions the vertical velocity of ground deformation was estimated by fusion and cross correlation of ascending and descending los velocities the vertical velocity is derived by merging ascending and descending los measurements on a pixel by pixel basis assuming that displacement is linear between these data acquisition 12 days intervals the vertical velocity of each pixel

distribution of ground subsidence patterns matches those observed in an urban center like east chandigarh fig 4c and e the distal fan sw of chandigarh with a shallow 20 m water table is experiencing

the kharar east chandigarh subsidence zones fig 4a the subsidence is pronounced around the sohana v and landarn vi regions these regions have three aquifer levels and most of the groundwater

pattern and regional population growth urbanization fig 5 a which show a positive correlation for over two decades 5 1 decadal groundwater level change vs dinsar subsidence overexploitation from the tube wells has an adverse effect on the water table in the piedmont zone around chandigarh the water table level decline is observed at 55 percent of the tube well with groundwater data indicating 5 8

region dropped sharply from 2006 to 07 fig 5a the precipitation pattern also declined sharply during the past 5 8 years fig 5a which may have aggravated the stress on the groundwater the overexploitation of groundwater and the absence of recharge in an area led to the development of a groundwater depression cone on a regional scale which could lead to ground subsidence yuan et al 2013 we compared ground subsidence fig 4 and cone of depression kadiyan et al 2021 cgwb sas nagar report 2017 along the five equal distance ns profiles p01 05 fig 5b f the region is experiencing a

remained steady fig 5f the swt decline and cone of depression subsidence rates are spatially correlated representing a sink hole type of subsidence fig 5f possibly due to the focused zone akin to single source of groundwater overexploitation the zone coincides with the expanding urban centers such as kharar sohana landran and dera bassi which do not have any restrictions on constructing boreholes unlike chandigarh urban areas located in the proximal part the cross correlation of swt decline rate with the subsidence rate shows a good correlation r 0 61 fig 5g in the hotspot regions though the subsidence depends on other aquifer parameters 5 2 aquifer characteristics and subsidence there are three aquifer zones identified in the northern part of the chandigarh piedmont fan with the semiconfined aquifer i and ii zones in the proximal part being dominated by boulders and gravels down to 150 m depth followed by the sand silt interlayered with clay beds fig 6 a the composition varies with decreasing grain size southwards the confined aquifer iii is composed of fine grained sand with a 30 m thick soft clay confining bed with 1 5 10 4 to 7 5 10 4 storativity in the proximal part fig 1c fig 6a cgwb chandigarh report 2013 only aquifer ii and iii extend southward towards the distal part of the fan where the primary abstraction is from aquifer iii pleistocene alluvium at a depth of 100 m where the 40 m thick holocene soft clay acts as the confining bed in the proximal fan region the pumping test suggests the discharge varies between 450 and 900 l per minute lpm for a drawdown of 2 5 25 m in the aquifer i the discharge increases to 1000 lpm in aquifer ii and 2000 lpm from 30 thick zones at 200 mbgl in aquifer iii cgwb chandigarh aquifer report 2019 at the distal part due to composition and grain size the semiconfined aquifer i and ii experience better groundwater recharge though the groundwater level depth decreases southwards with an almost artesian condition in the distal part of the fan fig 1d to understand the spatial relationship between subsidence and swt decline with the piedmont aquifer characteristics we plotted them along the ne sw profile xx line fig 4a fig 6a the profile extends from the himalayan foothills at khuda alisher to the distal fan near manakpur south of chandigarh where the artesian type condition prevails fig 1c and d along the profile xx two prominent cones of swt depression and ground subsidence cones are observed in the proximal east chandigarh s1 and distal sohana s2 fan regions the narrow 3 4 km cone of the swt depression up to 0 5 m yr corresponds well with 20 mm yr subsidence cone around east chandigarh region where all three aquifers are present fig 6a whereas the confined aquifer in the distal part around sohana region experienced 0 6 m yr swt depression corresponding to 50 mm yr subsidence with a wider cone which is higher by an order of the proximal part fig 6a the proximal part of the piedmont such as khuda ali sher and sector 23 experienced negligible subsidence or narrow swt depression and subsidence cones including the area around kharar fig 4b fig 6b this represents a point source over exploitation in the unconfined and semi confined aquifer i and ii fig 6a which has higher recharge potential the shape of the ground subsidence curve corresponds linearly with the swt decline curve in the distal part with a significantly larger spatial extent of 15 km profile yy across the confined artesian aquifer fig 6b in the distal part multiple cones of swt decline intersect resulting in the combined effect on the drawdown which can lower the groundwater table rapidly as observed elsewhere in piedmont zones green and nolan 1964 yuan et al 2013 usgs 2022 the cone of depression laterally proliferates in the artesian aquifers theis 1938 the aquifer load is supported by artesian pressure pushing upward and downward against the confining beds the over exploitation decreases the artesian pressure profoundly leading to the aquifer collapse as observed in many artesian aquifers xu et al 2012 liosis et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ngwa 2022 the drastic increase of confining clay layer thickness in the distal fan region reduces the groundwater recharge in aquifers ii iii fig 6b the reduced recharge is unable to compensate for the overall extraction in the sohana and landran area leading to categorizing the region as over exploited cgwb sas nagar report 2017 the confined artesian aquifer is possibly undergoing inelastic compaction due to unregulated over exploitation resulting in pronounced ground subsidence in the distal fan around sohana and landran the stress strain curve can be used to find the elastic and inelastic nature at different parts of the aquifer béjar pizarro et al 2017 li et al 2022 5 3 elastic and inelastic compaction of aquifer the hydraulic head plotted against the insar deformation on a temporal basis provides the aquifer stress strain relation which offers evidence about the type of deformation that the aquifer is undergoing the storage coefficient sk eq 5 is calculated from the relationship between the compression of the aquifer system and the change in the hydraulic head slope of the stress strain curve assuming that water is incompressible relative to the aquifer system compressibility 5 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 where δb is the change in deformation δh is the change in the hydraulic head for the corresponding period ss is the specific storage and b0 is the thickness of the aquifer in the study area the groundwater level variations are measured 2 3 times a year during the pre and post monsoon periods cgwb 2022 whereas the dinsar vertical deformations have a fortnightly frequency owing to limited time series data availability time series we attempted to analyze the stress strain relationship and sk values for 4 locations namely landran east chandigarh dera bassi and manimajra fig 1c fig 7 a d of these locations three sites are experiencing high ground subsidence and overexploitation and one site has no ground deformation many hysteresis loops in the stress strain curve indicate an aquifer s elastic behavior and their absence indicates inelastic deformation béjar pizarro et al 2017 li et al 2022 the hydraulic head of east chandigarh landran and dera bassi registered a lower hydraulic head than the pre consolidation head historical minimum hydraulic head implying inelastic compaction fig 7a c the manimajra exhibit multiple hysteresis loops in the stress strain relation curve indicating elastic deformation which registered a higher hydraulic head in december 2019 than in november 2014 suggesting optimal recharge fig 7d the inelastic compaction in the overexploited distal part is due to the lack of aquifer recharge associated with urbanization such as decreasing rechargeable area increasing water demand etc the same is analyzed using land cover changes with high resolution satellite images 5 4 land use and land cover lulc change recharge potential vs demand to understand the effect of change in land use patterns with increasing population and urbanization the lulc analysis of the region for the period 2000 to 2020 was carried out it was assumed that the increasing population will lead to an increase in built up areas which in turn will act as an impervious layer retarding natural groundwater recharge and enhancing surface runoff further it was observed that average annual rainfall reduced from 1050 mm yr to 850 mm yr during the 2014 2021 period imd 2022 and the precipitation intensity has been on the rise asoka et al 2017 leading to enhanced surface runoff and reduced recharge potential these phenomena adversely affect aquifer potential due to reduced recharge and increasing domestic demand leading to overexploitation the lulc analysis shows that despite the urban pressure in chandigarh and the adjoining region in the proximal piedmont the general availability of water from groundwater and surface water sources is sustainable there is no widespread ground subsidence fig 4a or swt decline fig 5 observed in the proximal zone except in local pockets around east chandigarh and kharar fig 4 the proximal zone also lies near the recharge structures such as the sukhna reservoir 0 5 of the study area as well as small piedmont channels though some of them are being diverted the lulc change around the study region shows that the built up areas have increased four times from 100 sq km to 400 sq km with a 100 increase in population in the past four decades we analyzed the impermeable built up surface area change using satellite images for three hotspot regions namely sohana landran and kharar for the period 2000 2020 fig 7 the built up area increased from 11 5 km2 to 29 2 km2 around the sohana region which is experiencing severe 60 mm yr subsidence fig 8 a a1 fig 5c the increased built up area primarily evolved due to the development of residential sectors 77 80 and the industrial regions around mohali and jlpl during the last decade similarly the impervious area around landran increased from 1 55 km2 to 9 8 km2 a 500 percent increase in the previous two decades fig 8b b1 the growth of the residential sectors 76 85 89 91 and 111 113 between 2005 and 2020 contributed to the drastic increase of impermeable area leading to 0 8 m yr swt decline and corresponding 40 60 mm yr ground subsidence fig 5c the kharar region underwent a 200 increase of built up areas attributable to the construction of residential sectors 125 127 between 2005 and 2020 10 8 28 5 km2 fig 8c and c1 and causing a decline in the water table at the rate of 0 75 m yr and severe subsidence of 40 50 mm yr the lack of a recharge structure and a fourfold increase of impermeable surface resulted in the lower aquifer recharge in the distal fan the current water usage in chandigarh urban area is 250 l person chandigarh metro 2022 far higher than the national average of 132 l per person indiawris 2022 the population of the chandigarh municipality region proximal part of the piedmont zone increased to 1 2 million from 0 8 million a rate of 1 5 per year between 2000 and 2020 united nations world population prospects 2022 whereas the population in the chandigarh suburbs including landran sohana kharar and dera bassi has grown from 0 5 million to 1 0 million at the rate of 3 4 per year during the same period master plans 2022 the twofold population growth in the distal part is likely to increase similar groundwater demand and cause severe over exploitation owing to unregulated groundwater exploitation compared to the regulated chandigarh municipality area in the proximal fan the same is reflected in the swt decline and associated ground subsidence fig 6a and b 5 5 temporal variation in subsidence groundwater level and urbanization the urbanization around the chandigarh piedmont zone leads to overexploitation affecting aquifer properties figs 5 7 the regions of acute ground subsidence usually experience crack in the manmade structure is one of the indicators of the phenomenon and the same is observed around mohali and chandigarh areas kadiyan et al 2021 the damage assessment found that tensional and shear cracks are frequently observed around the landran kharar sohana and kurali with over 3 4 of the damage belonging to tensional cracks which implies a subsidence phenomenon these observations coincide with the dinsar based subsidence groundwater depletion and land cover change observed in the hotspot regions namely kharar sohana landran and east chandigarh figs 4 and 9 a to understand the interrelationship between cause and effects we compared the urbanization trend built up area changes in and groundwater level changes during the past two decades with the ground subsidence trend during 2014 2022 in the hotspot regions fig 9a it is assumed that though the period of observation of the phenomenon is variable still the rate of change should reflect linearity if they have a direct correlation the built up area and subsidence increase exhibit linear trends despite some nonlinearity in groundwater level trends in the hotspot areas fig 9b the kharar and east chandigarh regions in the proximal part experienced a 10 m decade groundwater level decline and a fourfold increase in the builtup area between 2000 and 2020 which matches well with the linear subsidence trend of 40 mm yr during 2014 22 fig 9b the sohana and landran regions located in the distal fan zone with artesian conditions are undergoing 5 m decade groundwater level decline and 4 8 times increase in the builtup area between 2000 and 2020 resulting in the ground subsidence at 60 mm yr during 2014 22 fig 9b though higher groundwater level decline was observed in the proximal aquifer the distal fan is experiencing severe subsidence due to the unmonitored overexploitation from the confined aquifer possibly from aquifer iii as a result of the higher aquifer thickness and composition boulders and sand in the proximal aquifer it is being recharged better than the confined aquifer at the distal fan fig 6 the overexploitation has driven severe subsidence would cause inelastic compaction of the confined aquifer in the distal fan region making it unsustainable and adversely affecting the aquifer s health by the loss of storativity there is increasing evidence of the decline in groundwater resources in many parts of the world owing to urbanization famiglietti 2014 wada and bierkens 2014 which accelerated the land subsidence process chen et al 2018 du et al 2021 mautner et al 2020 there are many parallels to the chandigarh piedmont zone across the world where urban areas are undergoing subsidence due to over exploitation of groundwater wu et al 2009 castellazzi et al 2016 sahadevan and pandey 2021 the himalayan piedmont fans are spread across fast growing urban areas that are producing similar stress on the aquifer due to the over exploitation of groundwater the dinsar ipta methodology can be adapted on a large scale for rapid assessment of ground subsidence in such urban areas sahadevan and pandey 2021 sadeghi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 along with precautionary measures such as artificial recharge asano 1985 surinaidu et al 2017 harini et al 2018 nandan et al 2021 and managed pumping vaux 2011 gorelick and zheng 2015 6 conclusions the dinsar derived vertical subsidence in the himalayan piedmont zone around the fast growing urban center of chandigarh was analyzed in a combination of spatial and temporal changes in groundwater extraction aquifer property and urbanization driven lulc changes responsible for changing demand the analysis depicted precarious overexploitation driven ground subsidence causing the inelastic compaction of confined aquifers in the himalayan piedmont zone the severity is aggravated by the increase in impermeable urban areas which deprives the area of natural surface recharge further the decline in precipitation during the last decade which may be related to climate change has worsened even in the otherwise artesian condition of the distal fan zones these results have significant implications for aquifer management in growing urban centers in the himalayan piedmont zones in the indo gangetic region which is one of the most over exploited areas with fast growing urban centers considering that 80 of the world population is expected live in urban areas in 2050 the open source sentinel insar data sets on

2293,unsustainable groundwater exploitation often triggers inelastic aquifer compaction endangering future groundwater potential the himalayan piedmont fan regions are undergoing fast urbanization and experiencing rapid groundwater depletion and water table drop the piedmont fans have laterally varying aquifer geometry with slope dominated aquifer water flow and experience variable spatiotemporal changes in response to groundwater depletion we estimated the ground deformation over piedmont fans around chandigarh india a growing urban centre during 2014 2022 using satellite based interferometric point target analysis ipta we used both ascending and descending differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar dinsar acquisition modes to derive the vertical ground deformation by combining their line of sight los velocities the region is experiencing vertical subsidence up to 60 mm yr with prominent hotspots where the temporal subsidence is compared with the groundwater cone of depression and urbanization over decades comparing the subsidence with the aquifer parameters from the bore wells suggests that the clay confining aquifer level iii and semiconfined level ii in the distal fan are experiencing the highest subsidence the stress strain relationship of these hotspot regions reveals the inelastic compaction of the aquifers producing severe subsidence the piedmont zones of the himalayas with identical aquifer geometry and population growth are facing similar challenges and the combined dinsar ipta and observational groundwater

the indo ganges region the piedmont fan region in nw india is undergoing rapid urbanization one of the fastest growing areas is chandigarh which is witnessing 40 average decadal growth with a population density of 9500 people per sq km the rising population puts severe stress on water availability and in chandigarh total water demand 110 mgd exceeded its supply capacity of 87 mgd municipal corporation chandigarh 2022 this 30 deficit in water supply 25mgd which is met through 160 tube wells has resulted in the water table decreasing from 9 45mbgl in 1995 to 25mbgl in 2020 cgwb 2022 and

et al 2013 yuvaraj et al 2015 rao et al 2016 sahadevan et al 2019b the ground subsidence rate depends on the sedimentological heterogeneity of the aquifer system and water storage change which can be modeled using dinsar the ground subsidence phenomenon over nw indian cities including chandigarh and new delhi kadiyan et al 2021 kumar et al 2022 garg et al 2022 has been observed using dinsar but lacks a comprehensive hydrological analysis we analyzed and discussed the formation of the decadal scale cone of depression in many parts of the chandigarh piedmont region with respect to the aquifer profile and correlated it with the subsidence observed in dinsar data the time series dinsar derived ground subsidence was correlated with the hydraulic head to understand the aquifer deformation we also correlated dinsar derived subsidence with groundwater overexploitation aquifer characteristics and urban area recharge scenarios the aquifer compaction pattern in the piedmont zone around chandigarh points to the expansion of acute water overexploitation zones which is affecting the aquifer s health a similar analysis is vital for other urbanization centers with varied temporal scales

the himalayan front fig 1b the large sutlej river deflects eastward along soan dun in the himalayan front and debouches into the indus plain through the opz the proximal parts of the opz are often eroded and composed of well stratified yellowish brown mud silt sand and gravel with occasional pebble beds and the grain size decreases towards the distal part thakur et al 2007 these piedmont fans

such restriction in other parts of the study area 3 methodology for measuring surface deformation using dinsar the dinsar measures the ground deformation by analyzing persistent scattering from manmade structures at a very high resolution with the same radar sensor characteristics over a period crosetto et al 2016 conventionally it has been challenging to use synthetic aperture radar sar data before the launch of sentinel 1 due to the longer time interval between the images of the order of months which leads to temporal decorrelation in the sar signal the c band sentinel 1 began operations in 2014 with a repeat interval of 12 days improving temporal coherence a total of 400 interferometric wide iw sar images of the sentinel 1 satellite were acquired alaska satellite facility 2022 in single look complex slc level 1 format over 200 sar images were downloaded in descending and ascending mode between 2014 and 2022 along with precise orbital data alaska orbit files 2022 an increase in the number of scenes i e two acquisitions per month provides consistency in measuring spatial subsidence distribution 3 1 interferometric point target analysis ipta interferometric point target analysis ipta is a gamma software procedure that utilizes interferometric signatures obtained from point targets fig 2 werner et al 2003 wegmüller et al 2010 point targets such as artificial structures remain stable during the data acquisition point targets allow the interpretation of interferometric pairs with a longer baseline even above the critical baseline which permits more interpretation of data sets larger data sets result in minimal error from the atmospheric path delay and better temporal coverage ipta is a very successful technique in urban areas due to the larger availability of stable targets and can map the spatial and temporal characteristics of the deformation phenomenon better the ipta method employs vector data format instead of raster drastically reducing computer space requirements the unwrapped interferometric phase φu is stated as the sum of topographic φt deformation φd atmospheric phase φa and decorrelation phase noise φn eq 1 1 ϕ u ϕ t ϕ

atmospheric phase delays refined baseline etc the deformation rates were plotted using the corresponding points x and y values in the gis platform the pixels were discarded in case of standard

vertical velocity from dinsar los velocities the persistent scattering pixels 200000 belonging to ascending and descending modes were used for analyzing the spatio temporal pattern of the subsidence fig 3a and b the time series los subsidence in the study area exhibited a similar trend in ascending and descending modes with some deviations in the spatial pattern fig 3a and b where 80 of the pixels show similar annual subsidence rates ranging from 40 mm yr to 5 mm yr and maximum subsidence in the order of 65 to 60 mm yr respectively the variation is expected due to differences in satellite look directions the vertical velocity of ground deformation was estimated by fusion and cross correlation of ascending and descending los velocities the vertical velocity is derived by merging ascending and descending los measurements on a pixel by pixel basis assuming that displacement is linear between these data acquisition 12 days intervals the vertical velocity of each pixel

and b though agriculture with water intense farming contributed to 60 of total water intake since the green revolution of the 1960s it played a significant role in the over exploitation of groundwater in the kharar region which is experiencing rapid urbanization the indiscriminate groundwater pumping mainly from a confined aquifer in the older alluvium at 150 mbgl make it vulnerable cgwb kharar report 2020 unlike kharar east chandigarh ii in the proximal fan adjacent to the sukhna lake flood plain is constituted of highly porous grey micaceous sand silt and clay and has largely remained an

distribution of ground subsidence patterns matches those observed in an urban center like east chandigarh fig 4c and e the distal fan sw of chandigarh with a shallow 20 m water table is experiencing

the kharar east chandigarh subsidence zones fig 4a the subsidence is pronounced around the sohana v and landarn vi regions these regions have three aquifer levels and most of the groundwater extraction is from the confined level iii aquifer consisting of alluvial sand interbedded with clay mud fig 1d a large part of the sohana subsidence bowl 6x6 km experienced severe subsidence with the

during the last few decades we compare and discuss the observed dinsar based ground subsidence during 2014 2022 fig 4 with the declining water table groundwater aquifer characteristics precipitation pattern and regional population growth urbanization fig 5 a which show a positive correlation for over two decades 5 1 decadal groundwater level change vs dinsar subsidence overexploitation from the tube wells has an adverse effect on the water table in the piedmont zone around chandigarh the water table level decline is observed at 55 percent of the tube well with groundwater data indicating 5 8 m lowering during 2005 2018 tribuneindia 2021 cgwb sas nagar report 2017 leading to the abandonment of 10 of tube wells around chandigarh each year gupta and gupta 2018 the groundwater level in the region dropped sharply from 2006 to 07 fig 5a the precipitation pattern also declined sharply during the past 5 8 years fig 5a which may have aggravated the stress on the groundwater the overexploitation of groundwater and the absence of recharge in an area led to the development of a groundwater depression cone on a regional scale which could lead to ground subsidence yuan et al 2013 we compared ground subsidence fig 4 and cone of depression kadiyan et al 2021 cgwb sas nagar report 2017 along the five equal distance ns profiles p01 05 fig 5b f the region is experiencing a spatially varying static water table swt showing a general decline in southern chandigarh with peak values ranging from 0 5 m yr to 1 0 m yr with the distinct cone of depressions fig 5b f the kharar

swt with reducing wt decline rates with spatially coherent subdued cones of subsidence towards the distal part forming a bowl of 10 km radius of influence though the cone of depressions has a larger radius than the cone of subsidence fig 5b the maximum swt decline of 0 8 m yr is observed along the profile 2 with the cone of depression and subsidence 50 mm yr centered around landran fig 5c in the distal fan region although the declining swt produces a wide bowl of depression with 5 km radius of influence but the cone of subsidence 3km radius remains confined to the peak swt decline region

influence fig 5d the cone of swt depression show sharp decline to 0 8 m yr in the proximal fan region around eastern chandigarh but the subsidence cone with 40 mm yr peak value is observed further south along the profile 04 fig 5e a localized cone of subsidence 15 mm yr near the airport colony coincides with the 0 4 m yr swt decline in the distal fan region fig 5e further east along the profile 5 a localized cone of subsidence 30 mm yr coinciding with the cone of swt depression with peak 0 8 m yr is observed in the distal fan region around dera bassi though the proximal part of the fan remained steady fig 5f the swt decline and cone of depression subsidence rates are spatially correlated representing a sink hole type of subsidence fig 5f possibly due to the focused zone akin to single source of groundwater overexploitation the zone coincides with the expanding urban centers such as kharar sohana landran and dera bassi which do not have any restrictions on constructing boreholes unlike chandigarh urban areas located in the proximal part the cross correlation of swt decline rate with the subsidence rate shows a good correlation r 0 61 fig 5g in the hotspot regions though the subsidence depends on other aquifer parameters 5 2 aquifer characteristics and subsidence there are three aquifer zones identified in the northern part of the chandigarh piedmont fan with the semiconfined aquifer i and ii zones in the proximal part being dominated by boulders and gravels down to 150 m depth followed by the sand silt interlayered with clay beds fig 6 a the composition varies with decreasing grain size southwards the confined aquifer iii is composed of fine grained sand with a 30 m thick soft clay confining bed with 1 5 10 4 to 7 5 10 4 storativity in the proximal part fig 1c fig 6a cgwb chandigarh report 2013 only aquifer ii and iii extend southward towards the distal part of the fan where the primary abstraction is from aquifer iii pleistocene alluvium at a depth of 100 m where the 40 m thick holocene soft clay acts as the confining bed in the proximal fan region the pumping test suggests the discharge varies between 450 and 900 l per minute lpm for a drawdown of 2 5 25 m in the aquifer i the discharge increases to 1000 lpm in aquifer ii and 2000 lpm from 30 thick zones at 200 mbgl in aquifer iii cgwb chandigarh aquifer report 2019 at the distal part due to composition and grain size the semiconfined aquifer i and ii experience better groundwater recharge though the groundwater level depth decreases southwards with an almost artesian condition in the distal part of the fan fig 1d to understand the spatial relationship between subsidence and swt decline with the piedmont aquifer characteristics we plotted them along the ne sw profile xx line fig 4a fig 6a the profile extends from the himalayan foothills at khuda alisher to the distal fan near manakpur south of chandigarh where the artesian type condition prevails fig 1c and d along the profile xx two prominent cones of swt depression and ground subsidence cones are observed in the proximal east chandigarh s1 and distal sohana s2 fan regions the narrow 3 4 km cone of the swt depression up to 0 5 m yr corresponds well with 20 mm yr subsidence cone around east chandigarh region where all three aquifers are present fig 6a whereas the confined aquifer in the distal part around sohana region experienced 0 6 m yr swt depression corresponding to 50 mm yr subsidence with a wider cone which is higher by an order of the proximal part fig 6a the proximal part of the piedmont such as khuda ali sher and sector 23 experienced negligible subsidence or narrow swt depression and subsidence cones including the area around kharar fig 4b fig 6b this represents a point source over exploitation in the unconfined and semi confined aquifer i and ii fig 6a which has higher recharge potential the shape of the ground subsidence curve corresponds linearly with the swt decline curve in the distal part with a significantly larger spatial extent of 15 km profile yy across the confined artesian aquifer fig 6b in the distal part multiple cones of swt decline intersect resulting in the combined effect on the drawdown which can lower the groundwater table rapidly as observed elsewhere in piedmont zones green and nolan 1964 yuan et al 2013 usgs 2022 the cone of depression laterally proliferates in the artesian aquifers theis 1938 the aquifer load is supported by artesian pressure pushing upward and downward against the confining beds the over exploitation decreases the artesian pressure profoundly leading to the aquifer collapse as observed in many artesian aquifers xu et al 2012 liosis et al 2018 wang et al 2019 ngwa 2022 the drastic increase of confining clay layer thickness in the distal fan region reduces the groundwater recharge in aquifers ii iii fig 6b the reduced recharge is unable to compensate for the overall extraction in the sohana and landran area leading to categorizing the region as over exploited cgwb sas nagar report 2017 the confined artesian aquifer is possibly undergoing inelastic compaction due to unregulated over exploitation resulting in pronounced ground subsidence in the distal fan around sohana and landran the stress strain curve can be used to find the elastic and inelastic nature at different parts of the aquifer béjar pizarro et al 2017 li et al 2022 5 3 elastic and inelastic compaction of aquifer the hydraulic head plotted against the insar deformation on a temporal basis provides the aquifer stress strain relation which offers evidence about the type of deformation that the aquifer is undergoing the storage coefficient sk eq 5 is calculated from the relationship between the compression of the aquifer system and the change in the hydraulic head slope of the stress strain curve assuming that water is incompressible relative to the aquifer system compressibility 5 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 where δb is the change in deformation δh is the change in the hydraulic head for the corresponding period ss is the specific storage and b0 is the thickness of the aquifer in the study area the groundwater level variations are measured 2 3 times a year during the pre and post monsoon periods cgwb 2022 whereas the dinsar vertical deformations have a fortnightly frequency owing to limited time series data availability time series we attempted to analyze the stress strain relationship and sk values for 4 locations namely landran east chandigarh dera bassi and manimajra fig 1c fig 7 a d of these locations three sites are experiencing high ground subsidence and overexploitation and one site has no ground deformation many hysteresis loops in the stress strain curve indicate an aquifer s elastic behavior and their absence indicates inelastic deformation béjar pizarro et al 2017 li et al 2022 the hydraulic head of east chandigarh landran and dera bassi registered a lower hydraulic head than the pre consolidation head historical minimum hydraulic head implying inelastic compaction fig 7a c the manimajra exhibit multiple hysteresis loops in the stress strain relation curve indicating elastic deformation which registered a higher hydraulic head in december 2019 than in november 2014 suggesting optimal recharge fig 7d the inelastic compaction in the overexploited distal part is due to the lack of aquifer recharge associated with urbanization such as decreasing rechargeable area increasing water demand etc the same is analyzed using land cover changes with high resolution satellite images 5 4 land use and land cover lulc change recharge potential vs demand to understand the effect of change in land use patterns with increasing population and urbanization the lulc analysis of the region for the period 2000 to 2020 was carried out it was assumed that the increasing population will lead to an increase in built up areas which in turn will act as an impervious layer retarding natural groundwater recharge and enhancing surface runoff further it was observed that average annual rainfall reduced from 1050 mm yr to 850 mm yr during the 2014 2021 period imd 2022 and the precipitation intensity has been on the rise asoka et al 2017 leading to enhanced surface runoff and reduced recharge potential these phenomena adversely affect aquifer potential due to reduced recharge and increasing domestic demand leading to overexploitation the lulc analysis shows that despite the urban pressure in chandigarh and the adjoining region in the proximal piedmont the general availability of water from groundwater and surface water sources is sustainable there is no widespread ground subsidence fig 4a or swt decline fig 5 observed in the proximal zone except in local pockets around east chandigarh and kharar fig 4 the proximal zone also lies near the recharge structures such as the sukhna reservoir 0 5 of the study area as well as small piedmont channels though some of them are being diverted the lulc change around the study region shows that the built up areas have increased four times from 100 sq km to 400 sq km with a 100 increase in population in the past four decades we analyzed the impermeable built up surface area change using satellite images for three hotspot regions namely sohana landran and kharar for the period 2000 2020 fig 7 the built up area increased from 11 5 km2 to 29 2 km2 around the sohana region which is experiencing severe 60 mm yr subsidence fig 8 a a1 fig 5c the increased built up area primarily evolved due to the development of residential sectors 77 80 and the industrial regions around mohali and jlpl during the last decade similarly the impervious area around landran increased from 1 55 km2 to 9 8 km2 a 500 percent increase in the previous two decades fig 8b b1 the growth of the residential sectors 76 85 89 91 and 111 113 between 2005 and 2020 contributed to the drastic increase of impermeable area leading to 0 8 m yr swt decline and corresponding 40 60 mm yr ground subsidence fig 5c the kharar region underwent a 200 increase of built up areas attributable to the construction of residential sectors 125 127 between 2005 and 2020 10 8 28 5 km2 fig 8c and c1 and causing a decline in the water table at the rate of 0 75 m yr and severe subsidence of 40 50 mm yr the lack of a recharge structure and a fourfold increase of impermeable surface resulted in the lower aquifer recharge in the distal fan the current water usage in chandigarh urban area is 250 l person chandigarh metro 2022 far higher than the national average of 132 l per person indiawris 2022 the population of the chandigarh municipality region proximal part of the piedmont zone increased to 1 2 million from 0 8 million a rate of 1 5 per year between 2000 and 2020 united nations world population prospects 2022 whereas the population in the chandigarh suburbs including landran sohana kharar and dera bassi has grown from 0 5 million to 1 0 million at the rate of 3 4 per year during the same period master plans 2022 the twofold population growth in the distal part is likely to increase similar groundwater demand and cause severe over exploitation owing to unregulated groundwater exploitation compared to the regulated chandigarh municipality area in the proximal fan the same is reflected in the swt decline and associated ground subsidence fig 6a and b 5 5 temporal variation in subsidence groundwater level and urbanization the urbanization around the chandigarh piedmont zone leads to overexploitation affecting aquifer properties figs 5 7 the regions of acute ground subsidence usually experience crack in the manmade structure is one of the indicators of the phenomenon and the same is observed around mohali and chandigarh areas kadiyan et al 2021 the damage assessment found that tensional and shear cracks are frequently observed around the landran kharar sohana and kurali with over 3 4 of the damage belonging to tensional cracks which implies a subsidence phenomenon these observations coincide with the dinsar based subsidence groundwater depletion and land cover change observed in the hotspot regions namely kharar sohana landran and east chandigarh figs 4 and 9 a to understand the interrelationship between cause and effects we compared the urbanization trend built up area changes in and groundwater level changes during the past two decades with the ground subsidence trend during 2014 2022 in the hotspot regions fig 9a it is assumed that though the period of observation of the phenomenon is variable still the rate of change should reflect linearity if they have a direct correlation the built up area and subsidence increase exhibit linear trends despite some nonlinearity in groundwater level trends in the hotspot areas fig 9b the kharar and east chandigarh regions in the proximal part experienced a 10 m decade groundwater level decline and a fourfold increase in the builtup area between 2000 and 2020 which matches well with the linear subsidence trend of 40 mm yr during 2014 22 fig 9b the sohana and landran regions located in the distal fan zone with artesian conditions are undergoing 5 m decade groundwater level decline and 4 8 times increase in the builtup area between 2000 and 2020 resulting in the ground subsidence at 60 mm yr during 2014 22 fig 9b though higher groundwater level decline was observed in the proximal aquifer the distal fan is experiencing severe subsidence due to the unmonitored overexploitation from the confined aquifer possibly from aquifer iii as a result of the higher aquifer thickness and composition boulders and sand in the proximal aquifer it is being recharged better than the confined aquifer at the distal fan fig 6 the overexploitation has driven severe subsidence would cause inelastic compaction of the confined aquifer in the distal fan region making it unsustainable and adversely affecting the aquifer s health by the loss of storativity there is increasing evidence of the decline in groundwater resources in many parts of the world owing to urbanization famiglietti 2014 wada and bierkens 2014 which accelerated the land subsidence process chen et al 2018 du et al 2021 mautner et al 2020 there are many parallels to the chandigarh piedmont zone across the world where urban areas are undergoing subsidence due to over exploitation of groundwater wu et al 2009 castellazzi et al 2016 sahadevan and pandey 2021 the himalayan piedmont fans are spread across fast growing urban areas that are producing similar stress on the aquifer due to the over exploitation of groundwater the dinsar ipta methodology can be adapted on a large scale for rapid assessment of ground subsidence in such urban areas sahadevan and pandey 2021 sadeghi et al 2021 wang et al 2022 along with precautionary measures such as artificial recharge asano 1985 surinaidu et al 2017 harini et al 2018 nandan et al 2021 and managed pumping vaux 2011 gorelick and zheng 2015 6 conclusions the dinsar derived vertical subsidence in the himalayan piedmont zone around the fast growing urban center of chandigarh was analyzed in a combination of spatial and temporal changes in groundwater extraction aquifer property and urbanization driven lulc changes responsible for changing demand the analysis depicted precarious overexploitation driven ground subsidence causing the inelastic compaction of confined aquifers in the himalayan piedmont zone the severity is aggravated by the increase in impermeable urban areas which deprives the area of natural surface recharge further the decline in precipitation during the last decade which may be related to climate change has worsened even in the otherwise artesian condition of the distal fan zones these results have significant implications for aquifer management in growing urban centers in the himalayan piedmont zones in the indo gangetic region which is one of the most over exploited areas with fast growing urban centers considering that 80 of the world population is expected live in urban areas in 2050 the open source sentinel insar data sets on a global scale provide the opportunity for rapid assessment of aquifer stress and are particularly useful for fast developing countries like india credit authorship contribution statement dinesh kumar

2294,climate change is predicted to increase rainfall intensity in tropical regions convection permitting cp climate models have been developed to address deficiencies in conventional climate models that use parameterised convection however to date precipitation projections from cp climate models have not been used in conjunction with hydrological models to explore potential impacts of explicit modelling of convective rainfall on river flows in the tropics here we apply the outputs of a continental scale cp climate model as inputs to lumped rainfall runoff models in africa for the first time applied to five catchments in the lake victoria basin we show that the cp climate model produces greater river flows than an equivalent model using parameterised convection in both the current and future c 2100 climate however the location of the catchments near to lake victoria results in limited changes in extreme rainfall and river flows relative to changes in mean rainfall and river flows application of cp model rainfall data from an area where rainfall extremes change more than the change in mean rainfall to the rainfall runoff model does not result in significant changes in river flows instead this is shown to be a result of the rainfall runoff model structure and parameterisation which we posit is due to large scale storage in the catchments associated with wetland cover that buffers the impact of rainfall extremes based on an assessment of hydrological attributes wetland coverage water table depth topography precipitation evapotranspiration and river flow using global scale datasets for the catchments in this research this buffering may be extensive across humid regions application of cp climate model data to lumped catchment models in these areas are unlikely to result in significant increases in extreme river flows relative to increases in mean flows keywords climate change river flows convection permitting model lake victoria 1 introduction climate change is predicted to result in increasing rainfall intensity in sub saharan africa dunning et al 2018 with these increases predicted to affect water resources cuthbert et al 2019 ngoran et al 2015 taylor et al 2013 the impacts of climate change on water resources have been assessed extensively globally see reviews by atawneh et al 2021 garrote 2017 including in sub saharan africa kusangaya et al 2014 ngoran et al 2015 conventional approaches fowler et al 2007 to the assessment of the impacts of climate change on water resources consist of the use of downscaled meteorological data from coarse scale horizontal resolution 100 km global circulation models gcms e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under current and future climate to hydrological models these approaches are limited by the extent to which gcms can reliably simulate the climate physics of an area of interest in tropical continental regions such as sub saharan africa gcms are known to exhibit large errors in precipitation associated with the representation of convective rainfall bock et al 2011 gcms parameterise convective rainfall resulting in too much light daily rainfall and too little intense rainfall dirmeyer et al 2012 stephens et al 2010 which is a significant deficiency in tropical areas where convective systems can be c 75 of total rainfall roca et al 2014 in order to address the deficiency of parameterised convection in gcms convection permitting climate models cpms have been developed these models are run at kilometre scale grid resolution with convection represented explicitly on the model grid kendon et al 2021 cpms have been shown to produce significant improvements in model performance in comparison to conventional parameterised models in both small scale rainfall characteristics e g intensity diurnal cycles and large scale circulation in africa senior et al 2021 with improvements also observed in europe berthou et al 2020 and the usa liu et al 2017 the use of convection permitting models in operational rainfall forecasting is now well established clark et al 2016 rainfall forecasts have also been translated into forecasts of flash flooding in the uk golding et al 2016 mediterranean vincendon et al 2011 and usa qing et al 2020 wang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2021 recently convection permitting models have been used to explore the impacts of climate change on short duration extremes in precipitation with continental scale cp projections in africa producing greater future increases in 3 h and daily precipitation than parameterised models kendon et al 2017 kendon et al 2019 this is due at least in part to greater intensification of the storm updrafts which are not explicitly modelled in standard parameterised models jackson et al 2020 as convection permitting models give greater intensification of extreme rainfall under climate change through better capturing the dynamics of storms and their couplings with larger scales we therefore expect use of convection permitting model projections of rainfall to affect projections of hydrological flows the impacts of climate change based on cp projections on river flows based on distributed hydrological models have been evaluated in temperate climates such as the uk and northern and alpine europe kay 2022 kay and davies 2008 reszler et al 2018 schaller et al 2020 and semiarid texas wang and wang 2019 recently miller et al 2022 used cp projections to develop design storms to feed into an urban flood model in burkina faso west africa to date however no research has assessed how future changes in precipitation produced by convection permitting models may affect projected river flows derived from lumped hydrological models in the tropics moreover globally no work has assessed how lumped conceptual hydrological model structure and parameterisation may affect the propagation of extreme events from cpm precipitation to hydrological model river flow in this paper we quantify changes in river flows associated with application of convection permitting climate model data to lumped conceptual hydrological models for the first time we apply precipitation data from a high resolution convection permitting climate model for africa to five lumped conceptual hydrological models across the lake victoria basin east africa and compare the resulting river flow projections with projections derived from application of an equivalent climate model with parameterised convection we also undertake a series of model experiments applying climate model precipitation data from a region of known modelled rainfall intensification to each of the hydrological models and explore how changes in rainfall intensity propagate through the hydrological models finally we consider the implications for use of convection permitting climate model data in hydrological modelling studies and water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydroclimatic context the study area for this research is the lake victoria basin lvb east africa fig 1 the lvb is located at the head of the nile river basin and has a total area of c 251 000 km2 the area has an equatorial climate with a bimodal rainfall pattern long rains from march to may and short rains from october to december numerous studies have evaluated impacts of climate change on river flows using lumped and semi distributed models in the lvb dessu and melesse 2013 gabiri et al 2020 githui et al 2009 kingston and taylor 2010 mehdi et al 2021 taye et al 2011 and the wider east african region meresa and gatachew 2018 siam and eltahir 2017 van griensven et al 2012 however previous studies used downscaled gcm outputs which parameterize convection none have evaluated the impact of explicit modelling of convective processes on river flow projections the lvb is a hotspot for severe convective storms hanley et al 2021 and floods and landslides associated with such extreme weather events e g the 2019 short rains wainwright et al 2021a have significant socioeconomic consequences there is large inter model uncertainty in the region bornemann et al 2019 and gcms are known to have significant biases to convective rainfall with both cmip5 and cmip6 models shown to poorly simulate extreme events ayugi et al 2021 in east africa consequently some workers have developed cpm runs of the regional historic climate hanley et al 2021 van de walle et al 2020 for the purposes of improved understanding of regional climate and forecasting at climate change timescales cpm runs have been developed at the continental scale in africa kendon et al 2019 stratton et al 2018 and used in this research these have been evaluated in east africa and the lvb in particular and have been shown to improve simulations of rainfall intensity and the diurnal cycle finney et al 2019 finney et al 2020 2 2 hydrological model development 2 2 1 model code the hydrological model used in this research was the lumped conceptual hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 gr4j has been used extensively for streamflow simulation worldwide and has been shown to perform on average well over a wide range of catchment conditions whilst remaining parsimonious perrin et al 2003 westra et al 2014 gr4j has also been used in sub saharan africa in particular bodian et al 2018 kodja et al 2020 le lay et al 2007 the structure of gr4j is shown in fig 2 the model runs on a daily timestep is driven by single time series of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e the model consists of two stores production and routing and four parameters x1 x4 net rainfall pn actual evapotranspiration es and net evapotranspiration en are calculated from the balance on p and e a fraction of pn ps then is transferred to the production store which has a maximum capacity x1 and level s percolation out of the production store perc is added to pn ps to form the water quantity reaching the routing part of the model pr the routing store algorithms divide pr into direct and indirect flow components using unit hydrograph approaches uh1 and uh2 with the time base as parameter x4 to spread effective rainfall over several successive timesteps to produce hydrograms q9 and q1 both the direct and indirect flow components via the routing store maximum capacity parameter x3 level r account for groundwater exchange using parameter x2 and resulting flow components qr and qd are combined to produce the total streamflow q for more information regarding the model structure of gr4j the reader is referred to perrin et al 2003 2 2 2 river flow observations driving data and model calibration in order to test the impact of convection permitting climate model data on river flows gr4j was run on a daily timestep in order to calibrate gr4j s current climate we therefore extracted all daily river flow data in the global runoff data centre grdc 56 068 koblenz germany for a bounding box covering the lvb 28 37 e 5 s 4 n this consisted of daily river flow data for five catchments in the lvb as shown in fig 1 a summary of metadata for each of the catchments is shown in table 1 for each of the five catchments we developed a gr4j model instance by adjusting its parameters using the r package airgr coron et al 2017 referred to as each gr4j model herein each gr4j model requires single time series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as driving datasets we extracted historical 1958 2001 daily rainfall time series from the watch forcing dataset weedon et al 2011 taking the spatial mean of all grid cells within each catchment we also extracted temperature data which was used to calculate pet using the thornthwaite 1948 method each gr4j model was calibrated using the full river flow time series which has been shown to be more robust than calibration and validation using a split sample approach arsenault et al 2018 the model was calibrated using the default range of parameters and the built in steepest descent local slope procedure coron et al 2017 to optimise the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the kge is a calculated as kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σsim and σobs are the standard deviations in the simulations and observations respectively and µsim and µobs are the means of the simulations and observations respectively the kge has an ideal value at unity it should be noted that for our application the use of population based optimization algorithms which presumably have better global search capabilities did not outperform the default local approach in gr4j the kge was chosen instead of other criteria such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency as this research focusses on changes in extreme rainfall and river flows in such cases the kge tends to constrain the underestimation of uncommon flow events in simulated runoff gupta et al 2009 2 3 application of climate model experimental data to hydrological models for each of the calibrated gr4j models we applied data from two climate model experiments stratton et al 2018 developed with the specific aim of evaluating the impact of explicit modelling of convection 1 r25 a 25 km resolution climate model over africa with parameterised convection and 2 cp4 a finer 4 km resolution climate model over africa which allows structures recognizable as convective clouds to form the two climate models provide 10 year time series of daily rainfall and temperature for a historic 1997 2007 and future c 2100 period finney et al 2020 kendon et al 2019 cp4 is the first convection permitting multiyear regional climate simulation on an africa wide domain senior et al 2021 the 25 km resolution of r25 reflects the global 25 km amip simulation used as a boundary condition for both cp4 and r25 the 4 km resolution for cp4 was used as a compromise between domain size the african continent computational cost and the ability of the model to resolve deep convection stratton et al 2018 the length of time series produced by cp4 and r25 was a balance between computational demands and the need to generate sufficient data to evaluate the impact of resolving convection full information on the cp4 and r25 model experimental design can be found in stratton et al 2018 a number of previous papers are available which evaluate cp4 and r25 model results finney et al 2019 finney et al 2020 kendon et al 2019 senior et al 2021 and use these results for rainfall downscaling wilby et al 2022 to directly test the impact of explicit modelling of convective precipitation on predicted river flows we made the deliberate decision not to bias correct or downscale the cp4 and r25 data use and evaluation of cp4 and r25 data in this manner has an additional benefit of informing decisions on the value of bias correction of cpm data and the level of sophistication used in future studies notwithstanding that the purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of explicit modelling of convective precipitation it should be noted that previous studies have evaluated cp4 and r25 against observations and these have shown that both simulations capture many broad features of precipitation across east africa these include the biannual progression of the tropic rainband the contrasting rainfall between the african rift and the horn of africa finney et al 2019 the interannual variability in the peak of the short rains and the balance of precipitation between long and short rains wainwright et al 2021b the 4 km cp4 outputs were regridded using area weighted bi linear interpolation to 25 km regridding cp4 allows for a comparison with r25 on the basis of explicit and parametrised convection opposed to differences in resolution the results presented are representative of rainfall statistics on the scale of the r25 model finney et al 2019 spatial mean daily time series for each catchment in fig 1 were extracted and applied to each gr4j model projected changes in both mean and extreme precipitation from cp4 have been shown to be spatially variable both at the continental scale kendon et al 2019 and also in east africa in particular finney et al 2020 to evaluate how changes in precipitation propagate through each of the gr4j models developed in this research we conducted a sensitivity experiment by applying the same set of cp4 driving data to each gr4j model cp4 precipitation and temperature data was used from an area of known precipitation intensification to each of the gr4j models for each 25 km grid cell we first calculated the ratio of the changes in daily extreme precipitation defined as the 95th percentile of all days to changes in daily mean precipitation between the historic and future cp4 runs as follows δ 95 δ m e a n 95 future 95 historic mean future mean historic the resulting ratio referred to as δ95 δmean herein is shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of the δ95 δmean metric explicitly shows how modelled precipitation may intensify over a region where δ95 δmean 1 the change in the extreme as defined by the 95th percentile is greater than the change in the mean where δ95 δmean 1 the change in the mean is greater than the change in the extreme the 95th percentile was used as this has been used extensively in the analysis of extremes in precipitation christensen and christensen 2003 in additional to inland fluvial wu et al 2012 groundwater ascott et al 2017 and coastal flooding pirazzoli et al 2006 we selected a bounding box 34 37 34 90 w 0 82 1 36 s blue dashed line in fig 3 where δ95 δmean 1 and extracted and applied the precipitation and temperature data to each of the hydrological models 2 4 analysis of model results we first evaluated the calibrated historic river flow through visual inspection of the time series and kge values we then evaluated the river flow projections generated by the application of the catchment specific meteorological data from cp4 and r25 this was first done visually through plotting of river flow quantiles and boxplots for each hydrological model we then calculated if there are statistically significant differences between modelled river flows produced by gr4j using data from 1 cp4 future and cp4 historical 2 r25 future and r25 historical 3 cp4 future and r25 future 4 cp4 historical and r25 historical for each of these comparisons we undertook a two sample t test webster and oliver 1990 and a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test conover 1999 to determine if there were significant differences in the mean and distribution of river flows respectively we then calculated δ95 δmean for each model for precipitation and river flow for the gr4j model experiment runs we calculated and plotted river flow quantiles and boxplots and then calculated δ95 δmean for precipitation river flow and the hydrological model intermediate terms perc q9 and qr fig 2 all analysis was conducted using the statistical computing environment r r development core team 2016 3 results 3 1 hydrological model calibration fig 4 shows the observed and modelled historic river flows produced by gr4j for each of the catchments in this research the calibrated model parameter sets and resulting kge values are reported in table 2 across the five catchments observational data for daily river flows are sparse with data only available in the 1970s 1980s the implications of this are discussed further in section 4 3 when driven using historical watch forcing data the gr4j catchment models appear to replicate the timing and magnitude of the observed river flow peaks and recessions reasonably well fig 4 at low to moderate river flows 0 5 mm day the gr4j catchment models appear neither systematically over nor underpredicting river flows whilst at higher river flows 5 15 mm day the models appear to slightly underestimate peak flows using the mean observed flow as a benchmark the kge values for each model are moderately good table 2 and within the range of values 0 41 kge 1 that could be considered reasonable knoben et al 2019 3 2 river flow projections for each catchment derived from application of cp4 and r25 data fig 5 shows river flow quantiles produced by gr4j for each of the catchments when applying the historic and future cp4 and r25 data the same results are presented as boxplots in figure s2 it can be observed that across the river flow quantiles application of the future model runs of cp4 and r25 to gr4j produces greater river flows than the historic model runs with the exception of catchment 1269200 fig 5 panel a application of cp4 data also produces greater river flows than application of r25 to gr4j fig 5 in catchment 1269200 r25 historic produces greater river flows than r25 future and cp4 runs for quantiles 0 0 5 before the r25 runs begin to converge between quantiles 0 5 and 1 the r25 future run in catchment 1270900 fig 5 panel b produced zero flow for quantiles 0 0 5 for all catchments there were significant p 0 01 differences in the mean based on two sample t test and distribution based on two sample kolmogorov smirnov test of river flows between runs driven by 1 cp4 future and cp4 historical 2 r25 future and r25 historical 3 cp4 future and r25 future 4 cp4 historical and r25 historical table 3 shows δ95 δmean for cp4 and r25 for each of the five catchments with the exception of catchment 1270900 for all other catchments and both cp4 and r25 δ95 δmean is greater for precipitation than for river flow 3 3 gr4j model experiment results fig 6 shows river flow quantiles when cp4 data for the box where rainfall intensifies fig 3 is applied to each of the gr4j models see also figure s3 it can be observed that application of cp4 data to gr4j results in greater river flows than r25 table 4 shows δ95 δmean for precipitation river flow and model intermediate terms for each of the gr4j models δ95 δmean is greater for p perc and q9 than for qr and q 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of convection permitting climate model runs on river flows and the role of lumped hydrological model structure when applying data from the climate model experiments to each lumped catchment model the future runs result in greater river flows than the historic runs fig 5 with significantly different p 0 01 river flow means and distributions apart from one catchment 1269200 application of cp4 data resulted in greater river flows than application of r25 data see fig 5 panel a for all catchments application of cp4 data resulted in significantly different p 0 01 river flow means and distributions in comparison to application of r25 we suggest that the differences between the catchments in modelled river flows are likely primarily due to small scale chaotic variability in sampling of convective precipitation events around the lvb more than physical differences in surface forcing such as topography and land use lakeside features rowell and berthou 2022 longer or ensemble climate simulations would better discriminate the impact of heterogeneous surface features for cp4 with the exception of low flows quantile 0 4 at catchment 1269200 projected increases in river flows occur across all quantiles for all catchments fig 5 figure s1 in supplementary material reflecting an increase in mean precipitation but with limited increases in extreme flows relative to changes in mean flows despite the similarity of increases in mean and extreme precipitation table 3 when applying cp4 data from an area where increases in extreme precipitation are greater than increases in the mean the same also occurs table 4 why are increases in extreme precipitation relative to increases in the mean precipitation not propagating to changes in river flows the changes in δ95 δmean in different terms of gr4j table 4 suggest this is the result of the hydrological model structure used in this research δ95 δmean decreases substantially between the terms q9 and qr table 4 which is associated with the routing store and groundwater exchange components of the model fig 2 we posit that the storage dynamics in the routing store fig 2 result in a dampening of extreme precipitation events moreover in four out of five of the calibrated catchment models developed in this research the groundwater exchange parameter is negative table 2 which results in the model losing excess water during extreme precipitation events these storage dynamics are common across many lumped hydrological modelling approaches e g hbv bergström 1995 hec hms gyawali and watkins 2013 nam dhi 2008 and thus similar results would be anticipated if the cp4 and r25 precipitation data were applied to such models what physical processes are likely to be leading the dampening of extreme precipitation events in reality whilst the structure and parameter sets of lumped conceptual models such as gr4j have limited physical basis perrin et al 2003 some insight can be gained from the attributes of the catchments used in this research the catchments are reported to have notable wetland coverage mean 30 of land use shallow water tables mean depth 1 5 m below ground level and surface topography mean slope 2 82 with annual precipitation mean 1400 mm and aet mean 1130 mm being much greater than river flow mean 314 mm linke et al 2019 it is therefore likely that at the catchment scale storage and evaporative losses from wetlands and shallow groundwater storage will dampen the impacts of increases in extreme precipitation on catchment outflows such catchment attributes are likely to be globally common fig 7 shows the global distribution of shallow water tables panel a wetlands panel b and where runoff is 25 of precipitation panel c there are large areas of the americas europe asia and africa where shallow water tables and wetland coverage may result in dampening of extreme precipitation events at the catchment scale 4 2 implications for water management the changes in rainfall and river flow distribution predicted by application of cp4 and r25 data have significant implications for both water resources and flood risk management under future climate change whilst no significant increases in extremes relative to increases in mean river flows were projected for these lvb catchments application of cp4 still resulted in greater predicted river flows than application of r25 in the future model runs in four out of five catchments such sensitivities likely location specific should be borne in mind when evaluating the impacts of climate change on river flows by applying the output of conventional climate models which parameterise convection e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 increases in extreme precipitation relative to increases in mean precipitation shown in cp4 blue in fig 3 is likely to affect projections of future flooding it is anticipated that δ95 δmean associated with cp4 precipitation would propagate more extensively though a high temporal and spatial resolution flood inundation model e g yu and lane 2006 due to the distributed nature of such modelling approaches 4 3 limitations and further work there are a number of limitations to this research which could be addressed by further work these are outlined below the observed river flow time series used in the model calibration are short and from the 1970s and 1980s these are the only publicly available daily river flow data in the lake victoria basin and this paucity of observational data is present across much of africa tramblay et al 2021 similarly we used a reanalysis based set of driving data to calibrate the hydrological models weedon et al 2011 which may have contributed to the underestimation of peak flows by the calibrated gr4j catchment models in addition to new river flow and precipitation observations further historic data rescue and dissemination to develop improved hydrological models would be beneficial this research has evaluated the impact of explicit modelling of convective rainfall on river flow projections from lumped hydrological models for the first time applied to a small number of catchments in the lvb and only using one lumped hydrological model gr4j exploring the propagation of δ95 δmean through hydrological models of varying levels of complexity lumped vs distributed shorter timesteps would be of benefit this could include semi distributed hydrological models e g swat which has been commonly used in east africa van griensven et al 2012 as well as flood models e g miller et al 2022 similarly understanding propagation of δ95 δmean in catchments with varying hydrological attributes and projections of precipitation extremes would support an assessment of how useful cpm data are across different types of hydrological impact studies this would require application of cpm data to hydrological models in areas where δ95 δmean for precipitation 1 as well as across catchments with varying degrees of baseflow contribution whilst cpms improve the model performance for high intensity convective precipitation events cpms have also been shown to affect dry spell length in some african regions kendon et al 2019 it would therefore be beneficial to undertake a complementary analysis with a focus on dry periods and low flow metrics in this study only 10 years of weather data for the historic and future climate have been produced and cp4 and r25 are simulations based on one gcm the met office um stratton et al 2018 the application of cp4 and r25 data to gr4j in this study also does not consider future land use change which has been shown to have a potentially significant effect on water balance partitioning in the region gabiri et al 2020 näschen et al 2019 the use of uncorrected climate model output as inputs to gr4j was intentional for this study for the purpose of evaluating the impact of explicit modelling of convective rainfall however in conjunction with the limitations above the cp4 and r25 data cannot be used for climate change adaptation studies or planning at this time given that the character of precipitation time series e g amplitude of extremes duration of wet spells and dry spells is important any bias correction or downscaling of cpm data for such studies may need to consider the use of more sophisticated methods quantile quantile mapping correction of dry day counts e g famien et al 2018 process based scaling of rainfall e g klein et al 2021 than simple approaches e g delta change further work is required to assess how variability between convection permitting and non convection permitting versions of the same gcm compares with variability between gcms e g within cmip5 taylor et al 2012 quantifying the balance of impacts of climate change on river flows from application of precipitation data from cpms versus the impacts of future land use change would also be beneficial 5 conclusions in this research we apply the outputs of a continental scale convection permitting cp climate model to five lumped rainfall runoff models in africa for the first time application of a cp model produced greater river flows than an equivalent model using parameterised convection in both the current and future c 2100 climate in four of the five catchments the location of the catchments near lake victoria resulted in unusually small changes in extreme rainfall relative to mean rainfall likely explaining the small changes in extreme river flows relative to their mean change the regional atmospheric physics causing this independence of future change on storm intensity requires further research application of cp model rainfall data from an area where rainfall extremes change more than the change in mean rainfall to the rainfall runoff model did not result in significant changes in river flows this is shown to be a result of the rainfall runoff model structure and parameterisation which is likely to be due to large scale storage in the catchments associated with wetland cover and groundwater storage which buffers the impact of rainfall extremes the hydrological conditions in which this buffering occurs are shown to be extensive across humid regions application of cp climate model data to lumped catchment models in these areas are unlikely to result in significant increases in extreme river flows

2294,climate change is predicted to increase rainfall intensity in tropical regions convection permitting cp climate models have been developed to address deficiencies in conventional climate models that use parameterised convection however to date precipitation projections from cp climate models have not been used in conjunction with hydrological models to explore potential impacts of explicit modelling of convective rainfall on river flows in the tropics here we apply the outputs of a continental scale cp climate model as inputs to lumped rainfall runoff models in africa for the first time applied to five catchments in the lake victoria basin we show that the cp climate model produces greater river flows than an equivalent model using parameterised convection in both the current and future c 2100 climate however the location of the catchments near to lake victoria results in limited changes in extreme rainfall and river flows relative to changes in mean rainfall and river flows application of cp model rainfall data from an area where rainfall extremes change more than the change in mean rainfall to the rainfall runoff model does not result in significant changes in river flows instead this is shown to be a result of the rainfall runoff model structure and parameterisation which we posit is due to large scale storage in the catchments associated with wetland cover that buffers the impact of rainfall extremes based on an assessment of hydrological attributes wetland coverage water table depth topography precipitation evapotranspiration and river flow using global scale datasets for the catchments in this research this buffering may be extensive across humid regions application of cp climate model data to lumped catchment models in these areas are unlikely to result in significant increases in extreme river flows relative to increases in mean flows keywords climate change river flows convection permitting model lake victoria 1 introduction climate change is predicted to result in increasing rainfall intensity in sub saharan africa dunning et al 2018 with these increases predicted to affect water resources cuthbert et al 2019 ngoran et al 2015 taylor et al 2013 the impacts of climate change on water resources have been assessed extensively globally see reviews by atawneh et al 2021 garrote 2017 including in sub saharan africa kusangaya et al 2014 ngoran et al 2015 conventional approaches fowler et al 2007 to the assessment of the impacts of climate change on water resources consist of the use of downscaled meteorological data from coarse scale horizontal resolution 100 km global circulation models gcms e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 under current and future climate to hydrological models these approaches are limited by the extent to which gcms can reliably simulate the climate physics of an area of interest in tropical continental regions such as sub saharan africa gcms are known to exhibit large errors in precipitation associated with the representation of convective rainfall bock et al 2011 gcms parameterise convective rainfall resulting in too much light daily rainfall and too little intense rainfall dirmeyer et al 2012 stephens et al 2010 which is a significant deficiency in tropical areas where convective systems can be c 75 of total rainfall roca et al 2014 in order to address the deficiency of parameterised convection in gcms convection permitting climate models cpms have been developed these models are run at kilometre scale grid resolution with convection represented explicitly on the model grid kendon et al 2021 cpms have been shown to produce significant improvements in model performance in comparison to conventional parameterised models in both small scale rainfall characteristics e g intensity diurnal cycles and large scale circulation in africa senior et al 2021 with improvements also observed in europe berthou et al 2020 and the usa liu et al 2017 the use of convection permitting models in operational rainfall forecasting is now well established clark et al 2016 rainfall forecasts have also been translated into forecasts of flash flooding in the uk golding et al 2016 mediterranean vincendon et al 2011 and usa qing et al 2020 wang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2021 recently convection permitting models have been used to explore the impacts of climate change on short duration extremes in precipitation with continental scale cp projections in africa producing greater future increases in 3 h and daily precipitation than parameterised models kendon et al 2017 kendon et al 2019 this is due at least in part to greater intensification of the storm updrafts which are not explicitly modelled in standard parameterised models jackson et al 2020 as convection permitting models give greater intensification of extreme rainfall under climate change through better capturing the dynamics of storms and their couplings with larger scales we therefore expect use of convection permitting model projections of rainfall to affect projections of hydrological flows the impacts of climate change based on cp projections on river flows based on distributed hydrological models have been evaluated in temperate climates such as the uk and northern and alpine europe kay 2022 kay and davies 2008 reszler et al 2018 schaller et al 2020 and semiarid texas wang and wang 2019 recently miller et al 2022 used cp projections to develop design storms to feed into an urban flood model in burkina faso west africa to date however no research has assessed how future changes in precipitation produced by convection permitting models may affect projected river flows derived from lumped hydrological models in the tropics moreover globally no work has assessed how lumped conceptual hydrological model structure and parameterisation may affect the propagation of extreme events from cpm precipitation to hydrological model river flow in this paper we quantify changes in river flows associated with application of convection permitting climate model data to lumped conceptual hydrological models for the first time we apply precipitation data from a high resolution convection permitting climate model for africa to five lumped conceptual hydrological models across the lake victoria basin east africa and compare the resulting river flow projections with projections derived from application of an equivalent climate model with parameterised convection we also undertake a series of model experiments applying climate model precipitation data from a region of known modelled rainfall intensification to each of the hydrological models and explore how changes in rainfall intensity propagate through the hydrological models finally we consider the implications for use of convection permitting climate model data in hydrological modelling studies and water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydroclimatic context the study area for this research is the lake victoria basin lvb east africa fig 1 the lvb is located at the head of the nile river basin and has a total area of c 251 000 km2 the area has an equatorial climate with a bimodal rainfall pattern long rains from march to may and short rains from october to december numerous studies have evaluated impacts of climate change on river flows using lumped and semi distributed models in the lvb dessu and melesse 2013 gabiri et al 2020 githui et al 2009 kingston and taylor 2010 mehdi et al 2021 taye et al 2011 and the wider east african region meresa and gatachew 2018 siam and eltahir 2017 van griensven et al 2012 however previous studies used downscaled gcm outputs which parameterize convection none have evaluated the impact of explicit modelling of convective processes on river flow projections the lvb is a hotspot for severe convective storms hanley et al 2021 and floods and landslides associated with such extreme weather events e g the 2019 short rains wainwright et al 2021a have significant socioeconomic consequences there is large inter model uncertainty in the region bornemann et al 2019 and gcms are known to have significant biases to convective rainfall with both cmip5 and cmip6 models shown to poorly simulate extreme events ayugi et al 2021 in east africa consequently some workers have developed cpm runs of the regional historic climate hanley et al 2021 van de walle et al 2020 for the purposes of improved understanding of regional climate and forecasting at climate change timescales cpm runs have been developed at the continental scale in africa kendon et al 2019 stratton et al 2018 and used in this research these have been evaluated in east africa and the lvb in particular and have been shown to improve simulations of rainfall intensity and the diurnal cycle finney et al 2019 finney et al 2020 2 2 hydrological model development 2 2 1 model code the hydrological model used in this research was the lumped conceptual hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 gr4j has been used extensively for streamflow simulation worldwide and has been shown to perform on average well over a wide range of catchment conditions whilst remaining parsimonious perrin et al 2003 westra et al 2014 gr4j has also been used in sub saharan africa in particular bodian et al 2018 kodja et al 2020 le lay et al 2007 the structure of gr4j is shown in fig 2 the model runs on a daily timestep is driven by single time series of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration e the model consists of two stores production and routing and four parameters x1 x4 net rainfall pn actual evapotranspiration es and net evapotranspiration en are calculated from the balance on p and e a fraction of pn ps then is transferred to the production store which has a maximum capacity x1 and level s percolation out of the production store perc is added to pn ps to form the water quantity reaching the routing part of the model pr the routing store algorithms divide pr into direct and indirect flow components using unit hydrograph approaches uh1 and uh2 with the time base as parameter x4 to spread effective rainfall over several successive timesteps to produce hydrograms q9 and q1 both the direct and indirect flow components via the routing store maximum capacity parameter x3 level r account for groundwater exchange using parameter x2 and resulting flow components qr and qd are combined to produce the total streamflow q for more information regarding the model structure of gr4j the reader is referred to perrin et al 2003 2 2 2 river flow observations driving data and model calibration in order to test the impact of convection permitting climate model data on river flows gr4j was run on a daily timestep in order to calibrate gr4j s current climate we therefore extracted all daily river flow data in the global runoff data centre grdc 56 068 koblenz germany for a bounding box covering the lvb 28 37 e 5 s 4 n this consisted of daily river flow data for five catchments in the lvb as shown in fig 1 a summary of metadata for each of the catchments is shown in table 1 for each of the five catchments we developed a gr4j model instance by adjusting its parameters using the r package airgr coron et al 2017 referred to as each gr4j model herein each gr4j model requires single time series of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet as driving datasets we extracted historical 1958 2001 daily rainfall time series from the watch forcing dataset weedon et al 2011 taking the spatial mean of all grid cells within each catchment we also extracted temperature data which was used to calculate pet using the thornthwaite 1948 method each gr4j model was calibrated using the full river flow time series which has been shown to be more robust than calibration and validation using a split sample approach arsenault et al 2018 the model was calibrated using the default range of parameters and the built in steepest descent local slope procedure coron et al 2017 to optimise the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the kge is a calculated as kge 1 r 1 2 σ sim σ obs 1 2 μ sim μ obs 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σsim and σobs are the standard deviations in the simulations and observations respectively and µsim and µobs are the means of the simulations and observations respectively the kge has an ideal value at unity it should be noted that for our application the use of population based optimization algorithms which presumably have better global search capabilities did not outperform the default local approach in gr4j the kge was chosen instead of other criteria such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency as this research focusses on changes in extreme rainfall and river flows in such cases the kge tends to constrain the underestimation of uncommon flow events in simulated runoff gupta et al 2009 2 3 application of climate model experimental data to hydrological models for each of the calibrated gr4j models we applied data from two climate model experiments stratton et al 2018 developed with the specific aim of evaluating the impact of explicit modelling of convection 1 r25 a 25 km resolution climate model over africa with parameterised convection and 2 cp4 a finer 4 km resolution climate model over africa which allows structures recognizable as convective clouds to form the two climate models provide 10 year time series of daily rainfall and temperature for a historic 1997 2007 and future c 2100 period finney et al 2020 kendon et al 2019 cp4 is the first convection permitting multiyear regional climate simulation on an africa wide domain senior et al 2021 the 25 km resolution of r25 reflects the global 25 km amip simulation used as a boundary condition for both cp4 and r25 the 4 km resolution for cp4 was used as a compromise between domain size the african continent computational cost and the ability of the model to resolve deep convection stratton et al 2018 the length of time series produced by cp4 and r25 was a balance between computational demands and the need to generate sufficient data to evaluate the impact of resolving convection full information on the cp4 and r25 model experimental design can be found in stratton et al 2018 a number of previous papers are available which evaluate cp4 and r25 model results finney et al 2019 finney et al 2020 kendon et al 2019 senior et al 2021 and use these results for rainfall downscaling wilby et al 2022 to directly test the impact of explicit modelling of convective precipitation on predicted river flows we made the deliberate decision not to bias correct or downscale the cp4 and r25 data use and evaluation of cp4 and r25 data in this manner has an additional benefit of informing decisions on the value of bias correction of cpm data and the level of sophistication used in future studies notwithstanding that the purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of explicit modelling of convective precipitation it should be noted that previous studies have evaluated cp4 and r25 against observations and these have shown that both simulations capture many broad features of precipitation across east africa these include the biannual progression of the tropic rainband the contrasting rainfall between the african rift and the horn of africa finney et al 2019 the interannual variability in the peak of the short rains and the balance of precipitation between long and short rains wainwright et al 2021b the 4 km cp4 outputs were regridded using area weighted bi linear interpolation to 25 km regridding cp4 allows for a comparison with r25 on the basis of explicit and parametrised convection opposed to differences in resolution the results presented are representative of rainfall statistics on the scale of the r25 model finney et al 2019 spatial mean daily time series for each catchment in fig 1 were extracted and applied to each gr4j model projected changes in both mean and extreme precipitation from cp4 have been shown to be spatially variable both at the continental scale kendon et al 2019 and also in east africa in particular finney et al 2020 to evaluate how changes in precipitation propagate through each of the gr4j models developed in this research we conducted a sensitivity experiment by applying the same set of cp4 driving data to each gr4j model cp4 precipitation and temperature data was used from an area of known precipitation intensification to each of the gr4j models for each 25 km grid cell we first calculated the ratio of the changes in daily extreme precipitation defined as the 95th percentile of all days to changes in daily mean precipitation between the historic and future cp4 runs as follows δ 95 δ m e a n 95 future 95 historic mean future mean historic the resulting ratio referred to as δ95 δmean herein is shown in fig 3 the spatial distribution of the δ95 δmean metric explicitly shows how modelled precipitation may intensify over a region where δ95 δmean 1 the change in the extreme as defined by the 95th percentile is greater than the change in the mean where δ95 δmean 1 the change in the mean is greater than the change in the extreme the 95th percentile was used as this has been used extensively in the analysis of extremes in precipitation christensen and christensen 2003 in additional to inland fluvial wu et al 2012 groundwater ascott et al 2017 and coastal flooding pirazzoli et al 2006 we selected a bounding box 34 37 34 90 w 0 82 1 36 s blue dashed line in fig 3 where δ95 δmean 1 and extracted and applied the precipitation and temperature data to each of the hydrological models 2 4 analysis of model results we first evaluated the calibrated historic river flow through visual inspection of the time series and kge values we then evaluated the river flow projections generated by the application of the catchment specific meteorological data from cp4 and r25 this was first done visually through plotting of river flow quantiles and boxplots for each hydrological model we then calculated if there are statistically significant differences between modelled river flows produced by gr4j using data from 1 cp4 future and cp4 historical 2 r25 future and r25 historical 3 cp4 future and r25 future 4 cp4 historical and r25 historical for each of these comparisons we undertook a two sample t test webster and oliver 1990 and a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test conover 1999 to determine if there were significant differences in the mean and distribution of river flows respectively we then calculated δ95 δmean for each model for precipitation and river flow for the gr4j model experiment runs we calculated and plotted river flow quantiles and boxplots and then calculated δ95 δmean for precipitation river flow and the hydrological model intermediate terms perc q9 and qr fig 2 all analysis was conducted using the statistical computing environment r r development core team 2016 3 results 3 1 hydrological model calibration fig 4 shows the observed and modelled historic river flows produced by gr4j for each of the catchments in this research the calibrated model parameter sets and resulting kge values are reported in table 2 across the five catchments observational data for daily river flows are sparse with data only available in the 1970s 1980s the implications of this are discussed further in section 4 3 when driven using historical watch forcing data the gr4j catchment models appear to replicate the timing and magnitude of the observed river flow peaks and recessions reasonably well fig 4 at low to moderate river flows 0 5 mm day the gr4j catchment models appear neither systematically over nor underpredicting river flows whilst at higher river flows 5 15 mm day the models appear to slightly underestimate peak flows using the mean observed flow as a benchmark the kge values for each model are moderately good table 2 and within the range of values 0 41 kge 1 that could be considered reasonable knoben et al 2019 3 2 river flow projections for each catchment derived from application of cp4 and r25 data fig 5 shows river flow quantiles produced by gr4j for each of the catchments when applying the historic and future cp4 and r25 data the same results are presented as boxplots in figure s2 it can be observed that across the river flow quantiles application of the future model runs of cp4 and r25 to gr4j produces greater river flows than the historic model runs with the exception of catchment 1269200 fig 5 panel a application of cp4 data also produces greater river flows than application of r25 to gr4j fig 5 in catchment 1269200 r25 historic produces greater river flows than r25 future and cp4 runs for quantiles 0 0 5 before the r25 runs begin to converge between quantiles 0 5 and 1 the r25 future run in catchment 1270900 fig 5 panel b produced zero flow for quantiles 0 0 5 for all catchments there were significant p 0 01 differences in the mean based on two sample t test and distribution based on two sample kolmogorov smirnov test of river flows between runs driven by 1 cp4 future and cp4 historical 2 r25 future and r25 historical 3 cp4 future and r25 future 4 cp4 historical and r25 historical table 3 shows δ95 δmean for cp4 and r25 for each of the five catchments with the exception of catchment 1270900 for all other catchments and both cp4 and r25 δ95 δmean is greater for precipitation than for river flow 3 3 gr4j model experiment results fig 6 shows river flow quantiles when cp4 data for the box where rainfall intensifies fig 3 is applied to each of the gr4j models see also figure s3 it can be observed that application of cp4 data to gr4j results in greater river flows than r25 table 4 shows δ95 δmean for precipitation river flow and model intermediate terms for each of the gr4j models δ95 δmean is greater for p perc and q9 than for qr and q 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of convection permitting climate model runs on river flows and the role of lumped hydrological model structure when applying data from the climate model experiments to each lumped catchment model the future runs result in greater river flows than the historic runs fig 5 with significantly different p 0 01 river flow means and distributions apart from one catchment 1269200 application of cp4 data resulted in greater river flows than application of r25 data see fig 5 panel a for all catchments application of cp4 data resulted in significantly different p 0 01 river flow means and distributions in comparison to application of r25 we suggest that the differences between the catchments in modelled river flows are likely primarily due to small scale chaotic variability in sampling of convective precipitation events around the lvb more than physical differences in surface forcing such as topography and land use lakeside features rowell and berthou 2022 longer or ensemble climate simulations would better discriminate the impact of heterogeneous surface features for cp4 with the exception of low flows quantile 0 4 at catchment 1269200 projected increases in river flows occur across all quantiles for all catchments fig 5 figure s1 in supplementary material reflecting an increase in mean precipitation but with limited increases in extreme flows relative to changes in mean flows despite the similarity of increases in mean and extreme precipitation table 3 when applying cp4 data from an area where increases in extreme precipitation are greater than increases in the mean the same also occurs table 4 why are increases in extreme precipitation relative to increases in the mean precipitation not propagating to changes in river flows the changes in δ95 δmean in different terms of gr4j table 4 suggest this is the result of the hydrological model structure used in this research δ95 δmean decreases substantially between the terms q9 and qr table 4 which is associated with the routing store and groundwater exchange components of the model fig 2 we posit that the storage dynamics in the routing store fig 2 result in a dampening of extreme precipitation events moreover in four out of five of the calibrated catchment models developed in this research the groundwater exchange parameter is negative table 2 which results in the model losing excess water during extreme precipitation events these storage dynamics are common across many lumped hydrological modelling approaches e g hbv bergström 1995 hec hms gyawali and watkins 2013 nam dhi 2008 and thus similar results would be anticipated if the cp4 and r25 precipitation data were applied to such models what physical processes are likely to be leading the dampening of extreme precipitation events in reality whilst the structure and parameter sets of lumped conceptual models such as gr4j have limited physical basis perrin et al 2003 some insight can be gained from the attributes of the catchments used in this research the catchments are reported to have notable wetland coverage mean 30 of land use shallow water tables mean depth 1 5 m below ground level and surface topography mean slope 2 82 with annual precipitation mean 1400 mm and aet mean 1130 mm being much greater than river flow mean 314 mm linke et al 2019 it is therefore likely that at the catchment scale storage and evaporative losses from wetlands and shallow groundwater storage will dampen the impacts of increases in extreme precipitation on catchment outflows such catchment attributes are likely to be globally common fig 7 shows the global distribution of shallow water tables panel a wetlands panel b and where runoff is 25 of precipitation panel c there are large areas of the americas europe asia and africa where shallow water tables and wetland coverage may result in dampening of extreme precipitation events at the catchment scale 4 2 implications for water management the changes in rainfall and river flow distribution predicted by application of cp4 and r25 data have significant implications for both water resources and flood risk management under future climate change whilst no significant increases in extremes relative to increases in mean river flows were projected for these lvb catchments application of cp4 still resulted in greater predicted river flows than application of r25 in the future model runs in four out of five catchments such sensitivities likely location specific should be borne in mind when evaluating the impacts of climate change on river flows by applying the output of conventional climate models which parameterise convection e g cmip5 taylor et al 2012 increases in extreme precipitation relative to increases in mean precipitation shown in cp4 blue in fig 3 is likely to affect projections of future flooding it is anticipated that δ95 δmean associated with cp4 precipitation would propagate more extensively though a high temporal and spatial resolution flood inundation model e g yu and lane 2006 due to the distributed nature of such modelling approaches 4 3 limitations and further work there are a number of limitations to this research which could be addressed by further work these are outlined below the observed river flow time series used in the model calibration are short and from the 1970s and 1980s these are the only publicly available daily river flow data in the lake victoria basin and this paucity of observational data is present across much of africa tramblay et al 2021 similarly we used a reanalysis based set of driving data to calibrate the hydrological models weedon et al 2011 which may have contributed to the underestimation of peak flows by the calibrated gr4j catchment models in addition to new river flow and precipitation observations further historic data rescue and dissemination to develop improved hydrological models would be beneficial this research has evaluated the impact of explicit modelling of convective rainfall on river flow projections from lumped hydrological models for the first time applied to a small number of catchments in the lvb and only using one lumped hydrological model gr4j exploring the propagation of δ95 δmean through hydrological models of varying levels of complexity lumped vs distributed shorter timesteps would be of benefit this could include semi distributed hydrological models e g swat which has been commonly used in east africa van griensven et al 2012 as well as flood models e g miller et al 2022 similarly understanding propagation of δ95 δmean in catchments with varying hydrological attributes and projections of precipitation extremes would support an assessment of how useful cpm data are across different types of hydrological impact studies this would require application of cpm data to hydrological models in areas where δ95 δmean for precipitation 1 as well as across catchments with varying degrees of baseflow contribution whilst cpms improve the model performance for high intensity convective precipitation events cpms have also been shown to affect dry spell length in some african regions kendon et al 2019 it would therefore be beneficial to undertake a complementary analysis with a focus on dry periods and low flow metrics in this study only 10 years of weather data for the historic and future climate have been produced and cp4 and r25 are simulations based on one gcm the met office um stratton et al 2018 the application of cp4 and r25 data to gr4j in this study also does not consider future land use change which has been shown to have a potentially significant effect on water balance partitioning in the region gabiri et al 2020 näschen et al 2019 the use of uncorrected climate model output as inputs to gr4j was intentional for this study for the purpose of evaluating the impact of explicit modelling of convective rainfall however in conjunction with the limitations above the cp4 and r25 data cannot be used for climate change adaptation studies or planning at this time given that the character of precipitation time series e g amplitude of extremes duration of wet spells and dry spells is important any bias correction or downscaling of cpm data for such studies may need to consider the use of more sophisticated methods quantile quantile mapping correction of dry day counts e g famien et al 2018 process based scaling of rainfall e g klein et al 2021 than simple approaches e g delta change further work is required to assess how variability between convection permitting and non convection permitting versions of the same gcm compares with variability between gcms e g within cmip5 taylor et al 2012 quantifying the balance of impacts of climate change on river flows from application of precipitation data from cpms versus the impacts of future land use change would also be beneficial 5 conclusions in this research we apply the outputs of a continental scale convection permitting cp climate model to five lumped rainfall runoff models in africa for the first time application of a cp model produced greater river flows than an equivalent model using parameterised convection in both the current and future c 2100 climate in four of the five catchments the location of the catchments near lake victoria resulted in unusually small changes in extreme rainfall relative to mean rainfall likely explaining the small changes in extreme river flows relative to their mean change the regional atmospheric physics causing this independence of future change on storm intensity requires further research application of cp model rainfall data from an area where rainfall extremes change more than the change in mean rainfall to the rainfall runoff model did not result in significant changes in river flows this is shown to be a result of the rainfall runoff model structure and parameterisation which is likely to be due to large scale storage in the catchments associated with wetland cover and groundwater storage which buffers the impact of rainfall extremes the hydrological conditions in which this buffering occurs are shown to be extensive across humid regions application of cp climate model data to lumped catchment models in these areas are unlikely to result in significant increases in extreme river flows
