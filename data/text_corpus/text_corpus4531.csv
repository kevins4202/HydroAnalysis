information on visualization of wake and vortex structures the main conclusions are 1 in the viv region at re 60 000 the amplitude response frequency response harnessed power and power conversion efficiency of the upstream cylinder is the same for the two spacing ratios tested due to the shedding effect the motion of the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more severely suppressed than spacing ratio d d 2 57 which reduces the harnessed power and conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder 2 in the galloping region at re 110 000 due to the different timing of impingement of the shed vortices on the downstream cylinder the upstream cylinder harnesses more power and has higher energy conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 than d d 2 57 keywords flow induced

flow induced oscillations fio of a bluff body are common and powerful physical phenomena which involve complex fluid structure interactions inducing instabilities vortex induced vibration viv and galloping are the two most common fio phenomena viv and galloping have been comprehensively reviewed by sarpkaya 1979 2004 bearman 1984 2011 parkinson 1989 blevins 1977 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 gabbai and benaroya 2005 and sumner 2010 2013 in this paper we refer to the studied cases as flow induced oscillations fio because tested cylinders are rigid and oscillation frequencies are low instead of suppressing fio to mitigate structural fatigue damage bernitsas and raghavan 2009 undertook the engineering challenge of enhancing and controlling these destructive phenomena to harvest marine hydrokinetic mhk energy with the patented vivace converter the converter uses an environmentally compatible way of harnessing hydrokinetic energy even from slow flows starting at 0 4 m s bernitsas et al 2008 and later using the nonlinear stiffness oscillator to 0 275 m s ma et al 2016 passive turbulence control ptc in the form of sandpaper strips was developed and tested experimentally in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan park et al 2013 to enhance fio of cylinders by triggering galloping this resulted in back to back viv and galloping effectively making the converter s response amplitude operator to have no upper limit on the flow velocity of harnessing energy this increases the conversion of hydrodynamic energy from fluid flows to mechanical energy in oscillators and subsequently electricity through a generator in order to maximize the harnessed power multiple cylinders in synergistic fio have been studied park et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2013 bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2016 utilization of multiple cylinders in cross flow is common in many engineering applications in civil offshore aeronautics etc the arrangement of the cylinders and their orientation with respect to the free stream are the main factors related to the complicated fluid structure interaction between cylinders zdravkovich 2003a 2003b most previous research investigated fio of multiple cylinders is in the form of two smooth cylinders in tandem in some cases the cylinders were fixed in low reynolds number borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 fio of two cylinders with surface roughness ptc for high reynolds number has been studied by the mrelab experimentally kim et al 2016 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 sun et al 2016 systematically studied two tandem cylinders in fio for the hydrodynamic energy harnessing which found that two cylinders harness power is between 2 56 and 13 49 times and the power of a single cylinder the efficiency of two cylinders is between 2 0 and 6 68 of a single cylinder this result calls for further investigation into the fio problem and the synergy of tandem ptc cylinders the objective of this paper is to investigate numerically with experimental validation the interactive fio of two rough cylinders in tandem tests and simulations are conducted in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 which falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime trsl stands for transition in shear layer and 3 indicates the third region where the shear layer is fully turbulent resulting in stronger vortices shorter formation length and high lift zdravkovich 2003a simulations are performed by solving the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model the cfd codes were initially developed by wu et al 2014 based on openfoam in previous work the numerical results can predict the experimentally measured data well wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 2 physical model in the current experimental facility an embedded second generation virtual damper spring vck system has been introduced to replace the physical dampers and springs of the oscillator sun et al 2015 2016 the vck system provides the damper and spring stiffness forces through a controller based on the displacement and velocity measurements thus both the functional form and numerical value of stiffness and damping are simulated mathematically correctly by the vck system the hydrodynamic force exerted on the cylinder due to the relative flow is not included in the closed control loop and thus no bias is introduced sun et al 2015 a simple schematic of two elastically mounted circular cylinders and vck systems is depicted in fig 1 a the components of each oscillator are a a rigid circular cylinder of diameter d and length l b a virtual linear spring of stiffness k and c a virtual damping c coefficient in a linear viscous damping model two cylinders placed in tandem are constrained to oscillate in the y direction which is perpendicular to their axes and the flow velocity u in the x direction a picture of two single cylinder oscillators mounted on the ltfsw low turbulence free surface water channel is shown in fig 1 b each cylinder is mounted on a rail system allowing adjustment of the longitudinal spacing d d between the two cylinders the center to center spacing d between the two cylinders is set at 2 0d or 2 57d where the region is traditionally regarded as proximity and wake interference zdravkovich 1987 and the amplitudes of each cylinder are mutually affected sun et al 2017 the system parameters in the 2 d numerical simulation are the same as those used in the corresponding experiments as listed in table 1 high damping is selected for energy harnessing to enhance fio of cylinders and increase the efficiency and power density in harvesting marine hydrodynamic energy distributed roughness in the form of roughness strips was introduced and extensively studied in the mrelab experimentally chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 the distributed roughness was termed passive turbulence control ptc resulted in a valuable tool the fio to ptc map developed by park et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a pair of straight roughness strips is attached running along the entire length of the cylinder parallel to the cylinder axis according to the fio to ptc map park et al 2013 the location of the roughness strips determines the response fio of the cylinder the placement angle α ptc is measured in degrees from the forward stagnation point in the corresponding ideal flow to the upstream edge of the roughness strip based on the results of previous studies chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 on ptc the strips with commercial roughness designation p60 and width of 12 7 mm which covers 16 on each side of the 88 9 mm diameter cylinder have been used in this study the placement angle has been set at α ptc 20 the total thickness of the ptc is on the order of the boundary layer thickness table 2 shows the details of the roughness strips used in the present study all the experiments were conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan the ltfsw channel recirculates 37 85 m3 37 850 lt of fresh water at speed up to 1 4 m s using an impeller powered by a 15 kw induction motor the test section is 2 44m long 1 0m wide 1 17m deep and is made of transparent plexiglass which enables visualization of the flow past cylinders using two 5 w argon lasers and aluminum oxide particles of 100 μm 3 numerical model 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model the full flow field around the oscillating cylinders is investigated by solving the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 a dedicated cfd code was developed in the mrelab based on open source code openfoam for performing flow and body simulation openfoam is composed of c libraries solving continuum mechanics problems with a finite volume discretization method the developed code has two additional features a the dynamics of the multiple oscillators and b dynamic adjustment of the grid near a cylinder as it approaches a boundary ding et al 2015 the 2d urans governing equations are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s j i u j u i where x i represents the cartesian coordinate u i represents the corresponding mean flow velocity components ν represents the molecular kinematic viscosity and s ij represents the mean strain rate tensor 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the quantity τ i j u i u j represents the reynolds stress tensor which is symmetric in the spalart allmaras turbulence model a common method employs the boussinesq approximation to relate the reynolds stress to the mean velocity gradient as 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t represents the kinematic eddy viscosity the original spalart allmaras model is employed to solve a transport equation for the kinematic eddy viscosity this model is different from other one equation models and algebraic models in the sense that it is a local model which means the equation in one location does not depend on the solutions at other points therefore it is compatible with grids of any structure this model has been shown to give acceptable results for a wide variety of situations and is known for its stability wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 in the spalart allmaras model the turbulent eddy viscosity is defined as ν t ν f ν 1 f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 χ ν ν where ν represents an intermediate working variable of the turbulence model and obeys the following transport equation 5 ν t u j ν x j c b 1 1 f t 2 s ν c w 1 f w c b 1 κ 2 f t 2 ν d 2 1 σ x j ν ν ν x j c b 2 ν x i ν x i f t 1 δ u 2 additional definitions of functions and constants are given by spalart and allmaras 1992 in the present work the trip terms f t 1 and f t 2 are turned off and the trip less initial condition for ν travin et al 2000 which was successfully employed in earlier work wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 is used in order to introduce the cylinder dynamics in fio the mass damper spring oscillator is modelled by a second order linear differential equation the one degree of freedom equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m y c y k y f f l u i d y where f f l u i d y is the total fluid force acting on the cylinder in the y direction m is the total inertial mass of the vck system c is the total damping which includes the structural damping c structure and the harnessing damping c harness the solution to eq 6 can be attained by the following system of two first order differential equations 7 m u f f l u i d y c y k y 8 y u where u is the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction a compounded implicit explicit method is employed to solve the equation of motion together with the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for velocity u and displacement y of the cylinder superscript n represents values at the current time step and n 1 for the new time step then 9 u n u n 1 u n δ t 10 u n 1 u n δ t f f l u i d y c y k y m 11 y n 1 y n δ t u n 1 the divergence gradient and laplacian terms in the governing equations are solved through a second order gauss integration scheme with a linear interpolation for the face centered value of the unknown the time integration is performed by the second order backward euler method therefore second order accuracy is ensured by the numerical discretization scheme in space and time momentum and continuity equations are performed together in a segregated way through a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm 3 2 computational domain and grid generation the overall computational domain is 52 57d 13 2d for the two ptc cylinders as shown in fig 3 five boundaries inflow top two cylinder walls bottom and outflow are set in the overall domain the initial positions or the equilibrium positions of the cylinders are located at the center of the vertical direction of the domain the separation between the inlet boundary and the upstream cylinder center l up is set at 25d the separation between the downstream cylinder center and the outlet boundary it also set to be 25d a uniform and constant velocity is specified at the inflow boundary with a zero gradient pressure and a fixed ν a zero gradient condition is set for velocity pressure and ν at the outflow boundary a wall boundary is defined at the bottom to match the experimental conditions the top boundary condition the free surface is defined as a wall boundary to simplify the numerical simulations in the experiments the safety stops are placed on both sides of the mean position at a distance of around 2 8 times the diameter in the cases where the cylinder reaches the maximum displacement in the experiment there is still some distance between the free surface and the cylinder experiments from bernitsas et al 2007 and raghavan et al 2007 have shown that the effect of free surface or bottom boundary is very small at a distance of 3 diameters from the boundary therefore the interaction between the free surface and the cylinders in fio was not considered in the present numerical study ding et al 2013 2015 2016 in the simulations moving wall boundaries are specified for the two cylinders in fio the ptc is set as part of the cylinder surface and treated as wall boundary in order to simulate the effect of surface roughness a wall function type boundary condition is specified for ν t and ν wu et al 2014 moreover the trip less initial condition wu et al 2014 travin et al 2000 is utilized for the eddy viscosity ν this approach was proposed by shur et al 1996 to simulate subcritical regime cylinder flow without a user specified location for transition on the body the trip less initial conditions divide the fluid domain into two regions with different initial values for eddy viscosity a a zero value is applied from the inlet to the center of the upstream cylinder and b a nonzero value is applied to the rest of the flow domain in this study the nonzero value is set at the same level as the molecular eddy viscosity which was successfully employed in our previous one cylinder simulation work ding et al 2016 wu et al 2014 two dimensional structured computational grids were implemented for all numerical simulation cases when the cylinders are in fio the dynamic mesh motion adjustment is processed through the topological mesh change technique combined with general grid interfaces beaudoin and jasak 2008 in earlier work the application of the dynamic mesh technique was used successfully in simulating two cylinders and multiple cylinders in flow induced oscillation at the mrelab ding et al 2013 there is a 2d 2d square computational sub domain in the vicinity of each cylinder where the grid density for the near wall region is enhanced to increase the resolution in the boundary layer the 2d 2d square sub domain can move up and down together with the cylinder in fio therefore there is no mesh change around the cylinder keeping the near wall distance conserved during re meshing the top or bottom moving cell layer of each square can be removed when the mesh is compressed and added when the mesh is expanded the height of moving layer h is shrunk or elongated once h h minimum the moving layer is collapsed on the contrary when h h maxmimum a new cell layer is generated here the h minimum and h maxmimum are set based on the overall quality of the computational grid they are closely related to the minimum grid space of the mesh in the present work h minimum 0 002 m and h maxmimum 0 005 m therefore the mesh is kept in good quality with little deformation when the two cylinders undergo large amplitude fio due to the utilization of the wall function for the surface roughness model the values of y produced by the selected near wall grid spacing were between 10 and 30 depending on the reynolds number in order to determine the overall grid resolution to achieve a convergent and accurate solution in reasonable computational time a grid sensitivity study was conducted in earlier works wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 three different selected grid densities produced similar results on drag coefficient lift coefficient and strouhal number thus the grid resolution in the present work was set at 240 35 circumferential radial accordingly a close up of the grid about 138 208 cells for the case of two ptc cylinders is shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the grid when the cylinders are in fio 4 mathematical model for harnessed power in this section the mathematical model in eq 6 for the oscillator is used to calculate the harnessed and dissipated power of the two rough cylinder vivace converter the left hand side of eq 6 is integrated after multiplying it by the instantaneous velocity and then is averaged over the cycle period the final expression for the hydrokinetic power converted to kinematic in the vivace converter can be derived as bernitsas 2016 12 p h a r n e s s 8 π 3 m ζ h a r n e s s f n w a t e r a 2 f o s c 2 where a is the amplitude of the oscillating cylinder f osc is the frequency of the oscillating cylinder a and f osc are extracted from the displacement history curve of the oscillating cylinder and m represents the oscillating system mass the damping ratio ζ h a r n e s s and the natural frequency f n water in still water are defined as follows 13 ζ h a r n e s s c h a r n e s s 2 m k 14 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k m m a 1 2 π k m c a m d where c harness represents the harness damping and k represents the spring stiffness m d is the displaced fluid mass which is the volume of the fluid displaced by the oscillating cylinder only further m a is the inviscid added mass m a c a m d and c a is the added mass coefficient c a 1 the value of c a is a controversial issue and thus the approach selected in this paper requires a short discussion there are two approaches to modeling of the added mass a the first older approach separates the ideal added mass from the hydrodynamic forces on the right hand side of eq 6 then the frequency of oscillation changes exhibiting the lock in behavior where the vortex shedding frequency locks onto the frequency of cylinder oscillation b the second newer approach keeps the added mass force as part of the total hydrodynamic force and when it is measured experimentally and numerically it is indeed a variable it is renamed as hydrodynamic effective mass changing from 4 50 to 0 95 and is not related to the mechanical effective mass used in eq 7 the hydrodynamic effective mass makes the frequency of cylinder oscillation stay close to the natural frequency of the cylinder in water per vikestad et al 2000 some researchers conclude that viv lock in can be interpreted as a simple resonance phenomenon with variable c a or hydrodynamic effective mass actually the frequency of oscillation stays close to the natural frequency in water decreasing slowly to a ratio of about 0 9 as the measured effective mass changes from 4 50 to 0 95 however a the negative values of the hydrodynamic effective mass and b the fact that not all characteristics of linear resonance observed show that there are advantages and disadvantages with both approaches it is the authors opinion that both methods are based on simplistic models incapable of capturing the flow complexities and wake structures observed thus as long as the approach followed is stated at the beginning of all calculations and data presentation there should be no problem in interpreting or reproducing data in our approach we maintain the added mass term on the right hand side of eq 6 but we plot data using the constant theoretical value c a 1 the power in the fluid is calculated based on the area swept by the cylinders 15 p f l u i d w 1 2 ρ u 3 2 a max d l where a max is the largest amplitude among all cylinders in a multiple cylinder vivace converter obviously the input power depends on the cylinders response unlike wind turbines or ocean current turbines with fixed geometry where the flow area is determined by the blade swept area the betz limit is the theoretical maximum power that can be harnessed by a wind turbine from an open flow and is equal to 59 26 16 27 commercial scale wind turbines achieve peak efficiency of 75 80 of the betz limit according to the betz limit in this paper the harnessed power conversion efficiency is defined as 16 η h a r n e s s p h a r n e s s p f l u i d b e t z l i m i t 100 5 amplitude response fig 6 shows the variation of amplitude response of the two cylinders with respect to reynolds number re free stream velocity u and reduced velocity u which are all proportional within the test range of experiments and simulations four regions were distinctly observed which are the initial branch 45 000 re 60 000 upper branch 60 000 re 80 000 transition region from viv to galloping 80 000 re 90 000 and galloping 90 000 re upstream cylinder the experimental data show that in the viv region the amplitude response is not significantly influenced by the center to center spacing between the two rough cylinders in the transition and galloping regions however the amplitude for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 an explanation of the interaction is provided in section 7 the numerical results agree well with experimental data in the viv region fig 6 a in the galloping region the numerical results are lagging the experimental data in terms of re u u several effects may contribute to this discrepancy a the ptc effect in numerical simulation is not as prominent as in experiments chang et al 2011 which leads to the ptc being unable to trigger fio of the cylinders into galloping as early as the experiments b the flow distortion due to the support frames of the cylinders in the channel reducing the uniformity of the flow across the cylinders c the effect of the blockage fig 1 b even though limited adds an error to the experiments bernitsas 2016 d in spite of the ptc presence which forces flow separation and consequently minimizes three dimensional effects raghavan and bernitsas 2008 chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 some three dimensionality in the flow is expected in fio the cfd simulations performed are two dimensional e tip effects may be significant even though ptc reduces them kinaci et al 2016 nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend downstream cylinder the experimental data show that the motion of the downstream cylinder is suppressed in the viv region and the transition region for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the suppression is more severely than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 the numerical results show a similar trend with the experimental data 6 frequency response the numerical frequency for each case and for each cylinder is calculated using fast fourier transform fft the frequency ratio f f osc f n vac of each cylinder is plotted versus re u u in fig 7 the frequency ratio f f osc f n vac of each cylinder is non dimensionalized by the corresponding system natural frequency in vacuum f n vac 1 2 π m k m is the oscillating mass k is the spring stiffness the numerical frequency results are verified by the experimental data within test range 45 000 re 75 000 corresponding to the initial and upper branches the experimental frequency ratio of the two cylinders for both spacing distances increases slowly from 0 70 to 0 85 the numerical results follow well with the experimental data except for re 70 000 for the downstream cylinder with spacing ratio d d 2 0 as shown in fig 7 c the reason is that at re 70 000 and re 80 000 there are two main frequencies due to the interaction between the two cylinders the bigger frequency is equal to the frequency of oscillation and wake frequency of the upstream cylinder the lower one is equal to the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder in simulation the latter frequency is the dominant component and selected by the code for plotting as shown in fig 7 d for spacing ratio d d 2 57 the phenomenon of two dominant frequencies is not prominent for 45 000 re 90 000 corresponding to the end of the upper branch and transition region from viv to galloping the experimental data show that the frequency ratios of the two cylinders for both spacing ratios decrease gradually from 0 85 to 0 75 the numerical results show that the frequency ratio is constant around 0 9 the discrepancy may be attributed to variation of the added mass due to three dimensional effects from vortex shedding or tip flow when a cylinder is in oscillations or turbulence model however the detailed reasons should be investigated further in future for re 90 000 corresponding to the galloping region the experimental and numerical results both show that the frequency ratio is about constant in the galloping region 7 interactive flow in tandem cylinders to interpret the phenomena observed in amplitude response and frequency response the detailed flow features of fio are discussed in this section as well as the interaction hydrodynamic mechanisms that drive the cylinders in viv or galloping 7 1 interactions in the viv region at re 60 000 as shown in fig 8 the displacement histories and lift coefficients illustrate that the amplitude ratio of the upstream cylinder for both spacing values is about 0 6 and the motion of the downstream cylinder is suppressed this is caused by the shielding effect due to the presence of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the phase difference between the two cylinders is higher than d d 2 57 the mechanism is presented following the vortex structure analysis in fig 8 comparing the displacement history and the lift force coefficient for each cylinder in fig 8 we observe that lift leads displacement by about 10 typically in the tandem cylinders vortex shedding leads the induced lift force and the lift force leads the displacement for both spacing values in viv at re 60 000 the 2 s two single shedding vortices per cycle vortex structure can be clearly observed in the wake of the upstream cylinder two vortices shed from the upstream cylinder per oscillation cycle the clockwise vortex from the top shear layer and the counter clockwise one from the bottom shear layer as the clockwise vortex sheds from the top the upstream cylinder is subjected to the minimum lift t 5 70s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 70s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 similarly as the counterclockwise vortex sheds from the bottom the upstream cylinder is subjected to the maximum lift t 6 10s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 60s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 as the vortices from the upstream cylinder move downstream and reach into the vicinity of the downstream cylinder the vortices do not impinge on the oscillation of the downstream cylinder but reattach with the shear layer of the downstream cylinder the clockwise rotating vortex passes above the downstream cylinder and the counter clockwise vortex passes below it because of the low amplitude of the upstream cylinder the vortices from the upstream cylinder pass the downstream cylinder closely and take away the same rotational vortices from the downstream cylinder resulting in cancelation of the vortex formation behind the downstream cylinder and depriving it of circulation and its lift furthermore as the clockwise vortex from the upstream cylinder passes and re attaches to the downstream cylinder the downstream cylinder may be pushed to approach the opposite vortex and attain minimum lift t 5 50s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 90s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 similarly the counter clockwise vortex performs with the similar mechanism t 5 90s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 50s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 therefore the motion of the downstream cylinder is induced by the vortices from the upstream cylinder however the spacing ratio between the two cylinders is different and the vortices take different time to reach the downstream cylinder in d d 2 01 and 2 57 thus resulting in the wake induced vibration of the downstream cylinder to have different phase and amplitude 7 2 interactions in the galloping region at re 110 000 the displacement histories in fig 9 show that the amplitude ratio of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is in the range 0 9 a d 1 1 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 it is only about 0 7 the amplitudes of the downstream cylinder for both spacing values are almost the same as the upstream cylinder that is for d d 2 0 the amplitude of both cylinders is in a given range for d d 2 57 the amplitudes are nearly constant at a d 0 7 this observation indicates that variable spacing leads to particular interaction this will be presented in the following vortex structure analysis based on fig 9 compared to the nearly single frequency displacement histories the lift coefficients of the two cylinders exhibit more frequencies for both spacing ratios each crest or trough exhibits a saddle moreover the saddle shape of the downstream cylinder is more obvious than the upstream cylinder for both spacing ratios and the saddle for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more pronounced than spacing ratio d d 2 57 which indicates that the upstream cylinder for d d 2 0 is affected by the presence of the downstream cylinder according to the force curves these can be explained by the vortex structures in the same figure for spacing ratio d d 2 0 in galloping at re 110 000 the 2p two pairs of vortices per cycle vortex shedding structure can be clearly observed in the wake of the upstream cylinder two pairs of vortices are shed from the upstream cylinder per cycle one pair by the top of the shear layer a1 and a2 at t 11 1s and another pair by the bottom shear layer a3 and a4 at t 11 4s the two vortices of each pair do not shed at the same time the outside vortex a1 sheds at t 11 1s or a4 sheds at t 11 4s before the inside vortex a2 at t 11 1s or a3 at t 11 4s as the outside vortex a1 sheds at t 11 1s from the upstream cylinder the lift exerted on the upstream cylinder is affected and appears as a fluctuation then the outside vortex a1 merges with the outside vortex b3 from the downstream cylinder with the outside vortex a1 shedding at t 11 10s the inside vortex a2 impinges on the downstream cylinder then sheds from the back of the upstream cylinder meanwhile the upstream cylinder reaches its highest absolute lift for the downstream cylinder with spacing ratio d d 2 0 in galloping at re 110 000 however the vortex structure of the downstream cylinder is severely impacted by the wake from the upstream cylinder and the 2p vortex model can also be observed one pair is b1 and b2 at t 11 10s the other pair is b3 and b4 at t 11 40s the outside vortex b3 of the downstream cylinder is merged by the outside vortex a1 of the upstream cylinder at t 11 2s then the merged vortices shed as one at t 11 4s the other vortex b4 of this pair sheds at t 11 5s the lift coefficient of the downstream cylinder also has a bump at each crest or trough which is also induced by the non simultaneous shedding of the two vortices in one pair for spacing ratio d d 2 57 in galloping at re 110 000 the downstream cylinder is completely immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder vortex c1 of the upstream cylinder links with vortex d1 of the downstream cylinder at t 8 50s also for c3 and d3 at t 8 80s the two cylinders both have a quasi 2p vortex structure quasi 2p means that two pairs of vortices shed per cycle but in each pair one vortex is weaker than the other for the upstream cylinder vortex c1 and vortex c2 at t 8 70s or c3 and c4 at t 9 00s are one pair and vortex c2 is much weaker than vortex c1 for the downstream cylinder vortex d1 and vortex d2 at t 8 60s or d3 and d4 at t 8 90s are one pair and vortex d2 is much weaker than vortex d1 then the weaker vortex disappears quickly like vortex c2 at t 8 80s or vortex d2 at t 8 70s as aforementioned the amplitude of the upstream cylinder for the spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 the reason is that the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 can independently shed vortices in most cases however for spacing ratio d d 2 57 all the vortices of the upstream cylinder merge with the vortices of the downstream cylinder and some circulation vorticity is taken away from the downstream cylinder reducing its lift 8 harnessed power the power that can be harnessed by a two ptc cylinder vivace converter is extracted by the added harnessing damping a high damping ratio of ζ 2 6 table 1 was selected as a balance between extracting significant power and suppressing cylinder motion sun et al 2017 based on the experimental and numerical results of amplitude and frequency responses the harnessed power p harness by the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder are calculated using the mathematical model in section 4 experimental and numerical results for the harnessed power are plotted versus re u u in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a the harnessed power for the upstream cylinder starts from a low flow velocity 0 45 m s and extends to the limit flow rate of the channel in the initial branch and upper branch 45 000 re 80 000 the harnessed power increases steadily without being affected by the spacing ratio the numerical results agree well with the experimental data in the galloping region re 90 000 the harnessed power of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 the numerical results follow the same trend as shown in fig 10 b in test range 45 000 re 120 000 the harnessed power of the downstream cylinder for both spacing ratios generally is considerable lower than the upstream cylinder this is evidently accompanied with the suppression of the downstream cylinder motion in the initial branch and upper branch the numerical results agree well with the experimental results in the beginning of the galloping region the experimental results show a power jump and drop where the harnessed power increases suddenly then decreases suddenly numerical results also show this phenomenon however the increase and decrease lag the experimental data in terms of u in the entire galloping region the numerically predicted harnessed power is higher than the one based on experimental data fig 10 c depicts the power harnessed by the two rough cylinders the trend is dictated by the upstream cylinder in initial and upper viv branches the harnessed power increases steadily for both spacing ratios with little difference the numerical results agree well with the experimental data at the beginning of galloping the harnessed power by the two cylinders together also shows a jump and drop which is induced by the downstream cylinder in the fully developed galloping region the two cylinder harnessed power for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 this phenomenon as in the case of amplitude response was explained in the interaction section 7 2 9 efficiency of harnessed power the harnessed power conversion efficiency calculated by eq 16 is plotted in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a the harnessed power conversion efficiency for the upstream cylinder can reach 50 at about re 60 000 at the beginning of the upper branch as the upstream cylinder transitions from the viv initial branch to the viv upper branch the amplitude and frequency both increase greatly in the viv region the harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is close to that for spacing ratio d d 2 57 however in the galloping region the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more efficient in power harnessing than spacing ratio d d 2 57 numerical and experimental data agree well in the viv region in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data in general the tendency is predicted properly by the cfd calculations this is explained as the inability of the 2 d simulations to properly model the tip flow effect which limits the flow uniformity in experiments for the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 b the highest harnessed power conversion efficiencies for both spacing distances appear at the beginning of the initial branch the efficiency only reaches 21 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 14 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the harnessed power conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder is much lower than the upstream cylinder this is due to the motion suppression for the downstream cylinder in the viv region the numerical results follow closely with the experimental data in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data like the amplitude response section and harnessed power section again this is due to the 3 d tip flow effect in experiments which is not modeled in 2 d urans cfd in fig 11 c the harnessed power conversion efficiency of the two rough cylinders together is depicted the trend of the total harnessed power conversion efficiency is higher for the upstream cylinder at about re 60 000 the harnessed power conversion efficiency reaches 63 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 54 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 at the beginning of the upper branch in the viv region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 57 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 0 however in the galloping region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is little higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 in the viv region the numerical results follow closely the experimental data in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data like the amplitude response section and harnessed power section the general tendency is predicted properly by numerical simulations again this is due to the 3 d tip flow effect in experiments which is not modeled in 2 d urans cfd 10 conclusions conversion of hydrokinetic power by two rough rigid cylinders in tandem in fio was investigated using two dimensional u rans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the spalart allmaras turbulence model at high reynolds numbers 30 000 re 120 000 the numerical simulations were verified by experimental measurements performed in the ltfsw channel of the mrelab of the university of michigan the center to center spacing ratio d d of the two cylinders in tandem was set at 2 0 or 2 57 with mass ratio m 1 343 ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m the results including amplitude response frequency response cylinder interaction energy harvesting and conversion efficiency were analyzed enhancement of both the harnessed power and efficiency are revealed by numerical simulation the main conclusions drawn are the following 1 the numerical amplitude ratio results are in excellent agreement with experimental data in the initial branch and upper branch of viv in the galloping region the numerical results are lagging behind the experimental data due to several differences between experiments and simulations nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend 2 the numerical frequency response agrees well with experimental data for spacing d d 2 0 at re 70 000 and re 80 000 there are two main frequencies due to the interaction between the two cylinders in simulations 3 in the viv region at re 60 000 the amplitude response frequency response harnessed power and energy efficiency of the upstream cylinder are not affected by the spacing due to the timing vortices shed by the first cylinder impinge on the second cylinder the motion of the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more strongly suppressed than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 which causes reduction in the harnessed power and conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder 4 in the galloping region at re 110 000 due to the different impingement timing of vortices shed by the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the upstream cylinder produces more harnessed power and higher energy conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 than for d d 2 57 5 power can be harnessed by the two cylinder vivace converter starting from a low flow velocity 0 45 m s and spanning over a broad range of velocity 6 in the fully developed galloping region the two cylinder harnessed power for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than that for spacing ratio d d 2 57 7 the harnessed power conversion efficiency optimum appears at the beginning of the upper branch the highest efficiency can reach up to 63 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 54 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 in the galloping region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is a little higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 8 the major contribution of cfd in investigating and understanding the complexity of fio of two cylinders in tandem is that once the code has been validated against experimental results it enables vortex structure animation this is very helpful in understanding the differences of interactive fio mechanisms between the two cylinders for different spacing ratios acknowledgments the following support is gratefully acknowledged a cooperative

ptc in the form of roughness strips is applied to enhance fio and increase the power harness efficiency of the vivace vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy converter numerical simulations are performed using two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the spalart allmaras turbulence model the center to center spacing ratio d d of the two cylinders is set as

discussed results are compared to experimental data for validation and reveal how the interaction of two tandem cylinders may enhance the harnessed power cfd provides complementary valuable information on visualization of wake and vortex structures the main conclusions are 1 in the viv region at re 60 000 the amplitude response frequency response harnessed power and power conversion efficiency of the upstream cylinder is the same for the two spacing ratios tested due to the shedding effect the motion of the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more severely suppressed than spacing ratio d d 2 57 which reduces the harnessed power and conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder 2 in the galloping region at re 110 000 due to the different timing of impingement of the shed vortices on the downstream cylinder the upstream cylinder harnesses more power and has higher energy conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 than d d 2 57 keywords flow induced

flow induced oscillations fio of a bluff body are common and powerful physical phenomena which involve complex fluid structure interactions inducing instabilities vortex induced vibration viv and galloping are the two most common fio phenomena viv and galloping have been comprehensively reviewed by sarpkaya 1979 2004 bearman 1984 2011 parkinson 1989 blevins 1977 williamson and govardhan 2004 2008 gabbai and benaroya 2005 and sumner 2010 2013 in this paper we refer to the studied cases as flow induced oscillations fio because tested cylinders are rigid and oscillation frequencies are low instead of suppressing fio to mitigate structural fatigue damage bernitsas and raghavan 2009 undertook the engineering challenge of enhancing and controlling these destructive phenomena to harvest marine hydrokinetic mhk energy with the patented vivace converter the converter uses an environmentally compatible way of harnessing hydrokinetic energy even from slow flows starting at 0 4 m s bernitsas et al 2008 and later using the nonlinear stiffness oscillator to 0 275 m s ma et al 2016 passive turbulence control ptc in the form of sandpaper strips was developed and tested experimentally in the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan park et al 2013 to enhance fio of cylinders by triggering galloping this resulted in back to back viv and galloping effectively making the converter s response amplitude operator to have no upper limit on the flow velocity of harnessing energy this increases the conversion of hydrodynamic energy from fluid flows to mechanical energy in oscillators and subsequently electricity through a generator in order to maximize the harnessed power multiple cylinders in synergistic fio have been studied park et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2013 bernitsas 2016 sun et al 2016 utilization of multiple cylinders in cross flow is common in many engineering applications in civil offshore aeronautics etc the arrangement of the cylinders and their orientation with respect to the free stream are the main factors related to the complicated fluid structure interaction between cylinders zdravkovich 2003a 2003b most previous research investigated fio of multiple cylinders is in the form of two smooth cylinders in tandem in some cases the cylinders were fixed in low reynolds number borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 fio of two cylinders with surface roughness ptc for high reynolds number has been studied by the mrelab experimentally kim et al 2016 and numerically ding et al 2013 2015 sun et al 2016 systematically studied two tandem cylinders in fio for the hydrodynamic energy harnessing which found that two cylinders harness power is between 2 56 and 13 49 times and the power of a single cylinder the efficiency of two cylinders is between 2 0 and 6 68 of a single cylinder this result calls for further investigation into the fio problem and the synergy of tandem ptc cylinders the objective of this paper is to investigate numerically with experimental validation the interactive fio of two rough cylinders in tandem tests and simulations are conducted in the range of 30 000 re 120 000 which falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime trsl stands for transition in shear layer and 3 indicates the third region where the shear layer is fully turbulent resulting in stronger vortices shorter formation length and high lift zdravkovich 2003a simulations are performed by solving the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model the cfd codes were initially developed by wu et al 2014 based on openfoam in previous work the numerical results can predict the experimentally measured data well wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 2 physical model in the current experimental facility an embedded second generation virtual damper spring vck system has been introduced to replace the physical dampers and springs of the oscillator sun et al 2015 2016 the vck system provides the damper and spring stiffness forces through a controller based on the displacement and velocity measurements thus both the functional form and numerical value of stiffness and damping are simulated mathematically correctly by the vck system the hydrodynamic force exerted on the cylinder due to the relative flow is not included in the closed control loop and thus no bias is introduced sun et al 2015 a simple schematic of two elastically mounted circular cylinders and vck systems is depicted in fig 1 a the components of each oscillator are a a rigid circular cylinder of diameter d and length l b a virtual linear spring of stiffness k and c a virtual damping c coefficient in a linear viscous damping model two cylinders placed in tandem are constrained to oscillate in the y direction which is perpendicular to their axes and the flow velocity u in the x direction a picture of two single cylinder oscillators mounted on the ltfsw low turbulence free surface water channel is shown in fig 1 b each cylinder is mounted on a rail system allowing adjustment of the longitudinal spacing d d between the two cylinders the center to center spacing d between the two cylinders is set at 2 0d or 2 57d where the region is traditionally regarded as proximity and wake interference zdravkovich 1987 and the amplitudes of each cylinder are mutually affected sun et al 2017 the system parameters in the 2 d numerical simulation are the same as those used in the corresponding experiments as listed in table 1 high damping is selected for energy harnessing to enhance fio of cylinders and increase the efficiency and power density in harvesting marine hydrodynamic energy distributed roughness in the form of roughness strips was introduced and extensively studied in the mrelab experimentally chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 the distributed roughness was termed passive turbulence control ptc resulted in a valuable tool the fio to ptc map developed by park et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 a pair of straight roughness strips is attached running along the entire length of the cylinder parallel to the cylinder axis according to the fio to ptc map park et al 2013 the location of the roughness strips determines the response fio of the cylinder the placement angle α ptc is measured in degrees from the forward stagnation point in the corresponding ideal flow to the upstream edge of the roughness strip based on the results of previous studies chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 on ptc the strips with commercial roughness designation p60 and width of 12 7 mm which covers 16 on each side of the 88 9 mm diameter cylinder have been used in this study the placement angle has been set at α ptc 20 the total thickness of the ptc is on the order of the boundary layer thickness table 2 shows the details of the roughness strips used in the present study all the experiments were conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan the ltfsw channel recirculates 37 85 m3 37 850 lt of fresh water at speed up to 1 4 m s using an impeller powered by a 15 kw induction motor the test section is 2 44m long 1 0m wide 1 17m deep and is made of transparent plexiglass which enables visualization of the flow past cylinders using two 5 w argon lasers and aluminum oxide particles of 100 μm 3 numerical model 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model the full flow field around the oscillating cylinders is investigated by solving the two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2d urans equations with the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 a dedicated cfd code was developed in the mrelab based on open source code openfoam for performing flow and body simulation openfoam is composed of c libraries solving continuum mechanics problems with a finite volume discretization method the developed code has two additional features a the dynamics of the multiple oscillators and b dynamic adjustment of the grid near a cylinder as it approaches a boundary ding et al 2015 the 2d urans governing equations are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j 2 ν s j i u j u i where x i represents the cartesian coordinate u i represents the corresponding mean flow velocity components ν represents the molecular kinematic viscosity and s ij represents the mean strain rate tensor 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the quantity τ i j u i u j represents the reynolds stress tensor which is symmetric in the spalart allmaras turbulence model a common method employs the boussinesq approximation to relate the reynolds stress to the mean velocity gradient as 4 τ i j 2 ν t s i j where ν t represents the kinematic eddy viscosity the original spalart allmaras model is employed to solve a transport equation for the kinematic eddy viscosity this model is different from other one equation models and algebraic models in the sense that it is a local model which means the equation in one location does not depend on the solutions at other points therefore it is compatible with grids of any structure this model has been shown to give acceptable results for a wide variety of situations and is known for its stability wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 2015 2016 in the spalart allmaras model the turbulent eddy viscosity is defined as ν t ν f ν 1 f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 χ ν ν where ν represents an intermediate working variable of the turbulence model and obeys the following transport equation 5 ν t u j ν x j c b 1 1 f t 2 s ν c w 1 f w c b 1 κ 2 f t 2 ν d 2 1 σ x j ν ν ν x j c b 2 ν x i ν x i f t 1 δ u 2 additional definitions of functions and constants are given by spalart and allmaras 1992 in the present work the trip terms f t 1 and f t 2 are turned off and the trip less initial condition for ν travin et al 2000 which was successfully employed in earlier work wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 is used in order to introduce the cylinder dynamics in fio the mass damper spring oscillator is modelled by a second order linear differential equation the one degree of freedom equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m y c y k y f f l u i d y where f f l u i d y is the total fluid force acting on the cylinder in the y direction m is the total inertial mass of the vck system c is the total damping which includes the structural damping c structure and the harnessing damping c harness the solution to eq 6 can be attained by the following system of two first order differential equations 7 m u f f l u i d y c y k y 8 y u where u is the velocity of the cylinder in the y direction a compounded implicit explicit method is employed to solve the equation of motion together with the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for velocity u and displacement y of the cylinder superscript n represents values at the current time step and n 1 for the new time step then 9 u n u n 1 u n δ t 10 u n 1 u n δ t f f l u i d y c y k y m 11 y n 1 y n δ t u n 1 the divergence gradient and laplacian terms in the governing equations are solved through a second order gauss integration scheme with a linear interpolation for the face centered value of the unknown the time integration is performed by the second order backward euler method therefore second order accuracy is ensured by the numerical discretization scheme in space and time momentum and continuity equations are performed together in a segregated way through a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm 3 2 computational domain and grid generation the overall computational domain is 52 57d 13 2d for the two ptc cylinders as shown in fig 3 five boundaries inflow top two cylinder walls bottom and outflow are set in the overall domain the initial positions or the equilibrium positions of the cylinders are located at the center of the vertical direction of the domain the separation between the inlet boundary and the upstream cylinder center l up is set at 25d the separation between the downstream cylinder center and the outlet boundary it also set to be 25d a uniform and constant velocity is specified at the inflow boundary with a zero gradient pressure and a fixed ν a zero gradient condition is set for velocity pressure and ν at the outflow boundary a wall boundary is defined at the bottom to match the experimental conditions the top boundary condition the free surface is defined as a wall boundary to simplify the numerical simulations in the experiments the safety stops are placed on both sides of the mean position at a distance of around 2 8 times the diameter in the cases where the cylinder reaches the maximum displacement in the experiment there is still some distance between the free surface and the cylinder experiments from bernitsas et al 2007 and raghavan et al 2007 have shown that the effect of free surface or bottom boundary is very small at a distance of 3 diameters from the boundary therefore the interaction between the free surface and the cylinders in fio was not considered in the present numerical study ding et al 2013 2015 2016 in the simulations moving wall boundaries are specified for the two cylinders in fio the ptc is set as part of the cylinder surface and treated as wall boundary in order to simulate the effect of surface roughness a wall function type boundary condition is specified for ν t and ν wu et al 2014 moreover the trip less initial condition wu et al 2014 travin et al 2000 is utilized for the eddy viscosity ν this approach was proposed by shur et al 1996 to simulate subcritical regime cylinder flow without a user specified location for transition on the body the trip less initial conditions divide the fluid domain into two regions with different initial values for eddy viscosity a a zero value is applied from the inlet to the center of the upstream cylinder and b a nonzero value is applied to the rest of the flow domain in this study the nonzero value is set at the same level as the molecular eddy viscosity which was successfully employed in our previous one cylinder simulation work ding et al 2016 wu et al 2014 two dimensional structured computational grids were implemented for all numerical simulation cases when the cylinders are in fio the dynamic mesh motion adjustment is processed through the topological mesh change technique combined with general grid interfaces beaudoin and jasak 2008 in earlier work the application of the dynamic mesh technique was used successfully in simulating two cylinders and multiple cylinders in flow induced oscillation at the mrelab ding et al 2013 there is a 2d 2d square computational sub domain in the vicinity of each cylinder where the grid density for the near wall region is enhanced to increase the resolution in the boundary layer the 2d 2d square sub domain can move up and down together with the cylinder in fio therefore there is no mesh change around the cylinder keeping the near wall distance conserved during re meshing the top or bottom moving cell layer of each square can be removed when the mesh is compressed and added when the mesh is expanded the height of moving layer h is shrunk or elongated once h h minimum the moving layer is collapsed on the contrary when h h maxmimum a new cell layer is generated here the h minimum and h maxmimum are set based on the overall quality of the computational grid they are closely related to the minimum grid space of the mesh in the present work h minimum 0 002 m and h maxmimum 0 005 m therefore the mesh is kept in good quality with little deformation when the two cylinders undergo large amplitude fio due to the utilization of the wall function for the surface roughness model the values of y produced by the selected near wall grid spacing were between 10 and 30 depending on the reynolds number in order to determine the overall grid resolution to achieve a convergent and accurate solution in reasonable computational time a grid sensitivity study was conducted in earlier works wu et al 2014 ding et al 2013 three different selected grid densities produced similar results on drag coefficient lift coefficient and strouhal number thus the grid resolution in the present work was set at 240 35 circumferential radial accordingly a close up of the grid about 138 208 cells for the case of two ptc cylinders is shown in fig 4 fig 5 shows the grid when the cylinders are in fio 4 mathematical model for harnessed power in this section the mathematical model in eq 6 for the oscillator is used to calculate the harnessed and dissipated power of the two rough cylinder vivace converter the left hand side of eq 6 is integrated after multiplying it by the instantaneous velocity and then is averaged over the cycle period the final expression for the hydrokinetic power converted to kinematic in the vivace converter can be derived as bernitsas 2016 12 p h a r n e s s 8 π 3 m ζ h a r n e s s f n w a t e r a 2 f o s c 2 where a is the amplitude of the oscillating cylinder f osc is the frequency of the oscillating cylinder a and f osc are extracted from the displacement history curve of the oscillating cylinder and m represents the oscillating system mass the damping ratio ζ h a r n e s s and the natural frequency f n water in still water are defined as follows 13 ζ h a r n e s s c h a r n e s s 2 m k 14 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k m m a 1 2 π k m c a m d where c harness represents the harness damping and k represents the spring stiffness m d is the displaced fluid mass which is the volume of the fluid displaced by the oscillating cylinder only further m a is the inviscid added mass m a c a m d and c a is the added mass coefficient c a 1 the value of c a is a controversial issue and thus the approach selected in this paper requires a short discussion there are two approaches to modeling of the added mass a the first older approach separates the ideal added mass from the hydrodynamic forces on the right hand side of eq 6 then the frequency of oscillation changes exhibiting the lock in behavior where the vortex shedding frequency locks onto the frequency of cylinder oscillation b the second newer approach keeps the added mass force as part of the total hydrodynamic force and when it is measured experimentally and numerically it is indeed a variable it is renamed as hydrodynamic effective mass changing from 4 50 to 0 95 and is not related to the mechanical effective mass used in eq 7 the hydrodynamic effective mass makes the frequency of cylinder oscillation stay close to the natural frequency of the cylinder in water per vikestad et al 2000 some researchers conclude that viv lock in can be interpreted as a simple resonance phenomenon with variable c a or hydrodynamic effective mass actually the frequency of oscillation stays close to the natural frequency in water decreasing slowly to a ratio of about 0 9 as the measured effective mass changes from 4 50 to 0 95 however a the negative values of the hydrodynamic effective mass and b the fact that not all characteristics of linear resonance observed show that there are advantages and disadvantages with both approaches it is the authors opinion that both methods are based on simplistic models incapable of capturing the flow complexities and wake structures observed thus as long as the approach followed is stated at the beginning of all calculations and data presentation there should be no problem in interpreting or reproducing data in our approach we maintain the added mass term on the right hand side of eq 6 but we plot data using the constant theoretical value c a 1 the power in the fluid is calculated based on the area swept by the cylinders 15 p f l u i d w 1 2 ρ u 3 2 a max d l where a max is the largest amplitude among all cylinders in a multiple cylinder vivace converter obviously the input power depends on the cylinders response unlike wind turbines or ocean current turbines with fixed geometry where the flow area is determined by the blade swept area the betz limit is the theoretical maximum power that can be harnessed by a wind turbine from an open flow and is equal to 59 26 16 27 commercial scale wind turbines achieve peak efficiency of 75 80 of the betz limit according to the betz limit in this paper the harnessed power conversion efficiency is defined as 16 η h a r n e s s p h a r n e s s p f l u i d b e t z l i m i t 100 5 amplitude response fig 6 shows the variation of amplitude response of the two cylinders with respect to reynolds number re free stream velocity u and reduced velocity u which are all proportional within the test range of experiments and simulations four regions were distinctly observed which are the initial branch 45 000 re 60 000 upper branch 60 000 re 80 000 transition region from viv to galloping 80 000 re 90 000 and galloping 90 000 re upstream cylinder the experimental data show that in the viv region the amplitude response is not significantly influenced by the center to center spacing between the two rough cylinders in the transition and galloping regions however the amplitude for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 an explanation of the interaction is provided in section 7 the numerical results agree well with experimental data in the viv region fig 6 a in the galloping region the numerical results are lagging the experimental data in terms of re u u several effects may contribute to this discrepancy a the ptc effect in numerical simulation is not as prominent as in experiments chang et al 2011 which leads to the ptc being unable to trigger fio of the cylinders into galloping as early as the experiments b the flow distortion due to the support frames of the cylinders in the channel reducing the uniformity of the flow across the cylinders c the effect of the blockage fig 1 b even though limited adds an error to the experiments bernitsas 2016 d in spite of the ptc presence which forces flow separation and consequently minimizes three dimensional effects raghavan and bernitsas 2008 chang et al 2011 park et al 2013 some three dimensionality in the flow is expected in fio the cfd simulations performed are two dimensional e tip effects may be significant even though ptc reduces them kinaci et al 2016 nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend downstream cylinder the experimental data show that the motion of the downstream cylinder is suppressed in the viv region and the transition region for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the suppression is more severely than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 the numerical results show a similar trend with the experimental data 6 frequency response the numerical frequency for each case and for each cylinder is calculated using fast fourier transform fft the frequency ratio f f osc f n vac of each cylinder is plotted versus re u u in fig 7 the frequency ratio f f osc f n vac of each cylinder is non dimensionalized by the corresponding system natural frequency in vacuum f n vac 1 2 π m k m is the oscillating mass k is the spring stiffness the numerical frequency results are verified by the experimental data within test range 45 000 re 75 000 corresponding to the initial and upper branches the experimental frequency ratio of the two cylinders for both spacing distances increases slowly from 0 70 to 0 85 the numerical results follow well with the experimental data except for re 70 000 for the downstream cylinder with spacing ratio d d 2 0 as shown in fig 7 c the reason is that at re 70 000 and re 80 000 there are two main frequencies due to the interaction between the two cylinders the bigger frequency is equal to the frequency of oscillation and wake frequency of the upstream cylinder the lower one is equal to the vortex shedding frequency of the downstream cylinder in simulation the latter frequency is the dominant component and selected by the code for plotting as shown in fig 7 d for spacing ratio d d 2 57 the phenomenon of two dominant frequencies is not prominent for 45 000 re 90 000 corresponding to the end of the upper branch and transition region from viv to galloping the experimental data show that the frequency ratios of the two cylinders for both spacing ratios decrease gradually from 0 85 to 0 75 the numerical results show that the frequency ratio is constant around 0 9 the discrepancy may be attributed to variation of the added mass due to three dimensional effects from vortex shedding or tip flow when a cylinder is in oscillations or turbulence model however the detailed reasons should be investigated further in future for re 90 000 corresponding to the galloping region the experimental and numerical results both show that the frequency ratio is about constant in the galloping region 7 interactive flow in tandem cylinders to interpret the phenomena observed in amplitude response and frequency response the detailed flow features of fio are discussed in this section as well as the interaction hydrodynamic mechanisms that drive the cylinders in viv or galloping 7 1 interactions in the viv region at re 60 000 as shown in fig 8 the displacement histories and lift coefficients illustrate that the amplitude ratio of the upstream cylinder for both spacing values is about 0 6 and the motion of the downstream cylinder is suppressed this is caused by the shielding effect due to the presence of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the phase difference between the two cylinders is higher than d d 2 57 the mechanism is presented following the vortex structure analysis in fig 8 comparing the displacement history and the lift force coefficient for each cylinder in fig 8 we observe that lift leads displacement by about 10 typically in the tandem cylinders vortex shedding leads the induced lift force and the lift force leads the displacement for both spacing values in viv at re 60 000 the 2 s two single shedding vortices per cycle vortex structure can be clearly observed in the wake of the upstream cylinder two vortices shed from the upstream cylinder per oscillation cycle the clockwise vortex from the top shear layer and the counter clockwise one from the bottom shear layer as the clockwise vortex sheds from the top the upstream cylinder is subjected to the minimum lift t 5 70s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 70s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 similarly as the counterclockwise vortex sheds from the bottom the upstream cylinder is subjected to the maximum lift t 6 10s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 60s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 as the vortices from the upstream cylinder move downstream and reach into the vicinity of the downstream cylinder the vortices do not impinge on the oscillation of the downstream cylinder but reattach with the shear layer of the downstream cylinder the clockwise rotating vortex passes above the downstream cylinder and the counter clockwise vortex passes below it because of the low amplitude of the upstream cylinder the vortices from the upstream cylinder pass the downstream cylinder closely and take away the same rotational vortices from the downstream cylinder resulting in cancelation of the vortex formation behind the downstream cylinder and depriving it of circulation and its lift furthermore as the clockwise vortex from the upstream cylinder passes and re attaches to the downstream cylinder the downstream cylinder may be pushed to approach the opposite vortex and attain minimum lift t 5 50s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 90s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 similarly the counter clockwise vortex performs with the similar mechanism t 5 90s for spacing ratio d d 2 0 t 5 50s for spacing ratio d d 2 57 therefore the motion of the downstream cylinder is induced by the vortices from the upstream cylinder however the spacing ratio between the two cylinders is different and the vortices take different time to reach the downstream cylinder in d d 2 01 and 2 57 thus resulting in the wake induced vibration of the downstream cylinder to have different phase and amplitude 7 2 interactions in the galloping region at re 110 000 the displacement histories in fig 9 show that the amplitude ratio of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is in the range 0 9 a d 1 1 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 it is only about 0 7 the amplitudes of the downstream cylinder for both spacing values are almost the same as the upstream cylinder that is for d d 2 0 the amplitude of both cylinders is in a given range for d d 2 57 the amplitudes are nearly constant at a d 0 7 this observation indicates that variable spacing leads to particular interaction this will be presented in the following vortex structure analysis based on fig 9 compared to the nearly single frequency displacement histories the lift coefficients of the two cylinders exhibit more frequencies for both spacing ratios each crest or trough exhibits a saddle moreover the saddle shape of the downstream cylinder is more obvious than the upstream cylinder for both spacing ratios and the saddle for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more pronounced than spacing ratio d d 2 57 which indicates that the upstream cylinder for d d 2 0 is affected by the presence of the downstream cylinder according to the force curves these can be explained by the vortex structures in the same figure for spacing ratio d d 2 0 in galloping at re 110 000 the 2p two pairs of vortices per cycle vortex shedding structure can be clearly observed in the wake of the upstream cylinder two pairs of vortices are shed from the upstream cylinder per cycle one pair by the top of the shear layer a1 and a2 at t 11 1s and another pair by the bottom shear layer a3 and a4 at t 11 4s the two vortices of each pair do not shed at the same time the outside vortex a1 sheds at t 11 1s or a4 sheds at t 11 4s before the inside vortex a2 at t 11 1s or a3 at t 11 4s as the outside vortex a1 sheds at t 11 1s from the upstream cylinder the lift exerted on the upstream cylinder is affected and appears as a fluctuation then the outside vortex a1 merges with the outside vortex b3 from the downstream cylinder with the outside vortex a1 shedding at t 11 10s the inside vortex a2 impinges on the downstream cylinder then sheds from the back of the upstream cylinder meanwhile the upstream cylinder reaches its highest absolute lift for the downstream cylinder with spacing ratio d d 2 0 in galloping at re 110 000 however the vortex structure of the downstream cylinder is severely impacted by the wake from the upstream cylinder and the 2p vortex model can also be observed one pair is b1 and b2 at t 11 10s the other pair is b3 and b4 at t 11 40s the outside vortex b3 of the downstream cylinder is merged by the outside vortex a1 of the upstream cylinder at t 11 2s then the merged vortices shed as one at t 11 4s the other vortex b4 of this pair sheds at t 11 5s the lift coefficient of the downstream cylinder also has a bump at each crest or trough which is also induced by the non simultaneous shedding of the two vortices in one pair for spacing ratio d d 2 57 in galloping at re 110 000 the downstream cylinder is completely immersed in the wake of the upstream cylinder vortex c1 of the upstream cylinder links with vortex d1 of the downstream cylinder at t 8 50s also for c3 and d3 at t 8 80s the two cylinders both have a quasi 2p vortex structure quasi 2p means that two pairs of vortices shed per cycle but in each pair one vortex is weaker than the other for the upstream cylinder vortex c1 and vortex c2 at t 8 70s or c3 and c4 at t 9 00s are one pair and vortex c2 is much weaker than vortex c1 for the downstream cylinder vortex d1 and vortex d2 at t 8 60s or d3 and d4 at t 8 90s are one pair and vortex d2 is much weaker than vortex d1 then the weaker vortex disappears quickly like vortex c2 at t 8 80s or vortex d2 at t 8 70s as aforementioned the amplitude of the upstream cylinder for the spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 the reason is that the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 can independently shed vortices in most cases however for spacing ratio d d 2 57 all the vortices of the upstream cylinder merge with the vortices of the downstream cylinder and some circulation vorticity is taken away from the downstream cylinder reducing its lift 8 harnessed power the power that can be harnessed by a two ptc cylinder vivace converter is extracted by the added harnessing damping a high damping ratio of ζ 2 6 table 1 was selected as a balance between extracting significant power and suppressing cylinder motion sun et al 2017 based on the experimental and numerical results of amplitude and frequency responses the harnessed power p harness by the upstream cylinder and the downstream cylinder are calculated using the mathematical model in section 4 experimental and numerical results for the harnessed power are plotted versus re u u in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a the harnessed power for the upstream cylinder starts from a low flow velocity 0 45 m s and extends to the limit flow rate of the channel in the initial branch and upper branch 45 000 re 80 000 the harnessed power increases steadily without being affected by the spacing ratio the numerical results agree well with the experimental data in the galloping region re 90 000 the harnessed power of the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 the numerical results follow the same trend as shown in fig 10 b in test range 45 000 re 120 000 the harnessed power of the downstream cylinder for both spacing ratios generally is considerable lower than the upstream cylinder this is evidently accompanied with the suppression of the downstream cylinder motion in the initial branch and upper branch the numerical results agree well with the experimental results in the beginning of the galloping region the experimental results show a power jump and drop where the harnessed power increases suddenly then decreases suddenly numerical results also show this phenomenon however the increase and decrease lag the experimental data in terms of u in the entire galloping region the numerically predicted harnessed power is higher than the one based on experimental data fig 10 c depicts the power harnessed by the two rough cylinders the trend is dictated by the upstream cylinder in initial and upper viv branches the harnessed power increases steadily for both spacing ratios with little difference the numerical results agree well with the experimental data at the beginning of galloping the harnessed power by the two cylinders together also shows a jump and drop which is induced by the downstream cylinder in the fully developed galloping region the two cylinder harnessed power for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 this phenomenon as in the case of amplitude response was explained in the interaction section 7 2 9 efficiency of harnessed power the harnessed power conversion efficiency calculated by eq 16 is plotted in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 a the harnessed power conversion efficiency for the upstream cylinder can reach 50 at about re 60 000 at the beginning of the upper branch as the upstream cylinder transitions from the viv initial branch to the viv upper branch the amplitude and frequency both increase greatly in the viv region the harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is close to that for spacing ratio d d 2 57 however in the galloping region the upstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more efficient in power harnessing than spacing ratio d d 2 57 numerical and experimental data agree well in the viv region in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data in general the tendency is predicted properly by the cfd calculations this is explained as the inability of the 2 d simulations to properly model the tip flow effect which limits the flow uniformity in experiments for the downstream cylinder as shown in fig 11 b the highest harnessed power conversion efficiencies for both spacing distances appear at the beginning of the initial branch the efficiency only reaches 21 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 14 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the harnessed power conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder is much lower than the upstream cylinder this is due to the motion suppression for the downstream cylinder in the viv region the numerical results follow closely with the experimental data in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data like the amplitude response section and harnessed power section again this is due to the 3 d tip flow effect in experiments which is not modeled in 2 d urans cfd in fig 11 c the harnessed power conversion efficiency of the two rough cylinders together is depicted the trend of the total harnessed power conversion efficiency is higher for the upstream cylinder at about re 60 000 the harnessed power conversion efficiency reaches 63 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 54 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 at the beginning of the upper branch in the viv region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 57 is higher than spacing ratio d d 2 0 however in the galloping region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is little higher than spacing ratio d d 2 57 in the viv region the numerical results follow closely the experimental data in the galloping region the numerical results are higher than the experimental data like the amplitude response section and harnessed power section the general tendency is predicted properly by numerical simulations again this is due to the 3 d tip flow effect in experiments which is not modeled in 2 d urans cfd 10 conclusions conversion of hydrokinetic power by two rough rigid cylinders in tandem in fio was investigated using two dimensional u rans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with the spalart allmaras turbulence model at high reynolds numbers 30 000 re 120 000 the numerical simulations were verified by experimental measurements performed in the ltfsw channel of the mrelab of the university of michigan the center to center spacing ratio d d of the two cylinders in tandem was set at 2 0 or 2 57 with mass ratio m 1 343 ζ 0 26 and k 1 200n m the results including amplitude response frequency response cylinder interaction energy harvesting and conversion efficiency were analyzed enhancement of both the harnessed power and efficiency are revealed by numerical simulation the main conclusions drawn are the following 1 the numerical amplitude ratio results are in excellent agreement with experimental data in the initial branch and upper branch of viv in the galloping region the numerical results are lagging behind the experimental data due to several differences between experiments and simulations nevertheless experimental and cfd results exhibit the same phenomena and trend 2 the numerical frequency response agrees well with experimental data for spacing d d 2 0 at re 70 000 and re 80 000 there are two main frequencies due to the interaction between the two cylinders in simulations 3 in the viv region at re 60 000 the amplitude response frequency response harnessed power and energy efficiency of the upstream cylinder are not affected by the spacing due to the timing vortices shed by the first cylinder impinge on the second cylinder the motion of the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is more strongly suppressed than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 which causes reduction in the harnessed power and conversion efficiency for the downstream cylinder 4 in the galloping region at re 110 000 due to the different impingement timing of vortices shed by the upstream cylinder on the downstream cylinder for spacing ratio d d 2 0 the upstream cylinder produces more harnessed power and higher energy conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 than for d d 2 57 5 power can be harnessed by the two cylinder vivace converter starting from a low flow velocity 0 45 m s and spanning over a broad range of velocity 6 in the fully developed galloping region the two cylinder harnessed power for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is higher than that for spacing ratio d d 2 57 7 the harnessed power conversion efficiency optimum appears at the beginning of the upper branch the highest efficiency can reach up to 63 for spacing ratio d d 2 57 and 54 for spacing ratio d d 2 0 in the galloping region the combined harnessed power conversion efficiency for spacing ratio d d 2 0 is a little higher than for spacing ratio d d 2 57 8 the major contribution of cfd in investigating and understanding the complexity of fio of two cylinders in tandem is that once the code has been validated against experimental results it enables vortex structure animation this is very helpful in understanding the differences of interactive fio mechanisms between the two cylinders for different spacing ratios acknowledgments the following support is gratefully acknowledged a cooperative

important topic in maritime transportation wood chip carrier wcc is a kind of ship designed for carrying wood chips paper for the wcc it needs huge cargo but smaller displacement since the wood chips paper is comparatively light material almost all the wcc have shallow draft and many equipment on its deck usually wcc are equipped with cranes hoppers and belt conveyors for enabling efficient unloading of wood chip paper they also have large frontal projected area surfaces above water surface therefore research on improving economic efficiency for the wcc as well as reduced wind drag

that wind drag acting on the hull and the accommodation of the ship can be reduced by interaction effects measurement of wind drag acting on the ship has been carried out in a towing tank of osaka prefecture university opu the obtained results showed that the new hull and accommodation can reduce the total wind drag from 2 to 15 the data are in a good agreement with the obtained modeling results in our others papers k mizutani et al 2014 and n v he et al 2016 the effects of cargo handling equipment and interaction effects between accommodation and hull on wind resistance acting on ships by using both cfd simulation and experiment in towing tank the studies concluded that total wind drag of ship can be reduced by 10 by reduced effects of cargo handling equipment and it can reduce up to 60 of total wind drag acting on the ship due to wind direction by reduced interaction effect between hull and accommodation the modeling results were also in a good agreement with the

distribution around hull of the original ship in the three computed cases model 1 hull without crane hopper model 2 hull with hoppers model 3 hull with cranes hoppers in the figures the red region shows high pressure and blue region indicates low pressure it can be seen clearly the effect of cargo handling equipment on pressure distribution around and over the hull surface of the ship fig 7 shows the comparison between the cfd and the experimental data of ship with the different models model 1 hull without crane and hopper model 2 hull with hoppers model 3 hull with cranes and hoppers the curves show the coefficient of wind drag acting on the ship given by cfd the cd corresponding to wind attack angle the dots show the experimental data agreement between them is fairly good as can be seen in the figure in the computation the frontal projected area of the wcc is detailed in table 2 as follows 3 developed side guards for the wood chip carrier 3 1 designed side guards in this section a side guard has been designed to improve aerodynamic performance of the ship the side guard may be designed in many different configurations of different lengths and tilted angles however in this research the used side guards have a plate shape and tilted 450 which have been attached on the both side boards fig 8 shows the side guards attached on side boards of the original wcc 3 2 effect of side guards on aerodynamic performance the ship with the side guards on both side boards have been computed to investigate the aerodynamic performance and wind drag acting on hull figs 9 and 10 show the cfd results of dynamic pressure around hull of the ship with and without side guards at several cross sections the figure shows the computed results at wind direction of zero degree the results as shown in figs 9 and 10 show clearly different of pressure distribution around the hull with and without side guards on boards in the figures the blue region shows low dynamic pressure and high static pressure whereas the red region shows high dynamic pressure and low static pressure the high static pressure region appeared on hull surface of the ship will increase wind drag acting on the hull the effects of side guards on pressure distribution around the ship as shown will change the wind drag acting on hull of the ships figs 11 14 show some cfd results of pressure distribution around and over hull surface of the ship with and without side guards at wind direction of zero 20 40 and 60 respectively the results as shown in these figures show clearly difference of dynamic pressure distribution around the ship with and without side guards in the figures the low dynamic pressure region blue colour around hull of the ship has drastically reduced by the installed side guards the pressure over the frontal hull surface of the ship clearly reduced high pressure area red and yellow colours the results show clearly effect of the side guards on pressure distribution around hull of the ship there is a reason that affects on wind drag acting on the hull of the ship 3 3 effect of side guards on wind drag acting on hull wind drag acting on hull of the ship with and without side guards have been investigated by comparison the obtained results of wind drag acting on hull of the ships with and without side guards effects of side guards on wind drag acting on hull has been found fig 15 shows wind drag acting on the two ships with and without side guards detailed wind drag acting on the two ships are shown in table 3 fig 15 shows clearly reduction of wind drag acting on hull of the ship drastically reduction of wind drag by the developed side guards for the ship can be seen one can see that 24 reduction at wind direction of zero degree and 50 reduction at wind direction of 60 can be achieved for the ship with developed side guards table 3 these results of wind drag are in agreement with the results of pressure distribution as shown in figs 10 14 the results as shown indicate that side guards affect on wind drag acting on the ship it can be used to improve aerodynamic performance of the ship as well as to reduce wind drag in the calculation difference of the wind drag acting on the ship with and without side guard is defined as follows 3 δ c d c d h u l l w i t h s i d e g u a r d s c d h u l l w i t h o u t s i d e g u a r d c d h u l l w i t h o u t s i d e g u a r d x 100 in the results as shown in fig 14 and table 3 in all positions side guards lead to a reduction of wind drag except at 140 condition the reason for this exception can be found in the results of comparing pressure distribution over hull surface of the two ships shown in figs 16 and 17 the figures show clearly changing pressure distribution around the ship with and without side guards at wind direction of 140 in the results pressure distribution over aft hull surface of the ship with side guards has a lager high pressure region red and yellow colours and reduced lower pressure region blue colour than those of the original ship without side guards this result has made wind drag acting on the ship at wind attack angle of 140 changes differently from comparison with others wind attack angles as shown 4 conclusions the obtained results in this paper has shown that the proposed side guards can be used to reduce considerably wind drag acting on a wcc which results in fuel consumption in marine transportation the main conclusions are summarized below the effects of cargo handling equipment on wind drag acting on hull of the wcc has been investigated by using cfd and experiment at towing tank the obtained results have shown clearly the effect of cargo handling equipment on aerodynamic performance and wind drag acting on hull of the ship the developed side guards for the wood chip carrier affect on aerodynamic performance as well as wind drag acting on hull of the ship by attached side guards on deck the pressure distribution around hull is changing the separation region after accommodation and cargo handling equipment can be reduced the effects of side guards on wind drag acting on hull of the ship has been investigated using the proposed side guards up to 36 of the total wind drag at wind direction less than 40 and up to 50 of the total wind drag acting on hull at wind direction of 60 could be reduced

22657,under the effects of offshore platform drifting and current and wave forces risers exert a dynamic force on wellheads during drilling in deep water inducing a bending moment on a deep water subsea wellhead shallow casing sw sc system additionally the interaction between the casing string system and seabed soils below the mudline generates a force known as the foundation pressure these two forces particularly the mass force of the wellhead lead to system instability according to the hamilton principle combined with functional analysis the continuous virtual work done by the system mass force on the whole system during the deflection process is the major consideration because it increases the instability of the system therefore a dynamic differential equation was established followed by the finite element discretisation of the casing system then a dynamic equation was derived and matlab was used to solve this equation furthermore a dynamic performance simulation test of a shallow casing string was conducted by applying two types of seabed soils two layer soil and single layer soil homogeneous clay the displacement rotation angle bending moment and shear force of the sw sc system were calculated and compared keywords deep water subsea wellhead shallow casing experiment shallow soil vibration 1 introduction deep water oil and gas development is a future trend but presents engineering difficulties in the oil industry the interaction between the subsea wellhead shallow casing sw sc and loose soil has always been a research topic yan et al 2015 many scholars have studied various related aspects including the interaction between the riser and wellhead meng et al 2018 lei et al 2017 wang et al 2015 geological hazards wang et al 2018 skogdalen and vinnem 2012 the

during the drilling process yang et al 2013 however there is an absence of studies involving the dynamic analysis of a deep water subsea sw sc in weakening seabed soil and different soil layers previous studies focused on the stability of the deep water subsea wellhead shallow string the effects of the pipe size and the weight of the blowout preventer bop on the fatigue performance of the system were examined and methods for improving the fatigue resistance were proposed they revealed that previous studies failed to clearly identify the mechanism responsible for the interaction between the shallow casing and soil layers evans and mcgrail 2011 su et al 2012 the two key issues considered in the present study were as follows 1 the existing computational models do not consider the continuous virtual work performed by the sw scon the whole system during the deflection process 2 there is a lack of data on the dynamic performance of sw scs and few experimental studies have been conducted on the dynamic performance of the casing soil interaction previous studies have simply focused on the pile foundation mechanics related to the dynamics of the seabed soil few studies have been performed in accordance with the onsite conditions therefore a dynamic differential equation was established by considering the continuous virtual work done by the mass force to the system during the deflection according to the hamilton principle and functional analysis then finite element discretisation of the string system was performed followed by the derivation of the dynamic equation a matlab program was later developed to solve this equation an experiment involving the dynamic performance of a shallow casing string was performed in two types of seabed soil double layer soil and single layer soil homogeneous clay the displacement rotation angle bending moment and shear force of the sw sc were calculated and compared 2 modelling of dynamic performance of deep water sw sc this study focused on the conductor cement sheath outside the conductor casing cement sheath outside the casing where the upper part of the wellhead system is connected to the riser the riser is affected

mesh bag designed to be filled with simulated soil the top and bottom of the frame were rectangular steel plates used to support the weight of the soil layer and these two steel plates were welded to steel tubes the flexible model box is shown in fig 2 3 3 2 string model this experiment was designed to simulate the layer 50 m below the mudline a simple heavy weight made of steel was used to represent the massive wellhead and the volume was calculated using the similitude ratio 33 v g g ρ s 2000 10 3 9 8 7850 25 m 3 where g represents the wellhead device weight n g represents the gravitational acceleration n k g and ρ s represents the density of steel k g m 3 it was simplified to a cube that was 5 m long 5 m wide and 1 04 m high according to the length scale calculated by bockingham π theorem it can be set as 5 cm long 5 cm wide and 1 04 cm high the casing string model was designed as shown in fig 3 3 3 3 strain gauge and acceleration sensor the strain gauges and acceleration sensor were connected to the hy3811 static strain test system with the strain gauges distributed across the whole casing the acceleration sensor was a low frequency acceleration sensor produced by chengke electronics which was fixed to the wellhead and connected to the data collector at one end the acceleration value was shown on the data display 3 3 4 experimental model soil the model soil in this experiment was composed of clay and sand located at a drilling platform with a dry density of 2300 kg m3 the container was a cylinder with an inner diameter of 600 mm according to the calculated geometry scale of 0 01 the depth of each soil layer in the container was 100 mm the configuration ratio and configuration volume of each soil layer were calculated as shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively 3 4 measurement procedure ① keep the vibration table stable and apply a harmonic force to the wellhead at fixed intervals measure the accelerated velocity at the top of the casing and the strain values of 10 strain gauges and record the values ② change the soil layer property and wellhead quality measure the acceleration velocity at the top of the column and the strain values of 10 strain gauges and record the values ③ use the crane to place the shear model box on the vibration table and layer the two different soil layers into the box repeat test steps ①and ② and record the values ④ use the crane to place the shear model box on the vibration table and fill the box with the degraded soil repeat test steps ① and ② and record the values 4 experimental stability results for deep water sw sc 4 1 acceleration response the wellhead acceleration response was measured considering the simple harmonic force shown in figs 4 and 5 the dynamic forces affected the wellhead acceleration within its frequency and amplitude indicating that all of these forces including the tension sea current waves and floating effect of the platform i e drilling ship could not be ignored the properties of the soil layers had a minimal effect on the wellhead acceleration in contrast the wellhead acceleration was significantly affected by the wellhead quality therefore the influence of the mass force of the whole system had to be considered in the modelling fig 5 the property of seabed shallow layers changes with an increase in the water depth which enhances the underwater wellhead quality thus the stability of sw sc column should be considered 4 2 strain response analysis a total of 10 strain gauges were attached to the tube of the shallow casing when measuring the strain response as shown in fig 6 the values of these strain gauges were measured within 10 s and the maximum strain amplitude at each position was obtained via data processing under different conditions the casing strain values are shown in figs 7 and 8 considering the harmonic force at the wellhead there was no strain 20 m below the mudline when the harmonic force changed the strain in the wellhead reached the maximum value of π 90 and gradually decreased with an increase in depth the heterogeneity of the soil properties had a minimal impact on the wellhead acceleration fig 7 a large wellhead quality led to a large casing strain therefore the system quality should be considered in further studies fig 8 the casing strain was greater in the double layer soil than in the single layer soil fig 9 however the overall strain value did not exhibit a significant increase no casing junction should be placed at the same depth as a soil layer boundary during the casing string design process see fig 10 4 3 analysis of dynamic performance of deep water sw sc for the calculation example actual data corresponding to the experiment were adopted as shown in table 4 the soil was divided into upper and lower layers the upper layer was above the point 10 m below the mudline the calculation time step was 0 1 s and the depth interval of the system unit was 0 5 m 4 4 validation and comparison calculations of zero virtual work done by the wellhead mass force were consistent with simulation results obtained via other methods as shown in fig 11 guan et al 2009 li 2012 wang et al 2015 additionally the calculations of the virtual work were consistent with the experimental values of this study as shown in fig 12 demonstrating the validity of the simulation method when the wellhead mass force was not considered the results of the present simulation model were similar to those of other simulation models when the wellhead mass force was considered the proposed calculation method was in good agreement with the experimental data and was more accurate in the overall strain range along the string in particular the positions of weaknesses were close to each other this shows that the simulation method and the newmark β and newton downhill methods used by matlab in this study were feasible the results of previous studies were compared with the calculation of the virtual work at the same time as shown in figs 11 and 12 the strain change point of the model in this study was at a depth of 18 m whereas for other methods it was above the depth of 15 m thus the strain change point reported in this paper which considers the mass force of the wellhead is deeper than that in the other methods therefore to avoid the occurrence of engineering accidents the mass force which can do virtual work should be considered in the casing design a connection should not be located above the strain change point which would destroy the integrity of the wellbore 4 5 analysis of dynamic performance calculation results for deep water sw sc the analysis results for the dynamic performance the time step was 0 1 s with a total range of 10 s of the deep water sw sc were obtained by programming two different conditions those that considered or ignored the virtual work performed by the system quality force as shown in fig 13 the analysis results for the dynamic performance a total of 10 s of the double layer soil and single layer soil are shown in fig 14 1 lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the system when considering or ignoring the virtual work performed by the system quality force fig 12 shows that when the influence of the virtual work on the dynamic performance of the system was considered the overall displacement of the casing system was greater than the lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the virtual work without considering the system mass force when the system mass force was considered as performing virtual work the maximum lateral displacement of the system increased by 0 2 m the maximum angle increased by 0 8 the maximum bending moment increased by approximately 1000 kn m and the maximum shear force increased by approximately 100 kn therefore large quality values for the lower marine riser package bop christmas tree and wellhead significantly affected the stability of the sw sc these values should be fully considered in the analysis of the dynamic performance of the system additionally the best wellhead combination should be selected in the engineering design while ensuring the drilling time operation efficiency and safety to the greatest extent possible the weight of the wellhead system should be reduced as much as possible for ensuring drilling efficiency operation efficiency and safety 2 lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the double layer soil and single layer soil fig 13 indicates that the displacements of the single layer soil and double layer soil at the wellhead did not change significantly under a simple harmonic force within a certain time the undrained shear strength in the single layer soil was equal to that in the upper sandy soil with a strong degree of weakening compared with the bottom layer of the double layer soil the maximum lateral migration value 0 018 m in the single layer soil was slightly lower than that in the double layer soil 0 021 m the deflection angle 1 4 was slightly smaller than that in the double layer soil 1 5 the differences in the bending moment and shear force were not significant 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 discussion in this study the virtual work of the sw sc system mass was considered a comparison revealed that the strains obtained via calculations and experiments were larger than those of previous studies the main reasons for this are as follows 1 in the process of system vibration with the continuous migration of the wellhead the force of the system always exerts gravity in the vertical direction and the component along the direction of the gravity increases continuously thus the mass of the wellhead not only aggravates the rapid destruction of the weaknesses of the system but also increases the inclination of the sw sc system 2 with the continuous vibration of the system the gap between the subsea shallow soil layer and the casing expands rapidly at this time the lateral force of the risers and the effect of the wellhead force both accelerates the compression and weakens the subsea shallow layers and even the liquefaction of the subsea shallow layers occurs after a long period of vibration increasing the instability of the system in the process of offshore oil and gas exploration and development the system mass must also be considered the main reasons for this are as follows 1 with an increase in the water depth the effects of the current force and wave force on the riser become more obvious the drift of the drilling vessel becomes more frequent and there are more layers of casings in the offshore oil and gas oil to satisfy the complex environment and operating conditions a high quality sw sc system is needed 2 at present exploration and development are tending towards a high pressure a high temperature a high sulphur content and other complex conditions which require complex wellhead bop control equipment and high sw sc system quality therefore in the dynamic performance analysis of the system the influence of the mass force should be considered 5 2 conclusion 1 the dynamic theoretical model proposed in this paper is based on the hamiltonian principle and can be used to derive the kinetic energy equation potential energy equation and virtual work equation for each part of a sw sc system in deep water in the process of establishing the model the virtual work done by the system quality force is considered in the process of wellhead deflection compared with the experimental results and other simulations the accuracy of the calculation is higher when the virtual work is considered the system quality is mostly produced by the wellhead system and the weight of the wellhead system should be reduced to the greatest extent possible in the engineering design for ensuring the safety of the operation 2 an experiment on a deep water sw sc deflection was performed by employing the bockingham π theorem for the ratio similitude design additionally we designed a flexible shear model box to eliminate the reaction force of the soil box boundary and an experimental simulation model based on the actual size of a sw sc the experimental results revealed that the dynamic force of the wellhead significantly affected the wellhead acceleration and pipe strain considering the dynamic force of the wellhead the wellhead acceleration varied greatly under different values for the wellhead quality and the soil layer properties had minimal influence on its strain therefore the influence of the system mass on its dynamic performance should be considered in future models acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the national

22657,under the effects of offshore platform drifting and current and wave forces risers exert a dynamic force on wellheads during drilling in deep water inducing a bending moment on a deep water subsea wellhead shallow casing sw sc system additionally the interaction between the casing string system and seabed soils below the mudline generates a force known as the foundation pressure these two forces particularly the mass force of the wellhead lead to system instability according to the hamilton principle combined with functional analysis the continuous virtual work done by the system mass force on the whole system during the deflection process is the major consideration because it increases the instability of the system therefore a dynamic differential equation was established followed by the finite element discretisation of the casing system then a dynamic equation was derived and matlab was used to solve this equation furthermore a dynamic performance simulation test of a shallow casing string was conducted by applying two types of seabed soils two layer soil and single layer soil homogeneous clay the displacement rotation angle bending moment and shear force of the sw sc system were calculated and compared keywords deep water subsea wellhead shallow casing experiment shallow soil vibration 1 introduction deep water oil and gas development is a future trend but presents engineering difficulties in the oil industry the interaction between the subsea wellhead shallow casing sw sc and loose soil has always been a research topic yan et al 2015 many scholars have studied various related aspects including the interaction between the riser and wellhead meng et al 2018 lei et al 2017 wang et al 2015 geological hazards wang et al 2018 skogdalen and vinnem 2012 the interaction between saturated soil and the casing kan et al 2018 zakeri et al 2016a b the soil pressure of a shallow layer majidi et al 2017 deng et al 2017 and the tripping of the conductor casing during the drilling process yang et al 2013 however there is an absence of studies involving the dynamic analysis of a deep water subsea sw sc in weakening seabed soil and different soil layers previous studies focused on the stability of the deep water subsea wellhead shallow string the effects of the pipe size and the weight of the blowout preventer bop on the fatigue performance of the system were examined and methods for improving the fatigue resistance were proposed they revealed that previous studies failed to clearly identify the mechanism responsible for the interaction between the shallow casing and soil layers evans and mcgrail 2011 su et al 2012 the two key issues considered in the present study were as follows 1 the existing computational models do not consider the continuous virtual work performed by the sw scon the whole system during the deflection process 2 there is a lack of data on the dynamic performance of sw scs and few experimental studies have been conducted on the dynamic performance of the casing soil interaction previous studies have simply focused on the pile foundation mechanics related to the dynamics of the seabed soil few studies have been performed in accordance with the onsite conditions therefore a dynamic differential equation was established by considering the continuous virtual work done by the mass force to the system during the deflection according to the hamilton principle and functional analysis then finite element discretisation of the string system was performed followed by the derivation of the dynamic equation a matlab program was later developed to solve this equation an experiment involving the dynamic performance of a shallow casing string was performed in two types of seabed soil double layer soil and single layer soil homogeneous clay the displacement rotation angle bending moment and shear force of the sw sc were calculated and compared 2 modelling of dynamic performance of deep water sw sc this study focused on the conductor cement sheath outside the conductor casing cement sheath outside the casing where the upper part of the wellhead system is connected to the riser the riser is affected by the drift effect of the ocean drilling platform and the force induced by currents and waves which exert a dynamic force on the wellhead generating bending moments for the system the interaction force between the shallow casing and the seafloor soil is known as the counterforce of the foundation 2 1 dynamic performance model principle of deep water sw sc for a conservative system the lagrangian function i e the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy change is equal to zero the dynamic model of the deepwater sw sc is a non conservative system yang et al 2017 for a non conservative system the lagrangian function equals the virtual work done by the non conservative force thus the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy change over time and the non conservative

experimental results the soil layer in the model box was placed in a waterproof net bag which was configured into two or more layers on the basis of the soil properties the top and bottom of the model box were supported by a steel plate which allowed the weight of the soil layer to be applied to several supporting points this high quality model box could be transported by truck the force acting on the wellhead was tested using a simple harmonic motion arm 3 2 ratio similitude of experiment a dimensional analysis of the string was performed according to the bockingham π theorem wang et al 2014a

dimension matrix of each physical quantity are presented in table 1 3 3 production of experimental equipment 3 3 1 model box the main body of the flexible model was a frame which contained a rubber mesh bag designed to be filled with simulated soil the top and bottom of the frame were rectangular steel plates used to support the weight of the soil layer and these two steel plates were welded to steel tubes the flexible model box is shown in fig 2 3 3 2 string model this experiment was designed to simulate the layer 50 m below the mudline a simple heavy weight made of steel was used to represent the massive wellhead and the volume was calculated using the similitude ratio 33 v g g ρ s 2000 10 3 9 8 7850 25 m 3 where g represents the wellhead device weight n g represents the gravitational acceleration n k g and ρ s represents the density of steel k g m 3 it was simplified to a cube that was 5 m long 5 m wide and 1 04 m high according to the length scale calculated by bockingham π theorem it can be set as 5 cm long 5 cm wide and 1 04 cm high the casing string model was designed as shown in fig 3 3 3 3 strain gauge and acceleration sensor the strain gauges and acceleration sensor were connected to the hy3811 static strain test system with the strain gauges distributed across the whole casing the acceleration sensor was a low frequency acceleration sensor produced by chengke electronics which was fixed to the wellhead and connected to the data collector at one end the acceleration value was shown on the data display 3 3 4 experimental model soil the model soil in this experiment was composed of clay and sand located at a drilling platform with a dry density of 2300 kg m3 the container was a cylinder with an inner diameter of 600 mm according to the calculated geometry scale of 0 01 the depth of each soil layer in the container was 100 mm the configuration ratio and configuration volume of each soil layer were calculated as shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively 3 4 measurement procedure ① keep the vibration table stable and apply a harmonic force to the wellhead at fixed intervals measure the accelerated velocity at the top of the casing and the strain values of 10 strain gauges and record the values ② change the soil layer property and wellhead quality measure the acceleration velocity at the top of the column and the strain values of 10 strain gauges and record the values ③ use the crane to place the shear model box on the vibration table and layer the two different soil layers into the box repeat test steps ①and ② and record the values ④ use the crane to place the shear model box on the vibration table and fill the box with the degraded soil repeat test steps ① and ② and record the values 4 experimental stability results for deep water sw sc 4 1 acceleration response the wellhead acceleration response was measured considering the simple harmonic force shown in figs 4 and 5 the dynamic forces affected the wellhead acceleration within its frequency and amplitude indicating that all of these forces including the tension sea current waves and floating effect of the platform i e drilling ship could not be ignored the properties of the soil layers had a minimal effect on the wellhead acceleration in contrast the wellhead acceleration was significantly affected by the wellhead quality therefore the influence of the mass force of the whole system had to be considered in the modelling fig 5 the property of seabed shallow layers changes with an increase in the water depth which enhances the underwater wellhead quality thus the stability of sw sc column should be considered 4 2 strain response analysis a total of 10 strain gauges were attached to the tube of the shallow casing when measuring the strain response as shown in fig 6 the values of these strain gauges were measured within 10 s and the maximum strain amplitude at each position was obtained via data processing under different conditions the casing strain values are shown in figs 7 and 8 considering the harmonic force at the wellhead there was no strain 20 m below the mudline when the harmonic force changed the strain in the wellhead reached the maximum value of π 90 and gradually decreased with an increase in depth the heterogeneity of the soil properties had a minimal impact on the wellhead acceleration fig 7 a large wellhead quality led to a large casing strain therefore the system quality should be considered in further studies fig 8 the casing strain was greater in the double layer soil than in the single layer soil fig 9 however the overall strain value did not exhibit a significant increase no casing junction should be placed at the same depth as a soil layer boundary during the casing string design process see fig 10 4 3 analysis of dynamic performance of deep water sw sc for the calculation example actual data corresponding to the experiment were adopted as shown in table 4 the soil was divided into upper and lower layers the upper layer was above the point 10 m below the mudline the calculation time step was 0 1 s and the depth interval of the system unit was 0 5 m 4 4 validation and comparison calculations of zero virtual work done by the wellhead mass force were consistent with simulation results obtained via other methods as shown in fig 11 guan et al 2009 li 2012 wang et al 2015 additionally the calculations of the virtual work were consistent with the experimental values of this study as shown in fig 12 demonstrating the validity of the simulation method when the wellhead mass force was not considered the results of the present simulation model were similar to those of other simulation models when the wellhead mass force was considered the proposed calculation method was in good agreement with the experimental data and was more accurate in the overall strain range along the string in particular the positions of weaknesses were close to each other this shows that the simulation method and the newmark β and newton downhill methods used by matlab in this study were feasible the results of previous studies were compared with the calculation of the virtual work at the same time as shown in figs 11 and 12 the strain change point of the model in this study was at a depth of 18 m whereas for other methods it was above the depth of 15 m thus the strain change point reported in this paper which considers the mass force of the wellhead is deeper than that in the other methods therefore to avoid the occurrence of engineering accidents the mass force which can do virtual work should be considered in the casing design a connection should not be located above the strain change point which would destroy the integrity of the wellbore 4 5 analysis of dynamic performance calculation results for deep water sw sc the analysis results for the dynamic performance the time step was 0 1 s with a total range of 10 s of the deep water sw sc were obtained by programming two different conditions those that considered or ignored the virtual work performed by the system quality force as shown in fig 13 the analysis results for the dynamic performance a total of 10 s of the double layer soil and single layer soil are shown in fig 14 1 lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the system when considering or ignoring the virtual work performed by the system quality force fig 12 shows that when the influence of the virtual work on the dynamic performance of the system was considered the overall displacement of the casing system was greater than the lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the virtual work without considering the system mass force when the system mass force was considered as performing virtual work the maximum lateral displacement of the system increased by 0 2 m the maximum angle increased by 0 8 the maximum bending moment increased by approximately 1000 kn m and the maximum shear force increased by approximately 100 kn therefore large quality values for the lower marine riser package bop christmas tree and wellhead significantly affected the stability of the sw sc these values should be fully considered in the analysis of the dynamic performance of the system additionally the best wellhead combination should be selected in the engineering design while ensuring the drilling time operation efficiency and safety to the greatest extent possible the weight of the wellhead system should be reduced as much as possible for ensuring drilling efficiency operation efficiency and safety 2 lateral displacement deflection angle bending moment and shear force of the double layer soil and single layer soil fig 13 indicates that the displacements of the single layer soil and double layer soil at the wellhead did not change significantly under a simple harmonic force within a certain time the undrained shear strength in the single layer soil was equal to that in the upper sandy soil with a strong degree of weakening compared with the bottom layer of the double layer soil the maximum lateral migration value 0 018 m in the single layer soil was slightly lower than that in the double layer soil 0 021 m the deflection angle 1 4 was slightly smaller than that in the double layer soil 1 5 the differences in the bending moment and shear force were not significant 5 discussion and conclusion 5 1 discussion in this study the virtual work of the sw sc system mass was considered a comparison revealed that the strains obtained via calculations and experiments were larger than those of previous studies the main reasons for this are as follows 1 in the process of system vibration with the continuous migration of the wellhead the force of the system always exerts gravity in the vertical direction and the component along the direction of the gravity increases continuously thus the mass of the wellhead not only aggravates the rapid destruction of the weaknesses of the system but also increases the inclination of the sw sc system 2 with the continuous vibration of the system the gap between the subsea shallow soil layer and the casing expands rapidly at this time the lateral force of the risers and the effect of the wellhead force both accelerates the compression and weakens the subsea shallow layers and even the liquefaction of the subsea shallow layers occurs after a long period of vibration increasing the instability of the system in the process of offshore oil and gas exploration and development the system mass must also be considered the main reasons for this are as follows 1 with an increase in the water depth the effects of the current force and wave force on the riser become more obvious the drift of the drilling vessel becomes more frequent and there are more layers of casings in the offshore oil and gas oil to satisfy the complex environment and operating conditions a high quality sw sc system is needed 2 at present exploration and development are tending towards a high pressure a high temperature a high sulphur content and other complex conditions which require complex wellhead bop control equipment and high sw sc system quality therefore in the dynamic performance analysis of the system the influence of the mass force should be considered 5 2 conclusion 1 the dynamic theoretical model proposed in this paper is based on the hamiltonian principle and can be used to derive the kinetic energy equation potential energy equation and virtual work equation for each part of a sw sc system in deep water in the process of establishing the model the virtual work done by the system quality force is considered in the process of wellhead deflection compared with the experimental results and other simulations the accuracy of the calculation is higher when the virtual work is considered the system quality is mostly produced by the wellhead system and the weight of the wellhead system should be reduced to the greatest extent possible in the engineering design for ensuring the safety of the operation 2 an experiment on a deep water sw sc deflection was performed by employing the bockingham π theorem for the ratio similitude design additionally we designed a flexible shear model box to eliminate the reaction force of the soil box boundary and an experimental simulation model based on the actual size of a sw sc the experimental results revealed that the dynamic force of the wellhead significantly affected the wellhead acceleration and pipe strain considering the dynamic force of the wellhead the wellhead acceleration varied greatly under different values for the wellhead quality and the soil layer properties had minimal influence on its strain

22658,stressed by complex internal flows fish has a special locomotion feature different from the cruise in a jet fish pump based on the high speed photography and dynamic mesh technologies the present paper proposed a new numerical simulation methodology to study the impact of fish locomotion on the internal flow in a jet fish pump the results show that both single fish and fish shoal can cause wall static pressure peaks fish causes a rise of static pressure around its body and the pressure increment increases as primary flow rate grows fish shoal can result in a decrease of the measured value of mixed flow rate yet the locomotion of single fish shows no significant effect on it as the rise of axial velocity difference between internal flow and fish a low axial velocity region closed to fish body downstream expands fish locomotion has a significant effect on the recirculation region the recirculation region firstly breaks and then forms again when fish passes through

food source for human beings food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao highlighted that fisheries and aquaculture contributed significantly to food security and adequate nutrition in recent years fisheries and aquaculture have embraced their harvesting due to the wide application of sea cages summerfelt et al 2009 however traditional methods of fish transport by heavy lifting in a fish container are energy intensive and also result in great fish loss therefore fish pumps have been developed as an efficient substitute for transporting fish with less energy consumption and fewer fish loss grizzle et al 1992 based on the operating principle fish pumps are generally classified as impeller fish pumps pressure vacuum p v fish pumps and jet fish pumps jfps in live fish delivery the high speed rotating impellers of impeller fish pumps are specially designed to provide high fish flow rates but impeller fish pumps have high fish injury and mortality rates in fish transport the p v fish pumps treat the fish more gently by alternate vacuum and high pressure regions but they have a lower capacity due to the discontinuous operation during suction and discharge stages the jfps have simple structure and broad flow passage the primary flow goes into a suction chamber via an annular nozzle and creates a suction force on the secondary flow carrying the fish then the primary and secondary flow mixes in the throat and diffuser and is finally pumped out therefore compared with the other two types of fish pumps jfps have higher comprehensive properties giving consideration to transport capacity and mortality rate the preliminary research on jfps focused on the theoretical calculation and structural optimization huang et al 2007 the further study observed the locomotion characteristics of fish by a high speed camera in the jfp and analyzed the force on fish during the transport xiao et al 2015 based on this research long et al 2016 utilized both experimental and numerical simulation methods to classify injury types of fish in the jfp and discuss potential risks for fish injuries including flow direction changes flow recirculation shear flows and cavitation wu et al 2016 experimentally studied the changes in the serum indexes to obtain the stress response of grass carp after passing through the jfp then xu et al 2017 conducted a series of experiments to research the transport capacity of jfp and the diversities of physiological changes for different kinds of fish however current research mainly concerns with the health of fish by experiments such as injuries and blood index changes in jfps few research pay attention to the impact of fish locomotion on the internal flow in the jfp different from ordinary particles such as stones and fruits xu et al 2016 stressed fish have their own locomotion feature in the jfp xiao et al 2015 their locomotion can disturb the internal flow in the jfp and even induce unexpected flow phenomenon which probably results in extra injury risks for fish and decrease on the performance of jfps compared with the observation and measurement in the experiment computational fluid dynamics cfd method is more suitable for the research of fish locomotion in jfps by providing abundant flow details fish locomotion simulation research is a hot issue and various methods are proposed xia et al 2005 utilized dynamic mesh method to simulate an undulating advancing fish surrounded by the unsteady viscous flow field and the simulation showed that the frictional force was significantly reduced by undulating motion leroyer and visonneauã 2005 simulated a self propelled fish like body by regridding strategies and their simulation results illustrated that only the imposed deformation of the shape and its interaction with the fluid produce forces on the body and consequently motion chang et al 2007 proposed immersed boundary velocity correction method ibvcm to numerically study a flow past an undulating two dimensional fish like body combined with lattice boltzmann method lbm and they found the amplitude of midline oscillation is the most noticeable factor among the parameters affecting the generation of propulsion force shao et al 2010 numerically studied the hydrodynamic performances of a fishlike undulating foil in the wake of a d section cylinder by a modified immersed boundary method and arrived at the conclusion that the phase angle difference between the heave and the undulation was important for thrust in the preliminary research fish body shapes are usually replaced by hydrofoils in the numerical simulation however the diversity of body shape among different kinds of fish was ignored moreover simulated fish body was always endowed with periodic motion yet stressed fish usually has a random locomotion to simulate the actual locomotion of fish garvin et al 2012 came up with a method for coupling the use of image analysis based techniques for determining fish body motion with the use of a cfd simulation based on the image processing technology this method can reflect the actual locomotion of fish nevertheless the fish in their simulation swam behind a d section cylinder in cruising condition and their head showed no displacement along flow direction xu et al 2017 found that the fish were all stressed and their locomotion was not in cruising condition in the jfp therefore traditional numerical methods are not suitable for the simulation of the internal flow disturbed by the locomotion of stressed fish in the jfp the greatest challenge is the special locomotion feature of stressed fish for the numerical simulation the locomotion of stressed fish can result in the change of the flow field shape in the jfp therefore the present study establishes a new methodology for simulating this flow field in the jfp based on dynamic mesh and image analysis based techniques the dynamic mesh technology is an important methodology to simulate the changing flow field caused by moving boundaries drake and manoranjan 1996 the mesh is deformed and even merges or splits to adjust to the change of boundaries park and kwon 2005 in present study the variation law of boundaries can be fitted based on image analysis based techniques according to this methodology the complex flow field can be obtained and it is helpful to understand the change of flow field status when fish passes through a jfp moreover it also can guide the structural optimization considering the characteristics of fish transport process this new methodology will lend itself nicely to future studies on fish behavior in the complex flow field of hydraulic as well as fishery machinery and even on moving objects in flow fields 2 experimental set up and cfd formulation 2 1 jet fish pump jfp is composed of a suction duct a primary duct an annular nozzle a suction chamber a throat and a diffuser as it is shown in fig 1 shimizu et al 1987 the operating principle can be simplified as follows the high velocity primary flow exits the annular nozzle at low pressure and entrains fluid from the secondary flow mixed with fish into the flow stream then these two flows exchange momentum and mix in the suction chamber and throat with the mixed flow then passing through the diffuser as the pressure increases elger et al 1994 according to previous studies long et al 2010 2012 lyu et al 2016 the main structural parameters in fig 1 were set as follows d d 125 mm d p 100 mm d s 80 mm d t 60 mm l d 500 mm and l t 180 mm the area ratio m is 1 75 m a t a j a t and a j are throat and annular nozzle cross sectional area respectively in order to observe the transport process the suction chamber throat and diffuser were made of transparent perspex material 2 2 test rig and device fig 2 shows a sketch of the experimental rig pumped by a centrifugal pump the high pressure primary flow entrains the secondary flow of the mixture of fish and water from a conical net tube then the mixed flow discharges to a recycling tank in order to avoid the injuries caused by valves the height of delivery pipe h was used to control the outlet pressure three pressure transducers were installed to record the static pressure p p p s and p c in the primary duct suction duct and outlet pipe respectively in addition another ten pressure transducers were installed along the pump to monitor the wall static pressure variation along a jfp meanwhile two sets of electro magnetic flowmeters were installed in the primary duct and outlet pipe respectively all the data was collected by a data acquisition system carassius auratus were chosen as the experimental object whose averaged mass length and width were 32 3g 102 1 mm and 31 5 mm respectively when jfp ran in designed conditions they were gently moved into the conical net tube and then were transferred into the recycling tank during this process a high speed camera photron fastcam sa5 photographed the locomotion of fish and the data acquisition system synchronously recorded the data of pressure and flow rate the frame rate of the high speed camera was 5000 fps frames per second and the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system was 5000 hz 2 3 cfd scheme and validation a 3d simulation model was established based on the actual size of the jfp in the experiment in order to keep the stability of the inflow and the full development of the downstream flow the length of primary and suction ducts were set as 10 times of d s and the length of outlet pipe was set as 20 times of d d the flow in the jfp was assumed as steady and incompressible flow which was modeled by the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the sst k ω turbulence model was used to model the turbulence considering the locomotion of fish unstructured grid was used in the simulation and the final mesh had 7 68 million elements after grid independence tests the origin of cartesian coordinate was set at the circle center of nozzle exit cross section the computational domain and local mesh are shown in fig 3 velocity inlets were used for the inlet boundary conditions while the outlet boundary condition was set as the pressure outlet the solid walls were treated as no slip walls with the standard wall function used in the near wall boundary the measured values in the experiment were used as the values of boundary conditions in the simulation flow ratio q pressure ratio h and efficiency η are usually used to evaluate the performance of jfps and they can be calculated as follows 1 q q s q p 2 h p c p s p p p c 3 η q s p c p s q p p p p c 100 q h 100 where q is volumetric flow rate p is total pressure subscript p s and c are primary secondary and mixed flows respectively the performance of the jfp is displayed in fig 4 and the simulation results num coincide well with the experimental data exp 2 4 numerical simulation of fish locomotion according to high speed images a numerical simulation methodology of fish locomotion in the jfp was established according to the measurement in the experiment the fish was assumed to be 10 mm thick and had no displacement along the z axis in the numerical simulation as shown in fig 5 the gray scale images without and with fish were treated as background and target images respectively after the gray scale calculation of target and background images the binary shape of fish body with fish position information was obtained in fig 6 1 the coordinate of fish profile calculated by an image processing program was the pixel coordinate there are proportional coefficients between pixel coordinates and real coordinates in the jfp which are calculated as follows 4 x r e a l s x p i x e l y r e a l k y p i x e l where x and y are the positions along axis of x and y respectively s and k are proportional coefficients subscript real and pixel are real and pixel coordinates respectively the real coordinates of fish profile is shown in fig 6 2 the coordinate at fish mouth was treated as the particle coordinate for fish therefore the trajectory of particle represented the trajectory of fish locomotion due to the extremely short time interval captured by the high speed camera 2 10 4 s the motion of particle between adjacent images was assumed as the uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion between adjacent images in addition the rotation of fish was ignored in the numerical simulation because most of fish had not obvious rotation tendency during the extremely short time in the jfp the moment when the particle firstly enters the shooting region was treated as the time origin the velocity of particle in each moment can be decomposed into the velocities along x and y directions calculated as follows 5 v x n 1 2 x n 1 x n δ t v x n v y n 1 2 y n 1 y n δ t v y n where v x n and v x n 1 are the velocities along x direction at the moment of n and n 1 respectively v y n and v y n 1 are the velocities along x direction at the moment of n and n 1 respectively x n and x n 1 are the positions of particle along x axis at the moment of n and n 1 respectively y n and y n 1 are the positions of particle along y axis at the moment of n and n 1 respectively the initial velocities v x 0 and v y 0 are assumed to be the averaged velocities of first ten particle along x and y axes respectively the mesh generation method of fish locomotion in the jfp was the same as the simulation in section 2 3 without fish and the final mesh had 7 65 million elements according to the experiment results boundary conditions for two cases are shown in table 1 the dynamic mesh technologies were utilized to solve the problem of moving boundary of fish a user defined function udf was compiled to control the locomotion of fish in the jfp based on the calculation results of formula 5 considering the time interval between adjacent images the time step for unsteady computation of fish locomotion was set at 2 10 5 s it is worth noting that the initial flow field in the jfp was firstly calculated when fish was fixed at the origin position 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact on wall static pressure and flow rate by monitoring the transient wall static pressure the impact of fish on the change of wall static pressure can be revealed according to the results of experiments and numerical simulation both single fish and fish shoal 200 carassius auratus caused the rise of wall pressure when they passed through the jfp based on the data of the pressure transducer at throat inlet x d t 1 05 there is an apparent pressure peak with the wall transient pressure p wall experiencing a sudden rise and drop in fig 7 1 when a single fish passes through the jfp this pressure peak has an extremely short period about 9 5 ms and its maximum pressure is approximately 15 kpa higher than the average wall pressure at this position the numerical simulation also captured this pressure peak which is approximately 6 kpa higher than the average wall pressure at throat inlet and lasts for about 9 2 ms as it is shown in fig 7 2 according to the synchronization results of the high speed camera and the pressure transducer this pressure peak is caused by the process of fish passing through the cross section of throat inlet the velocity of fish is lower than that of surrounding fluid in the suction chamber and throat so fish functions as an obstacle to the internal flow and causes a static pressure peak in the experiment the pressure increased when fish was at throat inlet and returned to the normal value when fish left the pressure tap at throat inlet thus the transit time for fish at certain position decides the duration of pressure peak at this position considering the relative position between fish and pressure tap the length and velocity of fish can impact the transit time so the duration of pressure peak for a single fish has a positive correlation with the length of fish and a negative correlation with the velocity of fish similar with the pressure peak caused by a single fish the wall static pressure has a significant fluctuation when fish shoal cross the jfp this pressure fluctuation lasts longer than the duration of the pressure peak caused by a single fish because fish shoal continuously pass through the cross section where pressure transducer is installed for all operation conditions wall static pressures rise firstly and then drop to their normal values however pressure increments for different operation conditions are different as it is shown in fig 8 1 the pressure increment of wall static pressure increases with the increase of primary flow rate q p the reason of this rule probably lies in the velocity difference between fish and surrounding fluid as the rise of q p this velocity difference increases the corresponding hindering effect of fish on the internal flow also becomes more significant and it is the main reason for the rise of wall static pressure fish shoal display their significant impact on the measured rate of mixed flow q c as it is shown in fig 8 2 compared with the decrease process of q c it increases slowly when fish shoal leave this region in addition the mixed flow rate has a larger amplitude reduction about 28 m3 h when the jfp operates at q p 90 m3 h than that about 20 m3 h at q p 80 m3 h so the amplitude of this decrease has a positive correlation with the primary flow rate yet a single fish can hardly affect q c the reason of the change of measured flow rate probably lies in the measurement principle of the electromagnetic flowmeter the potential difference is reduced when fish shoal cross the section of electromagnetic flowmeter installation position but it can be hardly affected by a single fish 3 2 impact on pressure distribution the results of experiment and numerical simulation have proved the impact of fish locomotion on wall static pressure which indicates the disturbance on pressure distribution by fish locomotion distributions of static pressure for case 1 and 2 are numerically displayed in fig 9 compared with the static pressure distribution without fish in the jfp the static pressure is higher around fish body which corroborates the pressure peak captured by pressure transducers in the experiment the pressure increment caused by fish is larger when fish in the throat than that when fish in the diffuser due to the smaller cross section area for the throat the blocking effect caused by fish body in the throat is stronger than that in the diffuser this blocking effect is the source of the pressure increment so the pressure increment reaches the maximum when fish in the throat and then continuously decreases when fish moves downstream in the diffuser the variation rules of pressure increment are similar for different operation conditions when fish passed through the jfp yet the degree and range of pressure increment are different for different operation conditions as q p drops the value of pressure increment decreases and its region also reduces due to the blocking effect of fish on the internal flow the distribution of dynamic pressure is also affected as it is shown in fig 10 there is a high pressure region upstream from the fish and a low pressure region downstream the fish the cross section area of throat is smaller than that of diffuser thus fish has a more significant blocking impact in the throat than that in the diffuser 3 3 impact on velocity distribution according to the simulation results the axial velocity distributions are displayed in fig 11 as a foreign body in the jfp fish shows its impact on the flow field compared with the case without fish the flow field of the case with fish has an asymmetric axial velocity distribution because of the random locomotion of fish in addition there is a low velocity region closed to fish body downstream this low velocity region is generated from the axial velocity difference between flow and fish and the low velocity region expands when this axial velocity difference increases therefore the low velocity region has a bigger size when fish is in the throat than that in the diffuser and the low velocity region is larger when jfp operates in a higher q p condition it is noteworthy that fish locomotion has a significant effect on the recirculation region in the suction chamber when jfp operates in the recirculation operation condition case 2 according to the axial velocity distribution in fig 11 2 the recirculation region basically keeps its shape when fish is in the suction chamber at t0 after 20 ms this recirculation region becomes broken when fish crosses through this region in the suction chamber when fish is in the front of throat the size of recirculation region is significantly smaller than that at t0 the shape of recirculation region shows a recovery trend when fish is in the front of diffuser and becomes complete when fish is in the rear of diffuser thus the impact of fish on the recirculation region is strong when fish in near this region and it becomes weak when fish is far away from the suction chamber compared with the influence on the axial velocity distribution the effect of fish locomotion on the radial velocity distribution is little the radial velocity usually changes around fish body as it is shown in fig 12 in case 1 this change is more significantly when fish in is the throat than that when fish in in the diffuser yet the obvious radial velocity change happens when fish swims across the recirculation region and it can hardly be found in the diffuser when jfp operates in the recirculation condition the radial velocity difference between flow and fish body is the main reason for this phenomenon the main flow in the jfp is along the axial direction thus the radial velocity is low compared with the axial velocity in addition the locomotion of fish in the jfp is also mainly along the axial direction and the displacement of fish in the radial direction is small therefore the radial velocity difference between flow and fish body is small and the corresponding impact of fish on the internal flow is tiny especially when the jfp operates in the low q p condition 4 conclusions in this study a new numerical simulation methodology is established to research the fish locomotion effect on the internal flow in a jfp the basic steps of this methodology are as follows the motion trajectory of fish is captured in high speed imagines in step 1 the user defined functions are compiled based on the motion trajectory in step 2 the dynamic mesh technologies are applied in the numerical simulation according to the user defined functions in step 3 according to the results of experiment and numerical simulation this study detailed this impact during the transport process the following conclusions are obtained 1 according to the synchronization results of high speed camera and pressure transducer the peak of wall static pressure is generated from fish locomotion in the jfp the amplitude of this peak is decided by the velocity difference between fish and internal flow the duration of this peak for a single fish has a positive correlation with the length of fish and a negative correlation with the velocity of fish the duration of this peak for the fish shoal is decided by the transit time of fish shoal in the jfp 2 based on the measurement result of flow rate single fish has no significant impact on flow rates of primary and mixed flows yet the flow rate of mixed flow shows a significant decrease when the fish shoal passes through the jfp and the amplitude of this decrease has a positive correlation with the primary flow rate 3 fish acts as an obstacle in the jfp its locomotion results in the rise of static pressure around the fish body the increments of static pressure are different when fish swims into different parts of jfp this increment is higher when fish is in the narrower space the locomotion of fish also leads to an uneven dynamic pressure distribution when fish crosses through the jfp a high pressure region and a low pressure region occurs upstream and downstream the fish respectively 4 the random locomotion of fish results in asymmetric distributions for both axial and radial velocities caused by the axial velocity difference between flow and fish a low velocity region closed to fish body downstream expands as the rise of axial velocity difference the locomotion of fish has a significant effect on the recirculation region in the suction chamber this recirculation region firstly breaks and then forms again when fish passes through the jfp the influence of fish locomotion on the radial velocity distribution is little and the radial velocity usually changes around fish body beside the present results there are still lots of works need to do in the future the locomotion of fish along all directions should be concerned in the future works in order to restore more real fish locomotion more high speed cameras should be utilized from different angles more flow field details can be captured by the numerical simulation when fish has comprehensive locomotion characteristics the scale impact should also be taken into consideration in the future works the impacts of fish locomotion on the internal flow tend to be weakened if the scale of a jfp is enlarged conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china project no 51606167 and

assumed as steady and incompressible flow which was modeled by the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the sst k ω turbulence model was used to model the turbulence considering the locomotion of fish unstructured grid was used in the simulation and the final mesh had 7 68 million elements after grid independence tests the origin of cartesian coordinate was set at the circle center of nozzle exit cross section the computational domain and local mesh are shown in fig 3 velocity inlets were used for the inlet boundary conditions while the outlet boundary condition was set as the pressure outlet the solid walls were treated as no slip walls with the standard wall function used in the near wall boundary the measured values in the experiment were used as the values of boundary conditions in the simulation flow ratio q pressure ratio h and efficiency η are usually used to evaluate the performance of jfps and they can be calculated as follows 1 q q s q p 2 h p c p s p p p c 3 η q s p c p s q p p p p c 100 q h 100 where q is volumetric flow rate p is total pressure subscript p s and c are primary secondary and mixed flows respectively the performance of the jfp is displayed in fig 4 and the simulation results num coincide well with the experimental data exp 2 4 numerical simulation of fish locomotion according to high speed images a numerical simulation methodology of fish locomotion in the jfp was established according to the measurement in the experiment the fish was assumed to be 10 mm thick and had no displacement along the z axis in the numerical simulation as shown in fig 5 the gray scale images without and with fish were treated as background and target images respectively after the gray scale calculation of target and background images the binary shape of fish body with fish position information was obtained in fig 6 1 the coordinate of fish profile calculated by an image processing program was the pixel coordinate there are proportional coefficients between pixel coordinates and real coordinates in the jfp which are calculated as follows 4 x r e a l s x p i x e l y r e a l k y p i x e l where x and y are the positions along axis of x and y respectively s and k are proportional coefficients subscript real and pixel are real and pixel coordinates respectively the real coordinates of fish profile is shown in fig 6 2 the coordinate at fish mouth was treated as the particle coordinate for fish therefore the trajectory of particle represented the trajectory of fish locomotion due to the extremely short time interval captured by the high speed camera 2 10 4 s the motion of particle between adjacent images was assumed as the uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion between adjacent images in addition the rotation of fish was ignored in the numerical simulation because most of fish had not obvious rotation tendency during the extremely short time in the jfp the moment when the particle firstly enters the shooting region was treated as the time origin the velocity of particle in each moment can be decomposed into the velocities along x and y directions calculated as follows 5 v x n 1 2 x n 1 x n δ t v x n v y n 1 2 y n 1 y n δ t v y n where v x n and v x n 1 are the velocities along x direction at the moment of n and n 1 respectively v y n and v y n 1 are the velocities along x direction at the moment of n and n 1 respectively x n and x n 1 are the positions of particle along x axis at the moment of n and n 1 respectively y n and y n 1 are the positions of particle along y axis at the moment of n and n 1 respectively the initial velocities v x 0 and v y 0 are assumed to be the averaged velocities of first ten particle along x and y axes respectively the mesh generation method of fish locomotion in the jfp was the same as the simulation in section 2 3 without fish and the final mesh had 7 65 million elements according to the experiment results boundary conditions for two cases are shown in table 1 the dynamic mesh technologies were utilized to solve the problem of moving boundary of fish a user defined function udf was compiled to control the locomotion of fish in the jfp based on the calculation results of formula 5 considering the time interval between adjacent images the time step for unsteady computation of fish locomotion was set at 2 10 5 s it is worth noting that the initial flow field in the jfp was firstly calculated when fish was fixed at the origin position 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact on wall static pressure and flow rate by monitoring the transient wall static pressure the impact of fish on the change of wall static pressure can be revealed according to the results of experiments and numerical simulation both single fish and fish shoal 200 carassius auratus caused the rise of wall pressure when they passed through the jfp based on the data of the pressure transducer at throat inlet x d t 1 05 there is an apparent pressure peak with the wall transient pressure p wall experiencing a sudden rise and drop in fig 7 1 when a single fish passes through the jfp this pressure peak has an extremely short period about 9 5 ms and its maximum pressure is approximately 15 kpa higher than the average wall pressure at this position the numerical simulation also captured this pressure peak which is approximately 6 kpa higher than the average wall pressure at throat inlet and lasts for about 9 2 ms as it is shown in fig 7 2 according to the synchronization results of the high speed camera and the pressure transducer this pressure peak is caused by the process of fish passing through the cross section of throat inlet the velocity of fish is lower than that of surrounding fluid in the suction chamber and throat so fish functions as an obstacle to the internal flow and causes a static pressure peak in the experiment the pressure increased when fish was at throat inlet and returned to the normal value when fish left the pressure tap at throat inlet thus the transit time for fish at certain position decides the duration of pressure peak at this position considering the relative position between fish and pressure tap the length and velocity of fish can impact the transit time so the duration of pressure peak for a single fish has a positive correlation with the length of fish and a negative correlation with the velocity of fish similar with the pressure peak caused by a single fish the wall static pressure has a significant fluctuation when fish shoal cross the jfp this pressure fluctuation lasts longer than the duration of the pressure peak caused by a single fish because fish shoal continuously pass through the cross section where pressure transducer is installed for all operation conditions wall static pressures rise firstly and then drop to their normal values however pressure increments for different operation conditions are different as it is shown in fig 8 1 the pressure increment of wall static pressure increases with the increase of primary flow rate q p the reason of this rule probably lies in the velocity difference between fish and surrounding fluid as the rise of q p this velocity difference increases the corresponding hindering effect of fish on the internal flow also becomes more significant and it is the main reason for the rise of wall static pressure fish shoal display their significant impact on the measured rate of mixed flow q c as it is shown in fig 8 2 compared with the decrease process of q c it increases slowly when fish shoal leave this region in addition the mixed flow rate has a larger amplitude reduction about 28 m3 h when the jfp operates at q p 90 m3 h than that about 20 m3 h at q p 80 m3 h so the amplitude of this decrease has a positive correlation with the primary flow rate yet a single fish can hardly affect q c the reason of the change of measured flow rate probably lies in the measurement principle of the electromagnetic flowmeter the potential difference is reduced when fish shoal cross the section of electromagnetic flowmeter installation position but it can be hardly affected by a single fish 3 2 impact on pressure distribution the results of experiment and numerical simulation have proved the impact of fish locomotion on wall static pressure which indicates the disturbance on pressure distribution by fish locomotion distributions of static pressure for case 1 and 2 are numerically displayed in fig 9 compared with the static pressure distribution without fish in the jfp the static pressure is higher around fish body which corroborates the pressure peak captured by pressure transducers in the experiment the pressure increment caused by fish is larger when fish in the throat than that when fish in the diffuser due to the smaller cross section area for the throat the blocking effect caused by fish body in the throat is stronger than that in the diffuser this blocking effect is the source of the pressure increment so the pressure increment reaches the maximum when fish in the throat and then continuously decreases when fish moves downstream in the diffuser the variation rules of pressure increment are similar for different operation conditions when fish passed through the jfp yet the degree and range of pressure increment are different for different operation conditions as q p drops the value of pressure increment decreases and its region also reduces due to the blocking effect of fish on the internal flow the distribution of dynamic pressure is also affected as it is shown in fig 10 there is a high pressure region upstream from the fish and a low pressure region downstream the fish the cross section area of throat is smaller than that of diffuser thus fish has a more significant blocking impact in the throat than that in the diffuser 3 3 impact on velocity distribution according to the simulation results the axial velocity distributions are displayed in fig 11 as a foreign body in the jfp fish shows its impact on the flow field compared with the case without fish the flow field of the case with fish has an asymmetric axial velocity distribution because of the random locomotion of fish in addition there is a low velocity region closed to fish body downstream this low velocity region is generated from the axial velocity difference between flow and fish and the low velocity region expands when this axial velocity difference increases therefore the low velocity region has a bigger size when fish is in the throat than that in the diffuser and the low velocity region is larger when jfp operates in a higher q p condition it is noteworthy that fish locomotion has a significant effect on the recirculation region in the suction chamber when jfp operates in the recirculation operation condition case 2 according to the axial velocity distribution in fig 11 2 the recirculation region basically keeps its shape when fish is in the suction chamber at t0 after 20 ms this recirculation region becomes broken when fish crosses through this region in the suction chamber when fish is in the front of throat the size of recirculation region is significantly smaller than that at t0 the shape of recirculation region shows a recovery trend when fish is in the front of diffuser and becomes complete when fish is in the rear of diffuser thus the impact of fish on the recirculation region is strong when fish in near this region and it becomes weak when fish is far away from the suction chamber compared with the influence on the axial velocity distribution the effect of fish locomotion on the radial velocity distribution is little the radial velocity usually changes around fish body as it is shown in fig 12 in case 1 this change is more significantly when fish in is the throat than that when fish in in the diffuser yet the obvious radial velocity change happens when fish swims across the recirculation region and it can hardly be found in the diffuser when jfp operates in the recirculation condition the radial velocity difference between flow and fish body is the main reason for this phenomenon the main flow in the jfp is along the axial direction thus the radial velocity is low compared with the axial velocity in addition the locomotion of fish in the jfp is also mainly along the axial direction and the displacement of fish in the radial direction is small therefore the radial velocity difference between flow and fish body is small and the corresponding impact of fish on the internal flow is tiny especially when the jfp operates in the low q p condition 4 conclusions in this study a new numerical simulation methodology is established to research the fish locomotion effect on the internal flow in a jfp the basic steps of this methodology are as follows the motion trajectory of fish is captured in high speed imagines in step 1 the user defined functions are compiled based on the motion trajectory in step 2 the dynamic mesh technologies are applied in the numerical simulation according to the user defined functions in step 3 according to the results of experiment and numerical simulation this study detailed this impact during the transport process the following conclusions are obtained 1 according to the synchronization results of high speed camera and pressure transducer the peak of wall static pressure is generated from fish locomotion in the jfp the amplitude of this peak is decided by the velocity difference between fish and internal flow the duration of this peak for a single fish has a positive correlation with the length of fish and a negative correlation with the velocity of fish the duration of this peak for the fish shoal is decided by the transit time of fish shoal in the jfp 2 based on the measurement result of flow rate single fish has no significant impact on flow rates of primary and mixed flows yet the flow rate of mixed flow shows a significant decrease when the fish shoal passes through the jfp and the amplitude of this decrease has a positive correlation with the primary flow rate 3 fish acts as an obstacle in the jfp its locomotion results in the rise of static pressure around the fish body the increments of static pressure are different when fish swims into different parts of jfp this increment is higher when fish is in the narrower space the locomotion of fish also leads to an uneven dynamic pressure distribution when fish crosses through the jfp a high pressure region and a low pressure region occurs upstream and downstream the fish respectively 4 the random locomotion of fish results in asymmetric distributions for both axial and radial velocities caused by the axial velocity difference between flow and fish a low velocity region closed to fish body downstream expands as the rise of axial velocity difference the locomotion of fish has a significant effect on the recirculation region in the suction chamber this recirculation region firstly breaks and then forms again when fish passes through the jfp the influence of fish locomotion on the radial velocity distribution is little and the radial velocity usually changes around fish body beside the present results there are still lots of works need to do in the future the locomotion of fish along all directions should be concerned in the future works in order to restore more real fish locomotion more high speed cameras should be utilized from different angles more flow field details can be captured by the numerical simulation when fish has comprehensive locomotion characteristics the scale impact should also be taken into consideration in the future works the impacts of fish locomotion on the internal flow tend to be weakened if the scale of a jfp is enlarged conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china project no 51606167 and

oil spill forecasting system of national marine environmental forecasting center of china nmefc to forecast the oil drifting trajectory during sanchi collision accident in order to reveal the major errors sources and improve the accuracy of the forecasting system we designed five numeric simulation scenarios in the five scenarios we input the different current and wind forcing data into the forecasting system and set the different oil released time by the analysis and discussion of the five numeric simulation results we drew the conclusions following 1 the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error sources of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident 2 we should further strengthen the observation of the complicated vortex region of kuroshio current to improve the prediction accuracy of material transport in ocean 3 in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by simulating the oil spill on all kinds of different released conditions keywords operational oil spill forecasting lagrangian random walk drift trajectory wind and current forecasting error analysis 1 introduction the risk of oil spill accidents has increased with the developing industrial discharge oil exploration and transport oil storage facilities and other economic impacts oil spill accidents are very harmful to the ocean environment and ecosystem they contaminate shorelines and cause long term damages to offshore environment for fishery and wildlife oil spills may also contaminate harbor facilities and vessels in response to oil spill accidents many government agencies have prepared oil spill contingency plans an important component of these plans is the use of numerical models to predict oil slick movement and oil particle concentrations in waters oil spill models can predict the oil transport to assist the responses at sea the results from oil spill transport models are very useful as in most times the results can be the only information available numerical models have been widely used in oil spill studies and employed in real spill events around the world oil spill trajectory models are traditionally in the form of two dimensional models which use constant or variable parameters to link wind and current to determine the velocity of a surface oil slicks reed et al 1999 wang et al 2005 chen et al 2007 vethamony et al 2007 oil spill transport models are often based on generalized mass transport equations huang 1983 however the previous work bennett and clites 1987 showed that euler method could cause erroneous drifts of particle trajectories in nonuniform flow fields since elliot et al 1986 applied random walk particle tracking rwpt to describe oil droplet movement in a water column most oil spill models have used lagrangian method to determine the transport of oil spills reed et al 1999 wang et al 2008 xu et al 2008 wang and shen 2010 toz and koseoglu 2018 yin et al 2018 in these models the total transport of an oil particle is calculated as the sum of wind drift current buoyancy and turbulent diffusion observational data indicates that wind drift velocity of oil particles is 1 6 of the wind speed lehr and simecek beatty 2000 presently there are many oil spill models with different complexities to compute the trajectory of spills afenyo et al 2015 based on the lagrangian rwpt oil spill model the researchers of different countries developed these different oil spill simulation software systems oilmap of usa oscar of norway ostm of australia osis of uk and medslik of italy taking advantage of these oil spill software systems many researchers simulated the oil drifting trajectory in different seas and assessed the susceptibility of the different location to oil spill alves et al 2014 2015 2016 to support emergency response there are many oil spill models with different complexities to compute the trajectory of spills however the success of each model depends on the model structure and schemes the accuracy of input data such as wind current oil source information etc and the interpretation of results input data is subjected to many error sources some environmental variables may have stochastic behaviors thus there are always some uncertainties related to the input parameters that should not be neglected many studies have shown sensitivity test for all kinds of parameters or input data elliott 2004 jorda et al 2007 abascal et al 2010 these studies revealed that there are many factors influencing the accuracy of oil spill transportation besides the input data mentioned above the length of integration time step the method of integration the resolutions of model can also influence the results of oil spill models price et al 2004 elliott and jones 2000 garc ia mart inez and flores tovar 1999 the accuracy of oil spill transport modeling and forecast is not always good enough to provide reliable information due to various error sources some studies suggested how to improve the accuracy of oil spill transport modeling such as using ensemble method to weaken the influence of current modeling error marianoa et al 2011 and using some methods to determine the uncertainties of oil spill trajectories in coastal or open ocean sebastião and guedes 2006 2007 to improve oil spill transport modeling and forecast it is necessary to analyze and identify the major error sources on 06 january 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with a hong kong flagged cargo ship at 30 42 42 n 124 56 42 e in the east china sea ecs during the sanchi collision accident nmefc used an operational oil spill forecasting system to calculate the oil spill drifting trajectory and released the forecasting productions to relative organizations the operational oil spill forecasting system which was based on lagrangian rwpt method has been running operationally at national marine environmental forecasting center nmefc since 2008 li et al 2010 2013a 2013b in this paper in order to reveal the major error sources of the northwest pacific operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the sanchi collision accident and improve the accuracy of our oil spill forecasting system we collected the observed wind data and satellite remote sensing images designed five numeric simulation scenarios for the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc by the analysis and discussion of the five numeric simulation results we revealed the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident and drew some conclusions 2 the sanchi oil spill event on 6 january 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with a hong kong flagged cargo ship at 30 42 42 n 124 56 42 e in the east china sea ecs the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china public report documented that the sanchi tanker carried a full natural gas condensate cargo of 111 3 thousand metric tons after eight days at 16 45 on 14 january 2018 the sanchi tanker exploded and sank at 28 22 9 5 n 125 55 17 3 e with about 1900 tons of the sanchi s own fuel oil and unknown amount of condensate at 9 58 on 15 january the flames were extinguished national satellite ocean application service provided a number of satellite remote sensing images these images were collected in order to locate the oil slicks on the sea surface because the sanchi tanker kept burning after it collided there was not a large area oil spill been observed on the sea surface but after the flames were all wiped out on 15 january the satellite observation showed that there was a circular shaped oil slick of 57 87 square kilometers near the location at which sanchi tanker sank fig 1 a slick of tens to several hundreds square kilometers has been observed to persist in the region from the location of sunken tanker to the kuroshio current between 15 january and 26 january after 26 january the total area of oil films observed by satellite was less than several square kilometers every day there were only fewer new oil bubbles rising from the location of sunken tanker observed by marine surveillance ship at 4 51 on 16 january the satellite observation showed that there was a northwest southeast wide stripe shaped oil slick of 68 6 square kilometers and a narrow oil belt these oil slicks are illustrated as the blue zone in fig 1 at 17 42 on 17 january the total area of these oil slicks reached to 101 6 square kilometers the area of largest oil slick was 56 2 square kilometers the largest oil slick was in the northeast of the sunken tanker location between the largest oil slick and the sunken tanker location there was a u shaped long oil belt these oil slicks are illustrated as the green zone in fig 1 at 5 30 on 19 january the total area of these oil slicks reached to 259 8 square kilometers the largest oil slick was in the northeast of the sunken tanker location the area of which was 164 3 square kilometers and there was a long belt in the east of the sunken tanker location these oil slicks are illustrated as the pink zone in fig 1 3 model system we established an operational 3 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc in 2008 which is based on lagrangian rwpt model we use it to simulate the moving of oil film and forecast the drift trajectory of oil film the oil spill transport model needs to be input data such as spill location duration oil properties and oil mass as well as wind current and geographic information the horizontal transport of the oil particles is calculated as the total result of wind drift current waves and horizontal turbulent diffusion the vertical transport of the oil particles is determined by current buoyancy and vertical turbulence diffusion li et al 2013b we simplified the 3 dimensional oil spill mode and established an operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc for the northwest pacific in 2015 considering three factors following first the occurrence probability of oil spill on ocean surface is much higher than that of oil spill under sea surface second the grid number of the northwest pacific 3 d current model is huge the 3 dimensional oil spill transport simulation needs too much computer time while we need quickly issue the forecasting results to decision division at the scene of the accident third if the oil leak occur in the region of under 200 m depth because of the buoyancy the oil will usually rise rapidly up to the sea surface which will be near the projection location of oil leak site on sea surface in the nwp operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc the vertical transport of the oil particles was ignored we only used the u and v on sea surface from the nwp operational 3 dimensional current forecasting system of nmefc fig 2 is the structure of the nwp operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc the weathering processes including evaporation dissolution and emulsification are also included in the system the weathering processes are determined by water temperature air temperature wind velocity and oil properties li et al 2013b we focus on the oil particle transport here and do not introduce the weathering model in detail the nwp operational wind forecasting system of the nmefc is based on wrf daily at 08 30 local time it provides the forecasting of air temperature pressure humidity and wind speeds at 10 m above sea surface every hour in the next 120 h the forecasting results are available on website http www nmefc cn daily the nwp 99 160 e 5 52 n operational 3 dimensional current forecasting system of the nmefc is based on roms daily at 08 30 local time it provides the next 120 h every hour forecasting sea surface current temperature the model resolution is 1 20 nwp ocean circulation model configurations are listed in table 1 while the topography of ecs and depth of simulation domain are shown in fig 3 wang et al 2016 described the model configurations in detail then we are not going to further describe it in the paper the forecasting results are available on website http www nmefc cn daily from 2015 the sea water sampling inspection results supplied by ningbo marine environmental monitoring center station of state oceanic administration show that the oil on the sea surface is bunker fuel we assume the density of oil is 830 kg m3 the time step is 10 min wind drift factor is 0 02 referencing the operational experience parameter configurations of bunker fuel which was validated during many accidents before the horizontal diffusion coefficient is 6 the weathering parameter also referenced the operational experience parameter configurations of bunker fuel which was validated during many accidents before 4 scenarios it s well known that the influence of wind and current on the drifting trajectory of oil film is vital jorda et al 2007 in fact the released time of oil spill is also very important in order to reveal the major sources of the system and improve the accuracy of the forecasting system we designed five numeric simulation scenarios table 2 4 1 scenario 1 we used the operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc for nwp which the hourly wind forecasting data was from the nwp operational wind forecasting system of the nmefc and the hourly current forecasting data was from the nwp operational 3 d current forecasting system of nmefc from 15 january to 19 january we assumed that 1000 oil particles were released instantaneously in the oil films area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january which is the gray region in fig 1 4 2 scenario 2 in scenario 2 in order to eliminate the incoming error of wind we projected to use the observation wind speed instead of the forecasting wind data to force the model we collected twenty two observation data points of wind supplied by the cleaning ship around the sunken tanker location from 15th to 19th in january 2018 but we only had the observation data of wind around the sunken tanker location and the time of observation wind data was very discontinuous therefore the observation wind data do not fit to force the oil spill model directly the medium range forecast products of ecmwf are also used frequently during the operational forecasting it provides meteorological information every 6 h throughout the first 10 days the wind speed at 10 m is shown as an instantaneous forecast value in m s in the 10 day forecasting results ivan 2015 fig 4 is the comparison of wind vector of ecmwf forecasting wind wrf forecasting wind of nmefc and observed wind fig 5 is the comparisons of wind speed and wind direction error time series between the ecmwf forecasting wind and wrf forecasting wind of nmefc the mean relative absolute error of ecmwf forecasting wind speed and wrf forecasting wind speed of nmefc are 0 19 and 0 31 the absolute error of ecmwf and wrf of nmefc forecasting wind direction are 24 49 and 29 the comparison results show that the ecmwf forecasting wind is more agree with the observation wind than the nmefc forecasting wind if we use ecmwf forecasting wind to force the oil spill mode it will weaken the wind incoming error therefore in scenario 2 we used the ecmwf forecasting wind data to force the oil spill model the current data still used the nwp operational 3 d current forecasting system of nmefc from 15 january to 19 january one thousand oil particles are released instantaneously in the oil slicks area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january 4 3 scenario 3 and scenario 4 after the evaluation of the effects of wind forcing on oil spill trajectory we investigated the current forcing on spill modeling first due to the lacking of measured current data we couldn t validated and corrected the current data second to our knowledge the hindcast results are better than forecasting results third we had none of hindcast current data of nmefc during the accident but gofs3 0 the global ocean forecast system 3 0 hindcast current data and gofs3 1 the global ocean forecast system 3 1 hindcast current data can be downloaded to further weaken the current incoming error after weakening the wind incoming error we used the ecmwf forecasting wind data gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 hindcast current data separately to force the oil spill model of nmefc we recorded the two scenarios separately as scenario 3 and scenario 4 one thousand oil particles are released instantaneously in the oil slicks area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 are both based on hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model and ncoda the navy coupled ocean data assimilation in this paper we use the water

recommended to become the next global operational system we designed two different hindcast current in order to investigate which one is performing better in the accident 4 4 scenario 5 based on the satellite observations it was indicated that the largest oil film observed on 16 19 january should be the largest oil film observed on 15 january but there are some other oil belt except the largest oil film in fig 1 in scenario 5 after weakening the wind and current incoming errors to further improve the accuracy of simulation results 10000 oil particles were released continuedly in intervals of 10 min at the sunken tanker position on the sea surface from 6 00 on 15 january to 6 00 on 19 january 5 results in the first scenario the oil film moved northeast before 14 19 on january 16 then turned to move southeast as shown in fig 6 a the modeled oil spill distribution zone closely resemble the main oil zone observed by satellite at 4 51 on january 16 with the center of the oil zone located about 5 1 km away from the observation but the two modeled oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone and pink dots zone were both in the southeast of main oil film zone observed at 17 42 on january 17 and at 5 30 on january 19 and the distance errors of the oil zone center were respectively 30 0 km and 59 4 km it was satisfactory that the distance error at about 23rd hour was 5 1 km but the results at about 36th hour and 96th hour did not agree well with observation in the second scenario the oil film moved northeast before 0 19 on 17 january then turned to move southeast as shown in fig 6b the modeled oil spill distribution zone light blue dots zone closely resemble the main oil zone observed by satellite at 4 51 on 16 january with the center of the oil zone located about 6 8 km away from the observation the modeled oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone was in the southeast of the observation at 17 42 on 17 january with the center of the oil zone located about 13 3 km away from the observation the modeled oil spill distribution zones pink dots zone located inside the observed main oil film zone at 5 30 on 19 january and the area of oil modeled distribution zone was obviously smaller than that of the observed main oil film zone the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 10 5 km comparing the distance errors at about 23rd hour 36th hour and 96th hour of scenario 1 with scenario 2 the results at about 23rd hour of scenario 1 were a little better than that of scenario 2 but the results at about 36th hour and 96th hour were obviously worse than that of scenario 2 overall the results of scenario 2 were obviously better than that of scenario 1 in the third scenario the oil film moved northwest before 6 00 on 16 january then turned to move northeast and turned again to southeast and was nearly motionless after 0 00 on 17 january as shown in fig 6c the oil spill distribution zone light blue dots zone was in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 4 51 on 16 january the distance error of the center of the oil zone was 16 5 km the oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone lied in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 17 42 on 17 january and it was near the observed main oil film zone the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 15 8 km the oil spill distribution zones pink dots zone lied in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 5 30 on 19 january the center position of it was almost the same as that of observed oil film at 17 42 on 17 january the area of oil distribution zone was obviously smaller than that of the observed main oil film zone at corresponding time the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 26 3 km the oil distribution areas were all obviously smaller than that of the observed oil films on the sea surface at the different three moment in scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 especially at 5 30 on 19 january the oil film was stretched observed by satellite but the diffusion of oil particles were not obvious in scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 in the fourth scenario the direction of the simulating oil particles drifting trajectory was in the southeast of the sunken tanker location as in fig 6d the simulating results were worse than that of scenario 1 3 but in the scenario the oil distribution areas were better than that of other scenarios the oil particles spread on the surface the oil zone became a northwest southeast wide belt the shapes of the simulating oil zone in scenario 4 on 17 january and 19 january were better than that of the simulating oil zone in scenario 1 3 in the fifth scenario fig 7 shows us that the modeled results are basically agree with the observed distribution of oil films by satellite especially with that of the oil films observed at 5 30 on 19 january in fig 7a the oil particles directly move to northeast but there is a zigzag thin oil belt between the wide oil belt and the sunken tanker location in the satellite observation image while it is a straight line in the simulating results and the area of the wide oil belt is bigger than that of simulating results in fig 7b the direction of the oil belt of simulating results is firstly east and then turn to north while that of the satellite observation image is firstly southeast and turn to northwest although the shapes of the simulating oil belt and observation oil belt are both u shaped the locations of oil belts are mostly not same but near in fig 7c the simulating results are basically agree with the distribution of oil films observed by satellite but the simulating oil belt is continuous while the observed oil belt is intermittent and the locations of oil belts are mostly same 6 discussion overall five scenarios were conducted in this study as listed in table 2 the best results was the one when we used ecmwf and nwp to force the oil spill model of nmefc the results revealed that the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident 6 1 wind and current effects on oil drifting trajectories the satellite images showed that the drifting directions of the observed largest oil film basically accorded with the directions of observed wind during 15 19 january 2018 it revealed that the effect of current on the oil film drifting direction was relatively tiny while the effect of wind was vital during the accident but in scenario 3 and 4 the results showed us that the accuracy forecasting and simulation of current were also very important especially when the current speed was large and the current field had complicated vortex structure the current effect on the drifting trajectory of oil film was obvious we compared the differences between nwp forecasting current of nmefc gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 hindcast current around the sunken tanker location fig 8 shows that the sunken tanker location is near to kuroshio current it belongs to the complex vortex structure region caused by kuroshio current in fig 8 the kuroshio current speed of nwp forecasting current products is larger than that of other two hindcast current the kuroshio current speed of gofs3 1 hindcast current is the smallest in the nwp forecasting current filed of nmefc the left panel of fig 8 the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are northwest in 15 17 january 2018 then turn to northeast in 18 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location are north and northeast in 15 16 january 2018 and change to east and southeast in 17 19 january 2018 overall around the sunken tanker location the direction of ecmwf forecasting wind is northwest and north and turn to south and southwest during 17 19 january 2018 under the combined influence of wind and current the oil films firstly move to north then change to east and southeast following the current finally they would certainly move to mainstream axis area of kuroshio current fig 6b in the gofs3 0 hindcast current filed the middle panel of fig 8 the current structure is relatively stable and there is a cyclone in the area about 60 km northeast of the sunken tanker location which can be clearly seen especially in 18 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are north northeast and east in 15 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location are northwest in 15 january 2018 and turn to northeast in 16 17 january 2018 the oil films reach to the left of the cyclone area on 17 january 2018 under the influence of wind and current the wind direction is south they are blocked by the vortex they unable to move to east and disperse near the left of the cyclone area fig 6c in the gofs3 1 hindcast current filed the right panel of fig 8 the current structure is clearly different with that of the other ocean models in the area around of the sunken tanker location there are more complex vortex structures in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location the direction of ocean current is southeast in the south region of the sunken tanker location and turn to northeast in the southeast region of the sunken tanker location which is the mainstream axis area of kuroshio current the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are south and southeast in 15 19 january 2018 so the oil films of the sunken tanker location move to southeast instead of north or northeast when they reach the mainstream axis area of kuroshio current they will move to northeast following the kuroshio current fig 6d 6 2 the importance of accuracy released time information of oil in general we can obtain relatively accuracy information about the location of oil spill but it is often difficult to get the accuracy time of oil released especially when the oils are released intermittent continuously or when the oil spills happen in deep ocean in scenario 5 when we assumed that oil particles were released continuedly from 6 00 on 15 january to 6 00 on 19 january instead of released instantaneously at 6 00 on 15 january we found the results were more consistent with the observation oil films information therefore we drew the conclusion that the released time information of oil is also very important the model results may be strongly influenced by the accuracy of release information in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by the oil spill simulating on all kinds of different released conditions 7 conclusions in this paper we designed five scenarios to simulate the oil drifting trajectory using the nmefc oil spill model forced by different wind and current data during the sanchi collision accident after the analysis of error source it was revealed that the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident we can infer that the nwp forecasting current results in the accident region are the closest to the real situation the forecasting results in scenario 5 are the best results in the five scenarios the direction of oil drifting in scenario 4 is contrary to that of the observation results the effects of wind and current on the oil spill drifting trajectory are both vital the wind field structure is generally simple because of the flat ocean surface meanwhile the wind on ocean surface can be observed more easily than the current on ocean surface and we can use observed wind data to validate assimilate or optimize our wind forecasting model the accuracy of wind forecasting products can reach to an acceptable level ecmwf forecasting wind data had a better performance than wrf forecasting wind data of nmefc during the accident the accuracy of ocean surface current forecasting products can easily reach to the acceptable level in the offshore region where the tidal currents dominate in the complicated vortex region of kuroshio current the current forecasting becomes much more difficult to better understand the structure of kuroshio current and its surrounding areas with complex vortex structures it is suggested to further strengthen the observation so as to improve the prediction accuracy of material transport in ocean the released time information of oil is also very important the model results may be strongly influenced by the accuracy of release information in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by simulating the oil spill on all kinds of different released conditions funding this work was supported by national key research and development plan of

22659,on 06 january 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with a hong kong flagged cargo ship at 30 42 42 n 124 56 42 e in the east china sea ecs in this paper we used a northwest pacific nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of national marine environmental forecasting center of china nmefc to forecast the oil drifting trajectory during sanchi collision accident in order to reveal the major errors sources and improve the accuracy of the forecasting system we designed five numeric simulation scenarios in the five scenarios we input the different current and wind forcing data into the forecasting system and set the different oil released time by the analysis and discussion of the five numeric simulation results we drew the conclusions following 1 the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error sources of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident 2 we should further strengthen the observation of the complicated vortex region of kuroshio current to improve the prediction accuracy of material transport in ocean 3 in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by simulating the oil spill on all kinds of different released conditions keywords operational oil spill forecasting lagrangian random walk drift trajectory wind and current forecasting error analysis 1 introduction the risk of oil spill accidents has increased with the developing industrial discharge oil exploration and transport oil storage facilities and other economic impacts oil spill accidents are very harmful to the ocean environment and ecosystem they contaminate shorelines and cause long term damages to offshore environment for fishery and wildlife oil spills may also contaminate harbor facilities and vessels in response to oil spill accidents many government agencies have prepared oil spill contingency plans an important component of these plans is the use of numerical models to predict oil slick movement and oil particle concentrations in waters oil spill models can predict the oil transport to assist the responses at sea the results from oil spill transport models are very useful as in most times the results can be the only information available numerical models have been widely used in oil spill studies and employed in real spill events around the world oil spill trajectory models are traditionally in the form of two dimensional models which use constant or variable parameters to link wind and current to determine the velocity of a surface oil slicks reed et al 1999 wang et al 2005 chen et al 2007 vethamony et al 2007 oil spill transport models are often based on generalized mass transport equations huang 1983 however the previous work bennett and clites 1987 showed that euler method could cause erroneous drifts of particle trajectories in nonuniform flow fields since elliot et al 1986 applied random walk particle tracking rwpt to describe oil droplet movement in a water column most oil spill models have used lagrangian method to determine the transport of oil spills reed et al 1999 wang et al 2008 xu et al 2008 wang and shen 2010 toz and koseoglu 2018 yin et al 2018 in these models the total transport of an oil particle is calculated as the sum of wind drift current buoyancy and turbulent diffusion observational data indicates that wind drift velocity of oil particles is 1 6 of the wind speed lehr and simecek beatty 2000 presently there are many oil spill models with different complexities to compute the trajectory of spills afenyo et al 2015 based on the lagrangian rwpt oil spill model the researchers of different countries developed these different oil spill simulation software systems oilmap of usa oscar of norway ostm of australia osis of uk and medslik of italy taking advantage of these oil spill software systems many researchers simulated the oil drifting trajectory in different seas and assessed the susceptibility of the different location to oil spill alves et al 2014 2015 2016 to support emergency response there are many oil spill models with different complexities to compute the trajectory of spills however the success of each model depends on the model structure and schemes the accuracy of input data such as wind current oil source information etc and the interpretation of results input data is subjected to many error sources some environmental variables may have stochastic behaviors thus there are always some uncertainties related to the input parameters that should not be neglected many studies have shown sensitivity test for all kinds of parameters or input data elliott 2004 jorda et al 2007 abascal et al 2010 these studies revealed that there are many factors influencing the accuracy of oil spill transportation besides the input data mentioned above the length of integration time step the method of integration the resolutions of model can also influence the results of oil spill models price et al 2004 elliott and jones 2000 garc ia mart inez and flores tovar 1999 the accuracy of oil spill transport modeling and forecast is not always good enough to provide reliable information due to various error sources some studies suggested how to improve the accuracy of oil spill transport modeling such as using ensemble method to weaken the influence of current modeling error marianoa et al 2011 and using some methods to determine the uncertainties of oil spill trajectories in coastal or open ocean sebastião and guedes 2006 2007 to improve oil spill transport modeling and forecast it is necessary to analyze and identify the major error sources on 06 january 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with a hong kong flagged cargo ship at 30 42 42 n 124 56 42 e in the east china sea ecs during the sanchi collision accident nmefc used an operational oil spill forecasting system to calculate the oil spill drifting trajectory and released the forecasting productions to relative organizations the operational oil spill forecasting system which was based on lagrangian rwpt method has been running operationally at national marine environmental forecasting center nmefc since 2008 li et al 2010 2013a 2013b in this paper in order to reveal the major error sources of the northwest pacific operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the sanchi collision accident and improve the accuracy of our oil spill forecasting system we collected the observed wind data and satellite remote sensing images designed five numeric simulation scenarios for the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc by the analysis and discussion of the five numeric simulation results we revealed the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident and drew some conclusions 2 the sanchi oil spill event on 6 january 2018 the sanchi tanker collided with a hong kong flagged cargo ship at 30 42 42 n 124 56 42 e in the east china sea ecs the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china public report documented that the sanchi tanker carried a full natural gas condensate cargo of 111 3 thousand metric tons after eight days at 16 45 on 14 january 2018 the sanchi tanker exploded and sank at 28 22 9 5 n 125 55 17 3 e with about 1900 tons of the sanchi s own fuel oil and unknown amount of condensate at 9 58 on 15 january the flames were extinguished national satellite ocean application service provided a number of satellite remote sensing images these images were collected in order to locate the oil slicks on the sea surface because the sanchi tanker kept burning after it collided there was not a large area oil spill been observed on the sea surface but after the flames were all wiped out on 15 january the satellite observation showed that there was a circular shaped oil slick of 57 87 square kilometers near the location at which sanchi tanker sank fig 1 a slick of tens to several hundreds square kilometers has been observed to persist in the region from the location of sunken tanker to the kuroshio current between 15 january and 26 january after 26 january the total area of oil films observed by satellite was less than several square kilometers every day there were only fewer new oil bubbles rising from the location of sunken tanker observed by marine surveillance ship at 4 51 on 16 january the satellite observation showed that there was a northwest southeast wide stripe shaped oil slick of 68 6 square kilometers and a narrow oil belt these oil slicks are illustrated as the blue zone in fig 1 at 17 42 on 17 january the total area of these oil slicks reached to 101 6 square kilometers the area of largest oil slick was 56 2 square kilometers the largest oil slick was in the northeast of the sunken tanker location between the largest oil slick and the sunken tanker location there was a u shaped long oil belt these oil slicks are illustrated as the green zone in fig 1 at 5 30 on 19 january the total area of these oil slicks reached to 259 8 square kilometers the largest oil slick was in the northeast of the sunken tanker location the area of which was 164 3 square kilometers and there was a long belt in the east of the sunken tanker location these oil slicks are illustrated as the pink zone in fig 1 3 model system we established an operational 3 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc in 2008 which is based on lagrangian rwpt model we use it to simulate the moving of oil film and forecast the drift trajectory of oil film the oil spill transport model needs to be input data such as spill location duration oil properties and oil mass as well as wind current and geographic information the horizontal transport of the oil particles is calculated as the total result of wind drift current waves and horizontal turbulent diffusion the vertical transport of the oil particles is determined by current buoyancy and vertical turbulence diffusion li et al 2013b we simplified the 3 dimensional oil spill mode and established an operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc for the northwest pacific in 2015 considering three factors following first the occurrence probability of oil spill on ocean surface is much higher than that of oil spill under sea surface second the grid number of the northwest pacific 3 d current model is huge the 3 dimensional oil spill transport simulation needs too much computer time while we need quickly issue the forecasting results to decision division at the scene of the accident third if the oil leak occur in the region of under 200 m depth because of the buoyancy the oil will usually rise rapidly up to the sea surface which will be near the projection location of oil leak site on sea surface in the nwp operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc the vertical transport of the oil particles was ignored we only used the u and v on sea surface from the nwp operational 3 dimensional current forecasting system of nmefc fig 2 is the structure of the nwp operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc the weathering processes including evaporation dissolution and emulsification are also included in the system the weathering processes are determined by water temperature air temperature wind velocity and oil properties li et al 2013b we focus on the oil particle transport here and do not introduce the weathering model in detail the nwp operational wind forecasting system of the nmefc is based on wrf daily at 08 30 local time it provides the forecasting of air temperature pressure humidity and wind speeds at 10 m above sea surface every hour in the next 120 h the forecasting results are available on website http www nmefc cn daily the nwp 99 160 e 5 52 n operational 3 dimensional current forecasting system of the nmefc is based on roms daily at 08 30 local time it provides the next 120 h every hour forecasting sea surface current temperature the model resolution is 1 20 nwp ocean circulation model configurations are listed in table 1 while the topography of ecs and depth of simulation domain are shown in fig 3 wang et al 2016 described the model configurations in detail then we are not going to further describe it in the paper the forecasting results are available on website http www nmefc cn daily from 2015 the sea water sampling inspection results supplied by ningbo marine environmental monitoring center station of state oceanic administration show that the oil on the sea surface is bunker fuel we assume the density of oil is 830 kg m3 the time step is 10 min wind drift factor is 0 02 referencing the operational experience parameter configurations of bunker fuel which was validated during many accidents before the horizontal diffusion coefficient is 6 the weathering parameter also referenced the operational experience parameter configurations of bunker fuel which was validated during many accidents before 4 scenarios it s well known that the influence of wind and current on the drifting trajectory of oil film is vital jorda et al 2007 in fact the released time of oil spill is also very important in order to reveal the major sources of the system and improve the accuracy of the forecasting system we designed five numeric simulation scenarios table 2 4 1 scenario 1 we used the operational 2 dimensional oil spill forecasting system of nmefc for nwp which the hourly wind forecasting data was from the nwp operational wind forecasting system of the nmefc and the hourly current forecasting data was from the nwp operational 3 d current forecasting system of nmefc from 15 january to 19 january we assumed that 1000 oil particles were released instantaneously in the oil films area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january which is the gray region in fig 1 4 2 scenario 2 in scenario 2 in order to eliminate the incoming error of wind we projected to use the observation wind speed instead of the forecasting wind data to force the model we collected twenty two observation data points of wind supplied by the cleaning ship around the sunken tanker location from 15th to 19th in january 2018 but we only had the observation data of wind around the sunken tanker location and the time of observation wind data was very discontinuous therefore the observation wind data do not fit to force the oil spill model directly the medium range forecast products of ecmwf are also used frequently during the operational forecasting it provides meteorological information every 6 h throughout the first 10 days the wind speed at 10 m is shown as an instantaneous forecast value in m s in the 10 day forecasting results ivan 2015 fig 4 is the comparison of wind vector of ecmwf forecasting wind wrf forecasting wind of nmefc and observed wind fig 5 is the comparisons of wind speed and wind direction error time series between the ecmwf forecasting wind and wrf forecasting wind of nmefc the mean relative absolute error of ecmwf forecasting wind speed and wrf forecasting wind speed of nmefc are 0 19 and 0 31 the absolute error of ecmwf and wrf of nmefc forecasting wind direction are 24 49 and 29 the comparison results show that the ecmwf forecasting wind is more agree with the observation wind than the nmefc forecasting wind if we use ecmwf forecasting wind to force the oil spill mode it will weaken the wind incoming error therefore in scenario 2 we used the ecmwf forecasting wind data to force the oil spill model the current data still used the nwp operational 3 d current forecasting system of nmefc from 15 january to 19 january one thousand oil particles are released instantaneously in the oil slicks area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january 4 3 scenario 3 and scenario 4 after the evaluation of the effects of wind forcing on oil spill trajectory we investigated the current forcing on spill modeling first due to the lacking of measured current data we couldn t validated and corrected the current data second to our knowledge the hindcast results are better than forecasting results third we had none of hindcast current data of nmefc during the accident but gofs3 0 the global ocean forecast system 3 0 hindcast current data and gofs3 1 the global ocean forecast system 3 1 hindcast current data can be downloaded to further weaken the current incoming error after weakening the wind incoming error we used the ecmwf forecasting wind data gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 hindcast current data separately to force the oil spill model of nmefc we recorded the two scenarios separately as scenario 3 and scenario 4 one thousand oil particles are released instantaneously in the oil slicks area observed by satellite at 6 19 on 15 january gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 are both based on hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model and ncoda the navy coupled ocean data assimilation in this paper we use the water temperature eastward sea water velocity and northward sea water velocity variables data of surface sea of glbu0 08 expt 91 2 data of gofs3 0 the glbu0 08 data is the native hycom analysis data converted to netcdf the data is interpolated to a uniform 0 08 lat lon grid between 80 48 s and 80 48 n and interpolated to 40 standard z levels and providing five variables fields the glbu0 08

information of the difference between gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 please see the gofs3 1 validation test report joseph et al 2017 in the report gofs3 1 is performing equal to or better than gofs3 0 and is recommended to become the next global operational system we designed two different hindcast current in order to investigate which one is performing better in the accident 4 4 scenario 5 based on the satellite observations it was indicated that the largest oil film observed on 16 19 january should be the largest oil film observed on 15 january but there are some other oil belt except the largest oil film in fig 1 in scenario 5 after weakening the wind and current incoming errors to further improve the accuracy of simulation results 10000 oil particles were released continuedly in intervals of 10 min at the sunken tanker position on the sea surface from 6 00 on 15 january to 6 00 on 19 january 5 results in the first scenario the oil film moved northeast before 14 19 on january 16 then turned to move southeast as shown in fig 6 a the modeled oil spill distribution zone closely resemble the main oil zone observed by satellite at 4 51 on january 16 with the center of the oil zone located about 5 1 km away from the observation but the two modeled oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone and pink dots zone were both in the southeast of main oil film zone observed at 17 42 on january 17 and at 5 30 on january 19 and the distance errors of the oil zone center were respectively 30 0 km and 59 4 km it was satisfactory that the distance error at about 23rd hour was 5 1 km but the results at about 36th hour and 96th hour did not agree well with observation in the second scenario the oil film moved northeast before 0 19 on 17 january then turned to move southeast as shown in fig 6b the modeled oil spill distribution zone light blue dots zone closely resemble the main oil zone observed by satellite at 4 51 on 16 january with the center of the oil zone located about 6 8 km away from the observation the modeled oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone was in the southeast of the observation at 17 42 on 17 january with the center of the oil zone located about 13 3 km away from the observation the modeled oil spill distribution zones pink dots zone located inside the observed main oil film zone at 5 30 on 19 january and the area of oil modeled distribution zone was obviously smaller than that of the observed main oil film zone the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 10 5 km comparing the distance errors at about 23rd hour 36th hour and 96th hour of scenario 1 with scenario 2 the results at about 23rd hour of scenario 1 were a little better than that of scenario 2 but the results at about 36th hour and 96th hour were obviously worse than that of scenario 2 overall the results of scenario 2 were obviously better than that of scenario 1 in the third scenario the oil film moved northwest before 6 00 on 16 january then turned to move northeast and turned again to southeast and was nearly motionless after 0 00 on 17 january as shown in fig 6c the oil spill distribution zone light blue dots zone was in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 4 51 on 16 january the distance error of the center of the oil zone was 16 5 km the oil spill distribution zones light green dots zone lied in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 17 42 on 17 january and it was near the observed main oil film zone the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 15 8 km the oil spill distribution zones pink dots zone lied in the northwest of the observed main oil film zone at 5 30 on 19 january the center position of it was almost the same as that of observed oil film at 17 42 on 17 january the area of oil distribution zone was obviously smaller than that of the observed main oil film zone at corresponding time the distance errors of the center of the oil zone was 26 3 km the oil distribution areas were all obviously smaller than that of the observed oil films on the sea surface at the different three moment in scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 especially at 5 30 on 19 january the oil film was stretched observed by satellite but the diffusion of oil particles were not obvious in scenario 1 scenario 2 and scenario 3 in the fourth scenario the direction of the simulating oil particles drifting trajectory was in the southeast of the sunken tanker location as in fig 6d the simulating results were worse than that of scenario 1 3 but in the scenario the oil distribution areas were better than that of other scenarios the oil particles spread on the surface the oil zone became a northwest southeast wide belt the shapes of the simulating oil zone in scenario 4 on 17 january and 19 january were better than that of the simulating oil zone in scenario 1 3 in the fifth scenario fig 7 shows us that the modeled results are basically agree with the observed distribution of oil films by satellite especially with that of the oil films observed at 5 30 on 19 january in fig 7a the oil particles directly move to northeast but there is a zigzag thin oil belt between the wide oil belt and the sunken tanker location in the satellite observation image while it is a straight line in the simulating results and the area of the wide oil belt is bigger than that of simulating results in fig 7b the direction of the oil belt of simulating results is firstly east and then turn to north while that of the satellite observation image is firstly southeast and turn to northwest although the shapes of the simulating oil belt and observation oil belt are both u shaped the locations of oil belts are mostly not same but near in fig 7c the simulating results are basically agree with the distribution of oil films observed by satellite but the simulating oil belt is continuous while the observed oil belt is intermittent and the locations of oil belts are mostly same 6 discussion overall five scenarios were conducted in this study as listed in table 2 the best results was the one when we used ecmwf and nwp to force the oil spill model of nmefc the results revealed that the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident 6 1 wind and current effects on oil drifting trajectories the satellite images showed that the drifting directions of the observed largest oil film basically accorded with the directions of observed wind during 15 19 january 2018 it revealed that the effect of current on the oil film drifting direction was relatively tiny while the effect of wind was vital during the accident but in scenario 3 and 4 the results showed us that the accuracy forecasting and simulation of current were also very important especially when the current speed was large and the current field had complicated vortex structure the current effect on the drifting trajectory of oil film was obvious we compared the differences between nwp forecasting current of nmefc gofs3 0 and gofs3 1 hindcast current around the sunken tanker location fig 8 shows that the sunken tanker location is near to kuroshio current it belongs to the complex vortex structure region caused by kuroshio current in fig 8 the kuroshio current speed of nwp forecasting current products is larger than that of other two hindcast current the kuroshio current speed of gofs3 1 hindcast current is the smallest in the nwp forecasting current filed of nmefc the left panel of fig 8 the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are northwest in 15 17 january 2018 then turn to northeast in 18 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location are north and northeast in 15 16 january 2018 and change to east and southeast in 17 19 january 2018 overall around the sunken tanker location the direction of ecmwf forecasting wind is northwest and north and turn to south and southwest during 17 19 january 2018 under the combined influence of wind and current the oil films firstly move to north then change to east and southeast following the current finally they would certainly move to mainstream axis area of kuroshio current fig 6b in the gofs3 0 hindcast current filed the middle panel of fig 8 the current structure is relatively stable and there is a cyclone in the area about 60 km northeast of the sunken tanker location which can be clearly seen especially in 18 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are north northeast and east in 15 19 january 2018 the direction of currents in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location are northwest in 15 january 2018 and turn to northeast in 16 17 january 2018 the oil films reach to the left of the cyclone area on 17 january 2018 under the influence of wind and current the wind direction is south they are blocked by the vortex they unable to move to east and disperse near the left of the cyclone area fig 6c in the gofs3 1 hindcast current filed the right panel of fig 8 the current structure is clearly different with that of the other ocean models in the area around of the sunken tanker location there are more complex vortex structures in the north and northeast region of the sunken tanker location the direction of ocean current is southeast in the south region of the sunken tanker location and turn to northeast in the southeast region of the sunken tanker location which is the mainstream axis area of kuroshio current the direction of currents in the area around of the sunken tanker location are south and southeast in 15 19 january 2018 so the oil films of the sunken tanker location move to southeast instead of north or northeast when they reach the mainstream axis area of kuroshio current they will move to northeast following the kuroshio current fig 6d 6 2 the importance of accuracy released time information of oil in general we can obtain relatively accuracy information about the location of oil spill but it is often difficult to get the accuracy time of oil released especially when the oils are released intermittent continuously or when the oil spills happen in deep ocean in scenario 5 when we assumed that oil particles were released continuedly from 6 00 on 15 january to 6 00 on 19 january instead of released instantaneously at 6 00 on 15 january we found the results were more consistent with the observation oil films information therefore we drew the conclusion that the released time information of oil is also very important the model results may be strongly influenced by the accuracy of release information in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by the oil spill simulating on all kinds of different released conditions 7 conclusions in this paper we designed five scenarios to simulate the oil drifting trajectory using the nmefc oil spill model forced by different wind and current data during the sanchi collision accident after the analysis of error source it was revealed that the error of wind and the inaccuracy released time of oil were the major error source of the nwp operational oil spill forecasting system of nmefc during the accident we can infer that the nwp forecasting current results in the accident region are the closest to the real situation the forecasting results in scenario 5 are the best results in the five scenarios the direction of oil drifting in scenario 4 is contrary to that of the observation results the effects of wind and current on the oil spill drifting trajectory are both vital the wind field structure is generally simple because of the flat ocean surface meanwhile the wind on ocean surface can be observed more easily than the current on ocean surface and we can use observed wind data to validate assimilate or optimize our wind forecasting model the accuracy of wind forecasting products can reach to an acceptable level ecmwf forecasting wind data had a better performance than wrf forecasting wind data of nmefc during the accident the accuracy of ocean surface current forecasting products can easily reach to the acceptable level in the offshore region where the tidal currents dominate in the complicated vortex region of kuroshio current the current forecasting becomes much more difficult to better understand the structure of kuroshio current and its surrounding areas with complex vortex structures it is suggested to further strengthen the observation so as to improve the prediction accuracy of material transport in ocean the released time information of oil is also very important the model results may be strongly influenced by the accuracy of release information in the event that this information is unavailable uncertainty analysis should be conducted by simulating the oil spill on all kinds of different released conditions funding this work was supported by national key research and development plan of
