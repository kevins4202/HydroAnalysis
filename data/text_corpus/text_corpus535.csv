2675,climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of storms in many world regions calling for new flood planning and management strategies the concept of flood drainage rights fdr or the legal rights of regions to drain floodwaters into river reaches is used in watershed planning in china quantifying the allocation of fdr remains challenging where some previous methods have resulted in unreasonable or impractical allocation plans due to incomplete consideration of driving factors or the use of unscientific allocation methods this study explores the allocation plan of fdr in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river watershed in china climatic variability and change have caused frequent flooding in portions of the basin with significant societal and economic implications first we comprehensively analyzed factors driving fdr for regions in the watershed following the conceptual flood resilience strategy currently being advocated for the region we considered natural socioeconomic governance resilience and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of fdr and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors second we quantified fdr values for flood prone regions in the middle and lower river reaches of this major river basin we introduced a specific deep learning method called the variational autoencoder vae model to quantify fdr allocation providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distribution of factors driving fdr allocation next using data from 2005 to 2019 this model was applied to the study area the allocation of fdr summing to 100 across five flood prone provinces of the watershed includes inner mongolia 9 36 shaanxi 10 00 shanxi 10 95 henan 32 58 and shandong 37 12 using the harmony evaluation method based on harmony theory we compared the new vae allocation method with three conventional allocation methods the vae allocation method has the highest degree of harmony suggesting that it is the most practical for fdr allocation and is a reasonable allocation for flood management such fdr can work with water conservancy engineering facilities as part of a comprehensive management system toward protecting public health minimizing economic losses and preserving functions of development and natural lands within floodplains of the yellow river keywords flood drainage rights flood resilience strategy deep learning variational autoencoder harmonious evaluation yellow river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has caused frequent extreme weather events in china over the past 30 years yang et al 2021 making cities progressively more vulnerable to devastating flooding islam 2016 the frequency and intensity of flooding have increased with significant societal and economic implications guan et al 2015 the yellow river is the second longest river in china it is characterized by numerous tributaries a dense water network and concentrated rainfall leading to severe floods in july 2021 henan province on the river s middle and lower reaches suffered catastrophic flooding that caused 302 deaths and a direct economic loss of us 17 7 billion 1 usd 6 45 cny seriously affecting the province s economic and social development the chinese central government has emphasized the need for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin jiang et al 2021 a key component is to improve flood emergency management capabilities that aim to reduce disastrous flooding and ensure social and economic stability examples of measures already implemented to reduce disastrous flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river include a series of major water conservancy projects that expand and improve flood prevention water diversion and irrigation and water storage liu et al 2013 these hard physical flood control measures are complemented by soft planning and management measures such as a relatively comprehensive flood risk management system for pre flood forecasting inter event flood dispatching and post event disaster assessment wan and wang 2011 although these measures have achieved clear results there remain limitations first water conservancy projects incorporate limited flood storage capacity and drainage needs cannot be met during extreme events concentrated rainfall causing drainage demand to exceed a river s flood discharge capacity can lead to disastrous flooding lai et al 2020 second the flood dispatch plan only considers regional hydrology and water volume as driving factors overlooking social economic and environmental factors in the flood drainage area for example in june 2019 china s anhui province experienced a severe flood disaster environmental factors were not considered during flood discharge and the flood containing pollutants were discharged into the hongze lake in jiangsu province in the lower reach resulting in serious losses for the aquaculture industry in hongze lake third flood dispatch units control only the flood discharge and storage of each water conservancy project control point and lack scientific planning for flood drainage capacity across the various regions in the basin during a period of flood risk collectively these issues have resulted in unclear unscientific or inequitable allocations of flood drainage rights fdr and benefits this has intensified flood drainage disputes between regions and increased societal losses caused by disastrous floods zhang et al 2019 currently flood control is advocated through a multi tiered flood resilience strategy frs de bruijn 2004a the essence of an frs is to use management methods addressing resilience along with water conservancy engineering facilities addressing resistance to minimize losses from flooding de bruijn 2004b described the frs concept as managing risk to allow temporary inundation of large areas while adjusting land use to minimize damage hartmann and driessen 2017 described flood risk management as rationally planning the landscape and its use and employing engineering technology to reduce flood losses francesch huidobro et al 2017 stated that an frs has an essential impact on improving city disaster resilience morrison et al 2019 noted that the frs is a sustainable integrated method for managing land use and water resources and is conducive to environmental protection liao 2012 considered the frs to be flexible and thus adaptable to the uncertainties of climate change overall risk management based on the frs incorporates management methods resilience and water conservancy engineering projects addressing resilience to develop an adaptive flood response as part of optimized flood management planning aiming to minimize losses from flooding this in turn provides a particular reference and new ideas for studying fdr allocation the use of fdr in flood response is based on the concept of frs which is the use of the soft measures of management to control the direction of floods whereby flood management involves the rational allocation of fdr among various regions within the same basin zhang et al 2021 due to the characteristics of china s administrative management system and china s national conditions each administrative unit is responsible for flood control issues within its area the premise of the implementation of the fdr plan is that the flood disaster has affected many administrative units of provinces cities and counties in the disaster area since flood disasters are characterized by high speed and broad basin areas all flood prone administrative regions will compete for rights to flood drainage to protect their interests the drainage capacity of the river channel is regarded as a scarce resource and to improve its utilization efficiency fdr allocation is a useful tool to allocate the scarce resources and regulate the drainage volume from regions to the river channel therefore an fdr allocation is designed before flood disasters occur fdr is allocated to each province which should conduct flood drainage according to the assigned amount of fdr through the using of water conservancy projects or areas with water storage functions such as flood storage and detention areas floodplain areas and flood channels shifting the location of peak water flows and allowing flooding in certain areas for a certain period can effectively manage flood discharge flood storage and flood detention to reduce damage and preserve society and development zhang and shen 2019 the high level government in the basin has the leadership function of overall planning making the fdr plan and supervising the flood drainage behavior of the local government the local government is responsible for the higher level government and has the function of strictly implementing the fdr policy therefore it is necessary for the high level government and the local government to closely cooperate to minimize the losses from flood disasters at present fdr related research is still in the theoretical research stage and various works have explored fdr allocation methods shen et al 2019 constructed an fdr allocation model for the jiangsu section of the huaihe river basin which considered equity efficiency and history when allocating fdr for each region within the basin the reliability of the scheme was then confirmed through the analysis of a case study zhang et al 2020a constructed an indicator system for the allocation of fdr based on fairness efficiency and sustainable development and the fdr allocation model employed the entropy weight technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and considered a case study of the jiangsu section of the huaihe river basin the proposed scheme showed a high degree of harmony and met the flood drainage needs of various regions in the basin avoided conflicts surrounding flood discharge between regions and promoted the harmonious development of the basin sun et al 2020 used the entropy based matter element model to study the allocation of drainage rights for the sunan canal showing that the allocation result was optimal zhang et al 2021 constructed a two stage fdr allocation model which includes the interval multi objective allocation model based on the projection method and the harmonious diagnosis and readjustment model then studied fdr allocation in the jiangsu section of the southern sun canal the study results show that losses can be significantly reduced during flood disasters by allocating the fdr of the four cities in the region at the same time the pre allocation plan is adjusted based on the harmony theory which improves the practicality of the fdr allocation plan previous studies indicate that by planning the fdr of each region in the watershed an appropriate flood drainage plan can be achieved and agreed upon the flood drainage conflict between regions can be avoided to the utmost extent the corresponding responsibilities of each province can be clarified and the snatch of resources such as flood discharge channels among regions can be reduced therefore it is necessary to allocate fdr to each region in carefully designed planning prior works have laid a solid foundation for this research although with some limitations first the factors influencing the allocation of fdr have not been comprehensively investigated only basic factors such as fairness efficiency and sustainable development are currently considered during the allocation of fdr and the frs concept and the government s macro control factors have been overlooked at the same time the chinese government plays a leading role in fdr allocation and neglecting macro control factors will inevitably affect the comprehensiveness of any system for managing fdr a second limitation comes from fdr allocation models mainly considering a single factor or using mathematical models based on multi objective optimization prior methods have shortcomings in being too subjective and not accurately reflecting the basic principles of a large quantity of high dimensional and nonlinear data therefore the allocation methods lack precision and accuracy and they are not well adapted to multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal fdr allocation third the research areas of previous studies on the allocation of fdr are all small watersheds at the city level under the background of climate change the intensity and frequency of flood disasters are gradually increasing throughout the large yellow river basin it is necessary to expand the research area to a larger scale where the provincial level better matches the administrative responsibility for flood control fourth no relevant research has considered fdr in the yellow river basin since the chinese government established the top level objective of ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin and the regional fdr remains unclear to address these problems this study considers the frs for the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin as an example as these areas frequently flood the indicator system constructed considers the allocation principles of nature socioeconomic factors resilience government control and resistance given the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distribution characteristics of the factors in planning fdr allocation deep learning methods are promising in addressing complex fdr allocation plans deep learning methods have performed well in dealing with similar problems of resource allocation due to their powerful functions of conducting nonlinear dimensionality reduction on complex datasets shen et al 2019 siade et al 2020 therefore to obtain a more reasonable fdr allocation plan we have introduced a deep learning method i e the variational autoencoder vae model to cope with the above mentioned challenges of fdr allocation finally based on data from 2005 to 2019 the proposed model was applied to the study area this area was chosen with the aim to address the current lack of scientific planning of its regional flood drainage and so reduce regional conflicts concerning flood drainage balance the flood drainage interests of various regions clarify the corresponding responsibilities of each province reduce losses to flooding and optimize flood drainage the proposed model may fulfill the government s top level objective protect the smooth operation of the area s society and economy and thus promote high quality development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the world s fifth longest river and its basin was the cradle of the ancient chinese civilization fig 1 the study area comprises the river s middle and lower reaches from hekou town in inner mongolia to the bohai sea their combined length of 1 992 km accounts for 36 46 of the river s total length this section of the basin covers an area of 367 000 km2 i e 46 04 of the basin s total area the basin has a vital strategic position in china in addition to its historical significance it is endowed with political economic and cultural value socioeconomics the study area has a high population high population density and a high level of urban development from the dmsp ols night light satellite images in fig 2 it can be seen that the region is developing continuously from 1995 to 2020 and its population is mainly concentrated in the lower reaches agriculture and industry are the main economic activities and the area is a substantial food production base for the nation its economic development is not homogeneous i e the lower reaches are comparatively more developed than the middle reaches fig 2 therefore to minimize the impact of floods it is urgent to formulate a fair allocation plan for fdr natural climate the study area spans five provinces inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong the terrain is high in the west and low in the east the area has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate with rainfall concentrated during a hot summer annual precipitation is 400 800 mm across most of the basin most 70 falls in july and august this area is characterized by numerous tributaries unstable flow large seasonal changes summer floods and high sand content floods the concentrated summer rainfall high number of tributaries and huge quantities of sand and water cause frequent flooding in the study area in recent decades there have been eight extremely disastrous floods in 1954 1957 1958 1977 1982 1996 2003 and 2021 floods have had a severe impact on the area causing great social and economic losses 2 2 methods 2 2 1 factors influencing fdr allocation the allocation of fdr among regions in a river basin is complex and must consider a diversity of factors such as geography hydrology social development economic development ecology and government policies the factors are distributed unevenly and irregularly across the regions we used generalized gradient theory to analyze the factors influencing fdr allocation ensure wide coverage of fdr allocation and consider the different levels of development in each region li and zhao 2008 this theory is a diversified multi dimensional approach that applies to the special conditions of china which include large regional developmental disparities and diverse and complex gradient connotations the theory can be extended to multiple fields and can diversify the gradient subsystems of a system as needed xie and li 2004 by summarizing the existing literature on flood planning and allocation we classified factors influencing fdr allocation into five categories nature socioeconomic conditions governance resilience and resistance descriptions of these factors and their importance are presented below 1 natural factors natural factors occur unevenly across a watershed and can vary with time zhang et al 2020a different areas have varying natural and hydrological conditions such as the size of the administrative area the share of the watershed and annual rainfall natural factors represent the primary conditions of each region and must be fully considered to ensure fair fdr allocation syme et al 1999 2 socioeconomic factors economic and social development vary across a watershed and flooding will thus cause spatially different degrees of damage factors such as gdp population density per capita disposable income of residents and urban construction conditions could largely reflect the social and economic conditions of the region the level of economic and social development is related to flood drainage efficiency keller and keller 1995 and the marginal losses suffered by highly developed areas are more significant than those suffered by less developed areas bennett et al 2000 from the perspective of minimizing the overall loss of protection of the watershed regions with higher economic and social development require more fdr this will lead to regions requiring different rights 3 resilience factors resilience refers to the ease with which flood prone areas and rivers socioeconomic and physical characteristics can recover from floods klijn et al 2004 the resilience of a region to flooding risk is primarily determined by its land use and land cover e g the greening rate in the built up area forest coverage size of floodplain area and afforestation area and stormwater management infrastructure measurement of the resilience of regions facing flooding is crucial flood losses can be reduced by changing land use e g deforestation or reforestation and urban spatial planning e g flooding area laeni et al 2019 land uses and spatial planning will vary among regions and those with stronger resilience will need fewer fdr 4 governance factors although the market can efficiently allocate resources it is also prone to failure deng et al 2017 government departments and policies play a pivotal role in flood control and disaster relief among them the higher level government is responsible for the overall planning coordination and supervision the local government has the functions of implementing policies and feedback information therefore the government must apply macro controls strengthen its role in allocating scarce resources and facilitate leadership by government organizations li and luo 2006 roles status and functions of governmental control differ among various regions in a watershed this leads to variable degrees of policy support and capital aggregation and regions favored by governmental control can obtain more fdr 5 resistance factors resistance factors of a region mainly refer to hydraulic engineering projects that guard against flooding e g dams dikes embankments drainage pipes and weirs and keep floods away from human communities driessen et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to measure the resistance of each region as regions with more robust resistance will need fewer fdr 2 2 2 indicator system based on the influencing factors we established an indicator system for fdr allocation based on five subsystems one for each influencing factor considering the characteristics of the study area we selected 26 indicators to reflect these factors table 1 the indicators were selected based on their conceptual clarity definition and meaning data reliability and availability mutual independence and ease of calculation han et al 2021 2 2 3 model construction we first used the vae deep learning method to allocate fdr evaluation of the harmony between the vae method and other commonly used fdr allocation methods verified the scientific quality and harmony of the proposed allocation scheme the calculation process is shown in fig 3 1 vae model the allocation of fdr is influenced by socioeconomic natural environmental and government policy it is a typical high dimensional nonlinear non normal system decision making problem methods such as traditional classification weighting analytic hierarchy processing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy processing encounter shortcomings such as strong subjective arbitrariness diao and cui 2017 the autoencoder extracted high level abstract features of the sample layer by layer by constructing a multi layer unsupervised neural network model yan and han 2018 and then mapping the abstract features to the desired output through the classifier or regression algorithm kingma and welling 2014 the autoencoder model can extract features from unlabeled data using a few layers only which is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms huang et al 2020 as a typical unsupervised deep learning model the vae model is a special type of artificial neural network used to learn data encodings with simple training easy multi layer stacking and excellent generalization this statistical method aims to learn a lower dimensional representation encoding from the analysis of higher dimensional data by training the network to capture important parts of the system pu et al 2016 the method also can extract effective information from unlabeled data and perform nonlinear compression and reconstruction of input data khoshaman et al 2018 vae has advantages in solving problems with small sample sizes and ultra high dimensionality mahmud and fu 2019 which is the case of this study therefore we introduced the vae to allocate fdr following the procedure shown in fig 4 a detailed explanation of the calculation steps of the vae method is presented below following the basic principles of vae articulated by kingma and welling 2014 and related literature e g dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b vae converts data into statistical distribution parameters mean μ and standard deviation σ and then uses them to select an element at random from the latent variable space and decode it into the original input vae uses autoencoder networks to fit the generative and inferred models simultaneously the inference model is the coding layer in the autoencoder and the generative model is the decoding layer in the autoencoder first we preprocessed the data with the min max normalization method and supposed a data set x x 1 x 2 x n with all data distributed independently and the logarithmic maximum likelihood method estimated the parameters as follows 1 lg p θ x x 2 x n i 1 n lg p θ x i then the recognition model q ϕ z x i fitted the true posterior distribution p θ z x i moreover the kullback leibler kl divergence was used to measure the similarity of the two distributions 2 k l q ϕ z x i p θ z x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i lg p θ x i equations 1 2 lead to the edge likelihood formula of a single sample 3 lg p θ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z x i ι θ ϕ x i 4 ι θ ϕ x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i since the kl divergence here was non negative when the two distributions are consistent the kl divergence was 0 and lg p θ x i ι θ ϕ x i can be obtained where ι θ ϕ x i as the variational lower bound of the log likelihood function the optimization goals of vae were as follows 5 ι θ ϕ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z e q ϕ z x i lg p θ x i z according to the monte carlo method for parameter estimation if zq ϕ z x i was known and when q ϕ z x i was differentiable there was z g ϕ δ x where δ was an auxiliary variable the estimate from equation 5 was 6 ι θ ϕ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z 1 l l 1 l lg p x i z i l the lower bound of the log likelihood function could be estimated by mini batch as follows 7 ι θ ϕ x i ι m θ ϕ x m n m i 1 m ι θ ϕ x i minimizing equation 7 made our posterior distribution p θ z x i continuously approach the true posterior distribution p θ z x i the encoder obtained the real characteristics of the data then we configured the fdr of each region by first calculating the bias variance tradeoff 8 z i x i e 1 σ x where σ indicates the standard deviation the predicted value was then converted into a probability distribution by applying a normalized exponential function calculation softmax function to the data 9 softmax z i e z i c 1 c e zc where zi is the output value of the ith node and c is the number of output nodes i e the number of categories of classification the multi accumulated output values can be converted into a probability distribution with a range of 0 1 and a sum equal to 1 finally the average predicted value could be calculated and this corresponded to the results of fdr allocation 2 harmony evaluation model the chinese government s current national strategy is building a socialist harmonious society fdr allocation should consider the harmony of the results which would also be conducive to the promotion and implementation of the fdr allocation scheme accordingly to test the harmony and practicability of the allocation results zuo et al 2013 we used equations 10 13 to evaluate the results of different allocation schemes zuo et al 2018 10 p k 1 j 1 m β j max β j 2 1 2 11 p k 2 j 1 m β j min β j 2 1 2 12 p k 3 j 1 m max β j min β j 2 1 2 13 h k p k 1 p k 2 p k 1 p k 3 where p k 1 is the distance between the fdr of area j and the ideal fdr in plan k p k 2 is the distance between the fdr of area j and the lowest fdr in plan k p k 3 is the distance between the ideal fdr and the lowest fdr of area j in plan k and h k is the overall harmony degree of plan k k 1 2 3 and β j is the allocation ratio of fdr in area j j 1 n β j 1 2 2 4 data sources this study considered data from the five provinces spanning the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 economic social and environmental data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook series national bureau of statistics of china 2005 2019 hydrological data were obtained from the china water conservancy yearbook series ministry of water resources of china 2005 2019 and the yellow river yearbook series yellow river conservancy committee of the ministry of water resources 2005 2019 data on urban construction and water conservancy projects were from the china urban statistical yearbook series urban bureau of statistics of china 2005 2019 and were provided by the planning bureau of the yellow river water conservancy commission information regarding government policy comes from the evaluation and assignment of the management staff of the yellow river water conservancy commission personal communication in our calculation process data from these sources for each indicator of 23 from each province of 5 were input to the vae model year by year for 15 consecutive years 2005 2019 which characterizes the evolution of each indicator over time 3 results according to the characteristics of the study area and dataset the vae model in this study includes an encoder network and a decoder network both of which are 3 layer peer to peer fully connected autoencoder networks the network structure is shown in fig 5 the entire training process is an unsupervised learning process and the total number of parameters of the autoencoder network is 10 345 the encoder of vae implements the feature extraction function the encoder is composed of a two layer fully connected neural network with neurons of 128 and 16 in the two layer neural network respectively and the activation function is relu parameters μ and σ are the expectation and variance respectively extracted from the input data through the encoder structure z is the extracted feature value and the decoder is the equivalent reverse structure of the encoder finally use the sigmoid function to normalize the output to 0 1 to match the original data the vae model calculated fdr for the study area data for each year for each of the five provinces were input to the network with encoding through the training processes indicated by equations 1 7 to extract the features of the data the feature extraction value essentially represents the value of the high dimensional data after dimensionality reduction as shown in table 2 an epoch is a term used in deep learning and indicates the number of passes of the entire training dataset that the deep learning algorithm has completed fig 6 indicates that when the vae model was trained with different batch sizes different batch sizes had nearly the same convergence interval for the loss value thus the relationship between the training loss and epoch varied little indicating that the batch size has limited influence on the training results the softmax function was used to convert the predicted value into a probability distribution by using equation 9 after that the fdr result is obtained by accumulating and averaging table 3 to get a more stable final result we performed 200 epochs it was found that the data began to converge at 120 epochs and finally after 200 epochs the fdr values of the five provinces tended to stabilize fig 7 at this time the final convergent fdr allocation plan was obtained through cumulative average the results of the fdr allocation plan are shown in fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the fdr allocation results calculation using the vae model determined an fdr allocation ratio for the five provinces of inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong of 9 36 10 00 10 95 32 58 and 37 12 respectively there is considerable variation across the provinces shandong and henan have allocations each over 30 far exceeding those of the other three provinces while those of inner mongolia and shaanxi are considerably smaller not exceeding 10 the large differences in allocations came from the considerable differences in the provinces basic data shandong shandong province has a high fdr allocation 37 12 because it is the most economically developed of the five provinces in the study area looking at the fdr allocation indicators the values for s1 s3 s4 and s5 related to the economy are the highest among the five provinces confirming that shandong has the highest level of economic development which is dominated by agriculture and industry being the latter the most highly developed in the nation shandong therefore has the largest fdr allocation to minimize the basin s overall economic losses and ensure minimal disruption to the region s society and economy the values of ra1 ra4 and ra6 e g resilience factor for shandong are the highest among the five provinces indicating that this province has a strong environmental protection capacity discharging floodwater in some provinces can pollute the basin environment because of soil erosion or sewage discharge in this regard shandong should obtain more fdr because of its capability for environmental protection finally shandong having the highest values of g4 and g5 indicates that it has been the most affected by disastrous flooding over the years and therefore needs substantial fdr to protect its economy and people s lives overall shandong is allocated the most fdr among the five provinces henan henan province is allocated the second largest amount of fdr 32 58 because it has the highest value of s2 among the five provinces china is a people oriented country accordingly during floods the country places great importance on the protection of people s lives and property as henan is an important agricultural region it must be protected to ensure china s food security meanwhile henan province has the largest annual rainfall n2 and the highest government attention g2 for these reasons the province has the second highest fdr allocation shaanxi and shanxi these provinces are similar with the third and fourth highest allocations respectively both provinces are similar in size population density and greening rate in the built up area in detail although shanxi has the smallest gpd among the five provinces its four indicators for flood resilience were the smallest indicating that this province has the worst flood control capacity the implementation of water conservancy projects resistance factor in shanxi is poor and it cannot rely on reservoirs or drainage pipes for storing or discharging flood water therefore this province must obtain some rights to discharge floodwater into the yellow river to reduce flood losses inner mongolia inner mongolia has the smallest of the five fdr allocations at only 9 36 although this province has the largest watershed area and encompasses the greatest extent of the yellow river it has the lowest level of economic development and the lowest population density inner mongolia has large floodplains to naturally discharge flood water thus minimizing flood damage in the local area therefore inner mongolia has the lowest need for fdr among the five provinces 4 2 comparison with other fdr allocation methods the choice of allocation method has a substantial effect on the allocation results we compared the vae proposed here plan a with three other methods common decision making methods for fdr allocation include allocation by fairness plan b efficiency plan c and considering both fairness and efficiency plan d fairness allocation involves calculating the absolute average of all indicators in an area to obtain the fdr allocation results efficiency allocation considers the regions economic situation and emphasizes flood drainage efficiency finally allocation combining the two methods yields the final allocation through a weighted average calculation fig 9 presents the fdr allocations using all four methods the different principles underlying the four methods explains the large variation in their results plan b yields the smallest difference in allocations among the five provinces with the range between the highest allocation for shandong and the lowest for shanxi being only 13 66 percentage points this allocation is fair but it is not scientific for example the high allocation for inner mongolia is due to its large size and large watershed area despite there being a small population and low population density considering resilience inner mongolia has many flood plains and unused land that could be submerged with little consequence thus giving it great potential for discharging retaining flood water therefore considering only fairness and ignoring drainage efficiency and resilience will lead to low flood drainage efficiency and ultimately lower social welfare therefore a method using only fairness is not optimal plan c also has certain drawbacks it focuses on flood drainage efficiency and the fdr allocation is based on the economic development of each region shandong thus receives more fdr as its economy is the most developed although this method maximizes flood drainage efficiency it ignores other factors henan province is one of the most populous provinces in china it is china s grain base and its annual wheat output accounts for a quarter of the country s annual production at the same time henan province is located in the center of china and is the transportation hub of china therefore henan province plays an important role in the yellow river basin and even the whole country it receives a high degree of government attention and it has the highest population density yet its economic development is lower than in shandong this results in the province having an fdr allocation that is 10 99 percentage points lower than that of shandong finally scheme d considers both fairness and efficiency and it thus represents a significant improvement over schemes c and b however this scheme ignores environmental factors and the concept of resilience which leads to certain deficiencies in fdr allocation proper consideration of flood drainage should take environmental protection into account inner mongolia shanxi and shaanxi are rich in resources such as coal with greater exploitation of these resources than in other provinces resulting in severe water and soil loss a higher fdr allocation to these three provinces would pollute the entire downstream basin given the national aim of high quality development of the yellow river a particularly polluting fdr allocation should be adjusted furthermore if resilience is considered inner mongolia would require a smaller fdr allocation because it contains vast sparsely populated flood plains overall fdr allocation varies markedly according to the selected allocation method comparing these methods demonstrates that the fdr allocation plan proposed in this paper considers various factors in the watershed which overcomes the shortcomings of other fdr allocation plans and can reduce the loss of flood disasters to the watershed as much as possible therefore ideal fdr allocation has to account for a range of factors the interests of all parties and environmental protection to maximize the efficiency of water conservancy projects reduce flood induced losses and ultimately maximize social welfare 4 3 harmonious evaluation of different methods next harmony evaluation was applied to the four different fdr allocation schemes the results in tables 4 and 5 and fig 10 show that the harmony values of plans a b c and d are 0 85 0 80 0 72 and 0 75 respectively and thus that the vae fdr allocation scheme plan a proposed here has higher harmony than the other schemes following harmony theory the low degree of harmony of the other methods is due to their one sided consideration conversely the scheme proposed here promotes the study region s harmonious development by meeting the five provinces flood drainage needs the scheme s harmony also facilitates the acceptance and implementation of the fdr allocation 5 conclusions climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of storms in the yellow river basin of china calling for new strategies for flood planning and management this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the factors driving fdr allocation we considered natural socioeconomic governance resilience and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of fdr and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors considering a broader range of important indicators than have traditionally been used in allocation methods should increase the reliability of the fdr estimates our incorporation of the flood resilience concepts into the fdr allocation indicator system encouraged the rational use of floodplains and other areas to temporarily discharge and retain floodwater and promote flexibility in flood control strategies the government has an essential role in public disaster prevention and control thus we incorporated the government s macro control factors into the indicator system overall the allocation results obtained using this more comprehensive fdr allocation indicator system were the most reasonable and in line with the actual situation further we quantified fdr for regions in the middle and lower river reaches of the yellow river basin using a deep learning approach we developed a vae model providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distributions encountered during fdr allocation the method has a high degree of harmony suggesting that it is practical and thus conducive to its promotion and implementation overall it can achieve orderly flood drainage between provinces and promote the harmonious development of the whole region we acknowledge that research on fdr as a planning and management tool is still in the early stages and that other soft management strategies for flood management could be compared in future studies additional complexity such as the magnitudes and dynamics of flood events and the impact of climate change on regional flood responses could be considered toward updating reasonable and practicable fdr allocation plans for example typical flood events can be adopted as cases to reflect differing flood drainage processes and evaluate fdr allocation schemes the loss model could be used to calculate flood loss in each area and corresponding management measures can be determined to provide further science based references toward implementing the practice of fdr allocation by local governments credit authorship contribution statement kaize

2675,climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of storms in many world regions calling for new flood planning and management strategies the concept of flood drainage rights fdr or the legal rights of regions to drain floodwaters into river reaches is used in watershed planning in china quantifying the allocation of fdr remains challenging where some previous methods have resulted in unreasonable or impractical allocation plans due to incomplete consideration of driving factors or the use of unscientific allocation methods this study explores the allocation plan of fdr in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river watershed in china climatic variability and change have caused frequent flooding in portions of the basin with significant societal and economic implications first we comprehensively analyzed factors driving fdr for regions in the watershed following the conceptual flood resilience strategy currently being advocated for the region we considered natural socioeconomic governance resilience and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of fdr and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors second we quantified fdr values for flood prone regions in the middle and lower river reaches of this major river basin we introduced a specific deep learning method called the variational autoencoder vae model to quantify fdr allocation providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distribution of factors driving fdr allocation next using data from 2005 to 2019 this model was applied to the study area the allocation of fdr summing to 100 across five flood prone provinces of the watershed includes inner mongolia 9 36 shaanxi 10 00 shanxi 10 95 henan 32 58 and shandong 37 12 using the harmony evaluation method based on harmony theory we compared the new vae allocation method with three conventional allocation methods the vae allocation method has the highest degree of harmony suggesting that it is the most practical for fdr allocation and is a reasonable allocation for flood management such fdr can work with water conservancy engineering facilities as part of a comprehensive management system toward protecting public health minimizing economic losses and preserving functions of development and natural lands within floodplains of the yellow river keywords flood drainage rights flood resilience strategy deep learning variational autoencoder harmonious evaluation yellow river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change has caused frequent extreme weather events in china over the past 30 years yang et al 2021 making cities progressively more vulnerable to devastating flooding islam 2016 the frequency and intensity of flooding have increased with significant societal and economic implications guan et al 2015 the yellow river is the second longest river in china it is characterized by numerous tributaries a dense water network and concentrated rainfall leading to severe floods in july 2021 henan province on the river s middle and lower reaches suffered catastrophic flooding that caused 302 deaths and a direct economic loss of us 17 7 billion 1 usd 6 45 cny seriously affecting the province s economic and social development the chinese central government has emphasized the need for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin jiang et al 2021 a key component is to improve flood emergency management capabilities that aim to reduce disastrous flooding and ensure social and economic stability examples of measures already implemented to reduce disastrous flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river include a series of major water conservancy projects that expand and improve flood prevention water diversion and irrigation and water storage liu et al 2013 these hard physical flood control measures are complemented by soft planning and management measures such as a relatively comprehensive flood risk management system for pre flood forecasting inter event flood dispatching and post event disaster assessment wan and wang 2011 although these measures have achieved clear results there remain limitations first water conservancy projects incorporate limited flood storage capacity and drainage needs cannot be met during extreme events concentrated rainfall causing drainage demand to exceed a river s flood discharge capacity can lead to disastrous flooding lai et al 2020 second the flood dispatch plan only considers regional hydrology and water volume as driving factors overlooking social economic and environmental factors in the flood drainage area for example in june 2019 china s anhui province experienced a severe flood disaster environmental factors were not considered during flood discharge and the flood containing pollutants were discharged into the hongze lake in jiangsu province in the lower reach resulting in serious losses for the aquaculture industry in hongze lake third flood dispatch units control only the flood discharge and storage of each water conservancy project control point and lack scientific planning for flood drainage capacity across the various regions in the basin during a period of flood risk collectively these issues have resulted in unclear unscientific or inequitable allocations of flood drainage rights fdr and benefits this has intensified flood drainage disputes between regions and increased societal losses caused by disastrous floods zhang et al 2019 currently flood control is advocated through a multi tiered flood resilience strategy frs de bruijn 2004a the essence of an frs is to use management methods addressing resilience along with water conservancy engineering facilities addressing resistance to minimize losses from flooding de bruijn 2004b described the frs concept as managing risk to allow temporary inundation of large areas while adjusting land use to minimize damage hartmann and driessen 2017 described flood risk management as rationally planning the landscape and its use and employing engineering technology to reduce flood losses francesch huidobro et al 2017 stated that an frs has an essential impact on improving city disaster resilience morrison et al 2019 noted that the frs is a sustainable integrated method for managing land use and water resources and is conducive to environmental protection liao 2012 considered the frs to be flexible and thus adaptable to the uncertainties of climate change overall risk management based on the frs incorporates management methods resilience and water conservancy engineering projects addressing resilience to develop an adaptive flood response as part of optimized flood management planning aiming to minimize losses from flooding this in turn provides a particular reference and new ideas for studying fdr allocation the use of fdr in flood response is based on the concept of frs which is the use of the soft measures of management to control the direction of floods whereby flood management involves the rational allocation of fdr among various regions within the same basin zhang et al 2021 due to the characteristics of china s administrative management system and china s national conditions each administrative unit is responsible for flood control issues within its area the premise of the implementation of the fdr plan is that the flood disaster has affected many administrative units of provinces cities and counties in the disaster area since flood disasters are characterized by high speed and broad basin areas all flood prone administrative regions will compete for rights to flood drainage to protect their interests the drainage capacity of the river channel is regarded as a scarce resource and to improve its utilization efficiency fdr allocation is a useful tool to allocate the scarce resources and regulate the drainage volume from regions to the river channel therefore an fdr allocation is designed before flood disasters occur fdr is allocated to each province which should conduct flood drainage according to the assigned amount of fdr through the using of water conservancy projects or areas with water storage functions such as flood storage and detention areas floodplain areas and flood channels shifting the location of peak water flows and allowing flooding in certain areas for a certain period can effectively manage flood discharge flood storage and flood detention to reduce damage and preserve society and development zhang and shen 2019 the high level government in the basin has the leadership function of overall planning making the fdr plan and supervising the flood drainage behavior of the local government the local government is responsible for the higher level government and has the function of strictly implementing the fdr policy therefore it is necessary for the high level government and the local government to closely cooperate to minimize the losses from flood disasters at present fdr related research is still in the theoretical research stage and various works have explored fdr allocation methods shen et al 2019 constructed an fdr allocation model for the jiangsu section of the huaihe river basin which considered equity efficiency and history when allocating fdr for each region within the basin the reliability of the scheme was then confirmed through the analysis of a case study zhang et al 2020a constructed an indicator system for the allocation of fdr based on fairness efficiency and sustainable development and the fdr allocation model employed the entropy weight technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and considered a case study of the jiangsu section of the huaihe river basin the proposed scheme showed a high degree of harmony and met the flood drainage needs of various regions in the basin avoided conflicts surrounding flood discharge between regions and promoted the harmonious development of the basin sun et al 2020 used the entropy based matter element model to study the allocation of drainage rights for the sunan canal showing that the allocation result was optimal zhang et al 2021 constructed a two stage fdr allocation model which includes the interval multi objective allocation model based on the projection method and the harmonious diagnosis and readjustment model then studied fdr allocation in the jiangsu section of the southern sun canal the study results show that losses can be significantly reduced during flood disasters by allocating the fdr of the four cities in the region at the same time the pre allocation plan is adjusted based on the harmony theory which improves the practicality of the fdr allocation plan previous studies indicate that by planning the fdr of each region in the watershed an appropriate flood drainage plan can be achieved and agreed upon the flood drainage conflict between regions can be avoided to the utmost extent the corresponding responsibilities of each province can be clarified and the snatch of resources such as flood discharge channels among regions can be reduced therefore it is necessary to allocate fdr to each region in carefully designed planning prior works have laid a solid foundation for this research although with some limitations first the factors influencing the allocation of fdr have not been comprehensively investigated only basic factors such as fairness efficiency and sustainable development are currently considered during the allocation of fdr and the frs concept and the government s macro control factors have been overlooked at the same time the chinese government plays a leading role in fdr allocation and neglecting macro control factors will inevitably affect the comprehensiveness of any system for managing fdr a second limitation comes from fdr allocation models mainly considering a single factor or using mathematical models based on multi objective optimization prior methods have shortcomings in being too subjective and not accurately reflecting the basic principles of a large quantity of high dimensional and nonlinear data therefore the allocation methods lack precision and accuracy and they are not well adapted to multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal fdr allocation third the research areas of previous studies on the allocation of fdr are all small watersheds at the city level under the background of climate change the intensity and frequency of flood disasters are gradually increasing throughout the large yellow river basin it is necessary to expand the research area to a larger scale where the provincial level better matches the administrative responsibility for flood control fourth no relevant research has considered fdr in the yellow river basin since the chinese government established the top level objective of ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin and the regional fdr remains unclear to address these problems this study considers the frs for the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river basin as an example as these areas frequently flood the indicator system constructed considers the allocation principles of nature socioeconomic factors resilience government control and resistance given the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distribution characteristics of the factors in planning fdr allocation deep learning methods are promising in addressing complex fdr allocation plans deep learning methods have performed well in dealing with similar problems of resource allocation due to their powerful functions of conducting nonlinear dimensionality reduction on complex datasets shen et al 2019 siade et al 2020 therefore to obtain a more reasonable fdr allocation plan we have introduced a deep learning method i e the variational autoencoder vae model to cope with the above mentioned challenges of fdr allocation finally based on data from 2005 to 2019 the proposed model was applied to the study area this area was chosen with the aim to address the current lack of scientific planning of its regional flood drainage and so reduce regional conflicts concerning flood drainage balance the flood drainage interests of various regions clarify the corresponding responsibilities of each province reduce losses to flooding and optimize flood drainage the proposed model may fulfill the government s top level objective protect the smooth operation of the area s society and economy and thus promote high quality development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river is the world s fifth longest river and its basin was the cradle of the ancient chinese civilization fig 1 the study area comprises the river s middle and lower reaches from hekou town in inner mongolia to the bohai sea their combined length of 1 992 km accounts for 36 46 of the river s total length this section of the basin covers an area of 367 000 km2 i e 46 04 of the basin s total area the basin has a vital strategic position in china in addition to its historical significance it is endowed with political economic and cultural value socioeconomics the study area has a high population high population density and a high level of urban development from the dmsp ols night light satellite images in fig 2 it can be seen that the region is developing continuously from 1995 to 2020 and its population is mainly concentrated in the lower reaches agriculture and industry are the main economic activities and the area is a substantial food production base for the nation its economic development is not homogeneous i e the lower reaches are comparatively more developed than the middle reaches fig 2 therefore to minimize the impact of floods it is urgent to formulate a fair allocation plan for fdr natural climate the study area spans five provinces inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong the terrain is high in the west and low in the east the area has a typical warm temperate continental monsoon climate with rainfall concentrated during a hot summer annual precipitation is 400 800 mm across most of the basin most 70 falls in july and august this area is characterized by numerous tributaries unstable flow large seasonal changes summer floods and high sand content floods the concentrated summer rainfall high number of tributaries and huge quantities of sand and water cause frequent flooding in the study area in recent decades there have been eight extremely disastrous floods in 1954 1957 1958 1977 1982 1996 2003 and 2021 floods have had a severe impact on the area causing great social and economic losses 2 2 methods 2 2 1 factors influencing fdr allocation the allocation of fdr among regions in a river basin is complex and must consider a diversity of factors such as geography hydrology social development economic development ecology and government policies the factors are distributed unevenly and irregularly across the regions we used generalized gradient theory to analyze the factors influencing fdr allocation ensure wide coverage of fdr allocation and consider the different levels of development in each region li and zhao 2008 this theory is a diversified multi dimensional approach that applies to the special conditions of china which include large regional developmental disparities and diverse and complex gradient connotations the theory can be extended to multiple fields and can diversify the gradient subsystems of a system as needed xie and li 2004 by summarizing the existing literature on flood planning and allocation we classified factors influencing fdr allocation into five categories nature socioeconomic conditions governance resilience and resistance descriptions of these factors and their importance are presented below 1 natural factors natural factors occur unevenly across a watershed and can vary with time zhang et al 2020a different areas have varying natural and hydrological conditions such as the size of the administrative area the share of the watershed and annual rainfall natural factors represent the primary conditions of each region and must be fully considered to ensure fair fdr allocation syme et al 1999 2 socioeconomic factors economic and social development vary across a watershed and flooding will thus cause spatially different degrees of damage factors such as gdp population density per capita disposable income of residents and urban construction conditions could largely reflect the social and economic conditions of the region the level of economic and social development is related to flood drainage efficiency keller and keller 1995 and the marginal losses suffered by highly developed areas are more significant than those suffered by less developed areas bennett et al 2000 from the perspective of minimizing the overall loss of protection of the watershed regions with higher economic and social development require more fdr this will lead to regions requiring different rights 3 resilience factors resilience refers to the ease with which flood prone areas and rivers socioeconomic and physical characteristics can recover from floods klijn et al 2004 the resilience of a region to flooding risk is primarily determined by its land use and land cover e g the greening rate in the built up area forest coverage size of floodplain area and afforestation area and stormwater management infrastructure measurement of the resilience of regions facing flooding is crucial flood losses can be reduced by changing land use e g deforestation or reforestation and urban spatial planning e g flooding area laeni et al 2019 land uses and spatial planning will vary among regions and those with stronger resilience will need fewer fdr 4 governance factors although the market can efficiently allocate resources it is also prone to failure deng et al 2017 government departments and policies play a pivotal role in flood control and disaster relief among them the higher level government is responsible for the overall planning coordination and supervision the local government has the functions of implementing policies and feedback information therefore the government must apply macro controls strengthen its role in allocating scarce resources and facilitate leadership by government organizations li and luo 2006 roles status and functions of governmental control differ among various regions in a watershed this leads to variable degrees of policy support and capital aggregation and regions favored by governmental control can obtain more fdr 5 resistance factors resistance factors of a region mainly refer to hydraulic engineering projects that guard against flooding e g dams dikes embankments drainage pipes and weirs and keep floods away from human communities driessen et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to measure the resistance of each region as regions with more robust resistance will need fewer fdr 2 2 2 indicator system based on the influencing factors we established an indicator system for fdr allocation based on five subsystems one for each influencing factor considering the characteristics of the study area we selected 26 indicators to reflect these factors table 1 the indicators were selected based on their conceptual clarity definition and meaning data reliability and availability mutual independence and ease of calculation han et al 2021 2 2 3 model construction we first used the vae deep learning method to allocate fdr evaluation of the harmony between the vae method and other commonly used fdr allocation methods verified the scientific quality and harmony of the proposed allocation scheme the calculation process is shown in fig 3 1 vae model the allocation of fdr is influenced by socioeconomic natural environmental and government policy it is a typical high dimensional nonlinear non normal system decision making problem methods such as traditional classification weighting analytic hierarchy processing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy processing encounter shortcomings such as strong subjective arbitrariness diao and cui 2017 the autoencoder extracted high level abstract features of the sample layer by layer by constructing a multi layer unsupervised neural network model yan and han 2018 and then mapping the abstract features to the desired output through the classifier or regression algorithm kingma and welling 2014 the autoencoder model can extract features from unlabeled data using a few layers only which is more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms huang et al 2020 as a typical unsupervised deep learning model the vae model is a special type of artificial neural network used to learn data encodings with simple training easy multi layer stacking and excellent generalization this statistical method aims to learn a lower dimensional representation encoding from the analysis of higher dimensional data by training the network to capture important parts of the system pu et al 2016 the method also can extract effective information from unlabeled data and perform nonlinear compression and reconstruction of input data khoshaman et al 2018 vae has advantages in solving problems with small sample sizes and ultra high dimensionality mahmud and fu 2019 which is the case of this study therefore we introduced the vae to allocate fdr following the procedure shown in fig 4 a detailed explanation of the calculation steps of the vae method is presented below following the basic principles of vae articulated by kingma and welling 2014 and related literature e g dai et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b vae converts data into statistical distribution parameters mean μ and standard deviation σ and then uses them to select an element at random from the latent variable space and decode it into the original input vae uses autoencoder networks to fit the generative and inferred models simultaneously the inference model is the coding layer in the autoencoder and the generative model is the decoding layer in the autoencoder first we preprocessed the data with the min max normalization method and supposed a data set x x 1 x 2 x n with all data distributed independently and the logarithmic maximum likelihood method estimated the parameters as follows 1 lg p θ x x 2 x n i 1 n lg p θ x i then the recognition model q ϕ z x i fitted the true posterior distribution p θ z x i moreover the kullback leibler kl divergence was used to measure the similarity of the two distributions 2 k l q ϕ z x i p θ z x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i lg p θ x i equations 1 2 lead to the edge likelihood formula of a single sample 3 lg p θ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z x i ι θ ϕ x i 4 ι θ ϕ x i e q ϕ z x i lg q ϕ z x i p θ z x i since the kl divergence here was non negative when the two distributions are consistent the kl divergence was 0 and lg p θ x i ι θ ϕ x i can be obtained where ι θ ϕ x i as the variational lower bound of the log likelihood function the optimization goals of vae were as follows 5 ι θ ϕ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z e q ϕ z x i lg p θ x i z according to the monte carlo method for parameter estimation if zq ϕ z x i was known and when q ϕ z x i was differentiable there was z g ϕ δ x where δ was an auxiliary variable the estimate from equation 5 was 6 ι θ ϕ x i k l q ϕ z x i p θ z 1 l l 1 l lg p x i z i l the lower bound of the log likelihood function could be estimated by mini batch as follows 7 ι θ ϕ x i ι m θ ϕ x m n m i 1 m ι θ ϕ x i minimizing equation 7 made our posterior distribution p θ z x i continuously approach the true posterior distribution p θ z x i the encoder obtained the real characteristics of the data then we configured the fdr of each region by first calculating the bias variance tradeoff 8 z i x i e 1 σ x where σ indicates the standard deviation the predicted value was then converted into a probability distribution by applying a normalized exponential function calculation softmax function to the data 9 softmax z i e z i c 1 c e zc where zi is the output value of the ith node and c is the number of output nodes i e the number of categories of classification the multi accumulated output values can be converted into a probability distribution with a range of 0 1 and a sum equal to 1 finally the average predicted value could be calculated and this corresponded to the results of fdr allocation 2 harmony evaluation model the chinese government s current national strategy is building a socialist harmonious society fdr allocation should consider the harmony of the results which would also be conducive to the promotion and implementation of the fdr allocation scheme accordingly to test the harmony and practicability of the allocation results zuo et al 2013 we used equations 10 13 to evaluate the results of different allocation schemes zuo et al 2018 10 p k 1 j 1 m β j max β j 2 1 2 11 p k 2 j 1 m β j min β j 2 1 2 12 p k 3 j 1 m max β j min β j 2 1 2 13 h k p k 1 p k 2 p k 1 p k 3 where p k 1 is the distance between the fdr of area j and the ideal fdr in plan k p k 2 is the distance between the fdr of area j and the lowest fdr in plan k p k 3 is the distance between the ideal fdr and the lowest fdr of area j in plan k and h k is the overall harmony degree of plan k k 1 2 3 and β j is the allocation ratio of fdr in area j j 1 n β j 1 2 2 4 data sources this study considered data from the five provinces spanning the yellow river basin from 2005 to 2019 economic social and environmental data were obtained from the china statistical yearbook series national bureau of statistics of china 2005 2019 hydrological data were obtained from the china water conservancy yearbook series ministry of water resources of china 2005 2019 and the yellow river yearbook series yellow river conservancy committee of the ministry of water resources 2005 2019 data on urban construction and water conservancy projects were from the china urban statistical yearbook series urban bureau of statistics of china 2005 2019 and were provided by the planning bureau of the yellow river water conservancy commission information regarding government policy comes from the evaluation and assignment of the management staff of the yellow river water conservancy commission personal communication in our calculation process data from these sources for each indicator of 23 from each province of 5 were input to the vae model year by year for 15 consecutive years 2005 2019 which characterizes the evolution of each indicator over time 3 results according to the characteristics of the study area and dataset the vae model in this study includes an encoder network and a decoder network both of which are 3 layer peer to peer fully connected autoencoder networks the network structure is shown in fig 5 the entire training process is an unsupervised learning process and the total number of parameters of the autoencoder network is 10 345 the encoder of vae implements the feature extraction function the encoder is composed of a two layer fully connected neural network with neurons of 128 and 16 in the two layer neural network respectively and the activation function is relu parameters μ and σ are the expectation and variance respectively extracted from the input data through the encoder structure z is the extracted feature value and the decoder is the equivalent reverse structure of the encoder finally use the sigmoid function to normalize the output to 0 1 to match the original data the vae model calculated fdr for the study area data for each year for each of the five provinces were input to the network with encoding through the training processes indicated by equations 1 7 to extract the features of the data the feature extraction value essentially represents the value of the high dimensional data after dimensionality reduction as shown in table 2 an epoch is a term used in deep learning and indicates the number of passes of the entire training dataset that the deep learning algorithm has completed fig 6 indicates that when the vae model was trained with different batch sizes different batch sizes had nearly the same convergence interval for the loss value thus the relationship between the training loss and epoch varied little indicating that the batch size has limited influence on the training results the softmax function was used to convert the predicted value into a probability distribution by using equation 9 after that the fdr result is obtained by accumulating and averaging table 3 to get a more stable final result we performed 200 epochs it was found that the data began to converge at 120 epochs and finally after 200 epochs the fdr values of the five provinces tended to stabilize fig 7 at this time the final convergent fdr allocation plan was obtained through cumulative average the results of the fdr allocation plan are shown in fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of the fdr allocation results calculation using the vae model determined an fdr allocation ratio for the five provinces of inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong of 9 36 10 00 10 95 32 58 and 37 12 respectively there is considerable variation across the provinces shandong and henan have allocations each over 30 far exceeding those of the other three provinces while those of inner mongolia and shaanxi are considerably smaller not exceeding 10 the large differences in allocations came from the considerable differences in the provinces basic data shandong shandong province has a high fdr allocation 37 12 because it is the most economically developed of the five provinces in the study area looking at the fdr allocation indicators the values for s1 s3 s4 and s5 related to the economy are the highest among the five provinces confirming that shandong has the highest level of economic development which is dominated by agriculture and industry being the latter the most highly developed in the nation shandong therefore has the largest fdr allocation to minimize the basin s overall economic losses and ensure minimal disruption to the region s society and economy the values of ra1 ra4 and ra6 e g resilience factor for shandong are the highest among the five provinces indicating that this province has a strong environmental protection capacity discharging floodwater in some provinces can pollute the basin environment because of soil erosion or sewage discharge in this regard shandong should obtain more fdr because of its capability for environmental protection finally shandong having the highest values of g4 and g5 indicates that it has been the most affected by disastrous flooding over the years and therefore needs substantial fdr to protect its economy and people s lives overall shandong is allocated the most fdr among the five provinces henan henan province is allocated the second largest amount of fdr 32 58 because it has the highest value of s2 among the five provinces china is a people oriented country accordingly during floods the country places great importance on the protection of people s lives and property as henan is an important agricultural region it must be protected to ensure china s food security meanwhile henan province has the largest annual rainfall n2 and the highest government attention g2 for these reasons the province has the second highest fdr allocation shaanxi and shanxi these provinces are similar with the third and fourth highest allocations respectively both provinces are similar in size population density and greening rate in the built up area in detail although shanxi has the smallest gpd among the five provinces its four indicators for flood resilience were the smallest indicating that this province has the worst flood control capacity the implementation of water conservancy projects resistance factor in shanxi is poor and it cannot rely on reservoirs or drainage pipes for storing or discharging flood water therefore this province must obtain some rights to discharge floodwater into the yellow river to reduce flood losses inner mongolia inner mongolia has the smallest of the five fdr allocations at only 9 36 although this province has the largest watershed area and encompasses the greatest extent of the yellow river it has the lowest level of economic development and the lowest population density inner mongolia has large floodplains to naturally discharge flood water thus minimizing flood damage in the local area therefore inner mongolia has the lowest need for fdr among the five provinces 4 2 comparison with other fdr allocation methods the choice of allocation method has a substantial effect on the allocation results we compared the vae proposed here plan a with three other methods common decision making methods for fdr allocation include allocation by fairness plan b efficiency plan c and considering both fairness and efficiency plan d fairness allocation involves calculating the absolute average of all indicators in an area to obtain the fdr allocation results efficiency allocation considers the regions economic situation and emphasizes flood drainage efficiency finally allocation combining the two methods yields the final allocation through a weighted average calculation fig 9 presents the fdr allocations using all four methods the different principles underlying the four methods explains the large variation in their results plan b yields the smallest difference in allocations among the five provinces with the range between the highest allocation for shandong and the lowest for shanxi being only 13 66 percentage points this allocation is fair but it is not scientific for example the high allocation for inner mongolia is due to its large size and large watershed area despite there being a small population and low population density considering resilience inner mongolia has many flood plains and unused land that could be submerged with little consequence thus giving it great potential for discharging retaining flood water therefore considering only fairness and ignoring drainage efficiency and resilience will lead to low flood drainage efficiency and ultimately lower social welfare therefore a method using only fairness is not optimal plan c also has certain drawbacks it focuses on flood drainage efficiency and the fdr allocation is based on the economic development of each region shandong thus receives more fdr as its economy is the most developed although this method maximizes flood drainage efficiency it ignores other factors henan province is one of the most populous provinces in china it is china s grain base and its annual wheat output accounts for a quarter of the country s annual production at the same time henan province is located in the center of china and is the transportation hub of china therefore henan province plays an important role in the yellow river basin and even the whole country it receives a high degree of government attention and it has the highest population density yet its economic development is lower than in shandong this results in the province having an fdr allocation that is 10 99 percentage points lower than that of shandong finally scheme d considers both fairness and efficiency and it thus represents a significant improvement over schemes c and b however this scheme ignores environmental factors and the concept of resilience which leads to certain deficiencies in fdr allocation proper consideration of flood drainage should take environmental protection into account inner mongolia shanxi and shaanxi are rich in resources such as coal with greater exploitation of these resources than in other provinces resulting in severe water and soil loss a higher fdr allocation to these three provinces would pollute the entire downstream basin given the national aim of high quality development of the yellow river a particularly polluting fdr allocation should be adjusted furthermore if resilience is considered inner mongolia would require a smaller fdr allocation because it contains vast sparsely populated flood plains overall fdr allocation varies markedly according to the selected allocation method comparing these methods demonstrates that the fdr allocation plan proposed in this paper considers various factors in the watershed which overcomes the shortcomings of other fdr allocation plans and can reduce the loss of flood disasters to the watershed as much as possible therefore ideal fdr allocation has to account for a range of factors the interests of all parties and environmental protection to maximize the efficiency of water conservancy projects reduce flood induced losses and ultimately maximize social welfare 4 3 harmonious evaluation of different methods next harmony evaluation was applied to the four different fdr allocation schemes the results in tables 4 and 5 and fig 10 show that the harmony values of plans a b c and d are 0 85 0 80 0 72 and 0 75 respectively and thus that the vae fdr allocation scheme plan a proposed here has higher harmony than the other schemes following harmony theory the low degree of harmony of the other methods is due to their one sided consideration conversely the scheme proposed here promotes the study region s harmonious development by meeting the five provinces flood drainage needs the scheme s harmony also facilitates the acceptance and implementation of the fdr allocation 5 conclusions climate change has increased the intensity and frequency of storms in the yellow river basin of china calling for new strategies for flood planning and management this study provides a comprehensive investigation of the factors driving fdr allocation we considered natural socioeconomic governance resilience and resistance factors that influence the complex allocation of fdr and established a qualitative indicator system to reflect the complexity of these driving factors considering a broader range of important indicators than have traditionally been used in allocation methods should increase the reliability of the fdr estimates our incorporation of the flood resilience concepts into the fdr allocation indicator system encouraged the rational use of floodplains and other areas to temporarily discharge and retain floodwater and promote flexibility in flood control strategies the government has an essential role in public disaster prevention and control thus we incorporated the government s macro control factors into the indicator system overall the allocation results obtained using this more comprehensive fdr allocation indicator system were the most reasonable and in line with the actual situation further we quantified fdr for regions in the middle and lower river reaches of the yellow river basin using a deep learning approach we developed a vae model providing a robust solution to the challenge of the multi objective high dimensional nonlinear and non normal distributions encountered during fdr allocation the method has a high degree of harmony suggesting that it is practical and thus conducive to its promotion and implementation overall it can achieve orderly flood drainage between provinces and promote the harmonious development of the whole region we acknowledge that research on fdr as a planning and management tool is still in the early stages and that other soft management strategies for flood management could be compared in future studies additional complexity such as the magnitudes and dynamics of flood events and the impact of climate change on regional flood responses could be considered toward updating reasonable and practicable fdr allocation plans for example typical flood events can be adopted as cases to reflect differing flood drainage processes and evaluate fdr allocation schemes the loss model could be used to calculate flood loss in each area and corresponding management measures can be determined to provide further science based references toward implementing the practice of fdr allocation by local governments credit authorship contribution statement kaize

connectivity anderson 2005 constantz 2008 kalbus et al 2006 rau et al 2014 heat is an effective environmental tracer for quantifying sw gw exchange fluxes because of its strong diurnal fluctuations in surface waters and low cost of application hatch et al 2006 mccallum et al 2012 shanafield et al 2010 a standard application involves the use of discrete temperature sensors e g i buttons at multiple depths to evaluate and quantify the rate of exchange within the hyporheic zone and between the river and the underlying aquifer systems rau et al 2010 and in heterogeneous river environments irvine et al 2017 in the last two decades higher spatial resolution surveys of river and riverbed settings have been undertaken using fibre optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts that apply passive dts and active dts measurements selker et al 2006b shanafield et al 2018 tyler et al 2009 passive dts consists of measuring the natural temperature fluctuations with time and the quantification of fluxes is determined together with other distributed temperature measurements and outputs from energy balance models selker et al 2006a in comparison active dts a dts consists of measuring temperature changes in response to a continuous heat source along a fo cable which enables quantification of fluxes at a higher spatial and temporal resolution simon et al 2021a laboratory scale studies have been undertaken to validate the a dts methodology in using heat as a tracer and to calibrate thermal properties of both the water and sediment to quantify water velocities bakx et al 2019 maldaner et al 2019 simon et al 2020 simon et al 2021b at the field and river reach scale both passive and active dts surveys have been utilized to locate sw gw exchange and quantify groundwater discharge into streams e g gonzález pinzón et al 2015 simon et al 2021a in these applications the fo cable has been installed at or just below few centimetres the riverbed surface mohamed et al 2021 slater et al 2010 there are fewer studies that have used dts to measure seepage rates in losing streams to groundwater e g vogt et al 2010 in trento italy busato et al 2019 used horizontal drilling techniques to install a fo cable beneath the riverbed and applied passive dts to understand the interconnection between surface water and groundwater in the vermigliana creek catchment to the authors knowledge this has been the only other study and installation of fo cable beneath a river channel one of the key challenges of monitoring sw gw exchange in braided river systems is the installation of appropriate water monitoring infrastructure which is at risk of damage due to flooding and riverbed scouring for the first time this study used sub surface horizontal drilling and a dts surveys to measure river infiltration loss i e groundwater recharge in a braided river system in the south island of new zealand the novel approach using the a dts survey data and an analytical moving instantaneous line source solution of the heat transport equation made it possible to quantify groundwater velocities and thermal conductivities in the underlying shallow braidplain aquifer the study demonstrated the advantages of this cutting edge field technique over other methods to quantify sw gw exchange it provided high spatial resolution mapping of river infiltration loss across the width of the active river channel and identified the role of river geomorphology on preferential groundwater recharge pathways in the shallow braidplain aquifer 2 study site the waikirikiri selwyn river is located on the canterbury plains in the south island of new zealand fig 1 it flows from the canterbury foothills southeast across the canterbury plains for approximately 80 km where it joins te waihora lake ellesmere at the coast surface runoff from the hills generates most of the river flow to the upstream section of the waikirikiri selwyn river which has a braided morphology the downstream section receives groundwater from the canterbury plains aquifers and is characterised by a meandering braided river channel this river is a highly dynamic river system and is characterised by large fluctuations in discharge between summer and winter months fig 2 it has perennial ephemeral and intermittent reaches that experience both losing and gaining sw gw conditions the primary mechanism of aquifer recharge is leakage from the river channels larned et al 2008 the study site is an active channel of the waikirikiri selwyn river fig 1c and is located approximately 210 m above mean sea level amsl here the river comprises one to three braids and is within an ephemeral losing reach there is a gravel bar within the study site which has two clusters of piezometers s05 s06 s07 and s08 the contemporary braidplain is approximately 400 m wide and is bound by river terraces that are up to 5 m high the active riverbed is up to 60 m wide there are many paleochannels present at the site which may act as preferential flowpaths and a recharge mechanism to the underlying braidplain aquifer the geology of the area comprises two distinct hydrostratigraphic units of greywacke derived gravel known regionally as the springston and burnham formations forsyth et al 2008 the springston formation was deposited during the holocene epoch under slightly degrading depositional conditions as a result these gravels occur as thin lenses of postglacial fluvial channel and overbank sediments associated with contemporary braided rivers deposition during the current postglacial period with a relatively low sediment supply has resulted in a lag deposit of well sorted gravels sands and silts brown et al 1988 this unit is approximately 3 5 to 4 m thick in the study area and hosts a high permeability aquifer associated with the waikirikiri selwyn river herein referred to as the braidplain aquifer an aquifer test carried out for this study estimated hydraulic conductivity of 75 250 m d 1 and a specific yield of 0 03 0 01 for this unit the burnham formation lies beneath the springston formation and hosts the regional aquifer system burnham formation deposits consist of glacial and periglacial outwash gravels deposited in the last glacial period vincent 2005 core sediment material recovered during drilling at the study site shows fine to coarse greywacke gravels with occasional cobbles in a fine sand to clay matrix interbedded with silt layers fig s1 the permeability of the burnham formation is low near the surface but generally increases with depth this vertical change in permeability creates a zone of lower water content between the base of the braidplain aquifer at approximately 4 m depth and the potentiometric surface of the regional aquifer at approximately 20 m below ground level bgl the regional aquifer is not the focus of this study however based on water level and temperature data this aquifer can be considered hydraulically disconnected from the river and shallow braidplain aquifer and separated by an unsaturated zone of 15 m in thickness the calculated porosity values for the springston and burnham formations range between 0 18 and 0 3 from 27 samples of recovered drillhole core material at the study site robb 2021 these values are consistent with other studies on the canterbury plains dann et al 2009 3 methods 3 1 horizontal directional drilling horizontal directional drilling hdd was used to construct two 100 m long 125 mm diameter drillholes at a depth of approximately 5 m beneath and perpendicular to the river channel at the study site on the waikirikiri selwyn river the two hdd drillholes true right hdd1 and true left hdd2 orientation looking down river were drilled with the assistance of a xanthan gum drilling mud to keep the hole open and provide lubricant during the installation process following a successful drillhole a 125 mm diameter poly pipe conduit was welded to the exposed drill bit this poly pipe was temporarily installed within the hdd hole via back reaming hybrid fo cable consisting of multi mode fibres and 2x18awg copper conductors fig s2 were then threaded through the temporary conduit the fo cables were then held in place while the temporary conduit was removed this installation method enabled the drillhole to subsequently collapse allowing the riverbed material to make direct contact with the cable the cable connector terminals were secured in a buried cable pit on the riverbank to prevent vandalism and damage from river flooding 3 2 active distributed temperature sensing a silixa xt dts distributed temperature sensor combined with a silixa heat pulse system was used to collect a dts measurements along both fo cables the reported manufacturer specifications of the xt dts details a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m spatial resolution of 0 54 m and a temperature resolution of 0 01 c silixa ltd uk the spatial resolution is larger than the sample interval and is typically estimated by applying the 90 step change method where the true temperature change occurs over a step wise shift in distance along the fo cable selker et al 2014 simon et al 2020 tyler et al 2009 a double ended configuration was used where the instrument makes measurements from both directions of a looped fo cable that has its two ends connected to the xt dts the non uniform differential loss along the length of the fibre is corrected by aligning the forward and reverse signals that are measured from both ends of the fibre in addition 8 m of cable reference sections were positioned in two calibration baths of different temperatures ambient river water collected at the time of survey and ice water 0 c that were monitored using pt 100 temperature probes connected to the xt dts fig s3 the temperature measurement error for the ice calibration bath for the true right was 0 068 c and 0 099 c for the true left over the duration of the measurement period the measurement error for the river calibration bath for the true right was 0 100 c and 0 11 c for the true left each measurement cycle used the ice calibration bath temperature to correct the reported temperature value along the length of the cable at a sample interval of 0 25 m the double ended configuration together with the calibration baths greatly improves the temperature accuracy and precision along the length of the fibre hausner et al 2011 van de giesen et al 2012 the measurement sequence acquisition sampling rate and heat pulse duration for the surveys using the double ended configuration involved the following an acquisition sampling rate of 10 s sampled at 5 s on channel 1 forward measurement and 5 s on channel 2 reverse measurement for a measurement period of 300 s i e baseline temperature conditions prior to heating the cable for 1200 s at 15 w m 1 of cable followed by a post heating measurement period of 1200 s this sampling routine was sufficient to capture subtle temperature changes along the fibre and a significant increase in temperature from the baseline conditions 3 3 surface water and groundwater monitoring infrastructure there is an extensive network of surface water and groundwater monitoring infrastructure at the study site fig 1 it includes a river level gauge recorder station 68007 on the western edge of the main channel and a network of 27 shallow piezometers e g s01 s02 etc completed in the unconfined shallow braidplain aquifer screen intervals between 1 and 4 m below ground and deep piezometers completed in the semi confined regional aquifer screen intervals between 19 and 35 m below ground river stage and surface water temperature are recorded at 15 min intervals regular manual flow gauging has been undertaken to create a flow rating curve to calculate surface water discharge at the level gauge and differential flow gauging to determine water loss along the river reach within the study site water levels and temperature in the shallow and deep aquifers are recorded at 15 min intervals 3 4 mathematical model for estimating thermal conductivity and groundwater velocity the evolution of temperature in saturated porous media due to advection and conduction is described by the 2d heat transport equation bakker et al 2015 domenico and schwartz 1998 1 t t d 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 u r t x where t c is temperature t s is time d m2 s is thermal diffusivity u is groundwater velocity m s in the positive x direction and r is a thermal retardation coefficient the porosity weighted thermal diffusivity and thermal retardation coefficients are defined as 2 d λ c ρ n λ w 1 n λ s n c w ρ w 1 n c s ρ s 3 r c ρ n c w ρ w 1 1 n c s ρ s n c w ρ w where n is porosity λ w m c 1 is thermal conductivity c is specific heat capacity j kg 1 c 1 and ρ kg m 3 is density subscript w refers to water s refers to solids and no subscript indicates the combined rock fluid matrix it is assumed that the temperature of water and solids are at instantaneous equilibrium and the effect of temperature on density and viscosity is negligible anderson 2005 in this study a dts survey temperature data and the analytic moving instantaneous line source mils solution of zubair and chaudhry 1996 as detailed in bakker et al 2015 are used to estimate thermal conductivity and groundwater velocity i e average linear or pore fluid velocity u along the a dts cable at a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m it is assumed that the estimated groundwater velocity represents the magnitude of the dominant groundwater flow vector across the cable although the direction of flow cannot be determined by the method and remains unknown in the mils model an infinitely long source of constant heat q w m is located at the origin normal to the plane of constant groundwater flow the change in temperature δt c since the start of heating t s at a radial distance r m from the line source is given by 4 δ t q 4 π λ exp ux 2 d r w r 2 4 d t ur 2 d r where w is the hantush well function defined as 5 w a b a 1 s exp s b 2 4 s d s observations of temperature change during the heating period were used to fit equation 4 using a non linear least squares algorithm implemented in python the output was best fitting values of thermal conductivity groundwater velocity and thermal diffusivity optimised using the temperature change at each individual measurement point along the cable the root mean square error rmse was calculated from the residuals between the best fitting model and the data which gives a measure of the goodness of fit additionally a covariance matrix was calculated and the parameter standard deviations used to construct error bars in this context a small error bar indicates a good fit was achieved between measured and modelled data over a small range of parameter values during the non linear least squares estimation procedure the thermal retardation value r is calculated as 3 1 this is calculated using a porosity of 0 2 as measured by robb 2021 in the vicinity of the a dts cable values of density and specific heat capacity for water were taken from bakker et al 2015 as follows cw of 4 100 j kg 1 c 1 ρs of 2 650 kg m 3 and ρw of 1 000 kg m 3 specific heat capacity for the solid which is a greywacke derived material was taken from average values reported by mielke et al 2016 as cs of 800 j kg 1 c 1 this value is slightly lower than the 860 j kg 1 c 1 used by bakker et al 2015 the copper heating conductor and optical fibres are contained within a composite fo cable as shown in fig s2 the manufacturer specifications indicate that the distance between the copper heating conductor and optical fibre is within the range of 1 8 mm and 3 7 mm in order to estimate this distance we used equation 4 with u 0 and other values as listed above and iteratively altered the value of λ and r to optimise the match i e minimise the rmse between the modelled and measured heating curves along the cable during the conduction dominant period of the heating curve using this approach r values of 2 9 mm and 3 1 mm were estimated for the true right and true left cables respectively for the modelling 3 0 mm was used for the base case scenario the impact of uncertainty associated with this parameter is explored as part of a sensitivity analysis a key assumption in our interpretation of the data is that the drillhole annulus has collapsed around the fo cable this assumption is needed to consider that the a dts measurements are representative of perpendicular flow across the cable from the surrounding sediments 4 results 4 1 surface water and groundwater time series groundwater levels in the shallow aquifer piezometers s02 s04 s06 s08 and s21 show very similar temporal trends to river stage fig 3 a the direct response in the groundwater to changes in river stage indicates that the river and shallow braidplain aquifer are intimately connected although the true right and true left surveys were conducted 1 week apart the river level and the shallow groundwater level conditions were similar the hydraulic head gradient between the river and the observed shallow piezometers ranged from 0 15 to 0 76 average 0 5 confirming that the local flow field at the cable locations was from the river to groundwater fig 3b similar temporal trends are observed in the temperature time series data between the river and shallow groundwater fig 3c at the daily timescale there is a clear diurnal temperature response in the river where the surface water temperature increases from early morning and peaking mid afternoon before decreasing again in the evening fig 3d and fig 3e the diurnal temperature signal in the shallow groundwater is dampened compared to the river an exception is piezometer s21 which is located on the inside of the river meander bend and shows a similar diurnal temperature signal to the river but there is a clear phase shift lag and its amplitude is also slightly dampened the dampened amplitude and phase lag signals can be used to infer the losing river conditions we assume that these diurnal temperature variations do not have a significant effect on the adts measurements given the overall duration of the experiment approximately 45 min the surveys were also undertaken before the highest daily temperatures that are typically experienced by mid afternoon 4 2 active distributed temperature sensing the baseline and peak heat pulse temperature measurements for the true right 24 02 2021 and true left 01 03 2021 surveys are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively for the true right survey from 0 to 32 1 m the cable is located within the unsaturated zone and above the water level of shallow piezometer s02 this is also the case at 100 to 105 m where the cable is above the water level of piezometer s04 fig 4a the river temperature 21 c at the time of the true right survey was higher than the measured temperature of the shallow groundwater in piezometers s02 17 1 c s04 16 6 c and s21 15 1 c and the measured baseline temperature along the a dts cable that was located below the shallow watertable fig 4b for the true left survey from 0 to 46 1 m and from 98 7 to 106 m the cable is within the unsaturated zone and above the water levels of shallow piezometers s06 and s08 which are located on the gravel bar between two of the braided river channels fig 5a the river temperature 17 6 c at the time of the true left survey was higher than the measured temperature of the shallow groundwater in piezometers s06 15 8 c and s08 15 6 c and the measured baseline temperature along the a dts cable that was located below the shallow watertable fig 5b for the a dts cable that is located below the watertable in both surveys there is some visible spatial variability in the measured baseline and peak heat pulse temperature measurements that suggest zones beneath the river that have greater or less advective flow for example at a distance between 62 and 68 m for the true right there is an abrupt change in the temperature profile the measured baseline temperature at this low point is similar to the measured groundwater temperature of s021 at the time of the survey fig 4b and the river temperature measured early that morning on the 24 02 2021 fig 3d similar comparisons can be made for the true left survey where the measured early morning river temperature on the 01 03 2021 is close to the baseline a dts survey and the shallow groundwater temperature breakthrough curves at selected locations along the saturated sections of the fo cable are shown for the true right survey in fig 6 and for the true left survey in fig 7 when the heating cable is turned on there is a temperature increase from the baseline of about 4 c where it reaches an asymptotic plateau once the heating is turned off the temperature returns to the baseline fig 6a and fig 7a the sections of the cable that are located within the unsaturated zone and above the watertable of the shallow braidplain aquifer true right 0 32 1 m 100 105 m and true left 0 46 1 m 98 7 106 m show greater increases in temperature 8 10 c immediately after the heating is turned on fig 6b and fig 7b for the groundwater velocity calculations these measurements are not considered due to the partially saturated conditions of the unsaturated zone other noticeable features in the temperature heat maps fig 6c and fig 7c are locations along the fo cable where there is more rapid cooling or where the temperature increase is not as high compared to adjacent locations these features of rapid cooling are likely to be locations of higher groundwater velocities created by the spatial variability in the hydrogeological conditions of the braidplain aquifer for the true right survey on 24 02 2021 fitting equation 5 to the temperature data suggests an average groundwater velocity of 12 0 m d 1 with values along the length of cable at a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m ranging between 10 8 and 13 6 m d 1 fig 8 a the average thermal conductivity is 0 56 w m 1 c 1 with a range in values from 0 48 to 0 62 w m 1 c 1 the clear change in the baseline temperature at a distance between 62 and 68 m is also the location of the calculated highest velocity for the true left survey on 01 03 2021 the average groundwater velocity is 15 8 m d 1 and along the length of cable the velocities range from 12 4 to 19 4 m d 1 fig 8b the average thermal conductivity is 0 74 w m 1 c 1 with a range in values from 0 66 to 0 80 w m 1 c 1 rmse for the surveys conducted on the 24 02 2021 and 01 03 2021 are less than 0 07 c indicating a good fit between modelled and measured temperature change along the cable a simple sensitivity analysis of the input parameters that were used in the mils flow and heat transport model was undertaken on the tr survey data the derived groundwater velocity and bulk thermal conductivity values as a result of increasing and decreasing the input parameters of porosity specific heat capacity and r by 20 are shown in table 1 changing the porosity from the base case of 0 2 to 0 16 increased the groundwater velocity from an average of 12 to 14 4 m d 1 whilst modifying the distance between the line heat source and the fibre r from 2 4 to 3 6 mm changed the estimated groundwater velocity from 9 6 to 14 4 m d 1 there was no change to the estimated bulk conductivity with the range of input parameters that were tested 5 discussion assuming that the measured groundwater velocity is in the vertical direction the average specific discharge q i e river loss to the shallow braidplain aquifer is 2 8 m d 1 ranged from 2 3 to 3 3 m d 1 this was determined using the calculated average groundwater velocity u of 13 9 m d 1 ranged from 11 6 to 16 5 m d 1 for the true right and true left surveys and a measured porosity of 0 2 from the drillcore material the groundwater velocities do not vary significantly beneath the width of the active river channel as defined by the wetted footprint of the channel in a previous study by vincent 2005 of the upper reaches of the waikirikiri selwyn river it was suggested that the groundwater movement within the shallow braidplain aquifer would be influenced by remnant paleochannels that have formed by progressive shifting and abandonment of river channels on the alluvial fan surfaces furthermore preferential groundwater flow would occur where there is a complex network of interconnected channels of more permeable gravels surrounded by less permeable sediments and would also be influenced by the heterogeneity of the aquifer material this does not appear to be a significant controlling factor on the groundwater velocities beneath the active river channel at the study site however the measurement scale 0 25 m sample interval compared to the potential scale of macropore flow 1 2 cm needs to be taken into consideration the calculated groundwater velocities are dependent on the derived thermal conductivities in this study there was not a large variation in the values along the length of the cable for the two surveys and the uncertainty in thermal conductivity was relatively low fig 8 however we note that simon et al 2021b and del val et al 2021 found that calculated thermal conductivity uncertainty increases when the conduction dominant period is short as occurs under high flux conditions such as those found in our study the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions of sediment thermal conductivity on vertical groundwater flux estimates in a high flux stream and low flux lagoon was studied by sebok and müller 2019 their study found that the vertical heterogeneous distribution of thermal conductivity did not significantly change the modelled versus observed temperature data compared to the homogeneous distribution however it was critical that spatially representative thermal properties are used to obtain more precise flux estimates rather than using standard textbook values in our study the best fit values lowest rmse which was less than 0 07 c for both surveys for the bulk thermal conductivity of the saturated fluid rock matrix for the true right and true left a dts transects are contained within a narrow range from 0 48 to 0 8 w m 1 c 1 reported thermal conductivity for greywacke basement rock porosity 0 03 is 1 7 w m 1 c 1 mielke et al 2016 the variations to the geometrical arrangement of layers mineral grains and pores will also affect the bulk conductivity in particular changes in porosity clauser 2011 therefore the derived low bulk thermal conductivities from the two surveys are reasonable for the saturated fluid rock matrix of the greywacke aquifer material that has an average porosity of 0 2 when the porosity values were changed from 0 16 to 0 24 compared to the base case n 0 2 the calculated groundwater velocities decreased from 14 4 to 6 3 m d 1 another consideration as to why the derived bulk thermal conductivities are low for the saturated aquifer material in this study is how the subsurface gravels and fines have collapsed and repacked around the fo cable after horizontal drilling and cable installation this re packing settling of heavier gravels and infill of finer material would change the proportion of water filled voids to solid material unfortunately there is no way to physically measure this change in situ but repeat a dts surveys may be able to identify if there is any notable change to the derived bulk thermal conductivities along the length of the cable with time physical measurements of drillcore material using a thermal properties analyser would also help constrain the range in plausible values for the aquifer material under different saturated conditions one of the more sensitive parameters in the mils flow and heat transport model was associated with knowing the exact start time of the heating input s and the value of r as the distance between the heating line source and the observing fibre refer to equation 5 a simple sensitivity analysis of the tr survey showed that the effect of changing the start time from 240 to 252 s changed the calculated groundwater velocity from 12 0 to 15 4 m d 1 and the bulk thermal conductivity from 0 56 to 0 69 w m 1 c 1 the results presented here indicate that a higher temporal resolution in the early time measurements is important to capture the rapid temperature change in response to the line source heating whilst changing the distance between the line heat source and the fibre r by 0 8 mm was very sensitive to the derived groundwater velocities implying that knowing the cable specifications is critical to the survey results the main challenge with interpreting the a dts data is that the inferred direction of water flow is assumed to be 1d and does not account for flow in the two other directions multi direction 3d flow fields in the shallow streambed have been evaluated for hyporheic exchange using other active heat pulse temperature methods e g banks et al 2018 however there are no known studies that have been undertaken at depths greater than a few metres within river channels it is assumed that the longitudinal flow component in the near surface of the riverbed in the direction of river flow would be greater than the vertical and lateral flow components because of the permeability structure in riverbed environments the installation depth of the horizontal fo cable at the study site is several metres below the influence of hyporheic zone exchange lewandowski et al 2019 and therefore the derived groundwater velocities represent the dominant direction of flow within the shallow braidplain aquifer based on the observed hydraulic head gradient between the river and water level of the shallow braidplain aquifer as well as the measured differential river flow gauging we can be confident that the calculated specific discharge over this river reach represents river loss the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material of the shallow braidplain aquifer was estimated to be in the range of 23 to 33 m d 1 this was determined based on the range of calculated groundwater velocities 11 6 and 16 5 m d 1 and the measured average hydraulic head gradient between the river and shallow braidplain aquifer which at the time of the surveys was 0 5 m these hydraulic conductivities are less than the values based on aquifer tests that were done at the site which ranged from 75 to 250 m d 1 the permeability of riverbed materials are known to vary over eight orders of magnitude 9 10 6 to 9 102 m d 1 calver 2001 and because of the significant spatio temporal variability this can strongly control river loss to groundwater aquifer tests results primarily represent horizontal flow whereas river leakage is controlled by vertical hydraulic conductivity which is expected to be lower because of stratification and imbrication manual differential flow gauging that was undertaken on the 24 02 2021 using an acoustic doppler velocimeter by hydrographers from niwa measured a river infiltration loss of 8 640 m3 d 1 average point measurement uncertainty of 3 over a river reach length of 333 m equivalent to 26 m3 d 1 m 1 that encompassed the true right and true left a dts transect locations fig 1 in comparison the measured river infiltration loss over the entire 888 m long river reach of the study area was 22 464 m3 d 1 equivalent to 25 m3 d 1 m 1 using a wetted footprint width of the active river channel of 60 m and an effective distance over which the adts measurement can be applied that is equivalent to the diameter of the drillhole 0 125 m and combined with the calculated specific discharge from the a dts surveys 2 8 m d 1 the river infiltration loss at the transect locations is 21 m3 d 1 m 1 the calculated river losses using the a dts survey data and differential flow gauging are similar which is an encouraging result the scale of investigation between the two techniques is the most likely contributing factor to the different river loss calculations despite the low measurement uncertainty the differential flow gauging provides a net loss of surface water over a river reach that is 100 s of metres long whilst the a dts survey is measuring the groundwater velocities within the braidplain aquifer at a local scale directly beneath the active river channel but also at a high spatial resolution along the length of the transect that is perpendicular to the river channel 6 summary the novel approach that has been used in this study provides an improved understanding of the complex sw gw exchange processes in braided river systems the fo cable installation beneath the riverbed has demonstrated the value of a dts to quantify river infiltration losses at a high spatial sample interval 0 25 m and over the entire width of the active river channel there was some spatial variation in the calculated groundwater velocities beneath the active river channel which ranged from 11 6 to 16 5 m d 1 average 13 9 m d 1 these findings suggest that changes in the riverbed geomorphology or the presence of more transmissive paleochannels are to a small degree influencing preferential groundwater flowpaths in the shallow braidplain aquifer at the survey sites the calculated average infiltration loss of 21 m3 d 1 m 1 from the a dts surveys was similar to values derived from differential flow gauging across the study site 25 to 26 m3 d 1 m 1 the buried permanent installation of the fo cable allows for repeat surveys at different river stage and aquifer conditions to be conducted more frequently to evaluate how hydrologic conditions may affect groundwater velocities and recharge rates a higher frequency of monitoring has potential to be used to identify critical river flow conditions when the highest groundwater recharge occurs thus providing valuable information to water management decisions 6 1 future recommendations to improve the conceptualisation of river infiltration loss in braided river systems the significance of 1d versus 2d flow components beneath the river needs to be addressed to address the uncertainty in the derived groundwater velocities and to explore the phenomena of multi directional flow two vertical a dts fo cables have recently been installed on the riverbank adjacent to the horizontal drillholes to a depth of 30 m planned future surveys will hopefully provide greater insight into the complex flow fields beneath the river and resolve whether the vertical or lateral flow component is more dominant at this study site further work is required to compare the different analytical approaches of bakker et al 2015 to those of other studies including the adts toolbox by simon and bour 2022 and how they align to different fibre and heating cable configurations furthermore how this approach relates to the analytical solutions described by others including diao et al 2004 and del val et al 2021 the installation of the horizontal fo cables was a very costly field investigation method however this type of installation provided very high spatial resolution of groundwater velocities beneath a complex braided river system it has also allowed for multiple surveys to be conducted during different flow conditions with a reduced risk of losing equipment due to changing river flow conditions this was demonstrated in june 2021 when the installation survived a significant 1 50 year flood event where the river level gauge station and eight piezometers were damaged and lost time series data from a high resolution vertical dts profile used in the study by vogt et al 2010 observed sporadic high infiltration rates at times of high water tables the installation described in our study is of considerable benefit to being able to measure the dynamic behaviour of groundwater recharge beneath complex braided river systems and improve modelling efforts of sw gw exchange future planned research activities will provide new insights to how the controlling factors of river stage and channel elevation relative to watertable elevation of the shallow braidplain aquifer changes river infiltration loss prior to and after a large flood event other types of installation of fo cable or individual temperature sensors at an oblique angle beneath the river channel are also being considered to provide a simpler solution to be able to measure river infiltration losses during different flow events at several locations and at a reduced cost declaration of competing interest the

connectivity anderson 2005 constantz 2008 kalbus et al 2006 rau et al 2014 heat is an effective environmental tracer for quantifying sw gw exchange fluxes because of its strong diurnal fluctuations in surface waters and low cost of application hatch et al 2006 mccallum et al 2012 shanafield et al 2010 a standard application involves the use of discrete temperature sensors e g i buttons at multiple depths to evaluate and quantify the rate of exchange within the hyporheic zone and between the river and the underlying aquifer systems rau et al 2010 and in heterogeneous river environments irvine et al 2017 in the last two decades higher spatial resolution surveys of river and riverbed settings have been undertaken using fibre optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts that apply passive dts and active dts measurements selker et al 2006b shanafield et al 2018 tyler et al 2009 passive dts consists of measuring the natural temperature fluctuations with time and the quantification of fluxes is determined together with other distributed temperature measurements and outputs from energy balance models selker et al 2006a in comparison active dts a dts consists of measuring temperature changes in response to a continuous heat source along a fo cable which enables quantification of fluxes at a higher spatial and temporal resolution simon et al 2021a laboratory scale studies have been undertaken to validate the a dts methodology in using heat as a tracer and to calibrate thermal properties of both the water and sediment to quantify water velocities bakx et al 2019 maldaner et al

2010 there are fewer studies that have used dts to measure seepage rates in losing streams to groundwater e g vogt et al 2010 in trento italy busato et al 2019 used horizontal drilling techniques to install a fo cable beneath the riverbed and applied passive dts to understand the interconnection between surface water and groundwater in the vermigliana creek catchment to the authors knowledge this has been the only other study and installation of fo cable beneath a river channel one of the key challenges of monitoring sw gw exchange in braided river systems is the installation of appropriate water monitoring infrastructure which is at risk of damage due to flooding and riverbed scouring for the first time this study used sub surface horizontal drilling and a dts surveys to measure river infiltration loss i e groundwater recharge in a braided river system in the south island of new zealand the novel approach using the a dts survey data and an analytical moving instantaneous line source solution of the heat transport equation made it possible to quantify groundwater velocities and thermal conductivities in the underlying shallow braidplain aquifer the study demonstrated the advantages of this cutting edge field technique over other methods to quantify sw gw exchange it provided high spatial resolution mapping of river infiltration loss across the width of the active river channel and identified the role of river geomorphology on preferential groundwater recharge pathways in the shallow braidplain aquifer 2 study site the waikirikiri selwyn river is located on the canterbury plains in the south island of new zealand fig 1 it flows from the canterbury foothills southeast across the canterbury plains for approximately 80 km where it joins te waihora lake ellesmere at the coast surface runoff from the hills generates most of the river flow to the upstream section of the waikirikiri selwyn river which has a braided morphology the downstream section receives groundwater from the canterbury plains aquifers and is characterised by a meandering braided river channel this river is a highly dynamic river system and is characterised by large fluctuations in discharge between summer and winter months fig 2 it has perennial ephemeral and intermittent reaches that experience both losing and gaining sw gw conditions the primary mechanism of aquifer recharge is leakage from the river channels larned et al 2008 the study site is an active channel of the waikirikiri selwyn river fig 1c and is located approximately 210 m above mean sea level amsl here the river comprises one to three braids and is within an ephemeral losing reach there is a gravel bar within the study site which has two clusters of piezometers s05 s06 s07 and s08 the contemporary braidplain is approximately 400 m wide and is bound by river terraces that are up to 5 m high the active riverbed is up to 60 m wide there are many paleochannels present at the site which may act as preferential flowpaths and a recharge mechanism to the underlying braidplain aquifer the geology of the area comprises two distinct hydrostratigraphic units of greywacke derived gravel known regionally as the springston and burnham formations forsyth et al 2008 the springston formation was deposited during the holocene epoch under slightly degrading depositional conditions as a result these gravels occur as thin lenses of postglacial fluvial channel and overbank sediments associated with contemporary braided rivers deposition during the current postglacial period with a relatively low sediment supply has resulted in a lag deposit of well sorted gravels sands and silts brown et al 1988 this unit is approximately 3 5 to 4 m thick in the study area and hosts a high permeability aquifer associated with the waikirikiri selwyn river herein referred to as the braidplain aquifer an aquifer test carried out for this study estimated hydraulic conductivity of 75 250 m d 1 and a specific yield of 0 03 0 01 for this unit the burnham formation lies beneath the springston formation and hosts the regional aquifer system burnham formation deposits consist of glacial and periglacial outwash gravels deposited in the last glacial period vincent 2005 core sediment material recovered during drilling at the study site shows fine to coarse greywacke gravels with occasional cobbles in a fine sand to clay matrix interbedded with silt layers fig s1 the permeability of the burnham formation is low near the surface but generally increases with depth this vertical change in permeability creates a zone of lower water content between the base of the braidplain aquifer at approximately 4 m depth and the potentiometric surface of the regional aquifer at approximately 20 m below ground level bgl the regional aquifer is not the focus of this study however based on water level and temperature data this aquifer can be considered hydraulically disconnected from the river and shallow braidplain aquifer and separated by an unsaturated zone of 15 m in thickness the calculated porosity values for the springston and burnham formations range between 0 18 and 0 3 from 27 samples of recovered drillhole core material at the study site robb 2021 these values are consistent with other studies on the canterbury plains dann et al 2009 3 methods 3 1 horizontal directional drilling horizontal directional drilling hdd was used to construct two 100 m long 125 mm diameter drillholes at a depth of approximately 5 m beneath and perpendicular to the river channel at the study site on the waikirikiri selwyn river the two hdd drillholes true right hdd1 and true left hdd2 orientation looking down river were drilled with the assistance of a xanthan gum drilling mud to keep the hole open and provide lubricant during the installation process following a successful drillhole a 125 mm diameter poly pipe conduit was welded to the exposed drill bit this poly pipe was temporarily installed within the hdd hole via back reaming hybrid fo cable consisting of multi mode fibres and 2x18awg copper conductors fig s2 were then threaded through the temporary conduit the fo cables were then held in place while the temporary conduit was removed this installation method enabled the drillhole to subsequently collapse allowing the riverbed material to make direct contact with the cable the cable connector terminals were secured in a buried cable pit on the riverbank to prevent vandalism and damage from river flooding 3 2 active distributed temperature sensing a silixa xt dts distributed temperature sensor combined with a silixa heat pulse system was used to collect a dts measurements along both fo cables the reported manufacturer specifications of the xt dts details a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m spatial resolution of 0 54 m and a temperature resolution of 0 01 c silixa ltd uk the spatial resolution is larger than the sample interval and is typically estimated by applying the 90 step change method where the true temperature change occurs over a step wise shift in distance along the fo cable selker et al 2014 simon et al 2020 tyler et al 2009 a double ended configuration was used where the instrument makes measurements from both directions of a looped fo cable that has its two ends connected to the xt dts the non uniform differential loss along the length of the fibre is corrected by aligning the forward and reverse signals that are measured from both ends of the fibre in addition 8 m of cable reference sections were positioned in two calibration baths of different temperatures ambient river water collected at the time of survey and ice water 0 c that were monitored using pt 100 temperature probes connected to the xt dts fig s3 the temperature measurement error for the ice calibration bath for the true right was 0 068 c and 0 099 c for the true left over the duration of the measurement period the measurement error for the river calibration bath for the true right was 0 100 c and 0 11 c for the true left each measurement cycle used the ice calibration bath temperature to correct the reported temperature value along the length of the cable at a sample interval of 0 25 m the double ended configuration together with the calibration baths greatly improves the temperature accuracy and precision along the length of the fibre hausner et al 2011 van de giesen et al 2012 the measurement sequence acquisition sampling rate and heat pulse duration for the surveys using the double ended configuration involved the following an acquisition sampling rate of 10 s sampled at 5 s on channel 1 forward measurement and 5 s on channel 2 reverse measurement for a measurement period of 300 s i e baseline temperature conditions prior to heating the cable for 1200 s at 15 w m 1 of cable followed by a post heating measurement period of 1200 s this sampling routine was sufficient to capture subtle temperature changes along the fibre and a significant increase in temperature from the baseline conditions 3 3 surface water and groundwater monitoring infrastructure there is an extensive network of surface water and groundwater monitoring infrastructure at the study site fig 1 it includes a river level gauge recorder station 68007 on the western edge of the main channel and a network of 27 shallow piezometers e g s01 s02 etc completed in the unconfined shallow braidplain aquifer screen intervals between 1 and 4 m below ground and deep piezometers completed in the semi confined regional aquifer screen intervals between 19 and 35 m below ground river stage and surface water temperature are recorded at 15 min intervals regular manual flow gauging has been undertaken to create a flow rating curve to calculate surface water discharge at the level gauge and differential flow gauging to determine water loss along the river reach within the study site water levels and temperature in the shallow and deep aquifers are recorded at 15 min intervals 3 4 mathematical model for estimating thermal conductivity and groundwater velocity the evolution of temperature in saturated porous media due to advection and conduction is described by the 2d heat transport equation bakker et al 2015 domenico and schwartz 1998 1 t t d 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 u r t x where t c is temperature t s is time d m2 s is thermal diffusivity u is groundwater velocity m s in the positive x direction and r is a thermal retardation coefficient the porosity weighted thermal diffusivity and thermal retardation coefficients are defined as 2 d λ c ρ n λ w 1 n λ s n c w ρ w 1 n c s ρ s 3 r c ρ n c w ρ w 1 1 n c s ρ s n c w ρ w where n is porosity λ w m c 1 is thermal conductivity c is specific heat capacity j kg 1 c 1 and ρ kg m 3 is density subscript w refers to water s refers to solids and no subscript indicates the combined rock fluid matrix it is assumed that the temperature of water and solids are at instantaneous equilibrium and the effect of temperature on density and viscosity is negligible anderson 2005 in this study a dts survey temperature data and the analytic moving instantaneous line source mils solution of zubair and chaudhry 1996 as detailed in bakker et al 2015 are used to estimate thermal conductivity and groundwater velocity i e average linear or pore fluid velocity u along the a dts cable at a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m it is assumed that the estimated groundwater velocity represents the magnitude of the dominant groundwater flow vector across the cable although the direction of flow cannot be determined by the method and remains unknown in the mils model an infinitely long source of constant heat q w m is located at the origin normal to the plane of constant groundwater flow the change in temperature δt c since the start of heating t s at a radial distance r m from the line source is given by 4 δ t q 4 π λ exp ux 2 d r w r 2 4 d t ur 2 d r where w is the hantush well function defined as 5 w a b a 1 s exp s b 2 4 s d s observations of temperature change during the heating period were used to fit equation 4 using a non linear least squares algorithm implemented in python the output was best fitting values of thermal conductivity groundwater velocity and thermal diffusivity optimised using the temperature change at each individual measurement point along the cable the root mean square error rmse was calculated from the residuals between the best fitting model and the data which gives a measure of the goodness of fit additionally a covariance matrix was calculated and the parameter standard deviations used to construct error bars in this context a small error bar indicates a good fit was achieved between measured and modelled data over a small range of parameter values during the non linear least squares estimation procedure the thermal retardation value r is calculated as 3 1 this is calculated using a porosity of 0 2 as measured by robb 2021 in the vicinity of the a dts cable values of density and specific heat capacity for water were taken from bakker et al 2015 as follows cw of 4 100 j kg 1 c 1 ρs of 2 650 kg m 3 and ρw of 1 000 kg m 3 specific heat capacity for the solid which is a greywacke derived material was taken from average values reported by mielke et al 2016 as cs of 800 j kg 1 c 1 this value is slightly lower than the 860 j kg 1 c 1 used by bakker et al 2015 the copper heating conductor and optical fibres are contained within a composite fo cable as shown in fig s2 the manufacturer specifications indicate that the distance between the copper heating conductor and optical fibre is within the range of 1 8 mm and 3 7 mm in order to estimate this distance we used equation 4 with u 0 and other values as listed above and iteratively altered the value of λ and r to optimise the match i e minimise the rmse between the modelled and measured heating curves along the cable during the conduction dominant period of the heating curve using this approach r values of 2 9 mm and 3 1 mm were estimated for the true right and true left cables respectively for the modelling 3 0 mm was used for the base case scenario the impact of uncertainty associated with this parameter is explored as part of a sensitivity analysis a key assumption in our interpretation of the data is that the drillhole annulus has collapsed around the fo cable this assumption is needed to consider that the a dts measurements are representative of perpendicular flow across the cable from the surrounding sediments 4 results 4 1 surface water and groundwater time series groundwater levels in the shallow aquifer piezometers s02 s04 s06 s08 and s21 show very similar temporal trends to river stage fig 3 a the direct response in the groundwater to changes in river stage indicates that the river and shallow braidplain aquifer are intimately connected although the true right and true left surveys were conducted 1 week apart the river level and the shallow groundwater level conditions were similar the hydraulic head gradient between the river and the observed shallow piezometers ranged from 0 15 to 0 76 average 0 5 confirming that the local flow field at the cable locations was from the river to groundwater fig 3b similar temporal trends are observed in the temperature time series data between the river and shallow groundwater fig 3c at the daily timescale there is a clear diurnal temperature response in the river where the surface water temperature increases from early morning and peaking mid afternoon before decreasing again in the evening fig 3d and fig 3e the diurnal temperature signal in the shallow groundwater is dampened compared to the river an exception is piezometer s21 which is located on the inside of the river meander bend and shows a similar diurnal temperature signal to the river but there is a clear phase shift lag and its amplitude is also slightly dampened the dampened amplitude and phase lag signals can be used to infer the losing river conditions we assume that these diurnal temperature variations do not have a significant effect on the adts measurements given the overall duration of the experiment approximately 45 min the surveys were also undertaken before the highest daily temperatures that are typically experienced by mid afternoon 4 2 active distributed temperature sensing the baseline and peak heat pulse temperature measurements for the true right 24 02 2021 and true left 01 03 2021 surveys are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively for the true right survey from 0 to 32 1 m the cable is located within the unsaturated zone and above the water level of shallow piezometer s02 this is also the case at 100 to 105 m where the cable is above the water level of piezometer s04 fig 4a the river temperature 21 c at the time of the true right survey was higher than the measured temperature of the shallow groundwater in piezometers s02 17 1 c s04 16 6 c and s21 15 1 c and the measured baseline temperature along the a dts cable that was located below the shallow watertable fig 4b for the true left survey from 0 to 46 1 m and from 98 7 to 106 m the cable is within the unsaturated zone and above the water levels of shallow piezometers s06 and s08 which are located on the gravel bar between two of the braided river channels fig 5a the river temperature 17 6 c at the time of the true left survey was higher than the measured temperature of the shallow groundwater in piezometers s06 15 8 c and s08 15 6 c and the measured baseline temperature along the a dts cable that was located below the shallow watertable fig 5b for the a dts cable that is located below the watertable in both surveys there is some visible spatial variability in the measured baseline and peak heat pulse temperature measurements that suggest zones beneath the river that have greater or less advective flow for example at a distance between 62 and 68 m for the true right there is an abrupt change in the temperature profile the measured baseline temperature at this low point is similar to the measured groundwater temperature of s021 at the time of the survey fig 4b and the river temperature measured early that morning on the 24 02 2021 fig 3d similar comparisons can be made for the true left survey where the measured early morning river temperature on the 01 03 2021 is close to the baseline a dts survey and the shallow groundwater temperature breakthrough curves at selected locations along the saturated sections of the fo cable are shown for the true right survey in fig 6 and for the true left survey in fig 7 when the heating cable is turned on there is a temperature increase from the baseline of about 4 c where it reaches an asymptotic plateau once the heating is turned off the temperature returns to the baseline fig 6a and fig 7a the sections of the cable that are located within the unsaturated zone and above the watertable of the shallow braidplain aquifer true right 0 32 1 m 100 105 m and true left 0 46 1 m 98 7 106 m show greater increases in temperature 8 10 c immediately after the heating is turned on fig 6b and fig 7b for the groundwater velocity calculations these measurements are not considered due to the partially saturated conditions of the unsaturated zone other noticeable features in the temperature heat maps fig 6c and fig 7c are locations along the fo cable where there is more rapid cooling or where the temperature increase is not as high compared to adjacent locations these features of rapid cooling are likely to be locations of higher groundwater velocities created by the spatial variability in the hydrogeological conditions of the braidplain aquifer for the true right survey on 24 02 2021 fitting equation 5 to the temperature data suggests an average groundwater velocity of 12 0 m d 1 with values along the length of cable at a spatial sample interval of 0 25 m ranging between 10 8 and 13 6 m d 1 fig 8 a the average thermal conductivity is 0 56 w m 1 c 1 with a range in values from 0 48 to 0 62 w m 1 c 1 the clear change in the baseline temperature at a distance between 62 and 68 m is also the location of the calculated highest velocity for the true left survey on 01 03 2021 the average groundwater velocity is 15 8 m d 1 and along the length of cable the velocities range from 12 4 to 19 4 m d 1 fig 8b the average thermal conductivity is 0 74 w m 1 c 1 with a range in values from 0 66 to 0 80 w m 1 c 1 rmse for the surveys conducted on the 24 02 2021 and 01 03 2021 are less than 0 07 c indicating a good fit between modelled and measured temperature change along the cable a simple sensitivity analysis of the input parameters that were used in the mils flow and heat transport model was undertaken on the tr survey data the derived groundwater velocity and bulk thermal conductivity values as a result of increasing and decreasing the input parameters of porosity specific heat capacity and r by 20 are shown in table 1 changing the porosity from the base case of 0 2 to 0 16 increased the groundwater velocity from an average of 12 to 14 4 m d 1 whilst modifying the distance between the line heat source and the fibre r from 2 4 to 3 6 mm changed the estimated groundwater velocity from 9 6 to 14 4 m d 1 there was no change to the estimated bulk conductivity with the range of input parameters that were tested 5 discussion assuming that the measured groundwater velocity is in the vertical direction the average specific discharge q i e river loss to the shallow braidplain aquifer is 2 8 m d 1 ranged from 2 3 to 3 3 m d 1 this was determined using the calculated average groundwater velocity u of 13 9 m d 1 ranged from 11 6 to 16 5 m d 1 for the true right and true left surveys and a measured porosity of 0 2 from the drillcore material the groundwater velocities do not vary significantly beneath the width of the active river channel as defined by the wetted footprint of the channel in a previous study by vincent 2005 of the upper reaches of the waikirikiri selwyn river it was suggested that the groundwater movement within the shallow braidplain aquifer would be influenced by remnant paleochannels that have formed by progressive shifting and abandonment of river channels on the alluvial fan surfaces furthermore preferential groundwater flow would occur where there is a complex network of interconnected channels of more permeable gravels surrounded by less permeable sediments and would also be influenced by the heterogeneity of the aquifer material this does not appear to be a significant controlling factor on the groundwater velocities beneath the active river channel at the study site however the measurement scale 0 25 m sample interval compared to the potential scale of macropore flow 1 2 cm needs to be taken into consideration the calculated groundwater velocities are dependent on the derived thermal conductivities in this study there was not a large variation in the values along the length of the cable for the two surveys and the uncertainty in thermal conductivity was relatively low fig 8 however we note that simon et al 2021b and del val et al 2021 found that calculated thermal conductivity uncertainty increases when the conduction dominant period is short as occurs under high flux conditions such as those found in our study the effects of homogeneous and heterogeneous distributions of sediment thermal conductivity on vertical groundwater flux estimates in a high flux stream and low flux lagoon was studied by sebok and müller 2019 their study found that the vertical heterogeneous distribution of thermal conductivity did not significantly change the modelled versus observed temperature data compared to the homogeneous distribution however it was critical that spatially representative thermal properties are used to obtain more precise flux estimates rather than using standard textbook values in our study the best fit values lowest rmse which was less than 0 07 c for both surveys for the bulk thermal conductivity of the saturated fluid rock matrix for the true right and true left a dts transects are contained within a narrow range from 0 48 to 0 8 w m 1 c 1 reported thermal conductivity for greywacke basement rock porosity 0 03 is 1 7 w m 1 c 1 mielke et al 2016 the variations to the geometrical arrangement of layers mineral grains and pores will also affect the bulk conductivity in particular changes in porosity clauser 2011 therefore the derived low bulk thermal conductivities from the two surveys are reasonable for the saturated fluid rock matrix of the greywacke aquifer material that has an average porosity of 0 2 when the porosity values were changed from 0 16 to 0 24 compared to the base case n 0 2 the calculated groundwater velocities decreased from 14 4 to 6 3 m d 1 another consideration as to why the derived bulk thermal conductivities are low for the saturated aquifer material in this study is how the subsurface gravels and fines have collapsed and repacked around the fo cable after horizontal drilling and cable installation this re packing settling of heavier gravels and infill of finer material would change the proportion of water filled voids to solid material unfortunately there is no way to physically measure this change in situ but repeat a dts surveys may be able to identify if there is any notable change to the derived bulk thermal conductivities along the length of the cable with time physical measurements of drillcore material using a thermal properties analyser would also help constrain the range in plausible values for the aquifer material under different saturated conditions one of the more sensitive parameters in the mils flow and heat transport model was associated with knowing the exact start time of the heating input s and the value of r as the distance between the heating line source and the observing fibre refer to equation 5 a simple sensitivity analysis of the tr survey showed that the effect of changing the start time from 240 to 252 s changed the calculated groundwater velocity from 12 0 to 15 4 m d 1 and the bulk thermal conductivity from 0 56 to 0 69 w m 1 c 1 the results presented here indicate that a higher temporal resolution in the early time measurements is important to capture the rapid temperature change in response to the line source heating whilst changing the distance between the line heat source and the fibre r by 0 8 mm was very sensitive to the derived groundwater velocities implying that knowing the cable specifications is critical to the survey results the main challenge with interpreting the a dts data is that the inferred direction of water flow is assumed to be 1d and does not account for flow in the two other directions multi direction 3d flow fields in the shallow streambed have been evaluated for hyporheic exchange using other active heat pulse temperature methods e g banks et al 2018 however there are no known studies that have been undertaken at depths greater than a few metres within river channels it is assumed that the longitudinal flow component in the near surface of the riverbed in the direction of river flow would be greater than the vertical and lateral flow components because of the permeability structure in riverbed environments the installation depth of the horizontal fo cable at the study site is several metres below the influence of hyporheic zone exchange lewandowski et al 2019 and therefore the derived groundwater velocities represent the dominant direction of flow within the shallow braidplain aquifer based on the observed hydraulic head gradient between the river and water level of the shallow braidplain aquifer as well as the measured differential river flow gauging we can be confident that the calculated specific discharge over this river reach represents river loss the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material of the shallow braidplain aquifer was estimated to be in the range of 23 to 33 m d 1 this was determined based on the range of calculated groundwater velocities 11 6 and 16 5 m d 1 and the measured average hydraulic head gradient between the river and shallow braidplain aquifer which at the time of the surveys was 0 5 m these hydraulic conductivities are less than the values based on aquifer tests that were done at the site which ranged from 75 to 250 m d 1 the permeability of riverbed materials are known to vary over eight orders of magnitude 9 10 6 to 9 102 m d 1 calver 2001 and because of the significant spatio temporal variability this can strongly control river loss to groundwater aquifer tests results primarily represent horizontal flow whereas river leakage is controlled by vertical hydraulic conductivity which is expected to be lower because of stratification and imbrication manual differential flow gauging that was undertaken on the 24 02 2021 using an acoustic doppler velocimeter by hydrographers from niwa measured a river infiltration loss of 8 640 m3 d 1 average point measurement uncertainty of 3 over a river reach length of 333 m equivalent to 26 m3 d 1 m 1 that encompassed the true right and true left a dts transect locations fig 1 in comparison the measured river infiltration loss over the entire 888 m long river reach of the study area was 22 464 m3 d 1 equivalent to 25 m3 d 1 m 1 using a wetted footprint width of the active river channel of 60 m and an effective distance over which the adts measurement can be applied that is equivalent to the diameter of the drillhole 0 125 m and combined with the calculated specific discharge from the a dts surveys 2 8 m d 1 the river infiltration loss at the transect locations is 21 m3 d 1 m 1 the calculated river losses using the a dts survey data and differential flow gauging are similar which is an encouraging result the scale of investigation between the two techniques is the most likely contributing factor to the different river loss calculations despite the low measurement uncertainty the differential flow gauging provides a net loss of surface water over a river reach that is 100 s of metres long whilst the a dts survey is measuring the groundwater velocities within the braidplain aquifer at a local scale directly beneath the active river channel but also at a high spatial resolution along the length of the transect that is perpendicular to the river channel 6 summary the novel approach that has been used in this study provides an improved understanding of the complex sw gw exchange processes in braided river systems the fo cable installation beneath the riverbed has demonstrated the value of a dts to quantify river infiltration losses at a high spatial sample interval 0 25 m and over the entire width of the active river channel there was some spatial variation in the calculated groundwater velocities beneath the active river channel which ranged from 11 6 to 16 5 m d 1 average 13 9 m d 1 these findings suggest that changes in the riverbed geomorphology or the presence of more transmissive paleochannels are to a small degree influencing preferential groundwater flowpaths in the shallow braidplain aquifer at the survey sites the calculated average infiltration loss of 21 m3 d 1 m 1 from the a dts surveys was similar to values derived from differential flow gauging across the study site 25 to 26 m3 d 1 m 1 the buried permanent installation of the fo cable allows for repeat surveys at different river stage and aquifer conditions to be conducted more frequently to evaluate how hydrologic conditions may affect groundwater velocities and recharge rates a higher frequency of monitoring has potential to be used to identify critical river flow conditions when the highest groundwater recharge occurs thus providing valuable information to water management decisions 6 1 future recommendations to improve the conceptualisation of river infiltration loss in braided river systems the significance of 1d versus 2d flow components beneath the river needs to be addressed to address the uncertainty in the derived groundwater velocities and to explore the phenomena of multi directional flow two vertical a dts fo cables have recently been installed on the riverbank adjacent to the horizontal drillholes to a depth of 30 m planned future surveys will hopefully provide greater insight into the complex flow fields beneath the river and resolve whether the vertical or lateral flow component is more dominant at this study site further work is required to compare the different analytical approaches of bakker et al 2015 to those of other studies including the adts toolbox by simon and bour 2022 and how they align to different fibre and heating cable configurations furthermore how this approach relates to the analytical solutions described by others including diao et al 2004 and del val et al 2021 the installation of the horizontal fo cables was a very costly field investigation method however this type of installation provided very high spatial resolution of groundwater velocities beneath a complex braided river system it has also allowed for multiple surveys to be conducted during different flow conditions with a reduced risk of losing equipment due to changing river flow conditions this was demonstrated in june 2021 when the installation survived a significant 1 50 year flood event where the river level gauge station and eight piezometers were damaged and lost time series data from a high resolution vertical dts profile used in the study by vogt et al 2010 observed sporadic high infiltration rates at times of high water tables the installation described in our study is of considerable benefit to being able to measure the dynamic behaviour of groundwater recharge beneath complex braided river systems and improve modelling efforts of sw gw exchange future planned research activities will provide new insights to how the controlling factors of river stage and channel elevation relative to watertable elevation of the shallow braidplain aquifer changes river infiltration loss prior to and after a large flood event other types of installation of fo cable or individual temperature sensors at an oblique angle beneath the river channel are also being considered to provide a simpler solution to be able to measure river infiltration losses during different flow events at several locations and at a reduced cost declaration of competing interest the

2677,pre releasing before a flood can increase reservoir flood control storage capacity to effectively improve the flood disaster prevention and mitigation effects but also might bring water shortage risk due to the uncertain forecasts this paper proposes a framework to determine the optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release based on uncertain forecasts the framework includes three models a pre release model at the early stage of the flood to enlarge the flood control storage capacity a multi objective optimization model with resilience and risk as objectives at the flood regulating stage to optimize the flood control operating rules a fuzzy optimum selecting model to determine the satisfied operating rule considering forecast uncertainty and decision maker s preferences in the framework forecast uncertainty has been considered from the perspective of the forecast error distribution nierji reservoir in northeast china is taken as a case study results show that compared with the existing operating rule the recommended operating rule considering pre release releases water more evenly and can not only decrease the peak flow at the downstream protection point but also improve the downstream flood resilience without increasing reservoir risk the proposed framework that considers forecast error distribution provides higher superiority degrees of the rules than the traditional framework that considers the maximum and minimum forecast errors in the real time operation of the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs keywords flood control flood resilience forecast uncertainty pre release operating rules data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction flood disaster is one of the most frequent natural disasters that threaten human production and life berz 2000 milly et al 2002 shi et al 2020 reservoir flood control operation is the most important non engineering measure for safeguarding people s property and social stability arsenault et al 2016 fu et al 2016 huang and hsieh 2010 which can be enhanced by the utilization of forecast information reservoirs can pre release or pre store storage with the forecast information to increase the flood control or water conservation benefits pre release aims to vacate the flood control storage before floods to accommodate an impending flood more adequately pre store is to conserve more water in the reservoir to mitigate the water supply risk when there is no subsequent flood there are many studies carried out on the pre store li et al 2010 proposed a dynamic pre storing model considering the uncertainty of forecast information to increase the floodwater resources without decreasing the flood control benefits chen et al 2012 built a simulation based optimization model to dynamic control the reservoir flood limiting water level by pre store to achieve the maximum hydropower benefits without affecting flood benefits despite the rich research in the field of pre store there have been few studies on the pre release chou and wu 2013 proposed a decision support tool for a reservoir to pre release using the real time flood forecast information before the typhoon comes and proved that the pre release strategy can effectively increase the flood control benefits without increasing the risk of water supply shortage however due to the increase of flood frequency with a warmer climate alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2013 more and more management has focused on further excavating the flood control capacity of existing reservoirs more exploration of pre release to increase the flood control benefits is necessary the impact of forecast uncertainty on the reservoir flood forecast control operation mode is crucial beven 1993 2000 smith et al 2012 wei et al 2018 when the forecast value is larger than the observed value due to the forecast errors the pre release volume will be higher than the actual value which leads to that the future inflow volume cannot make the reservoir water level raise back to the water level before pre releasing and thus increase the water shortage risk therefore the impacts of forecast uncertainty cannot be ignored currently there are two ways to consider forecast uncertainty one is that the operating rule is optimized with observations i e perfect forecast and the forecast uncertainties are considered in the evaluation of the operating rules diao and wang 2010 zhou and guo 2014 the operating rule determined by this method can guarantee flood control safety but it is only the optimal rule for the perfect forecast the other one is that the operating rule is optimized with the forecast at the maximum and minimum errors which is safe for flood control zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 however the operating rule is optimal only for the forecast with maximum and minimum errors and yet the probability of which is very small in conclusion the above two methods have not excavated the comprehensive benefits of the reservoirs thus this paper proposes a framework considering forecast uncertainty from the perspective of forecast error distribution i e optimizes the operating rule with the forecast at the maximum probability identifies the feasible rules through evaluating the flood risks brought by forecast uncertainty and lastly determines the satisfactory rule with the fuzzy optimum selecting model the operating rule is often determined by the optimization operation model the objectives of flood control operation can be divided into two categories one is the profit objective such as maximizing the benefits of water conservation peng et al 2017 maximizing hydropower generation zhou et al 2018 the other one is the damage objective defined by the extreme value such as minimizing the highest level of the reservoir and minimizing the maximum release zhao et al 2017 however the damage of the flood to the system is a process that contains not only the extreme value but also the duration of the flood damage for example the damage of the dike is related with the magnitude of the flood over the top of the dike and the duration of the dike soaking the longer the dike is soaked the larger damage therefore it is necessary to evaluate and reduce the whole process of damage resilience theory proposed in the ecosystem by holling 1973 has been used to evaluate the process of flood damage gotangco et al 2016 karamouz and zahmatkesh 2017 lee and kim 2017 it can effectively assess the ability of the system to resist the flood absorb the flood adapt to the flood and recover to its original state after floods de bruijn et al 2019 the main idea of flood resilience is adapting to flood instead of controlling flood liao 2012 and it has been widely applied in urban flood control gotangco et al 2016 kotzee and reyers 2016 zhong et al 2020 for example chen and leandro 2019 proposed a time varying flood resilience index to achieve the quantification of the system response during and after floods to promote flood risk management wang et al 2019 developed a new flood resilience metric based on system performance function to identify the vulnerable catchments and to evaluate the adaptation strategy to flood prevention plan these studies show that flood resilience like risk can be used as an evaluation index of flood damage however few research focused on the flood resilience application in the flood forecast control operation system in the paper a framework to determine optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release is proposed in the framework a pre release model at the early stage of a flood has been built to evacuate the flood control storage second a multi objective optimization model with three objectives i e maximizing the flood resilience for the downstream system and minimizing the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the maximum water level of the reservoir is established to optimize the flood control operating rules third a fuzzy optimum selecting model is adopted to determine the recommended operating rule considering forecast uncertainty and decision makers preferences the proposed framework is applied to nierji reservoir located in northeast china the recommended operating rules by the framework are compared with the existing rules with no pre release and meanwhile compared with the rule derived from the framework that considers the forecast uncertainty by using the maximum and minimum forecast errors finally 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs are further applied to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework 2 methodology fig 1 illustrates the flowchart of the proposed framework which includes three models a pre release model section 2 2 a multi objective optimization model section 2 3 a fuzzy optimum selecting model section 2 4 the pre release model is applied at the early stage to enlarge the flood control storage capacity and the multi objective optimization model is applied at the flood regulating stage to optimize the flood control operating rules fig 2 the stages can be distinguished by the discriminant indicators which can represent the magnitude of floods the pre release model includes the feasibility analysis of forecast information and the selection of the discriminant indicators for pre release the multi objective optimization model with 3 objectives i e maximizing the flood resilience of the downstream system r obj minimizing the maximum water level of the reservoir z obj and the peak flow of the downstream protection point q obj is established to generate the pareto optimal solutions by the designed flood hydrographs finally the fuzzy optimum selecting model considering the forecast uncertainty and the preferences of decision makers is established to identify the satisfied operating rule in the pareto optimal solution set 2 1 the identification of forecast error distribution forecast error distribution identification is the premise of forecast utilization currently many probability distribution functions have been applied to describe the forecast error distribution such as p iii type distribution chen et al 2018 normal distribution function zhang et al 2014 and the maximum entropy model diao et al 2007 the maximum entropy model is applied in this study since it can identify the error distribution without any subjective assumptions about unknown information jaynes 1957 it has been widely used and achieves good results cabrera and lee 2020 diao et al 2007 after obtaining the forecast error distribution the following information can be obtained forecast error distribution the forecast error at the maximum possibility δ0 as well as the standard error interval δmin δmax in which the probability of forecast error is 99 99 here δmin δmax are defined as the minimum forecast error and maximum forecast error respectively 2 2 the pre release model the pre release model is to enlarge release to increase the flood control storage capacity at the early stage when there will be a flood in the future generally the discriminant indicators are the forecast cumulative net rainfall arsenault et al 2016 chou and wu 2013 and the forecast streamflow che and mays 2017 faber and stedinger 2001 zhao et al 2012 in the case study the reservoir forecast inflow is set as the discriminant indicator to distinguish these two stages as shown in fig 2 when the reservoir forecast inflow exceeds value qdown but does not exceed value qup at the early stage of floods the reservoir begins to pre release to enlarge the flood control storage capacity when the reservoir inflow exceeds value qup the reservoir begins to utilize the flood control storage to retain and control flood the larger the pre release volume the greater the flood control capacity and higher flood control benefits but when the forecast value is larger than the observed value or even no flood happens due to the forecast uncertainty the risk of the conservation benefits will increase a larger pre release might bring a higher risk of conservation therefore the pre release is to balance the flood control benefits and conservation risk in the paper the design basis of the pre release model using the forecast information at the early stage of floods is the pre release volume of the reservoir can guarantee that the future inflow volume can make the reservoir water level raise back to the designed flwl thus the pre release stage can be divided into two steps one step is the pre release step from t to t 1 the other step is the potential re store step from t 1 to t t 1 the water balance in the pre release step is as follows 1 v t 1 v t q in t q out t δ t if no flood will occur in the future we will restore water to rise the reservoir water level back to the designed flwl while ensuring the minimum release of the reservoir so that the water balance in the potential re store step is listed as follows 2 v flwl v t 1 k 1 t 1 q in t k k 1 t 1 q min t k δ t 3 w t k 0 t 1 q in t k combined eqs 1 2 and 3 then the pre release q out t at time t can be obtained 4 q out t f z t f z flwl 1 δ t w t k 1 t 1 q min t k 5 v t f z t where f is the water level storage capacity conversion function z t and v t are the reservoir water level and reservoir storage capacity at time t respectively z flwl and v flwl represent the designed flood limited water level flwl and the corresponding storage capacity v flwl f z flwl q in t is the forecast inflow at time t q in t k is the k day ahead forecasting flow at time t k 0 1 2 t t is the forecast lead time w t is the total forecasting inflow volume throughout the lead time at time t qmin t is the minimum water demand for downstream at time t δt is the time unit 2 3 the multi objective optimization model for flood control operation 2 3 1 objectives the objectives of the multi objective optimization model are the minimum of the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the reservoir maximum water level as well as the maximum of the flood resilience for the downstream system elaborated as follows 1 the minimum of the maximum reservoir water level 6 z o b j m i n 1 d d d z max d where d represents the number of flood hydrographs z max d represents the maximum water level of the reservoir during the dth flood hydrograph 2 the minimum of the peak flow at the downstream protection point 7 q o b j m i n 1 d d d q max d where q max d is the peak flow of the downstream protection point during the dth flood hydrograph 3 the maximum flood resilience for the downstream system 8 r o b j m a x 1 d n d r d where r d represents the flood resilience of the downstream system during the dth flood hydrograph the resilience of the downstream system measures the ability of the downstream system to resist flood absorb flood adapt to flood and recover to the original state after floods the quantification of resilience includes the attribute based and system performance based indexes the selection of the indicators and the weights of the indicators in the attribute based methods are subjective so that the application of the attribute based methods is limited karamouz and zahmatkesh 2017 li et al 2019 the performance based index is based on the system performance function bruneau et al 2003 which is simple to quantify and has been widely used in the urban flood system lee and kim 2017 mugume et al 2015 therefore we use the system performance function to quantify the flood resilience in the flood forecast control operation the system performance ps t at time t is described as follows 9 ps t 1 q t q min q max q t q max q min q min q t q max 0 q t q max where q min is the minimum streamflow that the system is destructed and the system is safe when streamflow is below q min q max is the streamflow that the system is completely destructed when the downstream flow is larger than q max the flood resilience r of the system can be obtained by integrating the system performance function curve ps t which can be expressed as 10 r 1 t n 0 t n p s t d t 2 3 2 decision variables and optimization method the discriminant indicators and the corresponding release in the flood forecast control rule are decision variables e g the limq 1 limq 2 limq 3 and xk k 0 1 6 are the decision variables of the study in table 1 section 3 3 the flood forecast control rules are optimized through the non dominated genetic algorithm nsga ii which has fast convergence speed and low computational complexity 2 4 fuzzy optimum selecting model the fuzzy optimum selecting model is built as follows first the forecast error at the maximum probability δ0 is introduced to optimize the operating rules by nsga ii second the feasible rules are identified from the pareto optimal front considering the uncertainty of the forecast information the pareto optimal solutions are used to simulate the designed hydrographs with maximum and minimum forecast errors of δmin and δmax and the solutions the number is denoted by m that satisfy the safety requirement of upstream and downstream flood safety have remained third the design flood hydrographs have been operated by m solutions under different forecast errors and these forecast errors are discretized equally within the forecast error range then the three objectives including the maximum water level k 1 the peak flow at the downstream protection point k 2 and the resilience for the downstream system k 3 of the m solutions under different discrete forecast errors can be calculated it is difficult to directly compare solutions of multi objective problems therefore we use the fuzzy optimum selecting model more details see shouyu and yu 2006 to evaluate the relative superiority degree of each solution for different the decision makers preferences i e the weights of the objectives so as to facilitate the comparison of solutions generally the larger the relative superiority degree of the solution the better the performance of the solution for real time flood operation under the decision maker s preference the steps are listed as follows 1 divide the error interval δmin and δmax into n equal divisions δ 0 δ 1 δ n 1 δ n δ 0 δ min δ n δ max and calculate the corresponding occurrence frequency p 0 p 1 p n 1 p n by the forecast error distribution 2 simulate the flood hydrographs

fuzzy optimization method to evaluate each solution with evaluation index matrix for the objectives k 3 the higher the better the relative membership degree equation is 11 r i j k o i j k min o j k

is used to solve the model here we use λ 1 the solution with the maximum u value is the final chosen rule 3 case study 3 1 the location and the task of the study reservoir nierji reservoir nr with a drainage area of 66 382 km2 is located in the up reaches of the nen river it spans inner mongolia and heilongjiang provinces northern china as shown in fig 3 the nierji water conservancy project as the most important engineering of nen river and even the songhua river basin flood control engineering system undertakes the flood control task of the mainstream of nen river together with the embankment system the primary protection downstream city is qiqihaer city there are mainly two tributaries named namoer river and nuoming river between nr and qiqihaer city that determines the interval inflow the total reservoir capacity of nr is 86 1 109 m3 with the flood control storage capacity of 23 7 109 m3 and the utilizable capacity of 59 6 109 m3 the normal water storage level the maximum water storage level the flood limited water level flwl and the dead water level are 216 00 m 218 15 m 213 37 m and 195 00 m respectively in terms of flood prevention and mitigation it has improved the flood protection level of qiqihaer city from once in 50 years to 100 years and increased the flood protection level of the interval region between qiqihaer city and nierji reservoir from once in 20 years to 50 years muskingum method is used to address the hydraulic connections between the upstream reservoir nierji reservoir the interval tributaries nuoming river and nomoer river and the downstream protection point qiqihaer city in the study 3 2 the identification of the forecast error distribution the accuracy of the 4 day ahead inflow forecast has been approved high enough to guide the flood control operation wei et al 2018 especially the relative error of the 4 day forecast flood volume is within 20 when the initial forecast flow is above 2000 m3 s therefore we use the 4 day forecast flood volume to guide pre release the probability distribution of relative error of the 4 day forecast flood volume identified by the maximum entropy model section 2 1 is shown in fig 4 the forecast error at the maximum probability is 1 3 and the probability of the error occurring in the forecast error interval 22 19 is 99 99 3 3 the release model of nierji reservoir the structure of the flood control operating rule is designed in table 1 the time interval is 1 day qin is the inflow of the reservoir qsum is the 1 day ahead forecast value at the downstream and can be predicted by the outflow of nierji reservoir the observed flow at dedu station in namoer river and guchengzi station in ruoming river the prediction accuracy is high and therefore assumed to be deterministic ding et al 2015 qdown is set to 2000 m3 s the reason is that the discriminant indicator of flood occurrence at the early stage of a flood is that the total flow of the three stations i e nierji reservoir dedu station and guchengzi station is above 3000 m3 s according to the proportion of the observed flow of nierji reservoir in the historic flood hydrographs we set that when the flow of nierji reservoir exceeds 2000 m3 s as the discriminant indicator of flood occurrence at the early stage of floods moreover the forecast accuracy with a 4 day forecast flood volume of inflow is high when qin is above 2000 m3 s as shown in fig 4 fds represents the period that inflow is greater than outflow frs represents the period that outflow is greater than inflow q out represents the pre release which can be calculated by equations 1 3 min qout x 0 means that the smaller of qout and x 0 is the final value limq 1 limq 2 limq 3 are the 20 year 50 year and 100 year flood discharge value of qsum and together with xk k 0 1 6 are decision variables which are determined by solving the optimization model with the 6 design flood hydrographs the 50 year and 100 year design floods of three typical floods 1969 1988 and 1998 6 table 1 shows that when inflow is small and smaller than limq 1 if the observed flow of nierji reservoir qin is above qdown i e 2000 m3 s the reservoir begins to pre release to enlarge the flood control storage capacity with the 4 day forecast flood volume when qsum exceeds value limq 1 the reservoir begins to utilize the flood control storage to retain and control flood 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal operating rules by the proposed framework 4 1 1 the pareto optimal solutions in the study the parameters of the nsga ii algorithm including the population size the number of iterations the probability of crossover the probability of mutation the distribution index for crossover and the distribution index for mutation are respectively set to 1 000 1 000 000 0 9 0 1 20 and 20 for comparison the optimal solutions for a scenario that does not consider pre release i e release equals inflow when q sum is below limq 1 is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen 1 the pareto optimal solutions of considering and not considering pre release scenario both locate above the redpoint denoted as the conventional rule cs which means that the framework provides superior rules to the conventional rule 2 the variation range of pareto optimal solutions considering pre releasing is wider than that of not considering pre releasing this means that considering pre releasing in the flood operation can decrease upstream risk without increasing downstream risk and flood resilience the pareto optimal solutions by the three objective optimization model considering pre releasing with the forecast error at the maximum probability are shown in fig 5 b as can be seen a decrease in the maximum reservoir water level is accompanied by an increase in the peak flow at the downstream protection point when the maximum reservoir water level approaches i e similar color the peak flow at the downstream protection point will increase with the increase of the flood resilience the results demonstrate that the three objectives of the optimization are not fully coordinated that is it is necessary to consider flood resilience as the objective in the determination of flood forecast control rules 4 1 2 the optimal rules considering forecast uncertainty and preferences the pareto optimal solutions are then filtrated by forecast uncertainty as introduced in section 2 4 if the solutions can satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream under error 22 δ m i n and 19 δ m a x they can satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream under all errors in the interval 22 19 the pareto optimal solutions considering pre releasing 10 000 rules are used to simulate the design flood hydrographs with relative forecast error of 22 and 19 and only 1661 feasible rules satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream flood control then using 0 1 as the discrete intervals the standard forecast error interval is discretized into 411 forecast errors 22 21 9 1 2 1 3 1 4 18 9 19 the z obj q obj and r obj under 411 forecast errors are obtained by 1661 rules there are 3 411 evaluation indexes for each feasible rule four different preference cases as listed in table 2 are set to select the satisfied rule case 1 does not consider flood resilience and assumes that the importance of the risk of downstream and upstream are the same the importance of the three objectives is the same in case 2 the decision makers pay more attention to upstream or reservoir risk in case 3 the decision makers pay more attention to downstream risk in case 4 the binary contrast method is adopted to quantify the weights by the preferences diao and wang 2010 section 2 4 to prove and qualify the superiority of the optimization considering resilience without pre release we can find a rule named rule cb in which the maximum water level is the same as rule cs 217 53 m but the peak flow at the downstream protection point 10 190 m3 s and the flood resilience 86 87 are better than rule cs 10 340 m3 s 86 18 from the optimal solution without no pre release table 3 it indicates that the optimization considering flood resilience and no pre release can provide rules that can improve the flood resilience of the downstream system and decrease the risk of downstream without increasing the risk of upstream secondly to prove and qualify the superiority of the optimization considering resilience and pre release we find a rule name rule cfb the flood resilience 88 48 the risk of downstream 9940 m3 s and the risk of upstream 217 52 m of which are better than rule cb from the pareto optimal solutions with pre release it further indicates that the proposed framework with pre release can provide rules that can ensure the higher safety of the reservoir and the downstream with a higher downstream flood resilience in addition the recommended operating rules obtained by the fuzzy optimum selecting model under each preference case and three different forecast error values are listed in table 3 more details about the optimized values of decision variables have been shown in table s1 in supplementary the results show that the recommended operating rules under extreme error 22 and 19 can also satisfy the safety of downstream and upstream to show more details the operation results of the 50 year design flood for the 1988 typical flood are shown in fig 6 it shows that the recommended operating rules by the proposed framework release more water at the early stage of the flood box 1 in fig 6 a which can increase the flood storage capacity rules z q and qzr mainly release the flood water more evenly and increase the reservoir flood detention time to mitigate the overall damage of the downstream system during flooding box 2 in fig 6 b this leads them to have better performance than rule qz in downstream risk and resilience compared with rules without considering resilience i e rules qz we can know that the duration of the peak flow at the downstream protection point by rules considering resilience i e rule q rule z and rule cfb is shorter fig 6 b and this leads to a shorter duration of flood damage fig 6 c the results further prove the advantages of considering resilience 4 2 analysis on the reasonability of the way to consider the forecast uncertainty to further verify the superiority of the way to consider the forecast error distribution in the proposed framework the traditional framework is adopted as comparison the traditional framework also with pre releasing model optimizes the rules under the maximum and minimum forecast error without considering the forecast error distribution then uses the fuzzy optimum selecting model considering the preferences of decision makers to determine the recommended operating rules including rule qzr qz q and z the rules with the highest relative superiority degree under different preferences of decision makers table 3 are determined as listed in table 4 the relative superiority degree of the rules for the real time flood calculated with fuzzy optimum selecting method details are listed in text s1 in supplementary is adopted for quantitively evaluation finally the recommended rules by the proposed and traditional framework respectively are used to simulate the operation of 1969 flood and 2013 flood the two largest floods of the study as can be seen the relative superiority degrees of the recommended rules i e qzr qz q and z from the proposed framework are better than that of the traditional framework this proves that the rules identified from the proposed framework are more suitable for real time operation in addition it shows that for the proposed and traditional framework the value of z obj using of rule z is smaller than that of other rules rules qzr qz and q and the value of q obj of rule q is smaller than that of other rules rules qzr qz and z this means that the decision maker s preferences can be considered by the fuzzy optimum selecting model 4 3 real time flood operation by the recommended rules from the proposed framework to further compare the operating performance of the different recommended rules selected by the proposed framework the real time flood operation results for 1969 flood and 2013 flood have been shown in figs 7 and 8 unlike rule cb and cs all recommended rules rule cfb rule q rule z rule qzr and rule qz are generated by the proposed framework that uses forecast information the forecast information can be obtained by the dbm model for more details see wei et al 2018 in real time flood operation unlike rules q z qzr and qz rule cfb is derived by rule cs that we think it fellows the preferences of decision maker who make rule cs compared with rule cb and cs the water levels of rules cfb in figs 7 and 8 is lowered by pre release at the early stage and are relatively late to return to the original flwl in the flood regulating stage so that there is more flood capability to release the flood slowly to make the downstream without damage or small damage to increase the resilience the pre release process of rule z rule q rule qz and rule qzr is similar at the early stage of 1969 flood fig 7 a and 2013 flood fig 8 a the major difference between these rules is the flood retention time and release values at the flood regulating stage rule z operates with the largest release and the shortest retention time resulting in the lowest value of the maximum water level the reason is that rule z has a higher preference in the upstream risk i e the weight of upstream risk is 0 555 than other recommended rules rules qzr qz and q table 3 rule q retains more flood water at the beginning of the flood regulation stage to decrease the flow of downstream because it has a higher preference in the downstream risk to explore the effects of forecast uncertainty on flood operation the forecasts from the dbm model wei et al 2018 and the forecast with perfect forecasts with a relative error of 22 and 19 are utilized for comparison with the operation rule of cfb as shown in figs 9 and 10 regardless of whether there is a forecast error or not the flood resilience of rule cfb and rule cb is higher than that of cs this phenomenon is mainly due to the flood damage duration being short this means flood resilience is effective as an objective to describe the damage process moreover since the overall forecasting values of dbm are less than the observed value the operation process based on the dbm model lies between the operation process based on a relative error of 22 and perfect forecasts 0 when the forecast value is larger than the observed value i e the relative error of 19 implying a larger flood the reservoir will release more water at the early stage of the flood shown in fig 8 that the water level is low and the release is high therefore the reservoir maximum water level and the peak flow at the downstream protection point are low on the contrary when the forecast value is smaller than the observed value i e the relative error of 22 the reservoir will pre release relatively smaller water at the early stage so that the flood control storage capacity has a small increase this leads to the increase of the reservoir s maximum water level and the peak flow at the downstream protection point by the flood operation process we can know that the water level process of the reservoir and the flow at the downstream protection point are acceptable under the maximum and minimum forecast error in the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrograph which proves the safety of rule cfb 5 conclusion the aim of this paper is to develop a framework to determine the optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release based on uncertain forecasts the framework consists of three models a pre release model a multi objective optimization model and a fuzzy optimum selecting model the pre release model has been developed to enlarge the flood control storage capacity at the early of a flood with the forecast information the multi objective optimization model not only considers the traditional objectives i e the minimization of the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the reservoir maximum water level but also considers a new objective i e the maximization of the flood resilience the fuzzy optimum selecting model has been built to select the recommended rules based on the forecast uncertainty finally nierji reservoir in the northeast of china has been taken as the case study and the following conclusions are drawn 1 the results show that three objectives i e the flood resilience for the downstream system the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the maximum water level of the reservoir of the optimization are not fully coordinated this means that it is feasible to take flood resilience as the objective for the selection and optimization of flood forecast control rules the rules considering resilience can reduce the duration of flooding and help the downstream system to tolerate floods and reorganize itself to achieve the transition from flood resistance to flood adaptation in addition by the comparison of the pareto optimal solutions from the optimization considering pre release or not the utilization of pre release can improve benefits from both upstream and downstream 2 by analyzing the operation process of the typical design flood the recommended operating rule considering pre release by the proposed framework release water more evenly it can not only decrease downstream risk but also increase downstream resilience without increasing reservoir risk therefore the proposed pre release model provides a new way for reservoir s operation which enlarge release to increase the flood control storage capacity at the early stage 3 the proposed framework has been compared with the traditional framework that just uses the maximum and minimum forecast errors in the real time flood hydrograph 1969 flood and 2013 flood the relative superiority degree of the flood operation results by the recommended rules by the proposed framework is better than that by the traditional framework this proves that the way to consider the forecast error distribution of the proposed framework is more reasonable for real time operation 4 the process results of the real time operation of the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs indicate that the recommended rules can lower the water levels by pre release in the early stage so that there is more flood capability to release the flood slowly to make the downstream without damage or small damage to increase the resilience and the results show that the operation result under the maximum and minimum forecast errors is acceptable with the safety of downstream and reservoir and the flood resilience has been greatly improved this is further proving that the proposed framework considering pre release and resilience is a more reasonable and beneficial operation the case in this study is a single reservoir however the reservoirs are connected in the basin i e muti reservoir system the proposed framework for pre releasing can be expanded in the multiple reservoir system through the aggregation decomposition method however in the multi reservoir system the correlation of the forecast uncertainties the hydraulic connections and the compensation effects of the reservoir capacity should be addressed the application in the multi reservoir system should be conducted in the future credit authorship contribution statement guozhen wei

2677,pre releasing before a flood can increase reservoir flood control storage capacity to effectively improve the flood disaster prevention and mitigation effects but also might bring water shortage risk due to the uncertain forecasts this paper proposes a framework to determine the optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release based on uncertain forecasts the framework includes three models a pre release model at the early stage of the flood to enlarge the flood control storage capacity a multi objective optimization model with resilience and risk as objectives at the flood regulating stage to optimize the flood control operating rules a fuzzy optimum selecting model to determine the satisfied operating rule considering forecast uncertainty and decision maker s preferences in the framework forecast uncertainty has been considered from the perspective of the forecast error distribution nierji reservoir in northeast china is taken as a case study results show that compared with the existing operating rule the recommended operating rule considering pre release releases water more evenly and can not only decrease the peak flow at the downstream protection point but also improve the downstream flood resilience without increasing reservoir risk the proposed framework that considers forecast error distribution provides higher superiority degrees of the rules than the traditional framework that considers the maximum and minimum forecast errors in the real time operation of the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs keywords flood control flood resilience forecast uncertainty pre release operating rules data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction flood disaster is one of the most frequent natural disasters that threaten human production and life berz 2000 milly et al 2002 shi et al 2020 reservoir flood control operation is the most important non engineering measure for safeguarding people s property and social stability arsenault et al 2016 fu et al 2016 huang and hsieh 2010 which can be enhanced by the utilization of forecast information reservoirs can pre release or pre store storage with the forecast information to increase the flood control or water conservation benefits pre release aims to vacate the flood control storage before floods to accommodate an impending flood more adequately pre store is to conserve more water in the reservoir to mitigate the water supply risk when there is no subsequent flood there are many studies carried out on the pre store li et al 2010 proposed a dynamic pre storing model considering the uncertainty of forecast information to increase the floodwater resources without decreasing the flood control benefits chen et al 2012 built a simulation based optimization model to dynamic control the reservoir flood limiting water level by pre store to achieve the maximum hydropower benefits without affecting flood benefits despite the rich research in the field of pre store there have been few studies on the pre release chou and wu 2013 proposed a decision support tool for a reservoir to pre release using the real time flood forecast information before the typhoon comes and proved that the pre release strategy can effectively increase the flood control benefits without increasing the risk of water supply shortage however due to the increase of flood frequency with a warmer climate alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2013 more and more management has focused on further excavating the flood control capacity of existing reservoirs more exploration of pre release to increase the flood control benefits is necessary the impact of forecast uncertainty on the reservoir flood forecast control operation mode is crucial beven 1993 2000 smith et al 2012 wei et al 2018 when the forecast value is larger than the observed value due to the forecast errors the pre release volume will be higher than the actual value which leads to that the future inflow volume cannot make the reservoir water level raise back to the water level before pre releasing and thus increase the water shortage risk therefore the impacts of forecast uncertainty cannot be ignored currently there are two ways to consider forecast uncertainty one is that the operating rule is optimized with observations i e perfect forecast and the forecast uncertainties are considered in the evaluation of the operating rules diao and wang 2010 zhou and guo 2014 the operating rule determined by this method can guarantee flood control safety but it is only the optimal rule for the perfect forecast the other one is that the operating rule is optimized with the forecast at the maximum and minimum errors which is safe for flood control zhang et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 however the operating rule is optimal only for the forecast with maximum and minimum errors and yet the probability of which is very small in conclusion the above two methods have not excavated the comprehensive benefits of the reservoirs thus this paper proposes a framework considering forecast uncertainty from the perspective of forecast error distribution i e optimizes the operating rule with the forecast at the maximum probability identifies the feasible rules through evaluating the flood risks brought by forecast uncertainty and lastly determines the satisfactory rule with the fuzzy optimum selecting model the operating rule is often determined by the optimization operation model the objectives of flood control operation can be divided into two categories one is the profit objective such as maximizing the benefits of water conservation peng et al 2017 maximizing hydropower generation zhou et al 2018 the other one is the damage objective defined by the extreme value such as minimizing the highest level of the reservoir and minimizing the maximum release zhao et al 2017 however the damage of the flood to the system is a process that contains not only the extreme value but also the duration of the flood damage for example the damage of the dike is related with the magnitude of the flood over the top of the dike and the duration of the dike soaking the longer the dike is soaked the larger damage therefore it is necessary to evaluate and reduce the whole process of damage resilience theory proposed in the ecosystem by holling 1973 has been used to evaluate the process of flood damage gotangco et al 2016 karamouz and zahmatkesh 2017 lee and kim 2017 it can effectively assess the ability of the system to resist the flood absorb the flood adapt to the flood and recover to its original state after floods de bruijn et al 2019 the main idea of flood resilience is adapting to flood instead of controlling flood liao 2012 and it has been widely applied in urban flood control gotangco et al 2016 kotzee and reyers 2016 zhong et al 2020 for example chen and leandro 2019 proposed a time varying flood resilience index to achieve the quantification of the system response during and after floods to promote flood risk management wang et al 2019 developed a new flood resilience metric based on system performance function to identify the vulnerable catchments and to evaluate the adaptation strategy to flood prevention plan these studies show that flood resilience like risk can be used as an evaluation index of flood damage however few research focused on the flood resilience application in the flood forecast control operation system in the paper a framework to determine optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release is proposed in the framework a pre release model at the early stage of a flood has been built to evacuate the flood control storage second a multi objective optimization model with three objectives i e maximizing the flood resilience for the downstream system and minimizing the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the maximum water level of the reservoir is established to optimize the flood control operating rules third a fuzzy optimum selecting model is adopted to determine the recommended operating rule considering forecast uncertainty and decision makers preferences the proposed framework is applied to nierji reservoir located in northeast china the recommended operating rules by the framework are compared with the existing rules with no pre release and meanwhile compared with the rule derived from the framework that considers the forecast uncertainty by using the maximum and minimum forecast errors finally 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs are further applied to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework 2 methodology fig 1 illustrates the flowchart of the proposed framework which includes three models a pre release model section 2 2 a multi objective optimization model section 2 3 a fuzzy optimum selecting model section 2 4 the pre release model is applied at the early stage to enlarge the flood control storage capacity and the multi objective optimization model is applied at the flood regulating stage to optimize the flood control operating rules fig 2 the stages can be distinguished by the discriminant indicators which can represent the magnitude of floods the pre release model includes the feasibility analysis of forecast information and the selection of the discriminant indicators for pre release the multi objective optimization model with 3 objectives i e maximizing the flood resilience of the downstream system r obj minimizing the maximum water level of the reservoir z obj and the peak flow of the downstream protection point q obj is established to generate the pareto optimal solutions by the designed flood hydrographs finally the fuzzy optimum selecting model considering the forecast uncertainty and the preferences of decision makers is established to identify the satisfied operating rule in the pareto optimal solution set 2 1 the identification of forecast error distribution forecast error distribution identification is the premise of forecast utilization currently many probability distribution functions have been applied to describe the forecast error distribution such as p iii type distribution chen et al 2018 normal distribution function zhang et al 2014 and the maximum entropy model diao et al 2007 the maximum entropy model is applied in this study since it can identify the error distribution without any subjective assumptions about unknown information jaynes 1957 it has been widely used and achieves good results cabrera and lee 2020 diao et al 2007 after obtaining the forecast error distribution the following information can be obtained forecast error distribution the forecast error at the maximum possibility δ0 as well as the standard error interval δmin δmax in which the probability of forecast error is 99 99 here δmin δmax are defined as the minimum forecast error and maximum forecast error respectively 2 2 the pre release model the pre release model is to enlarge release to increase the flood control storage capacity at the early stage when there will be a flood in the future generally the discriminant indicators are the forecast cumulative net rainfall arsenault et al 2016 chou and wu 2013 and the forecast streamflow che and mays 2017 faber and stedinger 2001 zhao et al 2012 in the case study the reservoir forecast inflow is set as the discriminant indicator to distinguish these two stages as shown in fig 2 when the reservoir forecast inflow exceeds value qdown but does not exceed value qup at the early stage of floods the reservoir begins to pre release to enlarge the flood control storage capacity when the reservoir inflow exceeds value qup the reservoir begins to utilize the flood control storage to retain and control flood the larger the pre release volume the greater the flood control capacity and higher flood control benefits but when the forecast value is larger than the observed value or even no flood happens due to the forecast uncertainty the risk of the conservation benefits will increase a larger pre release might bring a higher risk of conservation therefore the pre release is to balance the flood control benefits and conservation risk in the paper the design basis of the pre release model using the forecast information at the early stage of floods is the pre release volume of the reservoir can guarantee that the future inflow volume can make the reservoir water level raise back to the designed flwl thus the pre release stage can be divided into two steps one step is the pre release step from t to t 1 the other step is the potential re store step from t 1 to t t 1 the water balance in the pre release step is as follows 1 v t 1 v t q in t q out t δ t if no flood will occur in the future we will restore water to rise the reservoir water level back to the designed flwl while ensuring the minimum release of the reservoir so that the water balance in the potential re store step is listed as follows 2 v flwl v t 1 k 1 t 1 q in t k k 1 t 1 q min t k δ t 3 w t k 0 t 1 q in t k combined eqs 1 2 and 3 then the pre release q out t at time t can be obtained 4 q out t f z t f z flwl 1 δ t w t k 1 t 1 q min t k 5 v t f z t where f is the water level storage capacity conversion function z t and v t are the reservoir water level and reservoir storage capacity at time t respectively z flwl and v flwl represent the designed flood limited water level flwl and the corresponding storage capacity v flwl f z flwl q in t is the forecast inflow at time t q in t k is the k day ahead forecasting flow at time t k 0 1 2 t t is the forecast lead time w t is the total forecasting inflow volume throughout the lead time at time t qmin t is the minimum water demand for downstream at time t δt is the time unit 2 3 the multi objective optimization model for flood control operation 2 3 1 objectives the objectives of the multi objective optimization model are the minimum of the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the reservoir maximum water level as well as the maximum of the flood resilience for the downstream system elaborated as follows 1 the minimum of the maximum reservoir water level 6 z o b j m i n 1 d d d z max d where d represents the number of flood hydrographs z max d represents the maximum water level of the reservoir during the dth flood hydrograph 2 the minimum of the peak flow at the downstream protection point 7 q o b j m i n 1 d d d q max d where q max d is the peak flow of the downstream protection point during the dth flood hydrograph 3 the maximum flood resilience for the downstream system 8 r o b j m a x 1 d n d r d where r d represents the flood resilience of the downstream system during the dth flood hydrograph the resilience of the downstream system measures the ability of the downstream system to resist flood absorb flood adapt to flood and recover to the original state after floods the quantification of resilience includes the attribute based and system performance based indexes the selection of the indicators and the weights of the indicators in the attribute based methods are subjective so that the application of the attribute based methods is limited karamouz and zahmatkesh 2017 li et al 2019 the performance based index is based on the system performance function bruneau et al 2003 which is simple to quantify and has been widely used in the urban flood system lee and kim 2017 mugume et al 2015 therefore we use the system performance function to quantify the flood resilience in the flood forecast control operation the system performance ps t at time t is described as follows 9 ps t 1 q t q min q max q t q max q min q min q t q max 0 q t q max where q min is the minimum streamflow that the system is destructed and the system is safe when streamflow is below q min q max is the streamflow that the system is completely destructed when the downstream flow is larger than q max the flood resilience r of the system can be obtained by integrating the system performance function curve ps t which can be expressed as 10 r 1 t n 0 t n p s t d t 2 3 2 decision variables and optimization method the discriminant indicators and the corresponding release in the flood forecast control rule are decision variables e g the limq 1 limq 2 limq 3 and xk k 0 1 6 are the decision variables of the study in table 1 section 3 3 the flood forecast control rules are optimized through the non dominated genetic algorithm nsga ii which has fast convergence speed and low computational complexity 2 4 fuzzy optimum selecting model the fuzzy optimum selecting model is built as follows first the forecast error at the maximum probability δ0 is introduced to optimize the operating rules by nsga ii second the feasible rules are identified from the pareto optimal front considering the uncertainty of the forecast information the pareto optimal solutions are used to simulate the designed hydrographs with maximum and minimum forecast errors of δmin and δmax and the solutions the number is denoted by m that satisfy the safety requirement of upstream and downstream flood safety have remained third the design flood hydrographs have been operated by m solutions under different forecast errors and these forecast errors are discretized equally within the forecast error range then the three objectives including the maximum water level k 1 the peak flow at the downstream protection point k 2 and the resilience for the downstream system k 3 of the m solutions under different discrete forecast errors can be calculated it is difficult to directly compare solutions of multi objective problems therefore we use the fuzzy optimum selecting model more details see shouyu and yu 2006 to evaluate the relative superiority degree of each solution for different the decision makers preferences i e the weights of the objectives so as to facilitate the comparison of solutions generally the larger the relative superiority degree of the solution the better the performance of the solution for real time flood operation under the decision maker s preference the steps are listed as follows 1 divide the error interval δmin and δmax into n equal divisions δ 0 δ 1 δ n 1 δ n δ 0 δ min δ n δ max and calculate the corresponding occurrence frequency p 0 p 1 p n 1 p n by the forecast error distribution 2 simulate the flood hydrographs

fuzzy optimization method to evaluate each solution with evaluation index matrix for the objectives k 3 the higher the better the relative membership degree equation is 11 r i j k o i j k min o j k

is used to solve the model here we use λ 1 the solution with the maximum u value is the final chosen rule 3 case study 3 1 the location and the task of the study reservoir nierji reservoir nr with a drainage area of 66 382 km2 is located in the up reaches of the nen river it spans inner mongolia and heilongjiang provinces northern china as shown in fig 3 the nierji water conservancy project as the most important engineering of nen river and even the songhua river basin flood control engineering system undertakes the flood control task of the mainstream of nen river together with the embankment system the primary protection downstream city is qiqihaer city there are mainly two tributaries named namoer river and nuoming river between nr and qiqihaer city that determines the interval inflow the total reservoir capacity of nr is 86 1 109 m3 with the flood control storage capacity of 23 7 109 m3 and the utilizable capacity of 59 6 109 m3 the normal water storage level the maximum water storage level the flood limited water level flwl and the dead water level are 216 00 m 218 15 m 213 37 m and 195 00 m respectively in terms of flood prevention and mitigation it has improved the flood protection level of qiqihaer city from once in 50 years to 100 years and increased the flood protection level of the interval region between qiqihaer city and nierji reservoir from once in 20 years to 50 years muskingum method is used to address the hydraulic connections between the upstream reservoir nierji reservoir the interval tributaries nuoming river and nomoer river and the downstream protection point qiqihaer city in the study 3 2 the identification of the forecast error distribution the accuracy of the 4 day ahead inflow forecast has been approved high enough to guide the flood control operation wei et al 2018 especially the relative error of the 4 day forecast flood volume is within 20 when the initial forecast flow is above 2000 m3 s therefore we use the 4 day forecast flood volume to guide pre release the probability distribution of relative error of the 4 day forecast flood volume identified by the maximum entropy model section 2 1 is shown in fig 4 the forecast error at the maximum probability is 1 3 and the probability of the error occurring in the forecast error interval 22 19 is 99 99 3 3 the release model of nierji reservoir the structure of the flood control operating rule is designed in table 1 the time interval is 1 day qin is the inflow of the reservoir qsum is the 1 day ahead forecast value at the downstream and can be predicted by the outflow of nierji reservoir the observed flow at dedu station in namoer river and guchengzi station in ruoming river the prediction accuracy is high and therefore assumed to be deterministic ding et al 2015 qdown is set to 2000 m3 s the reason is that the discriminant indicator of flood occurrence at the early stage of a flood is that the total flow of the three stations i e nierji reservoir dedu station and guchengzi station is above 3000 m3 s according to the proportion of the observed flow of nierji reservoir in the historic flood hydrographs we set that when the flow of nierji reservoir exceeds 2000 m3 s as the discriminant indicator of flood occurrence at the early stage of floods moreover the forecast accuracy with a 4 day forecast flood volume of inflow is high when qin is above 2000 m3 s as shown in fig 4 fds represents the period that inflow is greater than outflow frs represents the period that outflow is greater than inflow q out represents the pre release which can be calculated by equations 1 3 min qout x 0 means that the smaller of qout and x 0 is the final value limq 1 limq 2 limq 3 are the 20 year 50 year and 100 year flood discharge value of qsum and together with xk k 0 1 6 are decision variables which are determined by solving the optimization model with the 6 design flood hydrographs the 50 year and 100 year design floods of three typical floods 1969 1988 and 1998 6 table 1 shows that when inflow is small and smaller than limq 1 if the observed flow of nierji reservoir qin is above qdown i e 2000 m3 s the reservoir begins to pre release to enlarge the flood control storage capacity with the 4 day forecast flood volume when qsum exceeds value limq 1 the reservoir begins to utilize the flood control storage to retain and control flood 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal operating rules by the proposed framework 4 1 1 the pareto optimal solutions in the study the parameters of the nsga ii algorithm including the population size the number of iterations the probability of crossover the probability of mutation the distribution index for crossover and the distribution index for mutation are respectively set to 1 000 1 000 000 0 9 0 1 20 and 20 for comparison the optimal solutions for a scenario that does not consider pre release i e release equals inflow when q sum is below limq 1 is shown in fig 5 a as can be seen 1 the pareto optimal solutions of considering and not considering pre release scenario both locate above the redpoint denoted as the conventional rule cs which means that the framework provides superior rules to the conventional rule 2 the variation range of pareto optimal solutions considering pre releasing is wider than that of not considering pre releasing this means that considering pre releasing in the flood operation can decrease upstream risk without increasing downstream risk and flood resilience the pareto optimal solutions by the three objective optimization model considering pre releasing with the forecast error at the maximum probability are shown in fig 5 b as can be seen a decrease in the maximum reservoir water level is accompanied by an increase in the peak flow at the downstream protection point when the maximum reservoir water level approaches i e similar color the peak flow at the downstream protection point will increase with the increase of the flood resilience the results demonstrate that the three objectives of the optimization are not fully coordinated that is it is necessary to consider flood resilience as the objective in the determination of flood forecast control rules 4 1 2 the optimal rules considering forecast uncertainty and preferences the pareto optimal solutions are then filtrated by forecast uncertainty as introduced in section 2 4 if the solutions can satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream under error 22 δ m i n and 19 δ m a x they can satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream under all errors in the interval 22 19 the pareto optimal solutions considering pre releasing 10 000 rules are used to simulate the design flood hydrographs with relative forecast error of 22 and 19 and only 1661 feasible rules satisfy the safety of upstream and downstream flood control then using 0 1 as the discrete intervals the standard forecast error interval is discretized into 411 forecast errors 22 21 9 1 2 1 3 1 4 18 9 19 the z obj q obj and r obj under 411 forecast errors are obtained by 1661 rules there are 3 411 evaluation indexes for each feasible rule four different preference cases as listed in table 2 are set to select the satisfied rule case 1 does not consider flood resilience and assumes that the importance of the risk of downstream and upstream are the same the importance of the three objectives is the same in case 2 the decision makers pay more attention to upstream or reservoir risk in case 3 the decision makers pay more attention to downstream risk in case 4 the binary contrast method is adopted to quantify the weights by the preferences diao and wang 2010 section 2 4 to prove and qualify the superiority of the optimization considering resilience without pre release we can find a rule named rule cb in which the maximum water level is the same as rule cs 217 53 m but the peak flow at the downstream protection point 10 190 m3 s and the flood resilience 86 87 are better than rule cs 10 340 m3 s 86 18 from the optimal solution without no pre release table 3 it indicates that the optimization considering flood resilience and no pre release can provide rules that can improve the flood resilience of the downstream system and decrease the risk of downstream without increasing the risk of upstream secondly to prove and qualify the superiority of the optimization considering resilience and pre release we find a rule name rule cfb the flood resilience 88 48 the risk of downstream 9940 m3 s and the risk of upstream 217 52 m of which are better than rule cb from the pareto optimal solutions with pre release it further indicates that the proposed framework with pre release can provide rules that can ensure the higher safety of the reservoir and the downstream with a higher downstream flood resilience in addition the recommended operating rules obtained by the fuzzy optimum selecting model under each preference case and three different forecast error values are listed in table 3 more details about the optimized values of decision variables have been shown in table s1 in supplementary the results show that the recommended operating rules under extreme error 22 and 19 can also satisfy the safety of downstream and upstream to show more details the operation results of the 50 year design flood for the 1988 typical flood are shown in fig 6 it shows that the recommended operating rules by the proposed framework release more water at the early stage of the flood box 1 in fig 6 a which can increase the flood storage capacity rules z q and qzr mainly release the flood water more evenly and increase the reservoir flood detention time to mitigate the overall damage of the downstream system during flooding box 2 in fig 6 b this leads them to have better performance than rule qz in downstream risk and resilience compared with rules without considering resilience i e rules qz we can know that the duration of the peak flow at the downstream protection point by rules considering resilience i e rule q rule z and rule cfb is shorter fig 6 b and this leads to a shorter duration of flood damage fig 6 c the results further prove the advantages of considering resilience 4 2 analysis on the reasonability of the way to consider the forecast uncertainty to further verify the superiority of the way to consider the forecast error distribution in the proposed framework the traditional framework is adopted as comparison the traditional framework also with pre releasing model optimizes the rules under the maximum and minimum forecast error without considering the forecast error distribution then uses the fuzzy optimum selecting model considering the preferences of decision makers to determine the recommended operating rules including rule qzr qz q and z the rules with the highest relative superiority degree under different preferences of decision makers table 3 are determined as listed in table 4 the relative superiority degree of the rules for the real time flood calculated with fuzzy optimum selecting method details are listed in text s1 in supplementary is adopted for quantitively evaluation finally the recommended rules by the proposed and traditional framework respectively are used to simulate the operation of 1969 flood and 2013 flood the two largest floods of the study as can be seen the relative superiority degrees of the recommended rules i e qzr qz q and z from the proposed framework are better than that of the traditional framework this proves that the rules identified from the proposed framework are more suitable for real time operation in addition it shows that for the proposed and traditional framework the value of z obj using of rule z is smaller than that of other rules rules qzr qz and q and the value of q obj of rule q is smaller than that of other rules rules qzr qz and z this means that the decision maker s preferences can be considered by the fuzzy optimum selecting model 4 3 real time flood operation by the recommended rules from the proposed framework to further compare the operating performance of the different recommended rules selected by the proposed framework the real time flood operation results for 1969 flood and 2013 flood have been shown in figs 7 and 8 unlike rule cb and cs all recommended rules rule cfb rule q rule z rule qzr and rule qz are generated by the proposed framework that uses forecast information the forecast information can be obtained by the dbm model for more details see wei et al 2018 in real time flood operation unlike rules q z qzr and qz rule cfb is derived by rule cs that we think it fellows the preferences of decision maker who make rule cs compared with rule cb and cs the water levels of rules cfb in figs 7 and 8 is lowered by pre release at the early stage and are relatively late to return to the original flwl in the flood regulating stage so that there is more flood capability to release the flood slowly to make the downstream without damage or small damage to increase the resilience the pre release process of rule z rule q rule qz and rule qzr is similar at the early stage of 1969 flood fig 7 a and 2013 flood fig 8 a the major difference between these rules is the flood retention time and release values at the flood regulating stage rule z operates with the largest release and the shortest retention time resulting in the lowest value of the maximum water level the reason is that rule z has a higher preference in the upstream risk i e the weight of upstream risk is 0 555 than other recommended rules rules qzr qz and q table 3 rule q retains more flood water at the beginning of the flood regulation stage to decrease the flow of downstream because it has a higher preference in the downstream risk to explore the effects of forecast uncertainty on flood operation the forecasts from the dbm model wei et al 2018 and the forecast with perfect forecasts with a relative error of 22 and 19 are utilized for comparison with the operation rule of cfb as shown in figs 9 and 10 regardless of whether there is a forecast error or not the flood resilience of rule cfb and rule cb is higher than that of cs this phenomenon is mainly due to the flood damage duration being short this means flood resilience is effective as an objective to describe the damage process moreover since the overall forecasting values of dbm are less than the observed value the operation process based on the dbm model lies between the operation process based on a relative error of 22 and perfect forecasts 0 when the forecast value is larger than the observed value i e the relative error of 19 implying a larger flood the reservoir will release more water at the early stage of the flood shown in fig 8 that the water level is low and the release is high therefore the reservoir maximum water level and the peak flow at the downstream protection point are low on the contrary when the forecast value is smaller than the observed value i e the relative error of 22 the reservoir will pre release relatively smaller water at the early stage so that the flood control storage capacity has a small increase this leads to the increase of the reservoir s maximum water level and the peak flow at the downstream protection point by the flood operation process we can know that the water level process of the reservoir and the flow at the downstream protection point are acceptable under the maximum and minimum forecast error in the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrograph which proves the safety of rule cfb 5 conclusion the aim of this paper is to develop a framework to determine the optimal operating rules for flood control considering pre release based on uncertain forecasts the framework consists of three models a pre release model a multi objective optimization model and a fuzzy optimum selecting model the pre release model has been developed to enlarge the flood control storage capacity at the early of a flood with the forecast information the multi objective optimization model not only considers the traditional objectives i e the minimization of the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the reservoir maximum water level but also considers a new objective i e the maximization of the flood resilience the fuzzy optimum selecting model has been built to select the recommended rules based on the forecast uncertainty finally nierji reservoir in the northeast of china has been taken as the case study and the following conclusions are drawn 1 the results show that three objectives i e the flood resilience for the downstream system the peak flow at the downstream protection point and the maximum water level of the reservoir of the optimization are not fully coordinated this means that it is feasible to take flood resilience as the objective for the selection and optimization of flood forecast control rules the rules considering resilience can reduce the duration of flooding and help the downstream system to tolerate floods and reorganize itself to achieve the transition from flood resistance to flood adaptation in addition by the comparison of the pareto optimal solutions from the optimization considering pre release or not the utilization of pre release can improve benefits from both upstream and downstream 2 by analyzing the operation process of the typical design flood the recommended operating rule considering pre release by the proposed framework release water more evenly it can not only decrease downstream risk but also increase downstream resilience without increasing reservoir risk therefore the proposed pre release model provides a new way for reservoir s operation which enlarge release to increase the flood control storage capacity at the early stage 3 the proposed framework has been compared with the traditional framework that just uses the maximum and minimum forecast errors in the real time flood hydrograph 1969 flood and 2013 flood the relative superiority degree of the flood operation results by the recommended rules by the proposed framework is better than that by the traditional framework this proves that the way to consider the forecast error distribution of the proposed framework is more reasonable for real time operation 4 the process results of the real time operation of the 1969 and 2013 flood hydrographs indicate that the recommended rules can lower the water levels by pre release in the early stage so that there is more flood capability to release the flood slowly to make the downstream without damage or small damage to increase the resilience and the results show that the operation result under the maximum and minimum forecast errors is acceptable with the safety of downstream and reservoir and the flood resilience has been greatly improved this is further proving that the proposed framework considering pre release and resilience is a more reasonable and beneficial operation the case in this study is a single reservoir however the reservoirs are connected in the basin i e muti reservoir system the proposed framework for pre releasing can be expanded in the multiple reservoir system through the aggregation decomposition method however in the multi reservoir system the correlation of the forecast uncertainties the hydraulic connections and the compensation effects of the reservoir capacity should be addressed the application in the multi reservoir system should be conducted in the future credit authorship contribution statement guozhen wei

2678,accurately estimating the soil water characteristics curve swcc has become indispensable in successfully implementing unsaturated soil mechanics into engineering practice the objective of this paper is to present a pore scale model for the prediction of the hysteretic swcc of granular soils using basic properties like grain size distribution gsd and porosity the discrete element method dem is used to model the soil structure by generating a stable assembly of spherical particles to attain a predefined grain size distribution and porosity a network of pores and throats is extracted from this assembly using a medial axis based network extraction technique and adequate pore scale mechanisms are availed to simulate two phase flow along drying and wetting paths the current work is further expanded to model swcc under different void ratios in addition swccs exhibit stress dependent behavior and a numerical framework for modeling swccs under various stress conditions is proposed the effect of particle shapes used for generating dem samples on swcc is also investigated the modeled swcc compares well with measured curves obtained for a range of granular soils from the literature the model effectively estimates the hysteretic drying wetting response and can capture the variation in swcc with change in net stress and initial void ratio keywords soil water characteristic curve discrete element method unsaturated soils pore network modeling grain size distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the relationship between soil suction and its water content called the soil water characteristic curve swcc plays a pivotal role in understanding the behavior of unsaturated soils with more attention being paid to evaluating the response of unsaturated soils to different mechanical and hydraulic conditions swcc has become an essential input data important direct and indirect information and insights about hydro mechanical properties of unsaturated soils are obtained from swcc so it is imperative to correctly estimate swcc under various field conditions fredlund and rahardjo 1993 vanapalli et al 1996 it is well established that swcc is not unique and various factors affect its behavior many studies have shown that swcc is stress dependent and significantly affected by a change in stress state due to the alteration of soil density and pore structure roy and rajesh 2020 the variation in the void ratio of soil samples also has a sizable influence on the characteristics of swcc and samples generated under varied initial void ratios yield distinct swccs birle et al 2008 also swcc is hysteretic in nature i e it follows different paths during the drying and wetting processes the ink bottle effect and contact angle hysteresis are the two main mechanisms responsible for hysteresis in swcc fredlund and rahardjo 1993 likos and lu 2004 many other factors like pore geometry grain size distribution compaction state initial water content stress history soil mineralogy soil porosity and tortuosity surface tension contact angle between fluid and solid surface temperature and soil suction measurement methodologies also influence swcc gupta and larson 1979 malaya and sreedeep 2012 likos and jaafar 2013 the costly and time consuming nature of experimental techniques to determine swcc attracts a lot of indirect methods or the development of pedo transfer functions ptf these methods have been broadly categorized into three groups by fredlund et al 2002 i regression analysis to estimate the water content at different soil suctions ii estimation of soil parameters for an algebraic function describing the swcc iii physico empirical models for determining swcc from the grain size distribution gsd arya and paris 1981 proposed one of the most popular ptfs based on the similarity between swcc and gsd the model aims to generate a pore size distribution by segmenting the gsd of a given soil equal sized spheres represent the solid volume in a segment and its void volume is approximated as a capillary tube of uniform size yielding the associated air entry value aev when matrix suction reaches the aev of a segment it is assumed to drain abruptly to bridge the gap between the simplified description of soil microstructure and actual behavior an empirical coefficient α is introduced a constant value of α is used for all soil textures and entrapment of air and hysteresis are not considered in this model later arya et al 1999 investigated the effect of soil texture on α and found that α varies with the particle size thus three new formulations for α are presented in arya et al 1999 besides a constant value of α for a given textural class one formulation is based on the logistic growth equation and the other on the similarity principle however these models are highly sensitive to α there are other approaches where ptfs are calculated using correlations obtained through regression analysis such as those by gupta and larson 1979 fredlund et al 1997 aubertin et al 2003 and wang et al 2017 the reliability of the aforementioned regression methods depends on the amount of training data restricting their applicability also most empirical models do not account for the physics governing the two phase fluid flow phenomena and water retention mechanism limiting their performance the intricacy of soil pore structure is rarely incorporated as most methods represent soil as a bundle of capillary tubes arya and paris 1981 arya et al 1999 fredlund et al 1997 which is an oversimplified interpretation subsequently empirical formulations are made to retain a middle ground between the actual physical behavior of soil microstructure and an oversimplified description of pore size and geometry a more comprehensive understanding of soil behavior and soil water interaction can be provided by pore scale analysis jaafar and likos 2011 presented an indirect method to estimate swcc based on pore scale analysis by converting a gsd into equivalent polydisperse spheres which are arranged into two extreme packings i e relatively loose and dense packing to get limiting pore size distribution the void ratio of soil is then used to constrain predicted swcc however the pore structure of the soil is far more complex and irregular in shape and size it consists of large pore bodies and narrow constrictions connecting them hence a more realistic and reasonable conceptualization would be to model soil pore structure as a network of pores large voids accounting for most void volume and throats narrow interparticle spaces using the pore network models seminal work has been carried out by rajaram et al 1997 fischer and celia 1999 jivkov et al 2013 gharedaghloo et al 2018 rojas et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 to model unsaturated soil properties such as hydromechanical coupling and hydraulic properties rostami et al 2015 coupled percolation theory and pore network modeling to simulate the wetting branch of swcc and scanning curves they also investigated the effect of net stress on swcc using network modeling however the model uses the drying branch of swcc to calibrate the network of pores and throats which is assumed to represent soil pore structure though pore network modeling is a powerful tool to estimate the retention properties of soil but requires either the drying swcc to optimize the network or sophisticated microtomography imaging to extract the pore network another approach that can be used to construct a network of pore space is by extracting it from an artificially generated pack of spheres tong et al 2012 and yuan et al 2016 used the discrete element method dem to generate the packing of spheres to simulate drainage in glass bead packing mehlhorn et al 2008 and sweijen et al 2017 coupled discrete element and pore network modeling to simulate swcc in granular soils dem pnm coupling to study the two phase flow process has been carried out by sweijen et al 2016 nikooee et al 2017 and mahmoodlu et al 2018 the triangulation method delaunay tessellation is used to extract a pore network from an artificially generated pack of spheres this method subdivides the pore space into a set of tetrahedrons the center of four neighboring particles forming a tetrahedron defines a pore body and the throat corresponds to the facet shared between two adjacent tetrahedrons resulting in a zero length throat adequate characterization of the pore space requires the neighboring tetrahedra to be merged but the merging criterion at the 3d condition is arbitrary taylor et al 2015 further such a representation leads to a coordination number or lattice connectivity of four but a wide range of coordination numbers characterizes porous media like soils additionally the aforementioned pore network models represent pore network elements as spheres for pores and cylinders for throats this depiction of the pore space of granular soil has twofold issues firstly the irregularity in the geometry of the pore structure is ignored resulting in an overestimation of capillary pressure suh and yun 2018 studied the effect of irregularities in the actual geometry of the throat on the modeled drying swcc they have suggested that the capillary pressure of an irregular pore throat is approximately 0 8 times the capillary pressure of an equivalent cylindrical pore throat for uniformly graded sands secondly the phenomena of corner flow and water retained in corners and crevices cannot be modeled for circular cross sections a pore is assumed to be in a drained state i e the degree of saturation is 0 or in a saturated state i e the degree of saturation is 1 thus impeding them from being partially saturated this simplification results in the overestimation of residual saturation sweijen et al 2017 this work focuses on suggesting an alternative approach to overcome these shortcomings the aims of this paper are as follows 1 in the present study a numerical framework is presented to simulate drying and wetting swcc the discrete element method is used to replicate a soil sample with a pre set grain size distribution and porosity the network extraction algorithm developed by raeini et al 2017 is used to overcome the limitations of the regular triangulation method and obtain a more representative distribution of coordination numbers additionally angular pore throat cross sections are generated by incorporating the corners within the pore space which is crucial for modeling corner flow and estimating capillary pressure accurately the drying and wetting branches of swcc are then modeled by incorporating pore scale mechanisms like piston like advance and wetting layers in the drying process and piston like advance pore body filling mechanisms and snap off in the wetting process 2 a framework is presented to simulate swccs under different stress conditions and initial void ratios 3 a study is conducted on the effect of different particle shapes used to replicate the geometry of granular soils on swcc the content of the study is arranged as follows in the numerical model section dem and network extraction methodology are elaborated followed by a detailed discussion of pores scale mechanisms to simulate hysteretic swcc finally the results based on the modeled swccs are analyzed and discussed 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical modeling of soil void structure the numerical modeling of soil void structure begins with generating a numerical packing representative of granular soil followed by extracting the pore network generating a numerical packing of granular structures is one of the most crucial steps in two phase flow simulations at pore scale usually a sample of a non cohesive granular structure is modeled as random packings of spherical particles produced via dynamic or geometrical methods in the geometrical method each sphere is introduced one at a time and it falls or rolls until it occupies one of the available spots without overlapping roozbahani et al 2013 in dynamic packing simulations the discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 is used to model the response of granular materials by considering the individual particles and their interactions dem can produce any desired randomly packed structure in a predefined density range many open source dem software packages are available šmilauer et al 2010 in the present study p f c 3 d itasca 2014 is used to generate an assembly of spheres packed to attain a predefined grain size distribution and porosity p f c 3 d uses the discrete element method to model the interaction of spherical particles that are assumed to be rigid to simulate such a system s mechanical behavior a force balance is written for each particle to calculate their motion due to contact and body forces and force displacement law to update contact forces to account for the normal and tangential displacements a physically based hertz mindlin model is used normal contact force f n between two particles is related to normal displacement u n by normal contact stiffness k n 1 f n k n u n 2 k n 2 g 2 r 3 1 ν u n where g and ν are the arithmetic averages of the shear moduli and the poisson ratios of the two spheres r is the harmonic mean of the radius of two spheres in contact and u n is the sphere overlap tangential contact force f t between two particles is related to tangential shear displacement u t by contact shear stiffness k s 3 f t k s u t 4 k s 2 3 g 1 ν r 1 3 2 ν f n 1 3 where f n is the magnitude of the normal contact force at contact point between two neighboring particles along with normal and shear displacements sliding also occurs when the tangential force exceeds maximum allowable shear contact force given by mohr coulomb criteria for static friction 5 f max s f n tan ϕ where ϕ is the angle of internal friction the particle packing is created within a cubic domain fig 1 the size of which depends on the grain size distribution and target porosity and is in the order of 1 mm 3 to 8 cm 3 for various granular soils used in this study for validation table 2 the number of spherical particles used to generate the packing depends on the gsd and a minimum of 4000 particles are used as shown in fig 6 however for the assemblies subjected to compression to incorporate the effect of net stress a larger number of particles are used to create an assembly with a minimum of 10 000 particles particle overlap and huge contact forces are anticipated while creating a representative assembly of spheres thus to reach the state of equilibrium the program is allowed to run till contact forces are within the specified tolerance limit the dem model parameters are given in table 1 once a representative assembly of spheres is generated the next step is to obtain a topologically equivalent network of pores and throats fig 2 in this work a network extraction algorithm by raeini et al 2017 is used to extract the network from the assembly created it is based on medial axis transformation this network extraction algorithm needs a 3d binary image of a 3d dem sample obtained by assigning the voxels representing soil grains a value of one and the voxels representing void space are assigned a value of zero the 3d binarized image has 1000 1000 1000 voxels and voxel size ranges from 1 µm to 20 µm for different reference materials used fig 1 shows a 3d dem sample representing a granular medium and its corresponding binarized image of a cross section the pore space is discretized into pores and throats with a constant cross sectional shape inscribing the spherical pore or cylindrical throat to account for the irregular geometry the network extraction algorithm provides parameters such as radius shape factor volume and length of individual network elements the cross sectional shape of an element depends on its shape factor as depicted in fig 3 shape factor is defined as a ratio of the cross sectional area of an element to its perimeter squared triangles have shape factors ranging from 0 to 3 36 for slit shaped triangles to equilateral triangles for a shape factor greater than 0 079 a circular cross section is assumed and if the shape factor is greater than 3 36 a square cross section is considered fig 2 d and e show the shape factor distribution for throats and pores for a reference material and most of the cross sections are triangular during drainage when air invades the pore space of a porous medium some water is retained in corners and crevices called the wetting layer lenormand et al 1983 in most network models pores are modeled as spheres and throats as cylinders and the capillary tube models take a cross section of capillary tubes to be circular circular cross sections cannot retain wetting layers resulting in binary values for saturation thus not accounting for partially saturated states contrary to this wetting layers that reside in corners can be accounted for within the network models only by angular pores triangular or square cross section thus the network model used in this study can incorporate wetting layers in the corners of pore space of granular soils 2 2 modeling drying swcc displacement of water by air in the soil is a drainage process since the soil is a water wet system for modeling drainage entry or threshold capillary pressure at which invasion of a water saturated element occurs is required here it is determined from øren et al 1998 generalization of the mayer and stowe princen method mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1969 based on the change in free energy for an infinitesimal movement of the fluids initially the network is completely saturated with water and it is assumed to be connected to the air reservoir on the inlet side and the water reservoir on the outlet with the water pressure kept constant the capillary pressure of the network is gradually increased by increasing the air pressure a search algorithm is run at every stage of this process to find the elements pores and throats that can drain necessary conditions that such an element has to satisfy are 1 water in an element should form a connected phase with the outlet else it will be considered trapped and can no longer be displaced 2 the capillary pressure of the system should be greater than or equal to the threshold capillary pressure of an element 3 at least one of the neighboring elements should be drained the threshold capillary pressure p c of an element is given by the following equation øren et al 1998 6 p c γ 1 2 π g f d cos θ r r where γ is the surface tension of the air water interface θ r is the receding drying contact angle and g and r are the shape factor and the inscribed radius of an element respectively f d is a dimensionless correction factor that depends on contact angle and shape factor and is equal to 1 for circular cross sectional elements 7 f d 1 1 4 g c cos 2 θ r 1 2 π g c is a function of corner half angles 8 c i 1 n cos θ r cos θ r β i sin β i π 2 θ r β i where n is the number of corners containing water in form of wetting layer which satisfy the condition valvatne and blunt 2004 9 β i θ r π 2 β i is the corner half angle fig 3 for triangular elements the corner half angles are computed using the approach suggested by patzek 2001 the three corner half angles β 1 β 2 and β 3 of triangular elements are assumed to follow the convention β 1 β 2 β 3 firstly β 2 is randomly selected between β 2 max and β 2 min i e β 2 min β 2 β 2 max 10 β 2 max arctan 2 3 cos arccos 12 3 g 3 11 β 2 min arctan 2 3 cos arccos 12 3 g 3 4 π 3 then β 1 and β 3 are obtained 12 β 1 1 2 β 2 1 2 arcsin tan β 2 4 g tan β 2 4 g sin β 2 13 β 3 π 2 β 1 β 2 after each capillary pressure increment when some pores and throats get drained the network saturation is updated for circular elements water saturation of drained pores is zero while for angular elements water saturation of an element s w with volume v is given by 14 s w a w a where a is the area of an element and a w is the area of water present as arc menisci in the corners of a pore body or throat and is given by øren et al 1998 15 a w r 2 i 1 n cos θ r cos θ r β i sin β i π 2 θ r β i 16 r γ p c u r p c u r is the current capillary pressure of the network the saturation of the entire network is computed by 17 s w n e t i s w i v i i v i 2 3 modeling wetting swcc the displacement of air by water in soils is an imbibition process the nature of displacement in imbibition is controlled by mechanisms like piston like advance pore body filling and snap off as shown in fig 4 lenormand et al 1983 blunt and scher 1995 øren et al 1998 patzek 2001 valvatne and blunt 2004 piston like filling in the throat is exactly the opposite of drainage however contact angle hysteresis causes three phase contact line to move when advancing wetting contact angle θ a is reached resulting in threshold capillary pressure being different from drainage the threshold capillary pressure for the piston like advance is given by 18 p c γ r a where r a is the radius of curvature of arc meniscus and patzek 2001 is followed to calculate r a for advancing or wetting contact angle values the work of kumar and malik 1990 is considered here pore filling is governed by a critical radius of curvature which depends on the number of adjacent drained throats these are called i n mechanisms lenormand et al 1983 where n is the number of drained throats connected to a pore to calculate threshold capillary pressure for an i n mechanism researchers have proposed empirical expressions blunt 1998 model is availed to compute the threshold capillary pressure for an i n mechanism according to which 19 p c i n 2 γ cos θ a r p γ i 1 n b i x i where r p is the radius of the pore to be filled x i is a random number between 0 and 1 and b i is the coefficient approximately equal to the inverse of the mean of throat radii connected to pore r p the pore filling is favored for smaller values of n i e most of the throats connected to a pore are filled with water snap off is an event that occurs in drained elements with water layers in corners these layers enlarge in response to an increase in water pressure and when they meet the entire element gets filled with water such a process results in the trapping of air piston type advance is more favored if it is topologically possible than snap off snap off occurs at a positive capillary pressure so the geometric condition that an element needs to satisfy for snap off to happen is 20 θ a π 2 β 1 the threshold capillary pressure for snap off when water meniscus in two or more corners of an element starts to swell is valvatne and blunt 2004 21 p c γ r cos θ a 2 sin θ a cot β 1 cot β 2 if only the water meniscus in the oblique most corner of an element swells then the expression for the threshold capillary pressure is valvatne and blunt 2004 22 p c γ r cos θ a cot β 1 sin θ a cos θ h 3 cot β 3 sin θ h 3 cot β 1 cot β 2 23 θ h 3 min arccos r min r a cos θ r β 3 β 3 θ a where θ h 3 is called hinging contact angle and r min is the ratio of γ and the maximum capillary pressure attained at the end of drainage all three mechanisms are incorporated in the present study the air water configuration at the end of the drainage is the initial state of the pore network for simulating wetting swcc the inlet of the network is now connected to the water reservoir and the outlet to the air reservoir the maximum capillary pressure attained at the end of drainage is gradually reduced by increasing the water pressure so the highest capillary pressure processes are favored the wetting process starts with water invading the inlet throats by piston type displacement followed by i n mechanisms for pore filling and snap off thus in each water pressure increment step elements that can be invaded by water through the above discussed mechanisms are determined and the saturation of the network is updated also in each step the algorithm checks air connectivity to the outlet reservoir to account for trapping 2 4 modeling the effect of initial void ratio and net stress there is an alteration in the soil pore structure for granular soil samples with the same grain size distribution but different void ratios as a result the pore network replicating soil pore structure will also be impacted to model the pore networks of granular soils with the same grain size distribution but the different void ratios in p f c 3 d after importing the grain size distribution of a soil the target porosity values are changed corresponding to the void ratio at which swcc is required thus the assembly of spheres illustrating the soil state at various void ratios is obtained and a pore network is extracted from these assemblies to simulate swcc similarly to model swcc at different net stress assembly of spheres depicting the soil structure corresponding to that net stress is required it is achieved by simulating 1d compression oedometric compression in p f c 3 d first an assembly of spheres with predefined gsd and porosity values is acquired without any external loading top and bottom walls are then moved with a predefined velocity to compress the specimen axially and to ensure 1d compression lateral wall movement is restricted hence representative packing of spheres at different net stress values is obtained refer to table 1 for dem model parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 reference materials and fluid flow parameters in order to evaluate and assess the proposed model ten different granular soils are selected from the literature donald 1957 schroth et al 1996 fredlund et al 1997 lins and schanz 2005 likos and jaafar 2013 fig 5 shows the grain size distribution of the materials chosen and their main properties are listed in table 2 three of the selected granular soils are ottawa sands with the same porosity but different grain size distribution they are used to investigate whether the model can predict the effect of change in grain size distribution the other test materials have porosities ranging from 32 to 47 with a varying grain size distribution to study the model s suitability on different granular soils the numerical framework to predict the effect of net stress and initial void ratio and the precision in simulating hysteresis effects is validated using experimental data from lins and schanz 2005 sensitivity analysis is performed on one test material in order to attain an optimal network independent of the number of particles swcc is obtained from packings with a different number of particles and the error mean absolute percentage error in saturation in each case is calculated fig 6 shows a considerable decrease in error with the increase in the number of spherical particles however no palpable change in error is observed with particles beyond 4000 for different grain size distributions and porosities analyzed in the current study the size of dem samples corresponding to 4000 particles is 15 20 times the mean particle diameter based on 3d dem simulations on polydisperse granular packings wiacek and molenda 2016 have also recommended a minimum representative element volume size of 15 times the mean particle diameter thus to generate dem assemblies to carry out the two phase flow simulations the packing of spherical particles with a minimum of 4000 particles is used to ensure the reproducibility of the swcc simulation for air water flow simulations the surface tension of water is set to 0 073 n m contact angle plays a significant role in the liquid distribution at the pore scale given that soil is a water wet system the drying contact angle θ r is generally assumed to be 0 lu and likos 2004 rostami et al 2015 during analysis using the current methodology it is observed that identical swccs are obtained for near zero values 0 to 10 of contact angles thus the present study also employs a value of 0 for the drying contact angle it is well established that the wetting contact angle θ a is greater than the drying contact angle kumar and malik 1990 found the wetting contact angles for different soils based on the capillary rise and horizontal infiltration testing and have reported a value of θ a 57 3 for soils with 11 fine content silt and clay to a value of θ a 84 8 for soils with 85 fine content laroussi and de backer 1979 also reported that the wetting contact angle is 20 to 30 greater than the drying contact angles in glass beads since the soil samples modeled in the current study are granular soils smaller values of wetting contact angles are employed a uniform random distribution of wetting angles from 20 to 40 is used in this work to predict wetting swcc 3 2 comparison with simplified pore network models this work refers to the pore network models containing spherical and cylindrical elements as simplified pore network models simplified pnm the pore network models extracted from 3d binary images of assembly of spheres used to represent granular soils are converted into simplified pnm by considering only the inscribed radii of elements i e the shape factor of all elements is assumed to be 0 079 circular cross section it results in a pore network of spheres and cylinders the two phase flow simulations are then carried out in the simplified pnm to obtain swccs of granular soils listed in table 2 the simplified expression for threshold capillary pressure of circular elements by substituting c 0 in eq 7 is 24 p c 2 γ cos θ r r the network saturation is updated using the eq 17 where s w is zero for drained elements and one for water saturated elements the modeled swcc from simplified pnm and the current methodology are compared in fig 7 simplified pnm overestimates capillary pressure and residual saturation and is in accord with the conclusions of sweijen et al 2017 and suh and yun 2018 the higher residual saturation values are obtained because of the trapping of water in an element or cluster of elements due to the fact that such elements are not in pressure connections with the outlet the capillary pressure in such elements will not change resulting in the trapping of water during drainage the wetting phase remains connected through the angular elements which can retain the wetting phase in their corners resulting in lower saturation values the modeled swccs with current and simplified pnm is fitted with the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 the model can be expressed as 25 s s r 1 s r 1 1 α ψ m n m where s r is the irreducible water saturation after drainage α kpa 1 is the inverse of air entry pressure and n and m parameters are related to soil pore size distribution and overall symmetry of the curve respectively the parameters are optimized by maximizing the r 2 value under the constraint m 1 1 n the values of fitting parameters α and s r are compared for all reference materials as depicted in fig 7 the air entry pressure which is inverse of parameter α and residual saturation obtained from simplified pnms are on the higher side when compared to the experimental values clearly by incorporating angular cross sections to account for irregularities in pores and throats and modeling wetting layers the modeled swccs show a significant resemblance with the experimental results 3 3 drying swcc fig 8 shows the predicted and measured swccs of granular soils listed in table 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean squared error rmse is calculated to quantify the goodness of fit and values are reported in table 3 26 r 2 1 s s m 2 s s 2 where s and s m are the measured and modeled saturation respectively 27 r m s e 1 n t i 1 n t s s m 2 where n t is the total number of measured saturation values r 2 value of 0 99 is obtained for most of the test materials with a minimum of 0 94 which indicates a good agreement between the measured and modeled swccs the measured and predicted swccs are fitted with the van genuchten function and the values of fitting parameters are tabulated in table 4 the air entry value one of the most important parameters associated with swcc is measured from the inverse of the α parameter for the measured and modeled curves fitting parameters α and n are in good agreement the difference in air entry pressure is below 8 with an average difference of 2 9 fig 9 shows the comparison of the proposed model with various other models namely arya and paris 1981 arya et al 1999 aubertin et al 2003 and wang et al 2017 a brief about them is given in the introduction section for arya and paris 1981 α 1 38 is used as suggested by the author and for arya et al 1999 the value of α used depends on the texture of the soil as per the u s department of agriculture the values are 1 285 1 459 1 375 1 150 and 1 160 for the sand sandy loam loam silt loam and clay textures respectively arya et al 1999 while arya and paris 1981 and arya et al 1999 models are highly sensitive to the empirical parameter α other models also do not provide a good prediction for all test materials the measured and modeled saturation using the proposed model for all the test materials is compared and the results are reported in fig 10 the predicted and the experimental values are in good agreement over the entire range of saturation however a few outliers show an absolute error of 0 15 in the predicted saturation 3 4 wetting swcc the wetting and drying swccs are not unique and follow different paths due to the time consuming nature of experimental procedures to assess wetting swccs only drying swccs are often acquired in the laboratory however many field problems like landslides due to precipitation the performance of hydraulic barriers etc require knowledge of wetting swcc experimental results of lins and schanz 2005 for two different soil samples of houston sand are used to validate the prediction of wetting swcc by the current model fig 11 shows the predicted and measured wetting swcc and the drying curves r 2 of 0 99 is obtained in both cases with rmse of 0 03 and 0 respectively which is evocative of the reasonable accuracy of the proposed approach and mechanism 3 5 influence of void ratio and net stress on swcc to study the efficiency of the model to capture the influence of change in void ratio on swcc a loose sample void ratio of 0 89 is compared with its dense configuration void ratio of 0 66 fig 12 compares the predicted values with the experimental values lins and schanz 2005 with the change in the initial state the characteristics of swcc change like the air entry value and the slope of the wetting and drying curves the loose sample drains faster due to large voids present in it resulting in a steeper slope of drying swcc in the loose sample on the other hand due to more percentage of smaller voids water imbibes faster in the dense soil resulting in a steeper slope of wetting swcc in the dense sample the proposed model is consistent with the experimental trend the network of pores and throats is extracted from the corresponding assembly of spheres at net stress of 10 kpa and 20 kpa to model swcc under different net stress the experimental and predicted values are shown in fig 13 indicate that the proposed method can simulate swccs under various stresses with reasonable accuracy the effect of net stress on swcc for the experimental results used for validation is not significant however the intent here is to only introduce this alternative approach to model swcc under different net stresses and it will be explored in further studies 3 6 effect of particle shape used for modeling granular soil structure on swcc spherical particles are generally used to model the geometry of granular soils the impact of various particle shapes that can be used to simulate the geometry of granular soils and their subsequent influence on swcc is analyzed and discussed in this section in order to investigate the effect of the shape of individual particles used to create a representative assembly three dem samples are generated following the same particle size distribution and packing density porosity the particle size distribution varies from 0 5 mm to 3 mm and the porosity of the samples is 0 65 apart from sphere shaped particles cubic and tetrahedron shaped individual particles are used to generate stable assemblies these complex geometries are modeled in p f c 3 d using clumps a clump is a cluster of spherical particles and the radii and placements of these particles determine the surface of the clump different complex shapes are approximated by using clumps that act like rigid bodies whose inertia parameters are calculated from its geometry or the outer surface defined by the distribution of spherical particles fig 14 shows the dem samples generated using cubic spherical and tetrahedron shaped particles with a magnified view of an individual clump after creating stable assemblies a pore network is extracted from them and swcc simulations are performed in each of the three pore networks however the present analysis does not consider the preferred alignment of individual particles while creating dem samples which may result in an anisotropic sample and consequently the water retention curve may change such analysis will be carried out in future studies the characteristics of the derived pore networks from dem samples modeled using various particle shapes are contrasted in table 5 and the simulated swccs are shown in fig 15 in terms of network attributes and swccs they are nearly identical for all three networks the creation of complex shaped individual particles is computationally expensive since the network properties and swccs show a close resemblance for various complex shapes used to model granular soils dem pnm coupling for granular soils using spherical particles can be successfully used for predicting water retention characteristics 4 conclusions a pore scale model to predict swcc of coarse grained materials is presented in this work the model is based on integrating dem and pore network modeling and requires only gsd and porosity as input parameters it is capable of predicting the main drying and wetting curves and can be further used to estimate swccs at different net stress and void ratios an essential micro mechanism of corner flow is incorporated in this model for a more accurate prediction of the drying curve of granular soils which most pore scale models have usually neglected to illustrate the proposed model s performance several reference materials are selected from literature with varying gsd and porosity values and measured and predicted drying swccs are compared the predicted values for all materials have an average r 2 value of 0 976 the average error in predicting air entry value is 2 9 while most of the ptfs are developed to predict the drying curve and the corresponding wetting curve is estimated indirectly using empirical techniques pham et al 2003 the current study also discusses the approach to model hysteresis mechanisms like piston type advance snap off and cooperative pore filling govern air displacement by water at the pore scale these mechanisms are included in the current model to predict the main wetting curve swcc is influenced by field conditions like compaction state and net stress the present work is made more extensive by extending it to simulate swcc under different initial void ratios and net stress dem assemblies are generated using different particle shapes to determine whether the latter affects swcc for the same gsd and porosity the pore network characteristics of the packing formed using complex particle morphologies are nearly the same as a result identical swccs are obtained from these assemblies thus instead of utilizing computationally expensive complicated shapes to describe the geometry of granular soils spherical particles effectively model the water retention properties of granular soils the significant advantage of the proposed framework is that by implementing relevant mechanisms at the pore scale it can be used not only to predict the retention behavior of granular soils but also for modeling unsaturated hydraulic conductivities explore reactive transport processes like the migration of pollutants adsorption biomass growth and various other flow and transport phenomena in unsaturated soils the present pore scale model can also be extended to fine grained soils where swcc

2678,accurately estimating the soil water characteristics curve swcc has become indispensable in successfully implementing unsaturated soil mechanics into engineering practice the objective of this paper is to present a pore scale model for the prediction of the hysteretic swcc of granular soils using basic properties like grain size distribution gsd and porosity the discrete element method dem is used to model the soil structure by generating a stable assembly of spherical particles to attain a predefined grain size distribution and porosity a network of pores and throats is extracted from this assembly using a medial axis based network extraction technique and adequate pore scale mechanisms are availed to simulate two phase flow along drying and wetting paths the current work is further expanded to model swcc under different void ratios in addition swccs exhibit stress dependent behavior and a numerical framework for modeling swccs under various stress conditions is proposed the effect of particle shapes used for generating dem samples on swcc is also investigated the modeled swcc compares well with measured curves obtained for a range of granular soils from the literature the model effectively estimates the hysteretic drying wetting response and can capture the variation in swcc with change in net stress and initial void ratio keywords soil water characteristic curve discrete element method unsaturated soils pore network modeling grain size distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the relationship between soil suction and its water content called the soil water characteristic curve swcc plays a pivotal role in understanding the behavior of unsaturated soils with more attention being paid to evaluating the response of unsaturated soils to different mechanical and hydraulic conditions swcc has become an essential input data important direct and indirect information and insights about hydro mechanical properties of unsaturated soils are obtained from swcc so it is imperative to correctly estimate swcc under various field conditions fredlund and rahardjo 1993 vanapalli et al 1996 it is well established that swcc is not unique and various factors affect its behavior many studies have shown that swcc is stress dependent and significantly affected by a change in stress state due to the alteration of soil density and pore structure roy and rajesh 2020 the variation in the void ratio of soil samples also has a sizable influence on the characteristics of swcc and samples generated under varied initial void ratios yield distinct swccs birle et al 2008 also swcc is hysteretic in nature i e it follows different paths during the drying and wetting processes the ink bottle effect and contact angle hysteresis are the two main mechanisms responsible for hysteresis in swcc fredlund and rahardjo 1993 likos and lu 2004 many other factors like pore geometry grain size distribution compaction state initial water content stress history soil mineralogy soil porosity and tortuosity surface tension contact angle between fluid and solid surface temperature and soil suction measurement methodologies also influence swcc gupta and larson 1979 malaya and sreedeep 2012 likos and jaafar 2013 the costly and time consuming nature of experimental techniques to determine swcc attracts a lot of indirect methods or the development of pedo transfer functions ptf these methods have been broadly categorized into three groups by fredlund et al 2002 i regression analysis to estimate the water content at different soil suctions ii estimation of soil parameters for an algebraic function describing the swcc iii physico empirical models for determining swcc from the grain size distribution gsd arya and paris 1981 proposed one of the most popular ptfs based on the similarity between swcc and gsd the model aims to generate a pore size distribution by segmenting the gsd of a given soil equal sized spheres represent the solid volume in a segment and its void volume is approximated as a capillary tube of uniform size yielding the associated air entry value aev when matrix suction reaches the aev of a segment it is assumed to drain abruptly to bridge the gap between the simplified description of soil microstructure and actual behavior an empirical coefficient α is introduced a constant value of α is used for all soil textures and entrapment of air and hysteresis are not considered in this model later arya et al 1999 investigated the effect of soil texture on α and found that α varies with the particle size thus three new formulations for α are presented in arya et al 1999 besides a constant value of α for a given textural class one formulation is based on the logistic growth equation and the other on the similarity principle however these models are highly sensitive to α there are other approaches where ptfs are calculated using correlations obtained through regression analysis such as those by gupta and larson 1979 fredlund et al 1997 aubertin et al 2003 and wang et al 2017 the reliability of the aforementioned regression methods depends on the amount of training data restricting their applicability also most empirical models do not account for the physics governing the two phase fluid flow phenomena and water retention mechanism limiting their performance the intricacy of soil pore structure is rarely incorporated as most methods represent soil as a bundle of capillary tubes arya and paris 1981 arya et al 1999 fredlund et al 1997 which is an oversimplified interpretation subsequently empirical formulations are made to retain a middle ground between the actual physical behavior of soil microstructure and an oversimplified description of pore size and geometry a more comprehensive understanding of soil behavior and soil water interaction can be provided by pore scale analysis jaafar and likos 2011 presented an indirect method to estimate swcc based on pore scale analysis by converting a gsd into equivalent polydisperse spheres which are arranged into two extreme packings i e relatively loose and dense packing to get limiting pore size distribution the void ratio of soil is then used to constrain predicted swcc however the pore structure of the soil is far more complex and irregular in shape and size it consists of large pore bodies and narrow constrictions connecting them hence a more realistic and reasonable conceptualization would be to model soil pore structure as a network of pores large voids accounting for most void volume and throats narrow interparticle spaces using the pore network models seminal work has been carried out by rajaram et al 1997 fischer and celia 1999 jivkov et al 2013 gharedaghloo et al 2018 rojas et al 2019 and zhao et al 2020 to model unsaturated soil properties such as hydromechanical coupling and hydraulic properties rostami et al 2015 coupled percolation theory and pore network modeling to simulate the wetting branch of swcc and scanning curves they also investigated the effect of net stress on swcc using network modeling however the model uses the drying branch of swcc to calibrate the network of pores and throats which is assumed to represent soil pore structure though pore network modeling is a powerful tool to estimate the retention properties of soil but requires either the drying swcc to optimize the network or sophisticated microtomography imaging to extract the pore network another approach that can be used to construct a network of pore space is by extracting it from an artificially generated pack of spheres tong et al 2012 and yuan et al 2016 used the discrete element method dem to generate the packing of spheres to simulate drainage in glass bead packing mehlhorn et al 2008 and sweijen et al 2017 coupled discrete element and pore network modeling to simulate swcc in granular soils dem pnm coupling to study the two phase flow process has been carried out by sweijen et al 2016 nikooee et al 2017 and mahmoodlu et al 2018 the triangulation method delaunay tessellation is used to extract a pore network from an artificially generated pack of spheres this method subdivides the pore space into a set of tetrahedrons the center of four neighboring particles forming a tetrahedron defines a pore body and the throat corresponds to the facet shared between two adjacent tetrahedrons resulting in a zero length throat adequate characterization of the pore space requires the neighboring tetrahedra to be merged but the merging criterion at the 3d condition is arbitrary taylor et al 2015 further such a representation leads to a coordination number or lattice connectivity of four but a wide range of coordination numbers characterizes porous media like soils additionally the aforementioned pore network models represent pore network elements as spheres for pores and cylinders for throats this depiction of the pore space of granular soil has twofold issues firstly the irregularity in the geometry of the pore structure is ignored resulting in an overestimation of capillary pressure suh and yun 2018 studied the effect of irregularities in the actual geometry of the throat on the modeled drying swcc they have suggested that the capillary pressure of an irregular pore throat is approximately 0 8 times the capillary pressure of an equivalent cylindrical pore throat for uniformly graded sands secondly the phenomena of corner flow and water retained in corners and crevices cannot be modeled for circular cross sections a pore is assumed to be in a drained state i e the degree of saturation is 0 or in a saturated state i e the degree of saturation is 1 thus impeding them from being partially saturated this simplification results in the overestimation of residual saturation sweijen et al 2017 this work focuses on suggesting an alternative approach to overcome these shortcomings the aims of this paper are as follows 1 in the present study a numerical framework is presented to simulate drying and wetting swcc the discrete element method is used to replicate a soil sample with a pre set grain size distribution and porosity the network extraction algorithm developed by raeini et al 2017 is used to overcome the limitations of the regular triangulation method and obtain a more representative distribution of coordination numbers additionally angular pore throat cross sections are generated by incorporating the corners within the pore space which is crucial for modeling corner flow and estimating capillary pressure accurately the drying and wetting branches of swcc are then modeled by incorporating pore scale mechanisms like piston like advance and wetting layers in the drying process and piston like advance pore body filling mechanisms and snap off in the wetting process 2 a framework is presented to simulate swccs under different stress conditions and initial void ratios 3 a study is conducted on the effect of different particle shapes used to replicate the geometry of granular soils on swcc the content of the study is arranged as follows in the numerical model section dem and network extraction methodology are elaborated followed by a detailed discussion of pores scale mechanisms to simulate hysteretic swcc finally the results based on the modeled swccs are analyzed and discussed 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical modeling of soil void structure the numerical modeling of soil void structure begins with generating a numerical packing representative of granular soil followed by extracting the pore network generating a numerical packing of granular structures is one of the most crucial steps in two phase flow simulations at pore scale usually a sample of a non cohesive granular structure is modeled as random packings of spherical particles produced via dynamic or geometrical methods in the geometrical method each sphere is introduced one at a time and it falls or rolls until it occupies one of the available spots without overlapping roozbahani et al 2013 in dynamic packing simulations the discrete element method cundall and strack 1979 is used to model the response of granular materials by considering the individual particles and their interactions dem can produce any desired randomly packed structure in a predefined density range many open source dem software packages are available šmilauer et al 2010 in the present study p f c 3 d itasca 2014 is used to generate an assembly of spheres packed to attain a predefined grain size distribution and porosity p f c 3 d uses the discrete element method to model the interaction of spherical particles that are assumed to be rigid to simulate such a system s mechanical behavior a force balance is written for each particle to calculate their motion due to contact and body forces and force displacement law to update contact forces to account for the normal and tangential displacements a physically based hertz mindlin model is used normal contact force f n between two particles is related to normal displacement u n by normal contact stiffness k n 1 f n k n u n 2 k n 2 g 2 r 3 1 ν u n where g and ν are the arithmetic averages of the shear moduli and the poisson ratios of the two spheres r is the harmonic mean of the radius of two spheres in contact and u n is the sphere overlap tangential contact force f t between two particles is related to tangential shear displacement u t by contact shear stiffness k s 3 f t k s u t 4 k s 2 3 g 1 ν r 1 3 2 ν f n 1 3 where f n is the magnitude of the normal contact force at contact point between two neighboring particles along with normal and shear displacements sliding also occurs when the tangential force exceeds maximum allowable shear contact force given by mohr coulomb criteria for static friction 5 f max s f n tan ϕ where ϕ is the angle of internal friction the particle packing is created within a cubic domain fig 1 the size of which depends on the grain size distribution and target porosity and is in the order of 1 mm 3 to 8 cm 3 for various granular soils used in this study for validation table 2 the number of spherical particles used to generate the packing depends on the gsd and a minimum of 4000 particles are used as shown in fig 6 however for the assemblies subjected to compression to incorporate the effect of net stress a larger number of particles are used to create an assembly with a minimum of 10 000 particles particle overlap and huge contact forces are anticipated while creating a representative assembly of spheres thus to reach the state of equilibrium the program is allowed to run till contact forces are within the specified tolerance limit the dem model parameters are given in table 1 once a representative assembly of spheres is generated the next step is to obtain a topologically equivalent network of pores and throats fig 2 in this work a network extraction algorithm by raeini et al 2017 is used to extract the network from the assembly created it is based on medial axis transformation this network extraction algorithm needs a 3d binary image of a 3d dem sample obtained by assigning the voxels representing soil grains a value of one and the voxels representing void space are assigned a value of zero the 3d binarized image has 1000 1000 1000 voxels and voxel size ranges from 1 µm to 20 µm for different reference materials used fig 1 shows a 3d dem sample representing a granular medium and its corresponding binarized image of a cross section the pore space is discretized into pores and throats with a constant cross sectional shape inscribing the spherical pore or cylindrical throat to account for the irregular geometry the network extraction algorithm provides parameters such as radius shape factor volume and length of individual network elements the cross sectional shape of an element depends on its shape factor as depicted in fig 3 shape factor is defined as a ratio of the cross sectional area of an element to its perimeter squared triangles have shape factors ranging from 0 to 3 36 for slit shaped triangles to equilateral triangles for a shape factor greater than 0 079 a circular cross section is assumed and if the shape factor is greater than 3 36 a square cross section is considered fig 2 d and e show the shape factor distribution for throats and pores for a reference material and most of the cross sections are triangular during drainage when air invades the pore space of a porous medium some water is retained in corners and crevices called the wetting layer lenormand et al 1983 in most network models pores are modeled as spheres and throats as cylinders and the capillary tube models take a cross section of capillary tubes to be circular circular cross sections cannot retain wetting layers resulting in binary values for saturation thus not accounting for partially saturated states contrary to this wetting layers that reside in corners can be accounted for within the network models only by angular pores triangular or square cross section thus the network model used in this study can incorporate wetting layers in the corners of pore space of granular soils 2 2 modeling drying swcc displacement of water by air in the soil is a drainage process since the soil is a water wet system for modeling drainage entry or threshold capillary pressure at which invasion of a water saturated element occurs is required here it is determined from øren et al 1998 generalization of the mayer and stowe princen method mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1969 based on the change in free energy for an infinitesimal movement of the fluids initially the network is completely saturated with water and it is assumed to be connected to the air reservoir on the inlet side and the water reservoir on the outlet with the water pressure kept constant the capillary pressure of the network is gradually increased by increasing the air pressure a search algorithm is run at every stage of this process to find the elements pores and throats that can drain necessary conditions that such an element has to satisfy are 1 water in an element should form a connected phase with the outlet else it will be considered trapped and can no longer be displaced 2 the capillary pressure of the system should be greater than or equal to the threshold capillary pressure of an element 3 at least one of the neighboring elements should be drained the threshold capillary pressure p c of an element is given by the following equation øren et al 1998 6 p c γ 1 2 π g f d cos θ r r where γ is the surface tension of the air water interface θ r is the receding drying contact angle and g and r are the shape factor and the inscribed radius of an element respectively f d is a dimensionless correction factor that depends on contact angle and shape factor and is equal to 1 for circular cross sectional elements 7 f d 1 1 4 g c cos 2 θ r 1 2 π g c is a function of corner half angles 8 c i 1 n cos θ r cos θ r β i sin β i π 2 θ r β i where n is the number of corners containing water in form of wetting layer which satisfy the condition valvatne and blunt 2004 9 β i θ r π 2 β i is the corner half angle fig 3 for triangular elements the corner half angles are computed using the approach suggested by patzek 2001 the three corner half angles β 1 β 2 and β 3 of triangular elements are assumed to follow the convention β 1 β 2 β 3 firstly β 2 is randomly selected between β 2 max and β 2 min i e β 2 min β 2 β 2 max 10 β 2 max arctan 2 3 cos arccos 12 3 g 3 11 β 2 min arctan 2 3 cos arccos 12 3 g 3 4 π 3 then β 1 and β 3 are obtained 12 β 1 1 2 β 2 1 2 arcsin tan β 2 4 g tan β 2 4 g sin β 2 13 β 3 π 2 β 1 β 2 after each capillary pressure increment when some pores and throats get drained the network saturation is updated for circular elements water saturation of drained pores is zero while for angular elements water saturation of an element s w with volume v is given by 14 s w a w a where a is the area of an element and a w is the area of water present as arc menisci in the corners of a pore body or throat and is given by øren et al 1998 15 a w r 2 i 1 n cos θ r cos θ r β i sin β i π 2 θ r β i 16 r γ p c u r p c u r is the current capillary pressure of the network the saturation of the entire network is computed by 17 s w n e t i s w i v i i v i 2 3 modeling wetting swcc the displacement of air by water in soils is an imbibition process the nature of displacement in imbibition is controlled by mechanisms like piston like advance pore body filling and snap off as shown in fig 4 lenormand et al 1983 blunt and scher 1995 øren et al 1998 patzek 2001 valvatne and blunt 2004 piston like filling in the throat is exactly the opposite of drainage however contact angle hysteresis causes three phase contact line to move when advancing wetting contact angle θ a is reached resulting in threshold capillary pressure being different from drainage the threshold capillary pressure for the piston like advance is given by 18 p c γ r a where r a is the radius of curvature of arc meniscus and patzek 2001 is followed to calculate r a for advancing or wetting contact angle values the work of kumar and malik 1990 is considered here pore filling is governed by a critical radius of curvature which depends on the number of adjacent drained throats these are called i n mechanisms lenormand et al 1983 where n is the number of drained throats connected to a pore to calculate threshold capillary pressure for an i n mechanism researchers have proposed empirical expressions blunt 1998 model is availed to compute the threshold capillary pressure for an i n mechanism according to which 19 p c i n 2 γ cos θ a r p γ i 1 n b i x i where r p is the radius of the pore to be filled x i is a random number between 0 and 1 and b i is the coefficient approximately equal to the inverse of the mean of throat radii connected to pore r p the pore filling is favored for smaller values of n i e most of the throats connected to a pore are filled with water snap off is an event that occurs in drained elements with water layers in corners these layers enlarge in response to an increase in water pressure and when they meet the entire element gets filled with water such a process results in the trapping of air piston type advance is more favored if it is topologically possible than snap off snap off occurs at a positive capillary pressure so the geometric condition that an element needs to satisfy for snap off to happen is 20 θ a π 2 β 1 the threshold capillary pressure for snap off when water meniscus in two or more corners of an element starts to swell is valvatne and blunt 2004 21 p c γ r cos θ a 2 sin θ a cot β 1 cot β 2 if only the water meniscus in the oblique most corner of an element swells then the expression for the threshold capillary pressure is valvatne and blunt 2004

and the maximum capillary pressure attained at the end of drainage all three mechanisms are incorporated in the present study the air water configuration at the end of the drainage is the initial state of the pore network for simulating wetting swcc the inlet of the network is now connected to the water reservoir and the outlet to the air reservoir the maximum capillary pressure attained at the end of drainage is gradually reduced by increasing the water pressure so the highest capillary pressure processes are favored the wetting process starts with water invading the inlet throats by piston type displacement followed by i n mechanisms for pore filling and snap off thus in each water pressure increment step elements that can be invaded by water through the above discussed mechanisms are determined and the saturation of the network is updated also in each step the algorithm checks air connectivity to the outlet reservoir to account for trapping 2 4 modeling the effect of initial void ratio and net stress there is an alteration in the soil pore structure for granular soil samples with the same grain size distribution but different void ratios as a result the pore network replicating soil pore structure will also be impacted to model the pore networks of granular soils with the same grain size distribution but the different void ratios in p f c 3 d after importing the grain size distribution of a soil the target porosity values are changed corresponding to the void ratio at which swcc is required thus the assembly of spheres illustrating the soil state at various void ratios is obtained and a pore network is extracted from these assemblies to simulate swcc similarly to model swcc at different net stress assembly of spheres depicting the soil structure corresponding to that net stress is required it is achieved by simulating 1d compression oedometric compression in p f c 3 d first an assembly of spheres with predefined gsd and porosity values is acquired without any external loading top and bottom walls are then moved with a predefined velocity to compress the specimen axially and to ensure 1d compression lateral wall movement is restricted hence representative packing of spheres at different net stress values is obtained refer to table 1 for dem model parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 reference materials and fluid flow parameters in order to evaluate and assess the proposed model ten different granular soils are selected from the literature donald 1957 schroth et al 1996 fredlund et al 1997 lins and schanz 2005 likos and jaafar 2013 fig 5 shows the grain size distribution of the materials chosen and their main properties are listed in table 2 three of the selected granular soils are ottawa sands with the same porosity but different grain size distribution they are used to investigate whether the model can predict the effect of change in grain size distribution the other test materials have porosities ranging from 32 to 47 with a varying grain size distribution to study the model s suitability on different granular soils the numerical framework to predict the effect of net stress and initial void ratio and the precision in simulating hysteresis effects is validated using experimental data from lins and schanz 2005 sensitivity analysis is performed on one test material in order to attain an optimal network independent of the number of particles swcc is obtained from packings with a different number of particles and the error mean absolute percentage error in saturation in each case is calculated fig 6 shows a considerable decrease in error with the increase in the number of spherical particles however no palpable change in error is observed with particles beyond 4000 for different grain size distributions and porosities analyzed in the current study the size of dem samples corresponding to 4000 particles is 15 20 times the mean particle diameter based on 3d dem simulations on polydisperse granular packings wiacek and molenda 2016 have also recommended a minimum representative element volume size of 15 times the mean particle diameter thus to generate dem assemblies to carry out the two phase flow simulations the packing of spherical particles with a minimum of 4000 particles is used to ensure the reproducibility of the swcc simulation for air water flow simulations the surface tension of water is set to 0 073 n m contact angle plays a significant role in the liquid distribution at the pore scale given that soil is a water wet system the drying contact angle θ r is generally assumed to be 0 lu and likos 2004 rostami et al 2015 during analysis using the current methodology it is observed that identical swccs are obtained for near zero values 0 to 10 of contact angles thus the present study also employs a value of 0 for the drying contact angle it is well established that the wetting contact angle θ a is greater than the drying contact angle kumar and malik 1990 found the wetting contact angles for different soils based on the capillary rise and horizontal infiltration testing and have reported a value of θ a 57 3 for soils with 11 fine content silt and clay to a value of θ a 84 8 for soils with 85 fine content laroussi and de backer 1979 also reported that the wetting contact angle is 20 to 30 greater than the drying contact angles in glass beads since the soil samples modeled in the current study are granular soils smaller values of wetting contact angles are employed a uniform random distribution of wetting angles from 20 to 40 is used in this work to predict wetting swcc 3 2 comparison with simplified pore network models this work refers to the pore network models containing spherical and cylindrical elements as simplified pore network models simplified pnm the pore network models extracted from 3d binary images of assembly of spheres used to represent granular soils are converted into simplified pnm by considering only the inscribed radii of elements i e the shape factor of all elements is assumed to be 0 079 circular cross section it results in a pore network of spheres and cylinders the two phase flow simulations are then carried out in the simplified pnm to obtain swccs of granular soils listed in table 2 the simplified expression for threshold capillary pressure of circular elements by substituting c 0 in eq 7 is 24 p c 2 γ cos θ r r the network saturation is updated using the eq 17 where s w is zero for drained elements and one for water saturated elements the modeled swcc from simplified pnm and the current methodology are compared in fig 7 simplified pnm overestimates capillary pressure and residual saturation and is in accord with the conclusions of sweijen et al 2017 and suh and yun 2018 the higher residual saturation values are obtained because of the trapping of water in an element or cluster of elements due to the fact that such elements are not in pressure connections with the outlet the capillary pressure in such elements will not change resulting in the trapping of water during drainage the wetting phase remains connected through the angular elements which can retain the wetting phase in their corners resulting in lower saturation values the modeled swccs with current and simplified pnm is fitted with the van genuchten function van genuchten 1980 the model can be expressed as 25 s s r 1 s r 1 1 α ψ m n m where s r is the irreducible water saturation after drainage α kpa 1 is the inverse of air entry pressure and n and m parameters are related to soil pore size distribution and overall symmetry of the curve respectively the parameters are optimized by maximizing the r 2 value under the constraint m 1 1 n the values of fitting parameters α and s r are compared for all reference materials as depicted in fig 7 the air entry pressure which is inverse of parameter α and residual saturation obtained from simplified pnms are on the higher side when compared to the experimental values clearly by incorporating angular cross sections to account for irregularities in pores and throats and modeling wetting layers the modeled swccs show a significant resemblance with the experimental results 3 3 drying swcc fig 8 shows the predicted and measured swccs of granular soils listed in table 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean squared error rmse is calculated to quantify the goodness of fit and values are reported in table 3 26 r 2 1 s s m 2 s s 2 where s and s m are the measured and modeled saturation respectively 27 r m s e 1 n t i 1 n t s s m 2 where n t is the total number of measured saturation values r 2 value of 0 99 is obtained for most of the test materials with a minimum of 0 94 which indicates a good agreement between the measured and modeled swccs the measured and predicted swccs are fitted with the van genuchten function and the values of fitting parameters are tabulated in table 4 the air entry value one of the most important parameters associated with swcc is measured from the inverse of the α parameter for the measured and modeled curves fitting parameters α and n are in good agreement the difference in air entry pressure is below 8 with an average difference of 2 9 fig 9 shows the comparison of the proposed model with various other models namely arya and paris 1981 arya et al 1999 aubertin et al 2003 and wang et al 2017 a brief about them is given in the introduction section for arya and paris 1981 α 1 38 is used as suggested by the author and for arya et al 1999 the value of α used depends on the texture of the soil as per the u s department of agriculture the values are 1 285 1 459 1 375 1 150 and 1 160 for the sand sandy loam loam silt loam and clay textures respectively arya et al 1999 while arya and paris 1981 and arya et al 1999 models are highly sensitive to the empirical parameter α other models also do not provide a good prediction for all test materials the measured and modeled saturation using the proposed model for all the test materials is compared and the results are reported in fig 10 the predicted and the experimental values are in good agreement over the entire range of saturation however a few outliers show an absolute error of 0 15 in the predicted saturation 3 4 wetting swcc the wetting and drying swccs are not unique and follow different paths due to the time consuming nature of experimental procedures to assess wetting swccs only drying swccs are often acquired in the laboratory however many field problems like landslides due to precipitation the performance of hydraulic barriers etc require knowledge of wetting swcc experimental results of lins and schanz 2005 for two different soil samples of houston sand are used to validate the prediction of wetting swcc by the current model fig 11 shows the predicted and measured wetting swcc and the drying curves r 2 of 0 99 is obtained in both cases with rmse of 0 03 and 0 respectively which is evocative of the reasonable accuracy of the proposed approach and mechanism 3 5 influence of void ratio and net stress on swcc to study the efficiency of the model to capture the influence of change in void ratio on swcc a loose sample void ratio of 0 89 is compared with its dense configuration void ratio of 0 66 fig 12 compares the predicted values with the experimental values lins and schanz 2005 with the change in the initial state the characteristics of swcc change like the air entry value and the slope of the wetting and drying curves the loose sample drains faster due to large voids present in it resulting in a steeper slope of drying swcc in the loose sample on the other hand due to more percentage of smaller voids water imbibes faster in the dense soil resulting in a steeper slope of wetting swcc in the dense sample the proposed model is consistent with the experimental trend the network of pores and throats is extracted from the corresponding assembly of spheres at net stress of 10 kpa and 20 kpa to model swcc under different net stress the experimental and predicted values are shown in fig 13 indicate that the proposed method can simulate swccs under various stresses with reasonable accuracy the effect of net stress on swcc for the experimental results used for validation is not significant however the intent here is to only introduce this alternative approach to model swcc under different net stresses and it will be explored in further studies 3 6 effect of particle shape used for modeling granular soil structure on swcc spherical particles are generally used to model the geometry of granular soils the impact of various particle shapes that can be used to simulate the geometry of granular soils and their subsequent influence on swcc is analyzed and discussed in this section in order to investigate the effect of the shape of individual particles used to create a representative assembly three dem samples are generated following the same particle size distribution and packing density porosity the particle size distribution varies from 0 5 mm to 3 mm and the porosity of the samples is 0 65 apart from sphere shaped particles cubic and tetrahedron shaped individual particles are used to generate stable assemblies these complex geometries are modeled in p f c 3 d using clumps a clump is a cluster of spherical particles and the radii and placements of these particles determine the surface of the clump different complex shapes are approximated by using clumps that act like rigid bodies whose inertia parameters are calculated from its geometry or the outer surface defined by the distribution of spherical particles fig 14 shows the dem samples generated using cubic spherical and tetrahedron shaped particles with a magnified view of an individual clump after creating stable assemblies a pore network is extracted from them and swcc simulations are performed in each of the three pore networks however the present analysis does not consider the preferred alignment of individual particles while creating dem samples which may result in an anisotropic sample and consequently the water retention curve may change such analysis will be carried out in future studies the characteristics of the derived pore networks from dem samples modeled using various particle shapes are contrasted in table 5 and the simulated swccs are shown in fig 15 in terms of network attributes and swccs they are nearly identical for all three networks the creation of complex shaped individual particles is computationally expensive since the network properties and swccs show a close resemblance for various complex shapes used to model granular soils dem pnm coupling for granular soils using spherical particles can be successfully used for predicting water retention characteristics 4 conclusions a pore scale model to predict swcc of coarse grained materials is presented in this work the model is based on integrating dem and pore network modeling and requires only gsd and porosity as input parameters it is capable of predicting the main drying and wetting curves and can be further used to estimate swccs at different net stress and void ratios an essential micro mechanism of corner flow is incorporated in this model for a more accurate prediction of the drying curve of granular soils which most pore scale models have usually neglected to illustrate the proposed model s performance several reference materials are selected from literature with varying gsd and porosity values and measured and predicted drying swccs are compared the predicted values for all materials have an average r 2 value of 0 976 the average error in predicting air entry value is 2 9 while most of the ptfs are developed to predict the drying curve and the corresponding wetting curve is estimated indirectly using empirical techniques pham et al 2003 the current study also discusses the approach to model hysteresis mechanisms like piston type advance snap off and cooperative pore filling govern air displacement by water at the pore scale these mechanisms are included in the current model to predict the main wetting curve swcc is influenced by field conditions like compaction state and net stress the present work is made more extensive by extending it to simulate swcc under different initial void ratios and net stress dem assemblies are generated using different particle shapes to determine whether the latter affects swcc for the same gsd and porosity the pore network characteristics of the packing formed using complex particle morphologies are nearly the same as a result identical swccs are obtained from these assemblies thus instead of utilizing computationally expensive complicated shapes to describe the geometry of granular soils spherical particles effectively model the water retention properties of granular soils the significant advantage of the proposed framework is that by implementing relevant mechanisms at the pore scale it can be used not only to predict the retention behavior of granular soils but also for modeling unsaturated hydraulic conductivities explore reactive transport processes like the migration of pollutants adsorption biomass growth and various other flow and transport phenomena in unsaturated soils the present pore scale model can also be extended to fine grained soils where swcc is also affected by the diffusion double layer and clay minerals credit authorship contribution statement suaiba mufti conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation

2679,maowei sea is a typical semi enclosed subtropical bay where eutrophication has been rising due to human activities in recent years at present the source and long term variability properties of nutrients are not well understood this study investigated the dissolved inorganic nutrients in the riverine sections to the sea and the coastal areas from 2011 to 2017 in qinzhou bay qzb beibu gulf results showed that harmful blooms were frequent in the dry season due to rapid urbanization in recent years during dry season the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip increased by 67 and 150 respectively most of the nutrients input to the bay were supplied by the adjoining rivers followed by groundwater discharge according to the classical box model devised by the land ocean interactions in the coastal zone high din concentrations in rivers were mainly caused by intensified agriculture including urban and rural effluents due to inadequate sanitary sewer systems maowei sea the inner bay of qzb is a sink system for din but a strong source system for dip which surpassed riverine input probably due to the discharge of dip containing effluent from the industries around the maoling river mouth the discrepancy in din and dip sources resulted in different din dip ratios between the wet and dry seasons p limitation generally occurs in the wet season and is relieved in the dry season the relief of p limitation in the dry season may be crucial for the frequent harmful algal blooms which may be further aggravated in the future with the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the bay therefore the results of this study provide a basis for the effective improvement of the ecological environment in the maowei sea keywords nutrients sources budgets decadal changes qinzhou bay maowei sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the trophic status of coastal waters in developing regions has captured global attention popova et al 2019 santos et al 2021 large amount of nutrients are discharged from point and non point sources and has led to the enrichment and imbalance of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphate dip which can cause direct and secondary adverse effects on coastal ecosystems such as changes in phytoplankton structure increased frequency of algae bloom oxygen deficiency submerged plant degeneration and seawater acidification cai et al 2011 zhang and gao 2016 diatoms represent a major portion of the global planktonic primary production and a high din to dip ratio may promote the proliferation of diatoms in water especially when the water temperature is conducive xiao et al 2018 the degree of offshore eutrophication has been rising in recent years with the continuous input of anthropogenic nutrients due to increased human activities in coastal areas and variation in climatic conditions peter 2012 therefore knowledge of the dominant sources and long term changes of dissolved nutrients in coastal ecosystems are essential for cognition of the evolution and nutrient pollution management in coastal areas generally the impact of human activities on nutrient enrichment is getting less attention in small coastal ecosystems particularly in rapidly developing economies of nations in south asia smith et al 2010 peter 2012 smaller coastal ecosystems respond to seasonal changes compared to large systems and natural and anthropogenic influences are rapid tay et al 2012 macro tidal induced short term nutrient concentration changes in small subtropical estuaries exceed those of seasonal and sub seasonal scales kaiser et al 2013 on a seasonal scale urban sewage incidents or floods affect nutrient concentrations in small systems gong et al 2020 thus single or few seasonal investigations do not accurately reveal the main nutrient sources in these systems seasonal problems may exist although many studies utilize isotope techniques to identify the main sources of nutrients in coastal systems shuler et al 2019 therefore long term continuous survey data are needed to analyze how human activities and nature affect the composition and dynamics of nutrients in small coastal systems qinzhou bay qzb is located in beibu gulf northern south china sea fig 1 it is a protected mangrove ecosystem for sousa chinensis and tachypleus tridentatus liao et al 2019 fu et al 2019 moreover its economy is underdeveloped relative to the temperate estuaries and bays in china major estuaries and bays in this area have been affected by diverse human activities e g agriculture aquaculture land reclamation wastewater discharge coal combustion etc wu et al 2017 li et al 2018 nutrient overload has been most pronounced during the last 10 years in qzb and the adjacent coastal waters yang et al 2015 2017 li et al 2018 in the winter of 2015 severe phaeocystis globosa bloom blocked the cooling seawater supply of the nuclear power located in qzb which led to a substantial economic loss and security concerns li et al 2019 most of the studies in qzb have focused on its trophic status yang et al 2017 li et al 2018 however studies investigating the primary sources of nutrient overload have been largely ignored the lack of long term nutrient data makes assessing the ecological effects and associated risks of anthropogenic activities in the bay difficult in this study multiple season data including 27 and 60 surveys of riverine and coastal nutrients from 2011 to 2018 in the qzb were collected the primary objectives were to 1 identify the content and composition of dissolved inorganic nutrients 2 analyze the main factors affecting seasonal and spatial fluctuation of nutrients and 3 assess the ecological risk resulting from the long term variations of nutrient concentrations and compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the qzb is a bay drowned valley located in the northern beibu gulf south china sea fig 1 it is a semi enclosed bay consisting of the maowei sea mws 135 km2 and qinzhou gang qzg about 200 km2 the average depth range of the bay is approximately 5 7 m with homogeneously mixed freshwater depending on the seasonal input in addition the macro tides range is 2 1 4 7 m the ring bay receives water from the maoling river mlr length 179 km drainage area 2959 km2 and qinjiang river qjr length 112 km drainage area 2457 km2 the catchment areas are dominated by forest lands and agricultural activities tian et al 2015 all these may have a profound impact on the coastal aquatic environment frequent heavy rain between may and september accounts for 70 of annual precipitation fig 2 a in contrast rainfall is low between october and april accordingly the seasons are roughly divided into wet may to september and dry october to april following the rainfall observed during this study the coastal population is 1 2 million the qzb has been rapidly urbanized in recent decades with the gross domestic product in 2017 nearly seven times that in 2005 and has witnessed relatively small population fluctuations fig 2b the sanitary sewer systems are inadequate in covering municipal communities and few sanitary sewer systems serving suburban areas drain wastewaters into the qjr and mljr due to rapid urbanization in addition the mws is covered by many floating rafts and bottom sowing aquaculture for oysters and fish breeding land reclamation from the sea in the qzg for industrial developments and coastal city construction has reached 55 km2 during the recent 10 years 2 2 sample collection and analysis five liters of surface water used for din dip and dsi determination were collected from the river sections to the sea and coastal areas in 2011 2018 by the specialized and skilled survey team of the oceanic administration of qinzhou sea surface temperature and salinity were measured in situ using an advanced portable multiparameter aquaprobe ap 2000 aquaread broadstairs uk in addition 15 and 22 seasonal surveys were independently conducted in mws and qinzhou harbor respectively and 23 periodic samplings were conducted in the qjr and mlr sections when salinity was 2 fig 1 table 1 only nutrient data from 11 surveys involved in the qjr estuary during 2011 2014 were also collected for regional comparison fig 1 table 1 sampling and sample analysis was conducted following the national standard of china gb 17378 4 2007 in chinese din and dip were measured spectrophotometrically using n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine and phosphomolybdenum blue methods respectively the hypobromite oxidation method was employed to determine ammonium indirectly kaiser et al 2013 the concentration of din was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n the standard error se calculated as the sum of the error contributions was 0 5 for din and dip respectively daily precipitation and water temperature were obtained from the qinzhou hydrometeorology station fig 1 2 3 data and statistical analysis data on gross domestic product and population were obtained from the qinzhou statistical bureau the spss 19 0 software was used for statistical data analysis some historical data on din dip and dsi were from references lu et al 2020 the student s t test was used to evaluate the differences between tested groups and pearson correlation was applied to reveal the relationship of tested variables the significant level in all statistical analyses was accepted using a p 0 05 value 2 4 nutrient budgets a box model devised by the land ocean interactions in the coastal zone and widely used for nutrient budgets in estuaries and coastal waters was employed to construct water and nutrient budgets liu et al 2011 li et al 2013 dan et al 2019 this model treats a system of interest as a single and steady box in brief the water mass balance was estimated as follows 1 v r v in v out v q v p v g v w v e where vr is the residual flow vin and vout are the inflow and outflow of water from the system of interest respectively vq vp vg vw and ve are the river discharge precipitation groundwater wastewater and evaporation respectively the freshwater salinity was treated as 0 vq vp vg vw and ve thus the salt balance can be derived 2 v x s 1 s 2 v r s r where sr s 1 s 2 2 s 1 and s 2 are the average salinity of the system of interest and the adjacent system respectively vx is the mixing flow between the two systems the total water exchange time τ of the system of interest was estimated from the vs vr vx vs refers to the volume of the system the non conservative fluxes of nutrient elements δy can be derived based on water budgets and nutrient concentrations 3 δ y o u t f l u x inf l u x v r c r v x c x v q c q v p c p v g c g v w c w where cr is the average element concentration in the residual flow boundary equating to c 1 c 2 2 cx is the mixing flow equating to c 1 c 2 and cq cp cg and cw are the average element concentrations in river discharge precipitation groundwater and wastewater respectively c 1 and c 2 are the average element concentrations of the system of interest and the adjacent system respectively a negative or positive sign for δy suggests that the system of interest is a sink or a source respectively 3 results 3 1 contents structure and spatiotemporal characteristics of nutrients in the rivers qjr was enriched in din relative to dip table 2 the din and dip contents were 22 186 μm mean 94 0 47 8 μm and 0 16 1 90 μm mean 1 1 0 5 μm respectively the high din contents led to high din dip ratios which ranged from 19 to 953 with an average of 160 235 in the qjr compared to the qjr the din and dip contents occurred in a relatively small 3 117 μm and large 0 10 4 52 μm range with a mean of 55 4 34 1 μm and 8 1 1 μm respectively with a low din dip ratio at a range of 4 393 mean 61 90 in the mlr no3 accounted for 5 92 of din with an average concentration of 61 4 46 3 μm and 35 7 27 5 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively nh4 accounted for 6 90 and 4 90 of din with an average level of 30 5 14 9 μm and 17 4 11 9 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively meanwhile the no2 contents were low 25 of din with average concentrations of 5 1 4 0 μm and 2 3 1 6 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively statistically t test pooled seasons the qjr had significant higher nitrate p 0 05 nitrite p 0 01 ammonium p 0 05 and din p 0 01 levels but significant lower dip levels p 0 01 compared with the mlr the nutrient concentration in the rivers varied seasonally and yearly fig 3 a the no2 variation in the mlr and dip in the qjr were weak the no3 contents increased from the dry to the wet season in the qjr except for a high level in march 2016 however the dip contents decreased from the dry to the wet season in the mlr no3 also has similar distributional trends in both rivers dip and no3 had no clear seasonality in the qjr and mlr respectively nevertheless dip had statistically higher concentrations in the dry season in qjr pooled seasons p 0 05 while no3 had no significant difference between seasons in the mlr nh4 concentrations also showed no seasonal difference in the rivers meanwhile significant but weakly positive correlations were found between no3 and no2 p 0 05 r2 0 18 and between nh4 and dip p 0 05 r2 0 16 in the rivers suggesting source commonality 3 2 contents structure and spatiotemporal characteristics of nutrients in the qzb nutrient transports from the mws to the qzg have been most pronounced by many seasonal studies in the qzb yang et al 2012 2013 lai et al 2013 ma et al 2013 nutrient concentrations were significantly high in the mws than in the qzg except for no2 pooled data 2011 2017 p 0 01 for no3 din and dip and p 0 05 for nh4 table 2 as a small subarea of the qzb the mws is largely influenced by the freshwater input from the qjr and mlr all nutrients had higher concentrations in the qjr than in the mws pooled all data in 2011 2014 p 0 01 for no3 and no2 and p 0 01 for nh4 in contrast dip contents were significantly lower in the qjr p 0 05 indicating that qjr contributed less dip the average dip in the mws was near twice the average in the qjr and even surpassed the levels in any season in the qjr fig 3b the spatial characteristics of nutrients with salinity in the wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 4 in the mws salinity varied from 0 to 28 and 10 to 30 in the wet and dry seasons no3 showed a conservative behavior in the dry season while no2 and nh4 exhibited either conservative or non conservative behaviors depending on the years the concentrations of n nutrients were almost stable at a salinity 5 during the wet season in the mws indicating their additions with the mixing dilution a sharp decline in nh4 which corresponded to an abrupt increase of no2 in the wet season of 2016 and high no2 as nh4 declines in the dry season of 2012 in the mws may be indicative of strong nitrification wu et al 2017 no mixing dilutions along the salinity gradient were found for dip in the dry and wet seasons in the mws in qzg the salinity varied from 10 to 30 and 20 to 30 in the wet and dry seasons respectively the contents of no3 and no2 showed similar rapid mixing dilution in the wet season dip also exhibited mixing dilution in the wet season except in 2013 in the qzg no apparent trend was found for nh4 all nutrients showed almost an uncertain spatial distribution in the dry season of different years in the qzg 3 3 spatial temporal variation characteristics of nutrients the seasonality of nutrient concentrations was weak in the mws and qzg except for increasing concentration trends of no2 from the dry to wet seasons fig 3b seasonal variability was up to 4 5 and 17 fold for no2 and no2 respectively in the wet season of 2013 no3 and no2 showed up to 8 7 fold variability in the wet season of 2015 indicating that the bay responded rapidly to both natural and anthropogenic factors low salinity with correspondingly high levels of no3 in september 2015 and august 2013 in mws and qzg respectively suggested high freshwater input the minimum salinity also corroborated with the higher and even the highest no2 and nh4 concentrations however the lack of significant correlation between no3 and salinity indicates that freshwater input may not always be a dominant factor enhancing the contents of no3 where a weak negative correlation was observed between salinity and no2 p 0 05 r 2 0 26 and nh4 p 0 05 r 2 0 28 in the mws in the qzg salinity showed significant weak and insignificant negative correlations with no2 p 0 01 r 2 0 60 no3 p 0 01 r 2 0 28 and nh4 p 0 05 r 2 0 786 respectively reflecting the differences in the nutrient responses from freshwater input meanwhile strong positive correlation was observed between no2 and nh4 in the mws p 0 01 r 2 0 47 and between no2 and no3 in the qzg p 0 0001 r 2 0 60 implying possible commonality in their sources no significant correlations were found between dip with salinity or other nutrients in the mws and the qzg statistically pooled data by season no3 and no2 showed higher concentrations in the wet season in the mws p 0 01 for no2 and p 0 01 for no2 and the qzg p 0 05 for no3 and p 0 01 for no2 table 2 the nh4 concentrations were significantly higher in the wet season in the mws p 0 0001 but were comparable between the wet and dry seasons in the qzg table 2 unlike din dip exhibited significantly lower levels in the wet season of the mws p 0 05 and the qzg p 0 01 which resulted in significantly lower din dip ratios in the dry season in the mws p 0 01 and qzg p 0 01 table 2 thus the mws and qzg generally had p limitation and re emission in the wet and dry seasons moreover the mws showed n limitation in the dry season during the study period fig 4 3 4 annual variations of dissolved nutrients the annual variabilities of din and dip were analyzed based on the collected and published data during similar seasons in the qzb fig 5 qzb showed a low din level relative to a high dip level in 1983 1984 din concentrations fluctuated at 15 μm lower concentrations during 1995 1998 and increased to 25 μm before the rapid urbanization and during the industrialization period respectively dip concentrations showed a staged increase with a mean of 0 2 0 4 1 2 and 2 2 μm in 1990 2001 2002 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively dsi concentrations in years were stable with an average of 46 3 4 6 μm following the available data in the bay the areal yield rates of din and dip in the two river basins were estimated by the product of nutrient concentrations with the river discharge divided by the drainage area fig 6 the din dip ratios decreased exponentially p 0 01 with an increase in the atomic ratios of dip to dsi fig 7 a this pattern is similar to the result of the atomic ratios of din to dip versus dip to dsi in large estuaries and embayment of china which indicates changes in primary production with nutrient transport in the coastal environment when the urbanization develops to a certain extent liu et al 2009 the calculated din dip dsi din and dsi dip ratios were plotted as a log log plot and the four quadrants were labeled following the redfield ratio fig 7b d according to the results qzb was declining in din dip and dsi dip ratios with changes in time scales causing nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth as n limitation increased 3 5 budgets of nutrients in the maowei sea the relative importance of external nutrient inputs versus physical mixing and biogeochemical processes was further assessed in the mws the water and salt budget for the mws system is shown in fig 8 freshwater inputs of rivers vq were the average seasonal runoffs table 2 the precipitation input vp was calculated by multiplying the average precipitation in seasons and the system area 135 km2 and the evaporative output ve was from the estimation of the evaporation per square kilometers in the subtropical daya bay with near latitude liu et al 2009 the groundwater input vg in the wet and dry seasons was estimated at 15 of the mixing flux of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater measured in june 2016 and march 2017 respectively chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b this rough estimation may be overestimated because the percentage of recirculated seawater is higher than 85 in many cases liu et al 2017 wang et al 2015a c the wastewater discharges vw in the wet and dry seasons were derived from the measurements around the mws in may september and november 2018 thus the net water output of the studied system has a residual flow vr of 25 1 106 and 11 7 106 m3 day 1 in the wet and dry seasons respectively following the water mass balance fig 8 based on the salt balance the water exchange vx between the mws and the qzg is 28 9 106 and 33 5 106 m3 day 1 in the wet and dry seasons respectively the volume of the mws vs is 6 8 108 m3 135 km2 with an average depth of 5 m and the estimated total water exchange time τ is 12 6 and 15 0 days in the wet and dry seasons respectively calculated from the ratio vs vr vx nutrient budgets were estimated following the water mass balance and nutrient concentrations in the specific freshwater riverine nutrient concentrations were based on the statistical means of 2011 2017 table 2 groundwater nutrient concentrations in the wet season refer to the measurements in june 2018 chen et al 2018a which were comparable to the riverine concentrations means of qjr and mlr in table 2 except for the low no2 content thus groundwater nutrient concentrations in the dry season are assumed to be the same as the riverine input due to the absence of available data as was explicitly mentioned by tri et al 1999 and employed in the beibu gulf by wan et al 2003 nutrient concentrations in wastewaters around the mws measured in may september and november 2018 were also used in this study while nutrient concentrations in precipitation referred to the measurements in the nanliu estuary beibu gulf kaiser et al 2013 with respect to nutrient concentrations and the water mass balance the seasonal nutrient budgets of the mws system are shown in table 3 the mws appeared to be a sink of n nutrients except for no2 in the dry season and a dip source 4 discussion 4 1 factor effects on the nutrient variation in river nutrient data were scarce in the qjr and the mlr average concentrations of din in the qjr and the mlr were within the range of the average global levels 52 μm and polluted water 110 μm while the average values of dip in the qjr were within the range of pristine 0 5 μm and clean water 1 4 μm levels which surpassed the clean water level in the mlr table 2 like other tropical rivers in china the high din and low dip concentrations resulted in high din dip ratios in the two rivers liu et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 dan et al 2019 compared with the global riverine data fig 6 the area yield rate of din ranked high and medium in the qjr and mlr respectively and the area yield rate of dip was classed as medium level which was comparable to other small tropical rivers e g jiulong river and the wanquan river howarth et al 1996 peierls et al 1991 wen et al 2008 li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 small rivers are more prone to pollution than large rivers because of their weak hydrodynamic forces and poor pollutant carrying capacity but they are often not concerned because of their small size hao et al 2021 the yangtze pearl and yellow rivers are major rivers in china and the world with runoffs over 50 times the mlr and the qjr however the areal yield rates of din and dip in the qjr watershed were 2 9 and 2 6 0 5 and 0 8 and 14 8 and 86 8 times the rates reported for the yangtze river wang et al 2015a c the pearl river strokal et al 2015 and the yellow river watersheds wu et al 2021 respectively moreover the areal yield rates of din and dip in the mlr watershed were 1 6 and 4 3 0 3 and 1 3 and 8 6 and 139 times the corresponding rates reported for the yangtze river wang et al 2015a c the pearl river strokal et al 2015 and the yellow river watersheds respectively wu et al 2021 these findings indicate that small rivers are more easily affected by human activities than the major river systems and must require more attention in the future high nitrate dominated din concentrations in rivers are usually attributed to leaching from agriculture and domestic activities over the drainage basins particularly to the washout of fertilizers not utilized by target plants liu et al 2011 bu et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 the qjr basin is dominated by agricultural land relative to the mlr fig 1 rice and sugarcane are the main cash crops cultivated in spring and summer and harvested in autumn thus significantly higher concentrations of din in the qjr than in the mlr p 0 01 table 2 reveal the influence of agriculture and the general increase in din concentration trend from dry season to wet season in the qjr fig 4a is a result of the extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers as well as enhanced runoff which increases riverine nutrient concentrations during the wet season falco et al 2010 tay et al 2012 the lack of significant differences p 0 05 in din concentrations between the qjr and the mlr in the dry season may be a result of the fallow state of cultivation and weak precipitation table 2 in addition the wide range of nh4 concentrations 6 90 and 4 90 of din in the qjr and the mlr averaging 35 respectively indicates that sewage effluents also influence the rivers due to the inadequate sanitary sewer system in the drainage area high nh4 levels were also found early in the qjr zhang 1996 and chen et al 2016 reported that urban effluents livestock and rural life were the primary pollution source of nh4 in the mlr other uncertain sources only occupied 22 1 emptying through qinzhou city with a higher population density fig 1 the qjr indeed showed higher nh4 concentrations than the mlr p 0 05 table 2 the discharges from urban rural life and livestock must be less regulated by seasons which are revealed by the insignificant difference p 0 05 of nh4 concentrations between wet and dry seasons in both the qjr and mlr table 2 the dip concentrations showed minimum seasonal fluctuation and lower values in the qjr than in the mlr fig 4 table 2 phosphorous is more difficult to be leached away from drainage basins than nitrogen liu et al 2009 dip concentrations decreased from the dry to wet seasons in the mlr fig 4a they were significantly lower in the wet season than in the dry season in the qjr p 0 05 table 2 which suggests that the dip concentrations became diluted in the rivers during the wet season 4 2 factor effects on the nutrient variation in mws the estuaries and bays in china have generally suffered high pollution of dissolved inorganic nutrients the beibu gulf was considered a relatively clean water body in the context of nutrient pollution however this study illustrates that intensive human activities have affected the coastal waters in recent years the average concentrations of din and dip increased by 67 and 150 respectively during the rapid urbanization period in the qzb fig 2b and fig 5 moreover the concentration trend of dip appeared to be on the rise fig 5b according to the chinese water quality classification gb 3097 1997 qzb must be regarded as highly polluted with din and extreme dip concentrations compared to major chinese bays liu et al 2009 this study reveals that intensive economic activities may still significantly impact the coastal ecosystems e g the imbalance of nutrients in the developing coastal areas despite the current advances in coastal nutrient management and techniques high nutrient concentrations in estuaries and bays were mainly attributed to the inputs of anthropogenic sources through rivers wet deposition groundwater and wastewater inputs padedda et al 2010 chen et al 2018b the mws is considered the main area which receives external nutrients input in the bay nutrient input except for nh4 by atmospheric deposition flux was 10 of the riverine influx in the wet season 17 6 table 3 nutrient fluxes from aquaculture wastewater are negligible relative to riverine input consistent with nanliu estuary beibu gulf kaiser et al 2013 mws eutrophication was also mainly attributed to riverine nutrient inputs by previous studies lan et al 2012 the concentrations of din and dip in the rivers entering the mws were at a medium level compared with other rivers but din and dip showed contrasting behavior between the wet and dry seasons which are mainly affected by rainfall rainfall in the wet season accounts for 80 of the annual rainfall suggesting that concentrations of din and dip became diluted in the rivers and qzb during the wet season however other factors such as basin area industrial structure and geological structure may also play a role hao et al 2021 according to figs 3 and 5 the din concentration in the river decreased yearly while the din concentration in mws increased from 2011 to 2018 the din concentration in the river was 3 6 times higher than in the mws table 3 this indicates that rivers and other sources contributed to din concentrations in the mws for example chen et al 2018a c reported that groundwater derived nutrients i e din and dip were 1 9 and 0 9 times the amounts delivered through riverine input in summer 2016 in the mws similar conclusions for groundwater derived nutrient fluxes over riverine inputs have been reported in other studies e g zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in this study the inputs of din and dip through groundwater influx were nearly 50 of the amounts delivered by rivers i e the sum of input by the qjr and mlr table 3 although the possible overestimation of groundwater mass may likely contribute to overestimated nutrient fluxes groundwater discharge serves as a significant source when nutrient additions with low salinity were generally observed in the mws in the wet season fig 3 din was almost conservative in the dry season indicating that riverine input acted as the dominant din source in the dry season fig 3 therefore riverine input is concluded to be the most significant nutrient source over the year followed by groundwater influx in the study area coincidentally the total annual riverine flux of din i e the sum of the input from qjr and mlr exhibited an excellent linear relationship with the annual variation of din concentration in the qzb during the study period fig 9 groundwater derived fluxes have been reported to respond to precipitation rapidly wang et al 2015a c terrestrial hydraulic gradients were also found to play significant roles in the discharge of fresh groundwater from terrestrial sources which have been extensively reported to significantly impacts tidal ranges and aquifer recharge michael et al 2011 gonneea et al 2013 wang and du 2016 thus conducting more measurements for groundwater nutrient fluxes especially during the flood tide in the study area is necessary despite the possible overestimation in groundwater nutrient flux the mws still appears as a significant dip source system surpassing the riverine and groundwater fluxes table 3 this result indicates that other important sources of dip inputs other than the rivers may exist significantly lower levels in the wet season than in the dry season in the bay p 0 05 for the mws p 0 01 for the qzg table 2 imply that the sources are related to point sources due to the possible dilution effect in the wet season the lower dip levels in the qinjiang mouth qjm than that in the mws suggests the sources are not produced in the qjm p 0 05 based on four sub seasonal surveys march june september and december lai et al 2013 reported the peak values of dip concentrations in the qzb near the maoling river mouth fig 0 1 where severe dip pollution was pronounced almost during the whole year in 2016 and 2017 by in situ monitoring moreover yang et al 2019 also observed the highest concentrations of exchangeable p in the sediment of the stations in this region indicating its strong origins in the overlying water zhuang et al 2014 thus the strong sources are probably related to the industries situated along the end of mlr which may have enhanced dip concentrations of the monitored mlr sections through the rising tide this shows that the mlr had higher dip discharge concentrations than the qjr in the previous analysis where riverine dip input to the sea was mainly attributed to urban and rural wastewater 4 3 impact of nutrient variation on the ecological environment of the mws seasonal nutrient transports are uncertain in the mws due to the rapid response to diverse human and natural factors for example extreme storm and precipitation events can result in more frequent short term variations of nutrient inputs shifts in nutrient ratios may occur due to the different reactions of nutrient species to the events kaiser et al 2013 these modifications can introduce complicated changes in coastal ecosystem composition and increase the risks of harmful algal blooms hallegraeff 2010 griffith and gobler 2020 this study demonstrates the complexities where runoff events significantly increased n nutrient concentrations but seasonal freshwater inputs played a limited role in increased nitrate concentrations in the mws as previously mentioned the different primary sources of din and dip in the qzb contribute to the seasonal variation of the din dip ratio the qzb is dominated by p limitation din dip ratios 16 in the wet season while the p limitation was relieved in the dry season due to the reduced din concentrations versus the stable dip concentrations fig 3 this may promote high primary production in the dry season five algal blooms have been recorded in the qzb and the adjacent waters since 2011 liu et al 2011 four of them were p globosa occurring in the dry season the frequent algal blooms in the dry season are speculated to be likely related to the alleviation of p limitation because nutrient ratios are far more critical regulators in the red tide increase yuasa et al 2020 it is believed that no report of algal blooms existed before the rapid urbanization in the qzb previous studies suggested that p limitation dominated the qzb and adjacent waters due to the relatively high din concentrations lai et al 2013 ma et al 2013 li et al 2018 however more extensive data in this study shows that the rapid rise in dip has led to improved p limitation in recent years fig 8 the growth of p globosa requires high concentrations of nutrients yang et al 2019 its growth rates in low phosphorus conditions were much lower than in high phosphorus waters hu et al 2008 and were rarely affected by n limitation due to its high competition for various inorganic and organic nitrogen sources qin et al 2012 moreover p limitation favored the decrease in p globosa bloom li et al 2015 and phosphorous played a more vital role than nitrogen in forming heavy mucous aggregates for p globosa mari et al 2005 thus p globosa blooms may be intensified in the future due to din enrichment with the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the bay 5 conclusions this study highlighted the effects of increased anthropogenic activities on nutrient dynamics in typical coastal water located in the developing coastal region of south asia the main conclusions are as follows 1 increased anthropogenic activity is particularly evident in the qzb where the trophic status is largely influenced due to rapid urbanization with frequent occurrence of harmful blooms in the dry seasons in recent decades the average din concentration increased by 67 during the rapid urbanization 2006 2017 whereas dip increased by 150 in the qzb din was mainly transported by rivers followed by groundwater input to the qzb high din concentrations in the rivers were primarily related to agriculture and urban and rural effluents due to inadequate sanitary sewer systems in the study area 2 mws appeared to be a din sink system but a strong source system for dip which surpassed riverine input even though nutrient input from groundwater may have been overestimated the result indicated a strong external dip source probably related to the industries located in the maoling river mouth the differences in the primary sources between din and dip resulted in a seasonal statistical discrepancy in the din dip ratios which indicated that p limitation generally occurred in the wet season and was relieved in the dry season due to the reduction of din discharge and stable dip concentrations the relief in p limitation in the dry season may be critical for the frequent algal blooms which could intensify in the future due to the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the study area 3 the data in the current study denotes the latest trophic status in this qzb and provides a robust interpretation of the primary sources of nutrients and ecological risks from anthropogenic factors in the beibu

2679,maowei sea is a typical semi enclosed subtropical bay where eutrophication has been rising due to human activities in recent years at present the source and long term variability properties of nutrients are not well understood this study investigated the dissolved inorganic nutrients in the riverine sections to the sea and the coastal areas from 2011 to 2017 in qinzhou bay qzb beibu gulf results showed that harmful blooms were frequent in the dry season due to rapid urbanization in recent years during dry season the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip increased by 67 and 150 respectively most of the nutrients input to the bay were supplied by the adjoining rivers followed by groundwater discharge according to the classical box model devised by the land ocean interactions in the coastal zone high din concentrations in rivers were mainly caused by intensified agriculture including urban and rural effluents due to inadequate sanitary sewer systems maowei sea the inner bay of qzb is a sink system for din but a strong source system for dip which surpassed riverine input probably due to the discharge of dip containing effluent from the industries around the maoling river mouth the discrepancy in din and dip sources resulted in different din dip ratios between the wet and dry seasons p limitation generally occurs in the wet season and is relieved in the dry season the relief of p limitation in the dry season may be crucial for the frequent harmful algal blooms which may be further aggravated in the future with the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the bay therefore the results of this study provide a basis for the effective improvement of the ecological environment in the maowei sea keywords nutrients sources budgets decadal changes qinzhou bay maowei sea data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the trophic status of coastal waters in developing regions has captured global attention popova et al 2019 santos et al 2021 large amount of nutrients are discharged from point and non point sources and has led to the enrichment and imbalance of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphate dip which can cause direct and secondary adverse effects on coastal ecosystems such as changes in phytoplankton structure increased frequency of algae bloom oxygen deficiency submerged plant degeneration and seawater acidification cai et al 2011 zhang and gao 2016 diatoms represent a major portion of the global planktonic primary production and a high din to dip ratio may promote the proliferation of diatoms in water especially when the water temperature is conducive xiao et al 2018 the degree of offshore eutrophication has been rising in recent years with the continuous input of anthropogenic nutrients due to increased human activities in coastal areas and variation in climatic conditions peter 2012 therefore knowledge of the dominant sources and long term changes of dissolved nutrients in coastal ecosystems are essential for cognition of the evolution and nutrient pollution management in coastal areas generally the impact of human activities on nutrient enrichment is getting less attention in small coastal ecosystems particularly in rapidly developing economies of nations in south asia smith et al 2010 peter 2012 smaller coastal ecosystems respond to seasonal changes compared to large systems and natural and anthropogenic influences are rapid tay et al 2012 macro tidal induced short term nutrient concentration changes in small subtropical estuaries exceed those of seasonal and sub seasonal scales kaiser et al 2013 on a seasonal scale urban sewage incidents or floods affect nutrient concentrations in small systems gong et al 2020 thus single or few seasonal investigations do not accurately reveal the main nutrient sources in these systems seasonal problems may exist although many studies utilize isotope techniques to identify the main sources of nutrients in coastal systems shuler et al 2019 therefore long term continuous survey data are needed to analyze how human activities and nature affect the composition and dynamics of nutrients in small coastal systems qinzhou bay qzb is located in beibu gulf northern south china sea fig 1 it is a protected mangrove ecosystem for sousa chinensis and tachypleus tridentatus liao et al 2019 fu et al 2019 moreover its economy is underdeveloped relative to the temperate estuaries and bays in china major estuaries and bays in this area have been affected by diverse human activities e g agriculture aquaculture land reclamation wastewater discharge coal combustion etc wu et al 2017 li et al 2018 nutrient overload has been most pronounced during the last 10 years in qzb and the adjacent coastal waters yang et al 2015 2017 li et al 2018 in the winter of 2015 severe phaeocystis globosa bloom blocked the cooling seawater supply of the nuclear power located in qzb which led to a substantial economic loss and security concerns li et al 2019 most of the studies in qzb have focused on its trophic status yang et al 2017 li et al 2018 however studies investigating the primary sources of nutrient overload have been largely ignored the lack of long term nutrient data makes assessing the ecological effects and associated risks of anthropogenic activities in the bay difficult in this study multiple season data including 27 and 60 surveys of riverine and coastal nutrients from 2011 to 2018 in the qzb were collected the primary objectives were to 1 identify the content and composition of dissolved inorganic nutrients 2 analyze the main factors affecting seasonal and spatial fluctuation of nutrients and 3 assess the ecological risk resulting from the long term variations of nutrient concentrations and compositions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the qzb is a bay drowned valley located in the northern beibu gulf south china sea fig 1 it is a semi enclosed bay consisting of the maowei sea mws 135 km2 and qinzhou gang qzg about 200 km2 the average depth range of the bay is approximately 5 7 m with homogeneously mixed freshwater depending on the seasonal input in addition the macro tides range is 2 1 4 7 m the ring bay receives water from the maoling river mlr length 179 km drainage area 2959 km2 and qinjiang river qjr length 112 km drainage area 2457 km2 the catchment areas are dominated by forest lands and agricultural activities tian et al 2015 all these may have a profound impact on the coastal aquatic environment frequent heavy rain between may and september accounts for 70 of annual precipitation fig 2 a in contrast rainfall is low between october and april accordingly the seasons are roughly divided into wet may to september and dry october to april following the rainfall observed during this study the coastal population is 1 2 million the qzb has been rapidly urbanized in recent decades with the gross domestic product in 2017 nearly seven times that in 2005 and has witnessed relatively small population fluctuations fig 2b the sanitary sewer systems are inadequate in covering municipal communities and few sanitary sewer systems serving suburban areas drain wastewaters into the qjr and mljr due to rapid urbanization in addition the mws is covered by many floating rafts and bottom sowing aquaculture for oysters and fish breeding land reclamation from the sea in the qzg for industrial developments and coastal city construction has reached 55 km2 during the recent 10 years 2 2 sample collection and analysis five liters of surface water used for din dip and dsi determination were collected from the river sections to the sea and coastal areas in 2011 2018 by the specialized and skilled survey team of the oceanic administration of qinzhou sea surface temperature and salinity were measured in situ using an advanced portable multiparameter aquaprobe ap 2000 aquaread broadstairs uk in addition 15 and 22 seasonal surveys were independently conducted in mws and qinzhou harbor respectively and 23 periodic samplings were conducted in the qjr and mlr sections when salinity was 2 fig 1 table 1 only nutrient data from 11 surveys involved in the qjr estuary during 2011 2014 were also collected for regional comparison fig 1 table 1 sampling and sample analysis was conducted following the national standard of china gb 17378 4 2007 in chinese din and dip were measured spectrophotometrically using n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine and phosphomolybdenum blue methods respectively the hypobromite oxidation method was employed to determine ammonium indirectly kaiser et al 2013 the concentration of din was calculated as the sum of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n the standard error se calculated as the sum of the error contributions was 0 5 for din and dip respectively daily precipitation and water temperature were obtained from the qinzhou hydrometeorology station fig 1 2 3 data and statistical analysis data on gross domestic product and population were obtained from the qinzhou statistical bureau the spss 19 0 software was used for statistical data analysis some historical data on din dip and dsi were from references lu et al 2020 the student s t test was used to evaluate the differences between tested groups and pearson correlation was applied to reveal the relationship of tested variables the significant level in all statistical analyses was accepted using a p 0 05 value 2 4 nutrient budgets a box model devised by the land ocean interactions in the coastal zone and widely used for nutrient budgets in estuaries and coastal waters was employed to construct water and nutrient budgets liu et al 2011 li et al 2013 dan et al 2019 this model treats a system of interest as a single and steady box in brief the water mass balance was estimated as follows 1 v r v in v out v q v p v g v w v e where vr is the residual flow vin and vout are the inflow and outflow of water from the system of interest respectively vq vp vg vw and ve are the river discharge precipitation groundwater wastewater and evaporation respectively the freshwater salinity was treated as 0 vq vp vg vw and ve thus the salt balance can be derived 2 v x s 1 s 2 v r s r where sr s 1 s 2 2 s 1 and s 2 are the average salinity of the system of interest and the adjacent system respectively vx is the mixing flow between the two systems the total water exchange time τ of the system of interest was estimated from the vs vr vx vs refers to the volume of the system the non conservative fluxes of nutrient elements δy can be derived based on water budgets and nutrient concentrations 3 δ y o u t f l u x inf l u x v r c r v x c x v q c q v p c p v g c g v w c w where cr is the average element concentration in the residual flow boundary equating to c 1 c 2 2 cx is the mixing flow equating to c 1 c 2 and cq cp cg and cw are the average element concentrations in river discharge precipitation groundwater and wastewater respectively c 1 and c 2 are the average element concentrations of the system of interest and the adjacent system respectively a negative or positive sign for δy suggests that the system of interest is a sink or a source respectively 3 results 3 1 contents structure and spatiotemporal characteristics of nutrients in the rivers qjr was enriched in din relative to dip table 2 the din and dip contents were 22 186 μm mean 94 0 47 8 μm and 0 16 1 90 μm mean 1 1 0 5 μm respectively the high din contents led to high din dip ratios which ranged from 19 to 953 with an average of 160 235 in the qjr compared to the qjr the din and dip contents occurred in a relatively small 3 117 μm and large 0 10 4 52 μm range with a mean of 55 4 34 1 μm and 8 1 1 μm respectively with a low din dip ratio at a range of 4 393 mean 61 90 in the mlr no3 accounted for 5 92 of din with an average concentration of 61 4 46 3 μm and 35 7 27 5 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively nh4 accounted for 6 90 and 4 90 of din with an average level of 30 5 14 9 μm and 17 4 11 9 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively meanwhile the no2 contents were low 25 of din with average concentrations of 5 1 4 0 μm and 2 3 1 6 μm in the qjr and mlr respectively statistically t test pooled seasons the qjr had significant higher nitrate p 0 05 nitrite p 0 01 ammonium p 0 05 and din p 0 01 levels but significant lower dip levels p 0 01 compared with the mlr the nutrient concentration in the rivers varied seasonally and yearly fig 3 a the no2 variation in the mlr and dip in the qjr were weak the no3 contents increased from the dry to the wet season in the qjr except for a high level in march 2016 however the dip contents decreased from the dry to the wet season in the mlr no3 also has similar distributional trends in both rivers dip and no3 had no clear seasonality in the qjr and mlr respectively nevertheless dip had statistically higher concentrations in the dry season in qjr pooled seasons p 0 05 while no3 had no significant difference between seasons in the mlr nh4 concentrations also showed no seasonal difference in the rivers meanwhile significant but weakly positive correlations were found between no3 and no2 p 0 05 r2 0 18 and between nh4 and dip p 0 05 r2 0 16 in the rivers suggesting source commonality 3 2 contents structure and spatiotemporal characteristics of nutrients in the qzb nutrient transports from the mws to the qzg have been most pronounced by many seasonal studies in the qzb yang et al 2012 2013 lai et al 2013 ma et al 2013 nutrient concentrations were significantly high in the mws than in the qzg except for no2 pooled data 2011 2017 p 0 01 for no3 din and dip and p 0 05 for nh4 table 2 as a small subarea of the qzb the mws is largely influenced by the freshwater input from the qjr and mlr all nutrients had higher concentrations in the qjr than in the mws pooled all data in 2011 2014 p 0 01 for no3 and no2 and p 0 01 for nh4 in contrast dip contents were significantly lower in the qjr p 0 05 indicating that qjr contributed less dip the average dip in the mws was near twice the average in the qjr and even surpassed the levels in any season in the qjr fig 3b the spatial characteristics of nutrients with salinity in the wet and dry seasons are shown in fig 4 in the mws salinity varied from 0 to 28 and 10 to 30 in the wet and dry seasons no3 showed a conservative behavior in the dry season while no2 and nh4 exhibited either conservative or non conservative behaviors depending on the years the concentrations of n nutrients were almost stable at a salinity 5 during the wet season in the mws indicating their additions with the mixing dilution a sharp decline in nh4 which corresponded to an abrupt increase of no2 in the wet season of 2016 and high no2 as nh4 declines in the dry season of 2012 in the mws may be indicative of strong nitrification wu et al 2017 no mixing dilutions along the salinity gradient were found for dip in the dry and wet seasons in the mws in qzg the salinity varied from 10 to 30 and 20 to 30 in the wet and dry seasons respectively the contents of no3 and no2 showed similar rapid mixing dilution in the wet season dip also exhibited mixing dilution in the wet season except in 2013 in the qzg no apparent trend was found for nh4 all nutrients showed almost an uncertain spatial distribution in the dry season of different years in the qzg 3 3 spatial temporal variation characteristics of nutrients the seasonality of nutrient concentrations was weak in the mws and qzg except for increasing concentration trends of no2 from the dry to wet seasons fig 3b seasonal variability was up to 4 5 and 17 fold for no2 and no2 respectively in the wet season of 2013 no3 and no2 showed up to 8 7 fold variability in the wet season of 2015 indicating that the bay responded rapidly to both natural and anthropogenic factors low salinity with correspondingly high levels of no3 in september 2015 and august 2013 in mws and qzg respectively suggested high freshwater input the minimum salinity also corroborated with the higher and even the highest no2 and nh4 concentrations however the lack of significant correlation between no3 and salinity indicates that freshwater input may not always be a dominant factor enhancing the contents of no3 where a weak negative correlation was observed between salinity and no2 p 0 05 r 2 0 26 and nh4 p 0 05 r 2 0 28 in the mws in the qzg salinity showed significant weak and insignificant negative correlations with no2 p 0 01 r 2 0 60 no3 p 0 01 r 2 0 28 and nh4 p 0 05 r 2 0 786 respectively reflecting the differences in the nutrient responses from freshwater input meanwhile strong positive correlation was observed between no2 and nh4 in the mws p 0 01 r 2 0 47 and between no2 and no3 in the qzg p 0 0001 r 2 0 60 implying possible commonality in their sources no significant correlations were found between dip with salinity or other nutrients in the mws and the qzg statistically pooled data by season no3 and no2 showed higher concentrations in the wet season in the mws p 0 01 for no2 and p 0 01 for no2 and the qzg p 0 05 for no3 and p 0 01 for no2 table 2 the nh4 concentrations were significantly higher in the wet season in the mws p 0 0001 but were comparable between the wet and dry seasons in the qzg table 2 unlike din dip exhibited significantly lower levels in the wet season of the mws p 0 05 and the qzg p 0 01 which resulted in significantly lower din dip ratios in the dry season in the mws p 0 01 and qzg p 0 01 table 2 thus the mws and qzg generally had p limitation and re emission in the wet and dry seasons moreover the mws showed n limitation in the dry season during the study period fig 4 3 4 annual variations of dissolved nutrients the annual variabilities of din and dip were analyzed based on the collected and published data during similar seasons in the qzb fig 5 qzb showed a low din level relative to a high dip level in 1983 1984 din concentrations fluctuated at 15 μm lower concentrations during 1995 1998 and increased to 25 μm before the rapid urbanization and during the industrialization period respectively dip concentrations showed a staged increase with a mean of 0 2 0 4 1 2 and 2 2 μm in 1990 2001 2002 2010 2011 2015 and 2016 2017 respectively dsi concentrations in years were stable with an average of 46 3 4 6 μm following the available data in the bay the areal yield rates of din and dip in the two river basins were estimated by the product of nutrient concentrations with the river discharge divided by the drainage area fig 6 the din dip ratios decreased exponentially p 0 01 with an increase in the atomic ratios of dip to dsi fig 7 a this pattern is similar to the result of the atomic ratios of din to dip versus dip to dsi in large estuaries and embayment of china which indicates changes in primary production with nutrient transport in the coastal environment when the urbanization develops to a certain extent liu et al 2009 the calculated din dip dsi din and dsi dip ratios were plotted as a log log plot and the four quadrants were labeled following the redfield ratio fig 7b d according to the results qzb was declining in din dip and dsi dip ratios with changes in time scales causing nutrient limitation for phytoplankton growth as n limitation increased 3 5 budgets of nutrients in the maowei sea the relative importance of external nutrient inputs versus physical mixing and biogeochemical processes was further assessed in the mws the water and salt budget for the mws system is shown in fig 8 freshwater inputs of rivers vq were the average seasonal runoffs table 2 the precipitation input vp was calculated by multiplying the average precipitation in seasons and the system area 135 km2 and the evaporative output ve was from the estimation of the evaporation per square kilometers in the subtropical daya bay with near latitude liu et al 2009 the groundwater input vg in the wet and dry seasons was estimated at 15 of the mixing flux of fresh groundwater and recirculated seawater measured in june 2016 and march 2017 respectively chen et al 2018a chen et al 2018b this rough estimation may be overestimated because the percentage of recirculated seawater is higher than 85 in many cases liu et al 2017 wang et al 2015a c the wastewater discharges vw in the wet and dry seasons were derived from the measurements around the mws in may september and november 2018 thus the net water output of the studied system has a residual flow vr of 25 1 106 and 11 7 106 m3 day 1 in the wet and dry seasons respectively following the water mass balance fig 8 based on the salt balance the water exchange vx between the mws and the qzg is 28 9 106 and 33 5 106 m3 day 1 in the wet and dry seasons respectively the volume of the mws vs is 6 8 108 m3 135 km2 with an average depth of 5 m and the estimated total water exchange time τ is 12 6 and 15 0 days in the wet and dry seasons respectively calculated from the ratio vs vr vx nutrient budgets were estimated following the water mass balance and nutrient concentrations in the specific freshwater riverine nutrient concentrations were based on the statistical means of 2011 2017 table 2 groundwater nutrient concentrations in the wet season refer to the measurements in june 2018 chen et al 2018a which were comparable to the riverine concentrations means of qjr and mlr in table 2 except for the low no2 content thus groundwater nutrient concentrations in the dry season are assumed to be the same as the riverine input due to the absence of available data as was explicitly mentioned by tri et al 1999 and employed in the beibu gulf by wan et al 2003 nutrient concentrations in wastewaters around the mws measured in may september and november 2018 were also used in this study while nutrient concentrations in precipitation referred to the measurements in the nanliu estuary beibu gulf kaiser et al 2013 with respect to nutrient concentrations and the water mass balance the seasonal nutrient budgets of the mws system are shown in table 3 the mws appeared to be a sink of n nutrients except for no2 in the dry season and a dip source 4 discussion 4 1 factor effects on the nutrient variation in river nutrient data were scarce in the qjr and the mlr average concentrations of din in the qjr and the mlr were within the range of the average global levels 52 μm and polluted water 110 μm while the average values of dip in the qjr were within the range of pristine 0 5 μm and clean water 1 4 μm levels which surpassed the clean water level in the mlr table 2 like other tropical rivers in china the high din and low dip concentrations resulted in high din dip ratios in the two rivers liu et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 dan et al 2019 compared with the global riverine data fig 6 the area yield rate of din ranked high and medium in the qjr and mlr respectively and the area yield rate of dip was classed as medium level which was comparable to other small tropical rivers e g jiulong river and the wanquan river howarth et al 1996 peierls et al 1991 wen et al 2008 li et al 2013 wu et al 2017 small rivers are more prone to pollution than large rivers because of their weak hydrodynamic forces and poor pollutant carrying capacity but they are often not concerned because of their small size hao et al 2021 the yangtze pearl and yellow rivers are major rivers in china and the world with runoffs over 50 times the mlr and the qjr however the areal yield rates of din and dip in the qjr watershed were 2 9 and 2 6 0 5 and 0 8 and 14 8 and 86 8 times the rates reported for the yangtze river wang et al 2015a c the pearl river strokal et al 2015 and the yellow river watersheds wu et al 2021 respectively moreover the areal yield rates of din and dip in the mlr watershed were 1 6 and 4 3 0 3 and 1 3 and 8 6 and 139 times the corresponding rates reported for the yangtze river wang et al 2015a c the pearl river strokal et al 2015 and the yellow river watersheds respectively wu et al 2021 these findings indicate that small rivers are more easily affected by human activities than the major river systems and must require more attention in the future high nitrate dominated din concentrations in rivers are usually attributed to leaching from agriculture and domestic activities over the drainage basins particularly to the washout of fertilizers not utilized by target plants liu et al 2011 bu et al 2011 kaiser et al 2013 the qjr basin is dominated by agricultural land relative to the mlr fig 1 rice and sugarcane are the main cash crops cultivated in spring and summer and harvested in autumn thus significantly higher concentrations of din in the qjr than in the mlr p 0 01 table 2 reveal the influence of agriculture and the general increase in din concentration trend from dry season to wet season in the qjr fig 4a is a result of the extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers as well as enhanced runoff which increases riverine nutrient concentrations during the wet season falco et al 2010 tay et al 2012 the lack of significant differences p 0 05 in din concentrations between the qjr and the mlr in the dry season may be a result of the fallow state of cultivation and weak precipitation table 2 in addition the wide range of nh4 concentrations 6 90 and 4 90 of din in the qjr and the mlr averaging 35 respectively indicates that sewage effluents also influence the rivers due to the inadequate sanitary sewer system in the drainage area high nh4 levels were also found early in the qjr zhang 1996 and chen et al 2016 reported that urban effluents livestock and rural life were the primary pollution source of nh4 in the mlr other uncertain sources only occupied 22 1 emptying through qinzhou city with a higher population density fig 1 the qjr indeed showed higher nh4 concentrations than the mlr p 0 05 table 2 the discharges from urban rural life and livestock must be less regulated by seasons which are revealed by the insignificant difference p 0 05 of nh4 concentrations between wet and dry seasons in both the qjr and mlr table 2 the dip concentrations showed minimum seasonal fluctuation and lower values in the qjr than in the mlr fig 4 table 2 phosphorous is more difficult to be leached away from drainage basins than nitrogen liu et al 2009 dip concentrations decreased from the dry to wet seasons in the mlr fig 4a they were significantly lower in the wet season than in the dry season in the qjr p 0 05 table 2 which suggests that the dip concentrations became diluted in the rivers during the wet season 4 2 factor effects on the nutrient variation in mws the estuaries and bays in china have generally suffered high pollution of dissolved inorganic nutrients the beibu gulf was considered a relatively clean water body in the context of nutrient pollution however this study illustrates that intensive human activities have affected the coastal waters in recent years the average concentrations of din and dip increased by 67 and 150 respectively during the rapid urbanization period in the qzb fig 2b and fig 5 moreover the concentration trend of dip appeared to be on the rise fig 5b according to the chinese water quality classification gb 3097 1997 qzb must be regarded as highly polluted with din and extreme dip concentrations compared to major chinese bays liu et al 2009 this study reveals that intensive economic activities may still significantly impact the coastal ecosystems e g the imbalance of nutrients in the developing coastal areas despite the current advances in coastal nutrient management and techniques high nutrient concentrations in estuaries and bays were mainly attributed to the inputs of anthropogenic sources through rivers wet deposition groundwater and wastewater inputs padedda et al 2010 chen et al 2018b the mws is considered the main area which receives external nutrients input in the bay nutrient input except for nh4 by atmospheric deposition flux was 10 of the riverine influx in the wet season 17 6 table 3 nutrient fluxes from aquaculture wastewater are negligible relative to riverine input consistent with nanliu estuary beibu gulf kaiser et al 2013 mws eutrophication was also mainly attributed to riverine nutrient inputs by previous studies lan et al 2012 the concentrations of din and dip in the rivers entering the mws were at a medium level compared with other rivers but din and dip showed contrasting behavior between the wet and dry seasons which are mainly affected by rainfall rainfall in the wet season accounts for 80 of the annual rainfall suggesting that concentrations of din and dip became diluted in the rivers and qzb during the wet season however other factors such as basin area industrial structure and geological structure may also play a role hao et al 2021 according to figs 3 and 5 the din concentration in the river decreased yearly while the din concentration in mws increased from 2011 to 2018 the din concentration in the river was 3 6 times higher than in the mws table 3 this indicates that rivers and other sources contributed to din concentrations in the mws for example chen et al 2018a c reported that groundwater derived nutrients i e din and dip were 1 9 and 0 9 times the amounts delivered through riverine input in summer 2016 in the mws similar conclusions for groundwater derived nutrient fluxes over riverine inputs have been reported in other studies e g zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 in this study the inputs of din and dip through groundwater influx were nearly 50 of the amounts delivered by rivers i e the sum of input by the qjr and mlr table 3 although the possible overestimation of groundwater mass may likely contribute to overestimated nutrient fluxes groundwater discharge serves as a significant source when nutrient additions with low salinity were generally observed in the mws in the wet season fig 3 din was almost conservative in the dry season indicating that riverine input acted as the dominant din source in the dry season fig 3 therefore riverine input is concluded to be the most significant nutrient source over the year followed by groundwater influx in the study area coincidentally the total annual riverine flux of din i e the sum of the input from qjr and mlr exhibited an excellent linear relationship with the annual variation of din concentration in the qzb during the study period fig 9 groundwater derived fluxes have been reported to respond to precipitation rapidly wang et al 2015a c terrestrial hydraulic gradients were also found to play significant roles in the discharge of fresh groundwater from terrestrial sources which have been extensively reported to significantly impacts tidal ranges and aquifer recharge michael et al 2011 gonneea et al 2013 wang and du 2016 thus conducting more measurements for groundwater nutrient fluxes especially during the flood tide in the study area is necessary despite the possible overestimation in groundwater nutrient flux the mws still appears as a significant dip source system surpassing the riverine and groundwater fluxes table 3 this result indicates that other important sources of dip inputs other than the rivers may exist significantly lower levels in the wet season than in the dry season in the bay p 0 05 for the mws p 0 01 for the qzg table 2 imply that the sources are related to point sources due to the possible dilution effect in the wet season the lower dip levels in the qinjiang mouth qjm than that in the mws suggests the sources are not produced in the qjm p 0 05 based on four sub seasonal surveys march june september and december lai et al 2013 reported the peak values of dip concentrations in the qzb near the maoling river mouth fig 0 1 where severe dip pollution was pronounced almost during the whole year in 2016 and 2017 by in situ monitoring moreover yang et al 2019 also observed the highest concentrations of exchangeable p in the sediment of the stations in this region indicating its strong origins in the overlying water zhuang et al 2014 thus the strong sources are probably related to the industries situated along the end of mlr which may have enhanced dip concentrations of the monitored mlr sections through the rising tide this shows that the mlr had higher dip discharge concentrations than the qjr in the previous analysis where riverine dip input to the sea was mainly attributed to urban and rural wastewater 4 3 impact of nutrient variation on the ecological environment of the mws seasonal nutrient transports are uncertain in the mws due to the rapid response to diverse human and natural factors for example extreme storm and precipitation events can result in more frequent short term variations of nutrient inputs shifts in nutrient ratios may occur due to the different reactions of nutrient species to the events kaiser et al 2013 these modifications can introduce complicated changes in coastal ecosystem composition and increase the risks of harmful algal blooms hallegraeff 2010 griffith and gobler 2020 this study demonstrates the complexities where runoff events significantly increased n nutrient concentrations but seasonal freshwater inputs played a limited role in increased nitrate concentrations in the mws as previously mentioned the different primary sources of din and dip in the qzb contribute to the seasonal variation of the din dip ratio the qzb is dominated by p limitation din dip ratios 16 in the wet season while the p limitation was relieved in the dry season due to the reduced din concentrations versus the stable dip concentrations fig 3 this may promote high primary production in the dry season five algal blooms have been recorded in the qzb and the adjacent waters since 2011 liu et al 2011 four of them were p globosa occurring in the dry season the frequent algal blooms in the dry season are speculated to be likely related to the alleviation of p limitation because nutrient ratios are far more critical regulators in the red tide increase yuasa et al 2020 it is believed that no report of algal blooms existed before the rapid urbanization in the qzb previous studies suggested that p limitation dominated the qzb and adjacent waters due to the relatively high din concentrations lai et al 2013 ma et al 2013 li et al 2018 however more extensive data in this study shows that the rapid rise in dip has led to improved p limitation in recent years fig 8 the growth of p globosa requires high concentrations of nutrients yang et al 2019 its growth rates in low phosphorus conditions were much lower than in high phosphorus waters hu et al 2008 and were rarely affected by n limitation due to its high competition for various inorganic and organic nitrogen sources qin et al 2012 moreover p limitation favored the decrease in p globosa bloom li et al 2015 and phosphorous played a more vital role than nitrogen in forming heavy mucous aggregates for p globosa mari et al 2005 thus p globosa blooms may be intensified in the future due to din enrichment with the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the bay 5 conclusions this study highlighted the effects of increased anthropogenic activities on nutrient dynamics in typical coastal water located in the developing coastal region of south asia the main conclusions are as follows 1 increased anthropogenic activity is particularly evident in the qzb where the trophic status is largely influenced due to rapid urbanization with frequent occurrence of harmful blooms in the dry seasons in recent decades the average din concentration increased by 67 during the rapid urbanization 2006 2017 whereas dip increased by 150 in the qzb din was mainly transported by rivers followed by groundwater input to the qzb high din concentrations in the rivers were primarily related to agriculture and urban and rural effluents due to inadequate sanitary sewer systems in the study area 2 mws appeared to be a din sink system but a strong source system for dip which surpassed riverine input even though nutrient input from groundwater may have been overestimated the result indicated a strong external dip source probably related to the industries located in the maoling river mouth the differences in the primary sources between din and dip resulted in a seasonal statistical discrepancy in the din dip ratios which indicated that p limitation generally occurred in the wet season and was relieved in the dry season due to the reduction of din discharge and stable dip concentrations the relief in p limitation in the dry season may be critical for the frequent algal blooms which could intensify in the future due to the rapid increase in dip concentrations in the study area 3 the data in the current study denotes the latest trophic status in this qzb and provides a robust interpretation of the primary sources of nutrients and ecological risks from anthropogenic factors in the beibu
