heathershaw 1974 and coastal regions heathershaw and thorne 1985 limited studies have been carried out in large shallow lakes being distinct from the marine environment hydrodynamic conditions in large shallow lakes are often controlled by combined wind waves and lake flow and the shallow suggests that the wind induced shear stress on the water surface can easily be transferred onto the bed without much damping moreover a long wind fetch also increases the effect of wind waves these factors will enhance the turbulence of bottom environment and result in significant sediment resuspension therefore it is important to conduct the relevant researches in large shallow lakes the present study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension using the

32 120 36 10 e which is the third largest freshwater lake in china is a large shallow eutrophic lake in the yangtze delta it covers an area of 2338 km2 and possesses a yearly volume around 4 43 billion m3 with a mean water depth of 1 9 m lake taihu not only bears important ecological functions but also provides water and fishery resources for surrounding cities however there exists frequent algal blooms in taihu for several decades qin et al 2007 stone 2011 wu et al 2015 and one important factor in excessive nutrient loadings is sediment resuspension qin 2009 qin et al 2006 wu et al 2016 yuan et al 2009 to embody spatial heterogeneity two monitoring sites fig 1 with different hydrodynamic conditions were selected in lake taihu i e pingtai shan and east taihu bay pingtai shan site1 31 13 46 n 120 06 31 e is located in the central zone of lake taihu where the bottom sediment layer is relatively thin and the current waves interaction is strong east taihu bay site2 30 59 56 n 120 26 35 e is in east taihu with many aquicolous plants where the bottom sediment layer is relatively thick and lake current is the dominant hydrodynamic force due to the large outflow 2 2 field observation the field observation was conducted within the period of july 22 31 2014 in pingtai shan and june 4 12 2015 in east taihu bay equipment of sontek adv ocean 5 m hz campbell obs 3a and ph ii handheld weather station were selected to get high frequency and synchronous data three dimensional velocity data and echo intensity ei were obtained by using adv with the sampling frequency of 10 hz in pingtai shan and 8 hz in east taihu bay the turbidity data was obtained by obs 3a with bursting interval of 1 min both adv and obs 3a were mounted at 5 cm above the lakebed and at the same time water samples were collected for suspended sediment concentrations ssc assay 2 3 data processing 2 3 1 data series selection and pre processing in this paper 512 s observation periods under 3 0 2 m s wind speed were selected for analysis at both sites the selected wind directions were also relatively stable which could guarantee a similar wind field at the two sites during the series significant wave heights of site1 and site2 were 0 276 m and 0 214 m respectively and the mean water depths at the two sites were 3 15 m and 2 m respectively the three dimensional velocity data were measured in the east north and vertical directions by adv in this research the horizontal flow directions in east and north was redistributed into the mainstream u and the transverse flow v based on statistics w represented the vertical velocity upward is positive direction for the purpose of good data quality it needed pre processing checking of initial signals the removal of the outliers which signal to noise ratio snr were less than 40 db or correlation coefficient were smaller than 70 and lastly patching of the missing data by linear interpolation using the neighboring points when the time fraction of missing data was less than 1 to extract the turbulence components u v w the mean flow velocities u v w were subtracted from the instantaneous flow field of each component u v w which was estimated by applying a moving average as a low pass filter kassem et al 2015 1 u u u v v v w w w where u v w means the velocity fluctuation in mainstream transverse and vertical directions respectively previous studies reported a simple logarithmic relationship between near bed ssc and echo intensity ei recorded by adv voulgaris and meyers 2004 yuan et al 2009 obs mounted at the same height with adv was used to calibrate ei and the water samples were used to convert obs turbidity ntu to ssc mg l fig 2 manifests a strong relationship r 0 94 between the turbidity values and ssc in the water samples therefore correlation coefficient r between log10 ssc and ei is calculated as 0 84 therefore the high frequency of ssc values 10 hz in pingtai shan and 8 hz in east taihu bay can be obtained which are sufficient for the study 2 3 2 reynolds stress the time series of reynolds stress was calculated as 2 rs ρ u w 2 3 3 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis was used to determine the interactions between turbulent bursts and sediment motion strom and papanicolaou 2007 willmarth and lu 1972 the bursting process was classified into four types of events depending on the velocity fluctuations in mainstream and vertical directions heathershaw 1974 liu and bai 2014 the quadrant analysis categorizes the bursting events into four quadrants as follows 1 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q1 a weak outward interaction of fluid away from the boundary high speed fluid reflected by the wall 2 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q2 an ejection of low speed fluid away from the boundary 3 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q3 a weak inward interaction of fluid toward the boundary low speed fluid being pushed back 4 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q4 a sweep or inrush of high speed fluid toward the boundary theoretically quadrant analysis should only consider intense fluctuations because small fluctuations balance each other out and are less important in momentum flux processes mohajeri et al 2016 the conditional sampling excludes the effect of small scale turbulence on the reynolds stresses because only events greater than the threshold are counted as contributors the hyperbolic threshold hole can distinguish the extreme events from the smaller fluctuations the threshold is a portion of reynolds shear stress k u w where k is a constant coefficient known as hole size and it takes k 1 0 in present study as suggested by previous literatures bogard and tiederman 1986 duan et al 2011 mohajeri et al 2016 the fractional contributions to the total reynolds shear stress from different magnitudes events of each quadrant can be calculated by the equation where n is the number of events and the indicator function xq is defined as follows 4 xq 1 u w k u 2 w 2 0 u w k u 2 w 2 horizontal turbulent velocity fluctuations u and vertical turbulent velocity fluctuations w defined by eq 1 were used for statistical analysis and quadrant analysis in this study the contribution of each quadrant to the sediment flux is calculated as follow 5 c 0 t x q c w d t c w t o t a l where c is the fluctuation of ssc calculated by moving average approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 turbulence characteristics at the two sites the theory of turbulence bursting was applied to explore the mechanism of sediment resuspension in different hydrodynamic conditions of lake taihu fig 3 presents the fluctuations of streamwise and vertical velocities u w sediment concentration c instantaneous reynolds stress u w and vertical sediment fluxes c w at the two sites in the observation period of 512 s in fig 3a u varies from 1 4 to 1 6 cm s with an average streamwise velocity u of 4 34 cm s u is as large as 6 39 cm s at the east bay site which is nearby the entrance of taipu river that has a discharge of approximately 300 m3 s fig 1 fig 3b indicates u fluctuates from 1 8 to 2 0 cm s the average vertical velocity w is smaller than u by an order of magnitude valuing as 0 24 and 0 12 cm s at the sites of center and east bay respectively fluctuation in w i e w ranges from 1 to 1 3 cm s at the center site and 0 6 to 0 8 cm s at the east bay site the average suspended sediment concentration ssc does not show much difference between the two sites calculated as 42 67 and 46 83 mg l at the sites of center and east bay respectively fig 3 however indicates that the c varies from 19 9 to 25 2 mg l at the center site while only ranges from 4 7 to 5 0 mg l at the east bay site fig 3 also shows the fluctuations of instantaneous reynolds stress u w and vertical sediment fluxes c w in fig 3a u w varies from 1 23 to 0 52 cm2 s2 with an average reynolds stress u w of 0 00586 cm2 s2 the value of u w at the east bay site is calculated as 0 0308 cm2 s2 and u w here fluctuates from 0 59 to 1 20 cm2 s2 the average sediment turbulent fluxes c w are as small as 0 05997 mg m2s and 0 0866 mg m2s at the central and east bay sites both u w and c w at the sites of center and east bay are very small and close to zero which indicates a long term balance of momentum and sediment fluxes the c w ranges from 93 40 to 228 72 mg m2s at the center site however fig 3b indicates that the sediment diffusion fluxes c w at the east bay site only changes from 18 55 to 22 14 mg m2s which is smaller than that in center zone by an order of magnitude although their reynolds stress u w do not distinguish much 3 2 instantaneous momentum fluxes u w and sediment turbulent fluxes c w coherent events are characterized by intermittent and many orders of magnitude events occur in random time and space cox and kobayashi 2000 godard et al 2009 yuan et al 2009 as shown in fig 3 the two blue solid lines in u w series mean two thresholds derived from eq 4 bursting events are extracted beyond these two thresholds red and blue dashed lines manifest some of the large amplitude events it could be found that the instantaneous momentum flux u w and sediment turbulent flux c w fluctuates irregularly and are interrupted by salient excursions these salient excursions correspond well which means intermittent coherent events control the suspension of sediment to a large extent yuan et al 2009 there are several patterns of sediment movement associated with coherent events 1 sediment was entrained to water column by upward events ejection and outward interaction and settled by downward events sweep and inward interaction instantaneously shown as dashed lines ②③④⑤⑦ in fig 3a and lines ②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧⑨⑩⑪⑫ in fig 3b 2 sediment suspension or settling displayed a certain time lag after a strong bursting and a large reynolds stress u w occurred thompson et al 2013 presented as lines ①⑧ with a time lag of 0 3 s in fig 3a and line ① with a 0 125 s lag in fig 3b 3 sediment suspension or settling was trigged by more than one bursting event for instance line ⑥ in fig 3a indicates a strong outward interaction which occurred after a strong sweep with a short time gap of 0 2 s during the process some sediments were carried by the sweep motion down to the bottom and was then reflected by the wall through an outward interaction resulting in more sediment being entrained upward at this moment the same mechanism could be found in the events of lines ⑨⑩ in fig 3a in addition to these three patterns an exception such as line ⑪ in fig 3a also existed which indicates a strong sediment suspension after a strong sweep motion downward with a time lag of 0 1 s the reasons may be that the sweep loosened the bottom sediment and made a large ssc after 0 1 s or there was a short event that had not been captured in this time lag cao 1997 keylock 2007 marchioli and soldati 2002 nelson et al 1995 there were in all 876 bursting events in the central site with 838 in the east bay site during the observation period the occurrence probabilities of bursting events were only 17 1 and 20 5 but they made large contributions in the momentum fluxes i e 63 9 in central zone and 64 9 in east bay in addition bursting motions contributed 46 4 to sediment suspension and 43 7 to settling in the central site while in the east bay site they contributed 39 6 to suspension and 39 0 to settling these suggested that bursting events were the main contributors in the processes of momentum and sediment exchange contributions of large u w and c w events to total momentum and sediment bursting fluxes at the two sites are summarized in fig 4 which adopted the top 30 20 and 10 values as the large amplitude bursting events for statistical analysis in the central site the top 30 20 and 10 u w events contributed as much as 53 8 41 8 and 26 5 to total momentum flux of bursting events and in the east bay site they were 52 3 41 3 and 26 7 respectively fig 4a for the sediment turbulent flux c w the top events made contributions of 67 3 54 5 and 36 0 to total bursting flux in the central zone site and 68 2 54 9 35 8 in the east bay site respectively fig 4b the results indicated the critical role of the extreme events in momentum and sediment exchange 3 3 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis is used to quantify the intermittent instantaneous reynolds stress signals as well as identify turbulence structures within a turbulent bursting sequence kassem et al 2015 mazumder et al 2009 in the present study the quadrant analysis was introduced for the categorizing of bursting motions from fig 5 a it could be realized that the time fractions of four bursting motions ejection sweep inward interaction and outward interaction in time series were only 3 4 5 9 2 5 and 5 2 in the central site however they made large contributions of 12 0 25 4 7 4 and 19 1 to reynolds stress respectively fig 5b it implied that u w was mainly generated by the ejection sweep and outward interaction events previous researches have found the largest contributions to stress through ejection and sweep motions duan et al 2011 jain et al 2015 maity and mazumder 2012 robinson 1991 as well as the outward interaction nelson et al 1995 however based on our observation at the east bay site it was observed that both inward 24 5 and outward interaction 28 0 contribute a lot to reynolds stress it might be because they possess relatively higher time fractions 7 9 and 8 2 in fig 5a besides the environment of many plants and less erosion by wind waves could also increase the roughness at this site which would improve the importance of inward and outward interactions kaftori et al 1998 papanicolaou et al 2001 for the sediment turbulent fluxes the present study omitted all c w with c 0 when c 0 especially the instantaneous ssc is very small the values of c w might be very large which are actually fake sediment turbulent fluxes for example when an ejection motion u 0 w 0 occurs a low speed fluid is ejected away from the boundary but a downward sediment flux c w might be calculated as c 0 which is unreasonable fig 5c describes the contributions of four kinds of events to sediment suspension and settling at the two sites at the central site ejection and outward interaction made contributions of 17 6 1213 4 mg m2s and 28 7 1977 0 mg m2s to sediment suspension respectively while they contributed 10 4 153 0 mg m2s and 29 2 429 8 mg m2s at the site of east bay to the settling of sediment sweep and inward interaction contributed 29 6 2036 6 mg m2s and 14 1 967 5 mg m2s at site1 11 9 144 7 mg m2s and 27 1 329 3 mg m2s at site2 respectively the dominant bursting motions to sediment fluxes at the two sites presented good consistency with the momentum analyses but the amount of sediment suspension and settling at the central site were greater than that of the east bay site the reasons were that there existed bigger vertical velocity fluctuation w and ssc fluctuation c in central zone section 3 1 while in east bay the main hydrodynamic force was the lake current all the four bursting events were weak due to the less felt impact from the wind waves the amount of upwelling flow ejection was also less at this site besides the environment of many plants there could also restrict sediment suspension 4 conclusion this study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension at two sites with different hydrodynamic conditions in lake taihu several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 in bursting processes there exist three mechanisms of sediment suspension in bottom regions a bursting motions controlled the suspension of sediment instantaneously b sediment responded to bursting motions with a time lag c more than one bursting event jointly affected the sediment suspension or settling 2 in total fluxes bursting events contributed about 64 to momentum flux 45 to sediment suspension and 40 to sediment settling with only 20 to time fraction in all bursting fluxes the extreme events of top 30 20 and 10 made contributions of approximately 53 41 and 27 to momentum flux and 68 55 and 36 to sediment flux 3 at the central site ejection sweep and outward interaction were the dominant events and made a large amount of sediment exchange while at the site of east bay inward and outward interactions dominated the exchange processes these results showed that both momentum transfer and sediment resuspension are mainly controlled by short bursts with large amplitude at the two different sites of lake taihu which supports the hypothesis put forward at the beginning of this paper i e sediment resuspension is closely related to turbulence bursting the findings of this paper reveal the relationships between turbulence bursting and sediment resuspension in large shallow lake taihu other future works may focus on higher frequency data collected by underwater particle image velocimetry uwpiv therefore one can examine the exact time lag between momentum change and sediment response it is also necessary to acquire the entire process of vortex from generation to breach including how it affects the sediment resuspension and transportation acknowledgements the

heights of site1 and site2 were 0 276 m and 0 214 m respectively and the mean water depths at the two sites were 3 15 m and 2 m respectively the three dimensional velocity data were measured in the east north and vertical directions by adv in this research the horizontal flow directions in east and north was redistributed into the mainstream u and the transverse flow v based on statistics w represented the vertical velocity upward is positive direction for the purpose of good data quality it needed pre processing checking of initial signals the removal of the outliers which signal to noise ratio snr were less than 40 db or correlation coefficient were smaller than 70 and lastly patching of the missing data by linear interpolation using the neighboring points when the time fraction of missing data was less than 1 to extract the turbulence components u v w the mean flow velocities u v w were subtracted from the instantaneous flow field of each component u v w which was estimated by applying a moving average as a low pass filter kassem et al 2015 1 u u u v v v w w w where u v w means the velocity fluctuation in mainstream transverse and vertical directions respectively previous studies reported a simple logarithmic relationship between near bed ssc and echo intensity ei recorded by adv voulgaris and meyers 2004 yuan et al 2009 obs mounted at the same height with adv was used to calibrate ei and the water samples were used to convert obs turbidity ntu to ssc mg l fig 2 manifests a strong relationship r 0 94 between the turbidity values and ssc in the water samples therefore correlation coefficient r between log10 ssc and ei is calculated as 0 84 therefore the high frequency of ssc values 10 hz in pingtai shan and 8 hz in east taihu bay can be obtained which are sufficient for the study 2 3 2 reynolds stress the time series of reynolds stress was calculated as 2 rs ρ u w 2 3 3 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis was used to determine the interactions between turbulent bursts and sediment motion strom and papanicolaou 2007 willmarth and lu 1972 the bursting process was classified into four types of events depending on the velocity fluctuations in mainstream and vertical directions heathershaw 1974 liu and bai 2014 the quadrant analysis categorizes the bursting events into four quadrants as follows 1 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q1 a weak outward interaction of fluid away from the boundary high speed fluid reflected by the wall 2 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q2 an ejection of low speed fluid away from the boundary 3 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q3 a weak inward interaction of fluid toward the boundary low speed fluid being pushed back 4 u 0 w 0 u w 0 q4 a sweep or inrush of high speed fluid toward the boundary theoretically quadrant analysis should only consider intense fluctuations because small fluctuations balance each other out and are less important in momentum flux processes mohajeri et al 2016 the conditional sampling excludes the effect of small scale turbulence on the reynolds stresses because only events greater than the threshold are counted as contributors the hyperbolic threshold hole can distinguish the extreme events from the smaller fluctuations the threshold is a portion of reynolds shear stress k u w where k is a constant coefficient known as hole size and it takes k 1 0 in present study as suggested by previous literatures bogard and tiederman 1986 duan et al 2011 mohajeri et al 2016 the fractional contributions to the total reynolds shear stress from different magnitudes events of each quadrant can be calculated by the equation where n is the number of events and the indicator function xq is defined as follows 4 xq 1 u w k u 2 w 2 0 u w k u 2 w 2 horizontal turbulent velocity fluctuations u and vertical turbulent velocity fluctuations w defined by eq 1 were used for statistical analysis and quadrant analysis in this study the contribution of each quadrant to the sediment flux is calculated as follow 5 c 0 t x q c w d t c w t o t a l where c is the fluctuation of ssc calculated by moving average approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 turbulence characteristics at the two sites the theory of turbulence bursting was applied to explore the mechanism of sediment resuspension in different hydrodynamic conditions of lake taihu fig 3 presents the fluctuations of streamwise and vertical velocities u w sediment concentration c instantaneous reynolds stress u w and vertical sediment fluxes c w at the two sites in the observation period of 512 s in fig 3a u varies from 1 4 to 1 6 cm s with an average streamwise velocity u of 4 34 cm s u is as large as 6 39 cm s at the east bay site which is nearby the entrance of taipu river that has a discharge of approximately 300 m3 s fig 1 fig 3b indicates u fluctuates from 1 8 to 2 0 cm s the average vertical velocity w is smaller than u by an order of magnitude valuing as 0 24 and 0 12 cm s at the sites of center and east bay respectively fluctuation in w i e w ranges from 1 to 1 3 cm s at the center site and 0 6 to 0 8 cm s at the east bay site the average suspended sediment concentration ssc does not show much difference between the two sites calculated as 42 67 and 46 83 mg l at the sites of center and east bay respectively fig 3 however indicates that the c varies from 19 9 to 25 2 mg l at the center site while only ranges from 4 7 to 5 0 mg l at the east bay site fig 3 also shows the fluctuations of instantaneous reynolds stress u w and vertical sediment fluxes c w in fig 3a u w varies from 1 23 to 0 52 cm2 s2 with an average reynolds stress u w of 0 00586 cm2 s2 the value of u w at the east bay site is calculated as 0 0308 cm2 s2 and u w here fluctuates from 0 59 to 1 20 cm2 s2 the average sediment turbulent fluxes c w are as small as 0 05997 mg m2s and 0 0866 mg m2s at the central and east bay sites both u w and c w at the sites of center and east bay are very small and close to zero which indicates a long term balance of momentum and sediment fluxes the c w ranges from 93 40 to 228 72 mg m2s at the center site however fig 3b indicates that the sediment diffusion fluxes c w at the east bay site only changes from 18 55 to 22 14 mg m2s which is smaller than that in center zone by an order of magnitude although their reynolds stress u w do not distinguish much 3 2 instantaneous momentum fluxes u w and sediment turbulent fluxes c w coherent events are characterized by intermittent and many orders of magnitude events occur in random time and space cox and kobayashi 2000 godard et al 2009 yuan et al 2009 as shown in fig 3 the two blue solid lines in u w series mean two thresholds derived from eq 4 bursting events are extracted beyond these two thresholds red and blue dashed lines manifest some of the large amplitude events it could be found that the instantaneous momentum flux u w and sediment turbulent flux c w fluctuates irregularly and are interrupted by salient excursions these salient excursions correspond well which means intermittent coherent events control the suspension of sediment to a large extent yuan et al 2009 there are several patterns of sediment movement associated with coherent events 1 sediment was entrained to water column by upward events ejection and outward interaction and settled by downward events sweep and inward interaction instantaneously shown as dashed lines ②③④⑤⑦ in fig 3a and lines ②③④⑤⑥⑦⑧⑨⑩⑪⑫ in fig 3b 2 sediment suspension or settling displayed a certain time lag after a strong bursting and a large reynolds stress u w occurred thompson et al 2013 presented as lines ①⑧ with a time lag of 0 3 s in fig 3a and line ① with a 0 125 s lag in fig 3b 3 sediment suspension or settling was trigged by more than one bursting event for instance line ⑥ in fig 3a indicates a strong outward interaction which occurred after a strong sweep with a short time gap of 0 2 s during the process some sediments were carried by the sweep motion down to the bottom and was then reflected by the wall through an outward interaction resulting in more sediment being entrained upward at this moment the same mechanism could be found in the events of lines ⑨⑩ in fig 3a in addition to these three patterns an exception such as line ⑪ in fig 3a also existed which indicates a strong sediment suspension after a strong sweep motion downward with a time lag of 0 1 s the reasons may be that the sweep loosened the bottom sediment and made a large ssc after 0 1 s or there was a short event that had not been captured in this time lag cao 1997 keylock 2007 marchioli and soldati 2002 nelson et al 1995 there were in all 876 bursting events in the central site with 838 in the east bay site during the observation period the occurrence probabilities of bursting events were only 17 1 and 20 5 but they made large contributions in the momentum fluxes i e 63 9 in central zone and 64 9 in east bay in addition bursting motions contributed 46 4 to sediment suspension and 43 7 to settling in the central site while in the east bay site they contributed 39 6 to suspension and 39 0 to settling these suggested that bursting events were the main contributors in the processes of momentum and sediment exchange contributions of large u w and c w events to total momentum and sediment bursting fluxes at the two sites are summarized in fig 4 which adopted the top 30 20 and 10 values as the large amplitude bursting events for statistical analysis in the central site the top 30 20 and 10 u w events contributed as much as 53 8 41 8 and 26 5 to total momentum flux of bursting events and in the east bay site they were 52 3 41 3 and 26 7 respectively fig 4a for the sediment turbulent flux c w the top events made contributions of 67 3 54 5 and 36 0 to total bursting flux in the central zone site and 68 2 54 9 35 8 in the east bay site respectively fig 4b the results indicated the critical role of the extreme events in momentum and sediment exchange 3 3 quadrant analysis quadrant analysis is used to quantify the intermittent instantaneous reynolds stress signals as well as identify turbulence structures within a turbulent bursting sequence kassem et al 2015 mazumder et al 2009 in the present study the quadrant analysis was introduced for the categorizing of bursting motions from fig 5 a it could be realized that the time fractions of four bursting motions ejection sweep inward interaction and outward interaction in time series were only 3 4 5 9 2 5 and 5 2 in the central site however they made large contributions of 12 0 25 4 7 4 and 19 1 to reynolds stress respectively fig 5b it implied that u w was mainly generated by the ejection sweep and outward interaction events previous researches have found the largest contributions to stress through ejection and sweep motions duan et al 2011 jain et al 2015 maity and mazumder 2012 robinson 1991 as well as the outward interaction nelson et al 1995 however based on our observation at the east bay site it was observed that both inward 24 5 and outward interaction 28 0 contribute a lot to reynolds stress it might be because they possess relatively higher time fractions 7 9 and 8 2 in fig 5a besides the environment of many plants and less erosion by wind waves could also increase the roughness at this site which would improve the importance of inward and outward interactions kaftori et al 1998 papanicolaou et al 2001 for the sediment turbulent fluxes the present study omitted all c w with c 0 when c 0 especially the instantaneous ssc is very small the values of c w might be very large which are actually fake sediment turbulent fluxes for example when an ejection motion u 0 w 0 occurs a low speed fluid is ejected away from the boundary but a downward sediment flux c w might be calculated as c 0 which is unreasonable fig 5c describes the contributions of four kinds of events to sediment suspension and settling at the two sites at the central site ejection and outward interaction made contributions of 17 6 1213 4 mg m2s and 28 7 1977 0 mg m2s to sediment suspension respectively while they contributed 10 4 153 0 mg m2s and 29 2 429 8 mg m2s at the site of east bay to the settling of sediment sweep and inward interaction contributed 29 6 2036 6 mg m2s and 14 1 967 5 mg m2s at site1 11 9 144 7 mg m2s and 27 1 329 3 mg m2s at site2 respectively the dominant bursting motions to sediment fluxes at the two sites presented good consistency with the momentum analyses but the amount of sediment suspension and settling at the central site were greater than that of the east bay site the reasons were that there existed bigger vertical velocity fluctuation w and ssc fluctuation c in central zone section 3 1 while in east bay the main hydrodynamic force was the lake current all the four bursting events were weak due to the less felt impact from the wind waves the amount of upwelling flow ejection was also less at this site besides the environment of many plants there could also restrict sediment suspension 4 conclusion this study analyzed the relationships between coherent structures and sediment resuspension at two sites with different hydrodynamic conditions in lake taihu several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 in bursting processes there exist three mechanisms of sediment suspension in bottom regions a bursting motions controlled the suspension of sediment instantaneously b sediment responded to bursting motions with a time lag c more than one bursting event jointly affected the sediment suspension or settling 2 in total fluxes bursting events contributed about 64 to momentum flux 45 to sediment suspension and 40 to sediment settling with only 20 to time fraction in all bursting fluxes the extreme events of top 30 20 and 10 made contributions of approximately 53 41 and 27 to momentum flux and 68 55 and 36 to sediment flux 3 at the central site ejection sweep and outward interaction were the dominant events and made a large amount of sediment exchange while at the site of east bay inward and outward interactions dominated the exchange processes these results showed that both momentum transfer and sediment resuspension are mainly controlled by short bursts with large amplitude at the two different sites of lake taihu which supports the hypothesis put forward at the beginning of this paper i e sediment resuspension is closely related to turbulence bursting the findings of this paper reveal the relationships between turbulence bursting and sediment resuspension in large shallow lake taihu other future works may focus on higher frequency data collected by underwater particle image velocimetry uwpiv therefore one can examine the exact time lag between momentum change and sediment response it is also necessary to acquire the entire process of vortex from generation to breach including how it affects the sediment resuspension and transportation acknowledgements the

7026,the most distinguished characteristic of pervious concrete is its connected porosity that allows water to percolate and the permeable capacity will decrease rapidly once the pervious concrete is clogged by the sediments despite the relationship between permeability and clogging is extensively researched there is limited information about pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements the aim of this paper is using the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method cfd dem model to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development taking into account of the porosity of pervious pavements sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity pore clogging is determined by the dl ds ratio the equivalent diameter of aggregate particles dl to equivalent diameter of sediments ds a fitted curve is utilized to depict the tendency of clogging sediments secondary movement is revealed results show that the well graded sands is able to percolate into the depth of 30 mm in pervious pavements coarse sands will settle on the shallow surface within depth of 20 mm in pervious pavements and fine sands will percolate into the depth of 60 100 mm in pervious pavements as the increase of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity the sediments will transport into pervious pavements deeply the cycle simulation of raining and draining shows it has limited influence to clogging keywords pervious pavements cfd dem simulation clogging mechanism sediments size distribution clogging depth 1 introduction pervious concrete is an environment friendly material with high porosity between 15 and 35 it has a large number of connected pores within the aggregate skeleton the permeability of pervious concrete is typically about 2 6 mm s even up to 10 mm s montes and haselbach 2006 tennis et al 2004 high permeable capacity guarantees good drainage capacity therefore pervious pavements have been applied broadly for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity fassman and blackbourn 2010 bean et al 2007 bonneau et al 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 clogging is the reduction in infiltration rate also called hydraulic conductivity permeability and leads to increased overflows and long periods of ponding razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 the pervious pavements will lose the basic function of permeable capacity once the sediments enter the space of connected pores tan et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 some authors have studied the relationship between sediments clogging and infiltration capacity of pervious concrete pavements pezzaniti et al 2009 lucke and beecham 2011 brown and borst 2013 andrés valeri et al 2016 kia et al 2017 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 baladès et al 1995 found the decrease of infiltration rates of pervious concrete caused by initial sediments could reach 50 of the original rate after 2 or 3 year kayhanian et al 2012 ct scanned cores of pervious concrete pavements and measured the permeability to assess clogging walsh et al 2014 measured the effect of sediment accumulation on the hydraulic conductivity of pervious concrete in laboratory scale kandra et al 2014 focused on the effect of physical characteristics of filter media and flow through rates on the clogging of stormwater filters razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 investigated clogging dynamic of permeable pavement systems using embedded sensors and concluded that for every 6 mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface furthermore some researches conclude that coarse sand particles do not reduce permeability significantly as these large particles are prevented from entering surface pores coughlin et al 2012 deo et al 2015 mata and leming 2012 other studies have observed that clogging sediments usually concentrate on the upper layer of the pervious pavements bean et al 2007 haselbach et al 2006 yong et al 2013 in theory mcdowell boyer et al 1986 revealed that retention of a relatively small solid volume within media pores can largely reduce media permeability tan et al 2003 derived an empirical theoretical formulation from the kozeny carmen equation in order to predict the reduction in permeability of the permeable bases moghadasi et al 2004 presented a mathematical model that simulated the porosity impairment by particle movement and deposition zheng et al 2014 developed a mathematical model correlating porosity and concentration of deposited particles for simulating porous physical clogging and provided a systematic description of the occurrence and development of physical clogging numerical simulation methods were also developed to explore the hydraulic behavior and water quality performance of pervious pavements turco et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 huang et al 2016 pieralisi et al 2017 developed and validated an advanced computational fluid dynamics coupled with discrete element method cfd dem model to assess the permeability of pervious concrete sansalone et al 2012 utilized the swmm continuous simulation of in situ permeable pavement system to measure and model filtration and hydraulic conductivity phenomena as well as maintenance requirements of permeable pavement directly loaded by urban drainage hou et al 2016 2017 used coupled navier stokes phase field model to evaluate the mechanical performance of asphalt at microscale however studies from the literature seldom revealed the pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements there is limited information on clogging depth considering the porosity of pervious pavements sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity especially the effect of raining and draining cycle the primary objective of this study is to reveal the pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements using cfd dem model and the most critical factor that determines clogging process i e the ratio between the diameter of aggregates and particle size of sediments was discussed the conclusions derived from this study can contribute to the future research on maintenance of pervious pavement this study confirms that it is possible to use cfd dem numerical model to reveal the clogging process and reduce the time and costs required an experimental simulation with the same objective and similar settings to this numerical simulation has been previously conducted by the group zhang et al 2018 2 mathematical equations in cfd dem model in the cfd dem model the flow in the whole flow region is calculated from the continuity and the navier stokes equations with a porosity term and an additional body force term used to account for the presence of particles in the fluid these are given by 1 φ t φ u 0 2 ρ φ u t u ρ φ u p μ 2 φ u f b ρ φ g 3 f b i 1 n v f fluid i where ρ is the density of the fluid φ is the porosity u is the fluid velocity p is the fluid pressure µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid g is the gravitational acceleration f b is the body force per unit volume f fluid i is the total force applied by the fluid on particle i nv is the number of particles per unit volume the porosity and body force of the fluid mesh elements are determined through dem the equations of motion for the particles have an additional force term to account for interaction with the fluid the equations are given as follow 4 m u p t f mech i f fluid i m g 5 ω t m i where u p is the particle velocity m is the particle mass f mech i is the sum of additional forces acting on the particle g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the particle angular velocity i is the moment of inertia m is the torque acting on the particle the total force applied by the fluid on particle i f fluid i consists of two parts drag force and a force resulting from the fluid pressure gradient other particle fluid forces such as the lift force is ignored in this study the resulting relationship could be expressed as 6 f fluid i f drag i 3 4 π r 3 p 7 f drag i 0 63 4 8 re p i 2 1 2 ρ π r i 2 u u p i u u p i φ χ where the φ χ term is an empirical factor accounts for the local porosity this correction term makes the force applicable to both fixed and fluidized porosity systems and a large range of reynolds numbers felice 1994 xu and yu 1997 the particle reynolds number re p i is defined as 8 re p i d s i ρ u u p i μ the empirical coefficient χ is defined as 9 χ 3 7 0 65 e x p 1 5 log 10 re p i 2 2 dem and cfd two way coupling is numerically achieved as follows eqs 1 3 are solved with the cfd code while eqs 4 9 are solved with dem code porosity and body force are determined by dem and divided by the volume from cfd the fluid velocity and fluid pressure for every element are determined by the cfd and then sent to the dem in each coupling data exchange 3 the set up of simulation study 3 1 the set up of dem simulation aggregates type and size have an important influence on porosity of pervious concrete in the experiment the cement paste will fill the pores to reduce the porosity furthermore the physical indexes of aggregates are listed in table 1 the aggregate size is 5 11 mm apparent density is 2 665 g cm3 stacking density is 1 665 g cm3 void ratio is 37 89 and crushing values is 8 6 imagej 1 52d software rasband and ferreira 2012 is used to determine the equivalent aggregate diameter and acquire the aggregate size grading curve fig 1 a shows the photo of aggregates in fig 1 b aggregates are processed by binaryzation and labelled the area of every aggregate is calculated automatically and the equivalent diameter is calculated by the equation d 2 a π where a is the area of every aggregate fig 1 c shows the measured aggregates size that ranges from 5 to 11 mm fig 1 d shows the grading curve of the aggregate used in dem simulation three kinds of aggregate particles with diameter of 4 mm 8 mm and 12 mm are determined to form the pervious pavement models the volume ratio of three kinds of particles is found to be 1 3 6 according to the experimental data and literature pieralisi et al 2016 as shown in table 2 pervious pavement models with porosity of 25 30 and 35 are created in edem software the volume of pervious pavement model is fixed and it s length width and thickness is 400 mm 30 mm and 250 mm respectively total volume of aggregates and cement paste used in pervious pavement model is calculated by the equation va vc 1 p where va is the total volume of aggregates and cement paste vc is the volume of pervious pavement p is the porosity of pervious pavement however in order to simplify this model the cement paste volume is directly incorporated into the aggregate volume using only single phase aggregate particles in pervious pavement model consequently the numbers of particle with diameter of 4 mm 8 mm 12 mm are calculated according to the fixed volume ratio at 1 3 6 in dem simulation the aggregate density is 2450 kg m3 shear modulus is 1 106 pa poisson s ratio is 0 3 gercek 2007 yang et al 2000 remond and pizette 2014 remond 2010 in particular the shear modulus is generally much smaller than the real modulus of the simulated materials to increase the time step used for simulations this leads to larger overlaps between particles but does not change the overall behaviour of clogging in pervious pavement model all these parameters are critical to influence time step in dem simulation ds ltd 2015 after the calibration of the parameters of materials all the aggregate particles are generated in edem software a slight compaction by a plate is performed to guarantee the aggregate particles interacting with each other closely the bonded particle model bpm ds ltd 2015 potyondy and cundall 2004 is applied to remedy the drawback that lacks cement paste it is added to aggregate particles to bond them as a whole pervious pavement model under the cohesive force parameters of the bpm are shown in table 3 in this study bonds are assumed as the hardened cements that have the similar material properties to the aggregates the values of normal stiffness and shear stiffness both are 2 107 n m3 these stiffness value can be obtained by many researches e g kazerani and zhao 2010 the values of normal critical stress and shear critical stress both are 5 1030 pa they are much larger than the real damage value of the concrete to prevent the erosion of the pervious pavement model as the clogging behavior is the primary goal of this study rather than the mechanical behavior kazerani and zhao 2010 and potyondy 2007 have done the parameters calibration work they calibrated the micromechanical parameters in bonded particle method and demonstrated that each material macro property i e young s modulus poisson s ratio and so on is distinctly related to the contact properties i e normal and shear stiffness and so on table 4 shows sediments gradations and properties there are three kinds of sediments including fine sands coarse sands and well graded sands these homogeneous mixtures are produced in dem simulation based on their sand grading curves obtained by field experiments the sand grading curves show the mass percent of different size of sediments passing the sieves the density shear modulus and poisson s ratio of sediments is 2650 kg m3 1 106 pa 0 3 respectively gercek 2007 the sediments are depicted in different colors to represent different sediments size in edem software for instance the sediments of size from 2 36 to 4 75 mm are depicted in pink it should be noted that the blue sediments whose size are smaller than 0 15 mm are neglected in simulation because they are too small and it consumes much time to generate them 3 2 the setup of cfd dem simulation as shown in fig 2 the cfd dem model simulates the sediments clogging development in pervious pavement in different working conditions including the horizontal runoff velocity seepage velocity porosity and sediments size distribution the commercial cfd software of fluent coupled with commercial dem software of edem to realize the connection of cfd with dem luo et al 2015 blais et al 2016 li and li 2018 in the sub models the volume of friction vof method ansys inc 2013 hirt and nichols 1981 kothe and rider 1998 is applied to observe the free surface of the water flow the inputs in cfd simulation are the air and water phases inlet water velocity and seepage velocity the outputs are the interface of phases velocity and pressure field the bpm is used to simulate the aggregates compaction and bonding process assuming some simplifications for the aggregate type and size without considering cement paste the inputs in dem simulation are sediments source such as coarse sands fine sands and well graded sands and the porosity of the pervious pavement model the outputs are the sediments distribution and the sediments velocity fig 3 a shows the cfd dem model the pervious pavement model is 400 mm length 30 mm width 250 mm thickness the water flow is considered as uniform flow because the maximum downward infiltration velocity in pervious pavement model is less than 1 of the mean run off flow velocity zhang et al 2017 in cfd dem model sediment particles attempt to percolate through the fixed and non deformable pervious pavement model under the free surface flow water level is set to 10 mm above the surface of pervious pavement model to simulate the free surface flow particle factory i e the sediments source is added above the pervious pavement model 100 mm downstream from the inlet fig 3 b shows the mesh size 3 3 the simulation cases as shown in table 5 the varied parameter of case 1 3 is the horizontal runoff velocity case 1 4 and 5 is the porosity case1 6 and 7 is the seepage velocity controlled by changing the outlet velocity case 1 8 and 9 is the sediments size distribution the case 10 repeats raining and draining periodically and the water table is going up and down periodically in simulation the first two seconds time is utilized to guarantee the stability of free surface flow then sediments are added and they start to percolate into the pervious pavement the computational time step used for the fluid is 5 0 10 4 s and for the sediments is 5 0 10 6 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 the pore clogging mechanism in the cfd dem model although the pores have different shapes from real pervious concrete they are all made up of relatively large pore chambers and relatively small pore throats in these structures particles will only be trapped in pores larger than or equal to their volume regardless of particle size fig 4 shows the sediments percolate into surface layer of pervious pavement model regions from 0 to 10 mm depth marked in blue box included all kinds of the sediments are selected to research the mechanism of pore clogging different clogging process is distinguished from the participation of large sediment particles of 2 36 4 75 mm thus clogging regions are classified into region a and b as shown in fig 5 region a includes the participation of large particles while region b does not the clogging mechanism of region a the sediments such as the pink or yellow particles first stop at a certain depth of pervious pavement and most of them stop at the shallow surface within depth of 10 mm they are hard to restart when they deposit into the pores of pervious pavement and consequently become pore skeleton this causes some pore channels of pervious pavement suddenly get narrow other small size of sediments can accumulate in these regions easily and rapidly the clogging mechanism of region b the dominant flow channels would occur since the pore structures of pervious concrete such as the size and shape are randomly distributed the seepage velocity is larger in the dominant channels thus subsequent sediments can be carried into the dominant channels and trapped there the clogging regions gradually occur and become stable only the smallest particles would continually transport into other places remond 2010 has also reported it in his study 4 2 clogging development in different layers pervious pavement model is sectioned into four layers by the depth to analyze the clogging development layer i 0 10 mm ii 10 30 mm iii 30 60 mm and iv 60 100 mm have the length of 175 mm and width of 30 mm the relationship of the volume fraction of sediments to their layers with the time is acquired to reveal the clogging development in different layers as shown in fig 6 all kinds of sediments exist in layer i the volume fractions of pink and yellow sediments are large it indicates large size particles range from 1 18 to 4 75 mm settle on shallow surface of 10 mm depth in pervious pavement in layer ii the volume fraction of sediments such as the green and black particles are comparatively larger but smaller than that of the layer i in addition pink particles did not exist in layer ii it indicates that the particles size range from 0 3 to 1 18 mm could easily percolate down to the depth of 30 mm while large size particles cannot reach the depth of 30 mm the small size sediments take a dominant place in layer iii it indicates particles size range from 0 3 mm to 1 18 mm could percolate down to the depth of 60 mm as for the layer iv little sediments exist 4 3 sediments secondary movement representative particles were manually chosen to analyze the particle position and velocity the results are presented in fig 7 it shows that 0 3 to 0 6 mm size of sediments could reach to 30 mm depth 0 15 to 0 3 mm size of sediments could reach to depth of 60 mm and farther when the slope of the curve altered suddenly in fig 7 a their vertical particle velocity alters correspondingly like impulse it indicates these particles move again however the large particles whose size range from 0 3 to 4 75 mm are not able to move again in vertical direction under the force of water flow they stop on the surface of pervious concrete pavement finally all the particles tend to be static and find an appropriate position as their vertical velocity tends to be zero after a series of fluctuations 4 4 influence of pervious concrete porosity fig 8 shows the clogging development in different layers caused by the varied porosity in well graded sands the uniform law of clogging development is revealed firstly the sediments initially percolate into layer i it leads to the volume of sediments in this layer rapidly increase and attains peak value after 3 s then the sediments in layer i transport downward to layer ii it leads to the sediments volume increase in layer ii there are little number of sediments in layer iii and there are almost no sediments in layer iv secondly fig 8 shows the volume fraction has a slight decrease in layer i and increase in layer ii in pervious pavement with porosity of 30 contrasted to the pervious pavement with porosity of 25 the volume fraction decrease in layer i and increase in layer ii evidently in pervious pavement with porosity of 35 contrasted with others it indicates that sediments transport deeply as the porosity increases 4 5 influence of sediments size distribution fig 9 shows the influence of sediments size distribution the results show that the well graded sands could reach to the depth of 30 mm coarse sands accumulate mostly within the range of 20 mm fine sands accumulate mostly within the range of 60 mm and could reach to the depth of 100 mm it shows that most clogging depth is limited to the upper 30 mm but sometimes can reach up to 100 mm under the surface in this study locations of the clogging particles can be compared and supported by previous studies baladès et al 1995 suggested that the depth of clogging is limited to the first centimeters of the permeable floor borgwardt 2006 concluded the infiltration performance is highly affected by the fines clogged in the pores within the upper 20 mm of porous paving blocks kayhanian et al 2012 analyzed the ct scanning images and concluded that generally clogging takes place at the top zone of the surface of open graded mixes especially surface layer mixes with thickness of about 25 mm zhang et al 2018 derived the same conclusions by an experimental simulation using the transparent sodium polyacrylate beads the clogging mechanisms are different depending on the ratio dl ds between the diameter of large aggregate particles forming the pervious pavement dl and that of small incoming sediments ds when dl ds is lower than 3 2 3 6 46 3 2 3 6 46 sediments are trapped inside the pores because they are too large to go through the smaller pores for larger ratios a single particle is generally not be stopped and clogging due to the arches formed when several grains attempt to go through smaller pores li and davis 2008 remond 2010 in this paper the equivalent diameter is defined as the diameter equals to 50 percent passing in grading curve the equivalent particle diameters of fine sands well graded sands and coarse sands are 0 25 1 18 and 2 2 mm acquired from sediments size distribution in table 4 the equivalent aggregate size dl is 8 mm according to the grading curve of aggregate size in fig 1d the dl ds is 32 6 78 and 3 64 respectively it means fine sands tend to form arches upon the pores and the coarse sands tend to be trapped easily on the surface of pervious pavement the coarse sands will cause the clogging of pervious pavement easily and fine sands will cause the clogging severely 4 6 influence of horizontal runoff velocity fig 10 shows the vertical velocity of sediments as horizontal runoff velocity changes the sediments vertical velocity refers to the average vertical velocity of all the same particles it indicates that sediments vertical velocity will increase as the particle size become smaller because the small size of sediments are easy to move and become the suspended matters under the force of water flow as the horizontal runoff velocities increase the curves especially the curves of black and red particles disperse this is because the sediments move rightward evidently with the effect of water flow and are able to find more pore space to percolate into the pervious pavement as the horizontal runoff velocity increases sediments will be static in vertical direction ultimately 4 7 influence of seepage velocity fig 11 shows the vertical velocity of sediments versus the seepage velocity changed by controlling the outlet velocity with the increase of the seepage velocity the vertical velocity of sediments in particular of the small size of sediments obviously increase it is not remarkable compared to the influence of horizontal velocity because the seepage velocity changed at the range of 2 6 mm s that was 100 times smaller than the horizontal runoff velocity in magnitude 4 8 influence of cycle of raining and draining fig 12 shows three cycles of raining and draining the purpose of the cycle simulation is to verify the effect of the fluctuation of water level to the sediments distribution during the 7 s the whole clogging process can be observed and after 7 s the clogging process will develop stable most sediments are able to penetrate within the depth of 60 mm during the 10 s of draining the water level in the pervious pavement model can drop to the depth of 60 mm therefore 7 s raining and 10 s draining in one cycle was enough to verify the effect of the fluctuation of water level to the sediments distribution at 2 s the initial water level is stable and the clogging materials are introduced into the pervious pavement model the clogging process will develop in the first cycle period then the cycle simulation raining and draining continued to verify the effect of the fluctuation of the water level it shows that the cycle simulation of water level fluctuation has little influence on the rapid sediments clogging development because large size of sediments are hard to move again and change their positions once the clogging happened as for the minor decrease of the volume fraction it is because the small size of sediments can penetrate downward 4 9 clogging development stages through the analysis of clogging tendency in different layers this research concludes that the depth of 0 30 mm is the most common region to be clogged by sediments the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer is normalized as shown in fig 13 the clogging development could be divided into 3 stages rapid clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable stage the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer firstly increases rapidly i e the rapid clogging stage and then falls down slightly i e the mitigation of clogging stage and finally tend to be stable stage if there are continuous supply of sediments source to simulate the clogging development the sediments volume fraction in pervious pavement will increase and finally tend to be saturated cui et al 2016 the logistic analysis and polynomial analysis are used to fit the stage 1 2 and 3 shown as follow 10 stage 1 v n 1 1 1 1 t x 0 p 11 stage 2 v n 2 a t b t c 12 stage 3 v n 3 d where v n1 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 1 v n2 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 2 t is the time s v n3 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 3 the parameters in eqs 10 12 varied by their boundary conditions take the case 1 as example the values of x 0 p a b c and d are 1 094 2 225 0 007 0 098 1 228 and 0 894 respectively under the condition of porosity 25 well graded sands and time 10 s and so on 5 conclusions this study develops a cfd dem model of sediments clogging development considering the porosity of pervious pavement sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity irregular shaped particles are arounded by the cements in reality while in this study all aggregates are assumed as single phase spheres the cement is incorporated into the aggregate despite that the cfd dem model is effective to reveal the pore clogging mechanism especially considering that the input parameters used are the same as real porous concrete two kinds of clogging mechanisms were proposed the first one includes the participation of large sediments the second one does not the first one is more likely to happen and evolves rapidly the dl ds ratio reflects the influence of the ratio of aggregate size to sediments size and the clogging mechanisms are discussed depending on the ratio dl ds sediments size distribution has a significant influence on clogging development the relationship between clogging depth and sediments size distribution is proposed the sediments clogging development in 0 30 mm layer is divided into 3 stages rapid clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable stage the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer is normalized analysis and fitted by formulas sediments secondary movement is investigated by studying the relationship between the sediments position and velocity the influences of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity on clogging development have been revealed as the increase of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity sediments could transport into pervious pavement deeply the cycle simulation of raining and draining has limited influence to the rapid clogging development the following conclusions can be derived based on above analysis the ration of dl ds of fine sands full graded sands and coarse sands is 32 6 78 and 3 64 respectively it means the coarse sands will cause the clogging of pervious pavement more easily and fine sands will cause the clogging more severely full graded sands can percolate into depth of 30 mm in pervious pavement coarse sands can percolate in depth within 20 mm fine sands can percolate into the depth of 60 mm even 100 mm sediments of size range from 1 18 to 4 75 mm is hardly to move again and sediments of size smaller than 1 18 mm is more likely to move again and become suspended substances acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the national program on key basic research project

7026,the most distinguished characteristic of pervious concrete is its connected porosity that allows water to percolate and the permeable capacity will decrease rapidly once the pervious concrete is clogged by the sediments despite the relationship between permeability and clogging is extensively researched there is limited information about pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements the aim of this paper is using the computational fluid dynamics discrete element method cfd dem model to numerically reveal the pore clogging mechanism and clogging development taking into account of the porosity of pervious pavements sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity pore clogging is determined by the dl ds ratio the equivalent diameter of aggregate particles dl to equivalent diameter of sediments ds a fitted curve is utilized to depict the tendency of clogging sediments secondary movement is revealed results show that the well graded sands is able to percolate into the depth of 30 mm in pervious pavements coarse sands will settle on the shallow surface within depth of 20 mm in pervious pavements and fine sands will percolate into the depth of 60 100 mm in pervious pavements as the increase of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity the sediments will transport into pervious pavements deeply the cycle simulation of raining and draining shows it has limited influence to clogging keywords pervious pavements cfd dem simulation clogging mechanism sediments size distribution clogging depth 1 introduction pervious concrete is an environment friendly material with high porosity between 15 and 35 it has a large number of connected pores within the aggregate skeleton the permeability of pervious concrete is typically about 2 6 mm s even up to 10 mm s montes and haselbach 2006 tennis et al 2004 high permeable capacity guarantees good drainage capacity therefore pervious pavements have been applied broadly for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity fassman and blackbourn 2010 bean et al 2007 bonneau et al 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 clogging is the reduction in infiltration rate also called hydraulic conductivity permeability and leads to increased overflows and long periods of ponding razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 the pervious pavements will lose the basic function of permeable capacity once the sediments enter the space of connected pores tan et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 some authors have studied the relationship between sediments clogging and infiltration capacity of pervious concrete pavements pezzaniti et al 2009 lucke and beecham 2011 brown and borst 2013 andrés valeri et al 2016 kia et al 2017 razzaghmanesh and beecham 2018 baladès et al 1995 found the decrease of infiltration rates of pervious concrete caused by initial sediments could reach 50 of the original rate after 2 or 3 year kayhanian et al 2012 ct scanned cores of pervious concrete pavements and measured the permeability to assess clogging walsh et al 2014 measured the effect of sediment accumulation on the hydraulic conductivity of pervious concrete in laboratory scale kandra et al 2014 focused on the effect of physical characteristics of filter media and flow through rates on the clogging of stormwater filters razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 investigated clogging dynamic of permeable pavement systems using embedded sensors and concluded that for every 6 mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface furthermore some researches conclude that coarse sand particles do not reduce permeability significantly as these large particles are prevented from entering surface pores coughlin et al 2012 deo et al 2015 mata and leming 2012 other studies have observed that clogging sediments usually concentrate on the upper layer of the pervious pavements bean et al 2007 haselbach et al 2006 yong et al 2013 in theory mcdowell boyer et al 1986 revealed that retention of a relatively small solid volume within media pores can largely reduce media permeability tan et al 2003 derived an empirical theoretical formulation from the kozeny carmen equation in order to predict the reduction in permeability of the permeable bases moghadasi et al 2004 presented a mathematical model that simulated the porosity impairment by particle movement and deposition zheng et al 2014 developed a mathematical model correlating porosity and concentration of deposited particles for simulating porous physical clogging and provided a systematic description of the occurrence and development of physical clogging numerical simulation methods were also developed to explore the hydraulic behavior and water quality performance of pervious pavements turco et al 2017 brunetti et al 2016 huang et al 2016 pieralisi et al 2017 developed and validated an advanced computational fluid dynamics coupled with discrete element method cfd dem model to assess the permeability of pervious concrete sansalone et al 2012 utilized the swmm continuous simulation of in situ permeable pavement system to measure and model filtration and hydraulic conductivity phenomena as well as maintenance requirements of permeable pavement directly loaded by urban drainage hou et al 2016 2017 used coupled navier stokes phase field model to evaluate the mechanical performance of asphalt at microscale however studies from the literature seldom revealed the pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements there is limited information on clogging depth considering the porosity of pervious pavements sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity especially the effect of raining and draining cycle the primary objective of this study is to reveal the pore clogging mechanism in pervious pavements using cfd dem model and the most critical factor that determines clogging process i e the ratio between the diameter of aggregates and particle size of sediments was discussed the conclusions derived from this study can contribute to the future research on maintenance of pervious pavement this study confirms that it is possible to use cfd dem numerical model to reveal the clogging process and reduce the time and costs required an experimental simulation with the same objective and similar settings to this numerical simulation has been previously conducted by the group zhang et al 2018 2 mathematical equations in cfd dem model in the cfd dem model the flow in the whole flow region is calculated from the continuity and the navier stokes equations with a porosity term and an additional body force term used to account for the presence of particles in the fluid these are given by 1 φ t φ u 0 2 ρ φ u t u ρ φ u p μ 2 φ u f b ρ φ g 3 f b i 1 n v f fluid i where ρ is the density of the fluid φ is the porosity u is the fluid velocity p is the fluid pressure µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid g is the gravitational acceleration f b is the body force per unit volume f fluid i is the total force applied by the fluid on particle i nv is the number of particles per unit volume the porosity and body force of the fluid mesh elements are determined through dem the equations of motion for the particles have an additional force term to account for interaction with the fluid the equations are given as follow 4 m u p t f mech i f fluid i m g 5 ω t m i where u p is the particle velocity m is the particle mass f mech i is the sum of additional forces acting on the particle g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the particle angular velocity i is the moment of inertia m is the torque acting on the particle the total force applied by the fluid on particle i f fluid i consists of two parts drag force and a force resulting from the fluid pressure gradient other particle fluid forces such as the lift force is ignored in this study the resulting relationship could be expressed as 6 f fluid i f drag i 3 4 π r 3 p 7 f drag i 0 63 4 8 re p i 2 1 2 ρ π r i 2 u u p i u u p i φ χ where the φ χ term is an empirical factor accounts for the local porosity this correction term makes the force applicable to both fixed and fluidized porosity systems and a large range of reynolds numbers felice 1994 xu and yu 1997 the particle reynolds number re p i is defined as 8 re p i d s i ρ u u p i μ the empirical coefficient χ is defined as 9 χ 3 7 0 65 e x p 1 5 log 10 re p i 2 2 dem and cfd two way coupling is numerically achieved as follows eqs 1 3 are solved with the cfd code while eqs 4 9 are solved with dem code porosity and body force are determined by dem and divided by the volume from cfd the fluid velocity and fluid pressure for every element are determined by the cfd and then sent to the dem in each coupling data exchange 3 the set up of simulation study 3 1 the set up of dem simulation aggregates type and size have an important influence on porosity of pervious concrete in the experiment the cement paste will fill the pores to reduce the porosity furthermore the physical indexes of aggregates are listed in table 1 the aggregate size is 5 11 mm apparent density is 2 665 g cm3 stacking density is 1 665 g cm3 void ratio is 37 89 and crushing values is 8 6 imagej 1 52d software rasband and ferreira 2012 is used to determine the equivalent aggregate diameter and acquire the aggregate size grading curve fig 1 a shows the photo of aggregates in fig 1 b aggregates are processed by binaryzation and labelled the area of every aggregate is calculated automatically and the equivalent diameter is calculated by the equation d 2 a π where a is the area of every aggregate fig 1 c shows the measured aggregates size that ranges from 5 to 11 mm fig 1 d shows the grading curve of the aggregate used in dem simulation three kinds of aggregate particles with diameter of 4 mm 8 mm and 12 mm are determined to form the pervious pavement models the volume ratio of three kinds of particles is found to be 1 3 6 according to the experimental data and literature pieralisi et al 2016 as shown in table 2 pervious pavement models with porosity of 25 30 and 35 are created in edem software the volume of pervious pavement model is fixed and it s length width and thickness is 400 mm 30 mm and 250 mm respectively total volume of aggregates and cement paste used in pervious pavement model is calculated by the equation va vc 1 p where va is the total volume of aggregates and cement paste vc is the volume of pervious pavement p is the porosity of pervious pavement however in order to simplify this model the cement paste volume is directly incorporated into the aggregate volume using only single phase aggregate particles in pervious pavement model consequently the numbers of particle with diameter of 4 mm 8 mm 12 mm are calculated according to the fixed volume ratio at 1 3 6 in dem simulation the aggregate density is 2450 kg m3 shear modulus is 1 106 pa poisson s ratio is 0 3 gercek 2007 yang et al 2000 remond and pizette 2014 remond 2010 in particular the shear modulus is generally much smaller than the real modulus of the simulated materials to increase the time step used for simulations this leads to larger overlaps between particles but does not change the overall behaviour of clogging in pervious pavement model all these parameters are critical to influence time step in dem simulation ds ltd 2015 after the calibration of the parameters of materials all the aggregate particles are generated in edem software a slight compaction by a plate is performed to guarantee the aggregate particles interacting with each other closely the bonded particle model bpm ds ltd 2015 potyondy and cundall 2004 is applied to remedy the drawback that lacks cement paste it is added to aggregate particles to bond them as a whole pervious pavement model under the cohesive force parameters of the bpm are shown in table 3 in this study bonds are assumed as the hardened cements that have the similar material properties to the aggregates the values of normal stiffness and shear stiffness both are 2 107 n m3 these stiffness value can be obtained by many researches e g kazerani and zhao 2010 the values of normal critical stress and shear critical stress both are 5 1030 pa they are much larger than the real damage value of the concrete to prevent the erosion of the pervious pavement model as the clogging behavior is the primary goal of this study rather than the mechanical behavior kazerani and zhao 2010 and potyondy 2007 have done the parameters calibration work they calibrated the micromechanical parameters in bonded particle method and demonstrated that each material macro property i e young s modulus poisson s ratio and so on is distinctly related to the contact properties i e normal and shear stiffness and so on table 4 shows sediments gradations and properties there are three kinds of sediments including fine sands coarse sands and well graded sands these homogeneous mixtures are produced in dem simulation based on their sand grading curves obtained by field experiments the sand grading curves show the mass percent of different size of sediments passing the sieves the density shear modulus and poisson s ratio of sediments is 2650 kg m3 1 106 pa 0 3 respectively gercek 2007 the sediments are depicted in different colors to represent different sediments size in edem software for instance the sediments of size from 2 36 to 4 75 mm are depicted in pink it should be noted that the blue sediments whose size are smaller than 0 15 mm are neglected in simulation because they are too small and it consumes much time to generate them 3 2 the setup of cfd dem simulation as shown in fig 2 the cfd dem model simulates the sediments clogging development in pervious pavement in different working conditions including the horizontal runoff velocity seepage velocity porosity and sediments size distribution the commercial cfd software of fluent coupled with commercial dem software of edem to realize the connection of cfd with dem luo et al 2015 blais et al 2016 li and li 2018 in the sub models the volume of friction vof method ansys inc 2013 hirt and nichols 1981 kothe and rider 1998 is applied to observe the free surface of the water flow the inputs in cfd simulation are the air and water phases inlet water velocity and seepage velocity the outputs are the interface of phases velocity and pressure field the bpm is used to simulate the aggregates compaction and bonding process assuming some simplifications for the aggregate type and size without considering cement paste the inputs in dem simulation are sediments source such as coarse sands fine sands and well graded sands and the porosity of the pervious pavement model the outputs are the sediments distribution and the sediments velocity fig 3 a shows the cfd dem model the pervious pavement model is 400 mm length 30 mm width 250 mm thickness the water flow is considered as uniform flow because the maximum downward infiltration velocity in pervious pavement model is less than 1 of the mean run off flow velocity zhang et al 2017 in cfd dem model sediment particles attempt to percolate through the fixed and non deformable pervious pavement model under the free surface flow water level is set to 10 mm above the surface of pervious pavement model to simulate the free surface flow particle factory i e the sediments source is added above the pervious pavement model 100 mm downstream from the inlet fig 3 b shows the mesh size 3 3 the simulation cases as shown in table 5 the varied parameter of case 1 3 is the horizontal runoff velocity case 1 4 and 5 is the porosity case1 6 and 7 is the seepage velocity controlled by changing the outlet velocity case 1 8 and 9 is the sediments size distribution the case 10 repeats raining and draining periodically and the water table is going up and down periodically in simulation the first two seconds time is utilized to guarantee the stability of free surface flow then sediments are added and they start to percolate into the pervious pavement the computational time step used for the fluid is 5 0 10 4 s and for the sediments is 5 0 10 6 s 4 results and discussion 4 1 the pore clogging mechanism in the cfd dem model although the pores have different shapes from real pervious concrete they are all made up of relatively large pore chambers and relatively small pore throats in these structures particles will only be trapped in pores larger than or equal to their volume regardless of particle size fig 4 shows the sediments percolate into surface layer of pervious pavement model regions from 0 to 10 mm depth marked in blue box included all kinds of the sediments are selected to research the mechanism of pore clogging different clogging process is distinguished from the participation of large sediment particles of 2 36 4 75 mm thus clogging regions are classified into region a and b as shown in fig 5 region a includes the participation of large particles while region b does not the clogging mechanism of region a the sediments such as the pink or yellow particles first stop at a certain depth of pervious pavement and most of them stop at the shallow surface within depth of 10 mm they are hard to restart when they deposit into the pores of pervious pavement and consequently become pore skeleton this causes some pore channels of pervious pavement suddenly get narrow other small size of sediments can accumulate in these regions easily and rapidly the clogging mechanism of region b the dominant flow channels would occur since the pore structures of pervious concrete such as the size and shape are randomly distributed the seepage velocity is larger in the dominant channels thus subsequent sediments can be carried into the dominant channels and trapped there the clogging regions gradually occur and become stable only the smallest particles would continually transport into other places remond 2010 has also reported it in his study 4 2 clogging development in different layers pervious pavement model is sectioned into four layers by the depth to analyze the clogging development layer i 0 10 mm ii 10 30 mm iii 30 60 mm and iv 60 100 mm have the length of 175 mm and width of 30 mm the relationship of the volume fraction of sediments to their layers with the time is acquired to reveal the clogging development in different layers as shown in fig 6 all kinds of sediments exist in layer i the volume fractions of pink and yellow sediments are large it indicates large size particles range from 1 18 to 4 75 mm settle on shallow surface of 10 mm depth in pervious pavement in layer ii the volume fraction of sediments such as the green and black particles are comparatively larger but smaller than that of the layer i in addition pink particles did not exist in layer ii it indicates that the particles size range from 0 3 to 1 18 mm could easily percolate down to the depth of 30 mm while large size particles cannot reach the depth of 30 mm the small size sediments take a dominant place in layer iii it indicates particles size range from 0 3 mm to 1 18 mm could percolate down to the depth of 60 mm as for the layer iv little sediments exist 4 3 sediments secondary movement representative particles were manually chosen to analyze the particle position and velocity the results are presented in fig 7 it shows that 0 3 to 0 6 mm size of sediments could reach to 30 mm depth 0 15 to 0 3 mm size of sediments could reach to depth of 60 mm and farther when the slope of the curve altered suddenly in fig 7 a their vertical particle velocity alters correspondingly like impulse it indicates these particles move again however the large particles whose size range from 0 3 to 4 75 mm are not able to move again in vertical direction under the force of water flow they stop on the surface of pervious concrete pavement finally all the particles tend to be static and find an appropriate position as their vertical velocity tends to be zero after a series of fluctuations 4 4 influence of pervious concrete porosity fig 8 shows the clogging development in different layers caused by the varied porosity in well graded sands the uniform law of clogging development is revealed firstly the sediments initially percolate into layer i it leads to the volume of sediments in this layer rapidly increase and attains peak value after 3 s then the sediments in layer i transport downward to layer ii it leads to the sediments volume increase in layer ii there are little number of sediments in layer iii and there are almost no sediments in layer iv secondly fig 8 shows the volume fraction has a slight decrease in layer i and increase in layer ii in pervious pavement with porosity of 30 contrasted to the pervious pavement with porosity of 25 the volume fraction decrease in layer i and increase in layer ii evidently in pervious pavement with porosity of 35 contrasted with others it indicates that sediments transport deeply as the porosity increases 4 5 influence of sediments size distribution fig 9 shows the influence of sediments size distribution the results show that the well graded sands could reach to the depth of 30 mm coarse sands accumulate mostly within the range of 20 mm fine sands accumulate mostly within the range of 60 mm and could reach to the depth of 100 mm it shows that most clogging depth is limited to the upper 30 mm but sometimes can reach up to 100 mm under the surface in this study locations of the clogging particles can be compared and supported by previous studies baladès et al 1995 suggested that the depth of clogging is limited to the first centimeters of the permeable floor borgwardt 2006 concluded the infiltration performance is highly affected by the fines clogged in the pores within the upper 20 mm of porous paving blocks kayhanian et al 2012 analyzed the ct scanning images and concluded that generally clogging takes place at the top zone of the surface of open graded mixes especially surface layer mixes with thickness of about 25 mm zhang et al 2018 derived the same conclusions by an experimental simulation using the transparent sodium polyacrylate beads the clogging mechanisms are different depending on the ratio dl ds between the diameter of large aggregate particles forming the pervious pavement dl and that of small incoming sediments ds when dl ds is lower than 3 2 3 6 46 3 2 3 6 46 sediments are trapped inside the pores because they are too large to go through the smaller pores for larger ratios a single particle is generally not be stopped and clogging due to the arches formed when several grains attempt to go through smaller pores li and davis 2008 remond 2010 in this paper the equivalent diameter is defined as the diameter equals to 50 percent passing in grading curve the equivalent particle diameters of fine sands well graded sands and coarse sands are 0 25 1 18 and 2 2 mm acquired from sediments size distribution in table 4 the equivalent aggregate size dl is 8 mm according to the grading curve of aggregate size in fig 1d the dl ds is 32 6 78 and 3 64 respectively it means fine sands tend to form arches upon the pores and the coarse sands tend to be trapped easily on the surface of pervious pavement the coarse sands will cause the clogging of pervious pavement easily and fine sands will cause the clogging severely 4 6 influence of horizontal runoff velocity fig 10 shows the vertical velocity of sediments as horizontal runoff velocity changes the sediments vertical velocity refers to the average vertical velocity of all the same particles it indicates that sediments vertical velocity will increase as the particle size become smaller because the small size of sediments are easy to move and become the suspended matters under the force of water flow as the horizontal runoff velocities increase the curves especially the curves of black and red particles disperse this is because the sediments move rightward evidently with the effect of water flow and are able to find more pore space to percolate into the pervious pavement as the horizontal runoff velocity increases sediments will be static in vertical direction ultimately 4 7 influence of seepage velocity fig 11 shows the vertical velocity of sediments versus the seepage velocity changed by controlling the outlet velocity with the increase of the seepage velocity the vertical velocity of sediments in particular of the small size of sediments obviously increase it is not remarkable compared to the influence of horizontal velocity because the seepage velocity changed at the range of 2 6 mm s that was 100 times smaller than the horizontal runoff velocity in magnitude 4 8 influence of cycle of raining and draining fig 12 shows three cycles of raining and draining the purpose of the cycle simulation is to verify the effect of the fluctuation of water level to the sediments distribution during the 7 s the whole clogging process can be observed and after 7 s the clogging process will develop stable most sediments are able to penetrate within the depth of 60 mm during the 10 s of draining the water level in the pervious pavement model can drop to the depth of 60 mm therefore 7 s raining and 10 s draining in one cycle was enough to verify the effect of the fluctuation of water level to the sediments distribution at 2 s the initial water level is stable and the clogging materials are introduced into the pervious pavement model the clogging process will develop in the first cycle period then the cycle simulation raining and draining continued to verify the effect of the fluctuation of the water level it shows that the cycle simulation of water level fluctuation has little influence on the rapid sediments clogging development because large size of sediments are hard to move again and change their positions once the clogging happened as for the minor decrease of the volume fraction it is because the small size of sediments can penetrate downward 4 9 clogging development stages through the analysis of clogging tendency in different layers this research concludes that the depth of 0 30 mm is the most common region to be clogged by sediments the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer is normalized as shown in fig 13 the clogging development could be divided into 3 stages rapid clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable stage the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer firstly increases rapidly i e the rapid clogging stage and then falls down slightly i e the mitigation of clogging stage and finally tend to be stable stage if there are continuous supply of sediments source to simulate the clogging development the sediments volume fraction in pervious pavement will increase and finally tend to be saturated cui et al 2016 the logistic analysis and polynomial analysis are used to fit the stage 1 2 and 3 shown as follow 10 stage 1 v n 1 1 1 1 t x 0 p 11 stage 2 v n 2 a t b t c 12 stage 3 v n 3 d where v n1 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 1 v n2 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 2 t is the time s v n3 is the normalized volume fraction of stage 3 the parameters in eqs 10 12 varied by their boundary conditions take the case 1 as example the values of x 0 p a b c and d are 1 094 2 225 0 007 0 098 1 228 and 0 894 respectively under the condition of porosity 25 well graded sands and time 10 s and so on 5 conclusions this study develops a cfd dem model of sediments clogging development considering the porosity of pervious pavement sediments size distribution the horizontal runoff velocity and the seepage velocity irregular shaped particles are arounded by the cements in reality while in this study all aggregates are assumed as single phase spheres the cement is incorporated into the aggregate despite that the cfd dem model is effective to reveal the pore clogging mechanism especially considering that the input parameters used are the same as real porous concrete two kinds of clogging mechanisms were proposed the first one includes the participation of large sediments the second one does not the first one is more likely to happen and evolves rapidly the dl ds ratio reflects the influence of the ratio of aggregate size to sediments size and the clogging mechanisms are discussed depending on the ratio dl ds sediments size distribution has a significant influence on clogging development the relationship between clogging depth and sediments size distribution is proposed the sediments clogging development in 0 30 mm layer is divided into 3 stages rapid clogging stage mitigation of clogging stage and stable stage the sediments volume fraction of 0 30 mm layer is normalized analysis and fitted by formulas sediments secondary movement is investigated by studying the relationship between the sediments position and velocity the influences of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity on clogging development have been revealed as the increase of porosity horizontal runoff velocity and seepage velocity sediments could transport into pervious pavement deeply the cycle simulation of raining and draining has limited influence to the rapid clogging development the following conclusions can be derived based on above analysis the ration of dl ds of fine sands full graded sands and coarse sands is 32 6 78 and 3 64 respectively it means the coarse sands will cause the clogging of pervious pavement more easily and fine sands will cause the clogging more severely full graded sands can percolate into depth of 30 mm in pervious pavement coarse sands can percolate in depth within 20 mm fine sands can percolate into the depth of 60 mm even 100 mm sediments of size range from 1 18 to 4 75 mm is hardly to move again and sediments of size smaller than 1 18 mm is more likely to move again and become suspended substances acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the national program on key basic research project

7027,the songhua river basin srb plays a vital role in supplying water resources to northeast china this river has a substantial effect on agricultural grain producing region therefore the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of multiple hydrological models driven by bias corrected precipitation estimates from a group of general circulation models gcms the variations in discharge obtained from multiple hydrological models were also analyzed for this purpose bias correction methods for gcms and five hydrological models lumped rainfall runoff nedbor afstromnings model nam grj4 semi distributed the water evaluation and planning tool weap hbv and the distributed soil water assessment tool swat were used in the srb before applying the bias correction method raw gcms were also plotted against observational data the results revealed that none of gcm performed well against observational data the results also showed that quantile mapping method corrects the biases of gcms better than daily and monthly scale factors distributed and semi distributed hydrological models performed better than lumped rainfall runoff models in the selected study area of srb by forcing hydrological models with bias corrected precipitation data the differences in the simulated discharge by swat hbv nam gr4j and weap were 3 2 4 7 and 3 respectively when compared with observed discharge the results also show that the overall performance of swat hbv nam and weap was better than grj4 the results also suggest that the application of multiple hydrological models is necessary to make improvements in the planning and management of agricultural and water resources in the srb region keywords general circulation models hydrological models climate change songhua river basin 1 introduction scientists and researchers worldwide agree that the global climate is warming and that warming will have major effects on the hydrological cycle after the 1950s unprecedented changes began to be observed in global climatic conditions intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 moreover emissions of greenhouse gases are also contributing to altering the earth s climate and the hydrological cycle the anticipated changes in climate variables are expected to change the magnitude and frequency of hydrological and climatic extremes in different regions giuntoli et al 2015 hagemann et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2014 teklesadik et al 2017 despite the availability of state of art hydrological models and global circulation models gcms the current emphasis of the effects of climate on water resources has dealt with the inherent structure of hydrological models and the related parameters and downscaling methods generally gcms represent conditions related to biogeochemical processes land surface ocean cryosphere and atmosphere on a geographical grid which covers the globe different gcms use different climate modeling systems that depend on the representative institute which provides the related data this means that the greenhouse gas scenario and spatial resolution of the gcms differ for the different gcms this fact restricts the direct application of gcms at local and regional scales and particularly impacts the study of the effects of climate change on hydrology and the environment wilby et al 2000 different downscaling methods such as statistical and dynamic methods have been developed to correct the biases found in gcms and to reduce higher resolution gcm output to smaller or site scales hay and clark 2003 wetterhall et al 2006 the statistical downscaling methods based on statistical relationships between local regional variables and large scale climate information while dynamical downscaling methods employ regional climate models rcms for limited regions with boundary conditions from gcm simulations maraun et al 2010 wilby et al 2004 these rcms with higher resolutions are able to capture smaller scale process more realistically the dynamic downscaling methods guarantee consistency with the gcm and models output variables internally consistent these methods are developed for rcms to study wave energy resource evaluation flooding risks assessment complex costliness and complex topography laugel et al 2014 tian et al 2013 but the disadvantage of dynamic downscaling is an intensive computation required to run a single scenario while statistical downscaling provides a simple and faster method for the computation required to run large scale gcms therefore most researchers and scientists have used statistical downscaling techniques to study the effects of climate change on hydrological and environmental behavior giuntoli et al 2015 wetterhall et al 2006 wilby et al 2000 recently some researchers have developed statistical models and bias correction techniques that have also been reported in literature such as the lars weather generator statistical downscaling model and automated statistical downscaling model power transformation linear scaling and distribution mapping hessami et al 2008 li et al 2013 semenov and barrow 1997 teutschbein and seibert 2012 wilby et al 2000 however these models only downscale hadcm3 a2 and cancm3 b2 scenarios of the 4th assessment report of the ipcc because the restrictions on models to successfully make predictors and then link with predictands in bias correction methods usually two steps are adopted 1 observed and simulated data are used to determine the scale factors and 2 adjustment of simulated gcms is employed with acquired scale factors to remove biases in the aforementioned techniques the calculation of scale factors is an important task the details of calculating scale factor are presented in section 3 1 in addition to bias correction of gcms past researches have also applied gcms and multiple hydrological models at regional and local scales to study the impact of climate change caused by differences between the structure of hydrological models and their parameters giuntoli et al 2015 hagemann et al 2013 jiang et al 2007 gosling et al 2011 documented that the difference in mean annual discharge depends on the selection of a specific hydrological model their results exhibited up to a 25 difference in the annual modeled discharge and this difference was larger after the selection of gcms than after the selection of a hydrological model poulin et al 2011 found significant uncertainty existed in hydrological model structure than in the uncertainty of hydrological model parameters likewise precipitation and land use have also affected the runoff for example bi et al 2009 yin et al 2017 studied the effect of land use and precipitation in different parts of china and documented a significant influence of land use changes on runoff fang et al 2012 found erosive effect of rainfall characteristics in the wangjiaqiao watershed as summarized above quantifying studies are very important for decision making related to water resources and agricultural management a recommendation based on a single hydrological model may be highly uncertain whereas the use of multiple hydrological models and their combination with gcms would highlight different sources of uncertainty and this can help decision makers to take appropriate mitigation measures before the occurrence of a natural hazard such as a flood or drought several studies have been carried out in the songhua river basin srb in northeastern china to assess the effects of climate variables and changes in water resources faiz et al 2017a faiz et al 2017b liu et al 2016 mu et al 2012 song et al 2015 scientists have usually reached a consensus that temperature is rising while changes in precipitation remain uncertain in the srb for example song et al 2015 khan et al 2016 and faiz et al 2018 studied the historical trend of precipitation temperature in the srb and documented that the precipitation has an increase and decrease trend while temperature has risen from 1 to 1 5 c in last five decades at 82 stations in the literature several studies in the srb have dealt with changes in precipitation projected by gcms but a literature gap of ensembles of gcms exists with hydrological models in the srb because stream flow is very sensitive to changes in precipitation the ambiguity in projected stream flow will complicate the future planning and management of water resources in this region the studies cited above mostly used non parametric trend tests to assess the changes in river discharge and climate variables such as precipitation although non parametric trend tests are sufficient to represent the best state of art methods for determining changes in river discharge and precipitation but during an impact evaluation study quantifying the contributions of climate variables e g precipitation an ensemble of multiple hydrological models and gcms should be used to provide a more reliable assessment of changes in river discharge in the context of the above literature three hydrological models the gr4j lumped precipitation runoff model water evaluation and planning tool weap a conceptual rainfall runoff nam model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv and soil water assessment tool swat along with the bias corrected precipitation obtained from an ensemble of seven gcms were used to analyze conditions in the srb of northeastern china the main goals of the study were 1 to evaluate the performance of the gr4j weap nam hbv and swat models under current climate conditions in the srb 2 to examine the reliability of the gr4j weap nam hbv and swat models forced by downscaled precipitation of an ensemble of gcms 2 study area the srb the seventh largest major river basin in china stretches between 41 42 51 48 n 119 52 132 31 e with an area of 556 800 km2 the srb is divided into three sub basins 1 the main stream of the songhua river 2 the second songhua river and 3 the nenjiang basins the second songhua river and the nenjiang are the southern and northern sources of the main stream of the songhua river respectively mu et al 2012 the current study emphasized the main stream of songhua river gauged at harbin gauging station that covers an area of 53 600 km2 and is located in the middle of the srb fig 1 this sub basin is the main agricultural area of the region and stands at an elevation of 80 1666 m a s l the mean annual precipitation in the selected basin ranges from 400 to 700 mm while mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 5 c faiz et al 2018 song et al 2015 according to hydrological bureau of harbin the mean monthly discharge at the yilan gauge station is 18 228 mcm the daily datasets for climate variables such as relative humidity temperature minimum and maximum wind speed precipitation evaporation and sunshine hours from 1961 to 2016 for ten climatic stations were obtained from the harbin metrological department heilongjiang province china fig 1 the quality of the data had already been reviewed by the harbin metrological department the daily discharge datasets gauged at yilan station for the period of 1988 to 2016 were also obtained from the harbin hydrological department fig 1 moreover historical outputs of seven gcms with different resolutions for precipitation 1961 to 2005 and outputs of gcms for the period of 2006 to 2010 under representative concentration pathway 2 6 rcp 2 6 from different institutes were also downloaded from https pcmdi llnl gov search cmip5 and these data were provided by the world climate research program table 1 the rcp 2 6 represents the lowest rcp scenario rogelj et al 2012 therefore in this study rcp 2 6 was taken for making ensemble of gcms to force hydrological models for the period of 1988 to 2010 these seven models performed well during a previous evaluation and projection of future changes in precipitation and temperature in china sun et al 2015 3 methods 3 1 linear scaling section 1 discussed a few bias correction methods for gcms that were needed because of their coarse resolution however linear scaling provides the simplest and easiest method of correcting the biases in gcms as a result a number of researchers worldwide have used linear scaling for bias correction of rcms and gcms lenderink et al 2007 mahmood and babel 2013 mahmood and shaofeng 2016 piani et al 2010a 2010b with these correction methods authors usually calculate scale factors on a monthly basis which limits its usefulness in exploring daily variations in the data in the modified linear scaling method the temporal resolution of scaling factors increased during the transition from a monthly to a daily basis by using eq 1 1 p c d a i l y p r a w d a i l y μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y where p c d a i l y is the corrected daily precipitation time series for any period e g 1990 2005 p r a w d a i l y is the raw daily precipitation simulated by a gcm for the period 1990 2005 p o b s d a i l y is the daily observed precipitation for the control period e g 1961 1975 and μ is the expectation operator for example μ p o b s d a i l y is the average value of precipitation for a given day in this proposed method 365 scales factors μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y were obtained from long term daily observed precipitation and gcm precipitation instead of 12 scaled factors intensive care is required at the time of calculating scale factors because they depend on the annual cycle of a gcm before applying the corrected precipitation data to hydrological models the modified linear scale method was used to evaluate the observed precipitation data for this purpose the observed and gcms data were divided into two sets a control and the scenario periods as defined above then mean daily scale factors for the control period were obtained by applying the formula μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y before applying these scale factors using eq 1 a gaussian filter mitchell et al 1966 was applied by matlab to smooth the scale factors different filters such as running average low high and band pass filters can be used to smooth data chatfield 2016 in gaussian filter the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution can be related to 50 of frequency response of the filter therefore an appropriate gaussian distribution has standard distribution σ g λ 0 5 6 λ 0 5 is desired wave length the weights of the filter can be obtained by sampling the probability distribution functions of the standard normal distribution at t values 0 1 σ g 2 σ g 3 σ g in this study a wavelength of 30 years is taken to get a gaussian filter with frequency response of 0 5 for more detail of application of gaussian filter we refer readers to the paper of mitchell et al 1966 furthermore the monthly scale factors μ p o b s m o n t h l y μ p r a w m o n t h l y were also calculated to find the difference in downscaled data see fig 2 a for clarification it could be seen that from days 180 to 270 the monthly scale factors ranged from 1 7 to 2 2 while daily scale factors have different ranges this indicate that correction of gcms with monthly scale factors for a particular month might correct the mean values of that month but there might be different daily values for that month finally smooth scale factors were adjusted with daily precipitation of each gcm to obtain the correct gcm data for each station in the srb a graphical presentation of the corrected precipitation by daily scale and monthly factors for the bcc csm 1 1 m model is presented fig 2b c the corrected precipitation with daily scale factor is more consistent and accurate compared to monthly scale factors for more robust assessment the corrected precipitation determined by the modified linear scaling method based on daily scale factors was also evaluated using a taylor diagram a taylor diagram is a brief summary of the evaluation of the observed and simulated data in terms of the root mean square difference correlation and ratio of variances taylor 2001 the results show that the corrected daily precipitation data had good agreement and correlation between the observed and downscaled precipitation fig 3 3 2 quantile mapping the quantile mapping qm is a non parametric bias correction method this method is applicable for distributions of precipitation without any assumption on precipitation distribution this particular bias correction approach is based on empirical transformation and successfully implemented to correct the biases of rcms precipitation fang et al 2015 jakob themeßl et al 2011 sun et al 2011 the effective advantage of this method is to correct biases in quantiles wet day frequency mean and standard deviation the bias correction of gcms based on quantile mapping can be expressed based on empirical distribution function and inverse of empirical distribution function fang et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2012 piani et al 2010a 2010b 2 p c o r r e c t d a i l y e c d f o b s m o n t h 1 e c d f r a w m o n t h p r a w d a i l y where ecd f o b s m o n t h 1 represents the inverse cumulative distribution function of mean value of observed precipitation at given month m ecd f r a w m o n t h represents cumulative distribution function of mean value of non corrected gcm simulated precipitation at given month m and p r a w d a i l y is the raw daily precipitation simulated by a gcm at a given month 3 3 hydrological models the hydrological conditions in the srb were modeled using five hydrological models weap nam gr4j hbv and swat these five models were selected because they employed different runoff routing methods the brief description of each model and the related input parameters are summarized in table 2 the hydrological models were forced with observational data and the precipitation simulated in an ensemble of seven gcms including other climatic parameters that were fixed during the analysis such as temperature minimum maximum relative humidity and wind speed the calibration 1988 2010 and validation 2011 2016 of the hydrological models were carried out by stream flow gauging at yilan station that is located at the end of the main stream of the basin 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance evaluation of raw gcms the performance of daily mean precipitation for the raw gcms without correction for the period of 1961 1990 was evaluated by comparing that data with observed daily precipitation data for this purpose statistical indicators such as 1 the correlation co efficient r 2 error between mean of observed and gcm and 3 error between standard deviations of observed and gcm were calculated for the entire study area these statistical indicators were mostly used for performance evaluation of observational data against gcm data mahmood and babel 2013 mahmood and shaofeng 2016 to investigate the basin wide pattern of precipitation captured by gcms the mean monthly observational data and gcms data were plotted by taking the arithmetic mean of the observed and all the gcms grids that covered the basin the indicators were calculated based on daily time series raw precipitation data of seven gcms against the observational data all the gcms predicted a correlation of less than 0 50 the remaining indicators exhibited poor performance of all gcms in the region the errors in standard deviation and errors in mean ranged from 0 3 to 0 90 mm day and 0 2 to 0 8 mm day respectively table 3 the poor performance of gcms shows that raw gcms cannot be used for an analysis at either the basin or regional scale the mean monthly precipitation of all seven gcms against observed precipitation is presented in fig 4 a this graphical presentation revealed that somehow all models overestimated the predicted precipitation moreover the performance of gcms showed well agreement when bias corrected with daily scale factors compared to monthly scale factors fig 4b c 4 2 performance evaluation of gcms by modified linear scaling and quantile mapping methods according to the application of impact study different statistics could be used for evaluation of downscaling or bias correction methods such as temporal characteristics or intensity metrics maraun et al 2010 the mean variance percentile percentage wet wet and dry spell length and peak over threshold are commonly used statistics for bias corrected precipitation chen et al 2012 khan and coulibaly 2010 wetterhall et al 2006 the statistics calculated for corrected gcms with modified linear scaling of mean daily and mean monthly precipitation as well as quantile mapping for the period of 1961 90 are presented in table 4 the results demonstrate a good agreement between the corrected gcms and observational data in the basin the results indicate that means and variances were well improved when compared with raw gcms even the corrected gcms show better improvement when the statistics were calculated for quantile mapping method to examine the performance of corrected versus observational data the statistics for different seasons winter spring summer autumn and annual were also calculated for this purpose the precipitation threshold value was assumed 1 0 mm it is evident that quantile mapping showed better performance than linear scaling during analysis it was observed that quantile mapping caused an overwhelming advantage to linear scaling because most statistics exhibited better performance for quantile mapping than those of linear scaling table 4 for example wet day percentage and maximum dry day spell in winter and summer maximum wet day spell and peak over threshold in winter spring and annual showed better statistics than linear scaling methods in the current analysis precipitation corrected by daily scale factors was also compared with precipitation bias corrected by monthly scale factors table 4 the results indicate that daily scale factors exhibited an improvement in means and variances as well as percentage wet based on the statistics calculated for the period of 1961 90 precipitation time series the main purpose of modification in linear scaling was to correct the daily variation in the precipitation time series although both linear scaling methods showed an overestimation in the most of statistics results precipitation time series data corrected by daily scale factors somehow proved similar to the correction carried out by quantile mapping the graphical presentation and statistics showed that the modified linear scaling method and quantile mapping performed better than original linear scaling and can be used in daily precipitation time series that are based hydrological models fig 5 4 3 calibration and validation of hydrological models using observational data the performance of hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat was checked for the srb region based on observational data additionally non dimensional criteria such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and pearson correlation coefficient lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 were also computed between observed and simulated runoff by using hydrological models the predicted values were calibrated using correction factors that generate predicted values that were consistent with the observed values while validation was done to judge the performance of each model using observational data that was not used during the calibration process and time period in this study the hydrological models are classified into two categories a lumped rainfall runoff models b semi distributed and distributed hydrological models a lumped rainfall runoff models to evaluate the best performance of gr4j the model was calibrated several times to obtain the best parameter values if new parameters provided better results than the previous ones the previous parameters were replaced by the new ones this procedure continued until the best values were obtained during the calibration period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was not greater than 0 62 for the period from 1988 to 2010 likewise during the validation period the nse was never less than 0 64 the graphical representation of calibration and validation period is presented in fig 6 it was noted that gr4j model underestimates the peak flow while low flow showed a little bit over estimate this under and over estimation of flow directly related to model parameters for example during the calibration it was observed that the parameter x4 which is related to unit hydrograph is most sensitive to high flows while x2 that is related to groundwater is sensitive to low flows the parameters x1 production store and x3 routing store were sensitive to target function nse because target function is a statistical measure that calculate the performance of simulated and observed flows the results suggested that sensitivity of these four parameters could not be ignored because all these parameters directly affect the hydrograph lerat et al 2012 also confirm that stability of these four parameters is a primary importance at the time of applying gr4j in operational conditions the nam model was run for the same time period 1988 2010 to obtain the optimized parameter values for the basin during calibration the nse value was obtained as 0 73 likewise the value of nse was found to be 0 80 for the validation period during analysis the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated data for nam was never less than 0 80 while for gr4j the minimum correlation coefficient was found to be 0 70 table 5 during analysis it was also observed that for the nam model the parameters for the overland flow runoff coefficient lmax and ck1k2 were the most sensitive and had the most influence on the process of predicting discharge for instance it was revealed that increasing the lmax value tends to decrease the simulated accumulated volume as well as decrease in the simulated hydrograph peak and vice versa the overland flow runoff coefficient which divides the excess rainfall into overland flow and infiltration also had a substantial effect in this case the coefficient value close to zero showed a drastic decrease in the overland flow volume while a value close to or greater than 0 3 demonstrated the best agreement between simulated and observed discharges ck1 2 generally controls the hydrograph peak the analysis found that the most suitable value of ck1 2 was 16 showing the most appropriate match for predicting the discharge amount the optimized calibrated values for models are presented in table 6 moreover nam model captured the peak flow hydrograph better than the gr4j model fig 6 b semi distributed and distributed hydrological models the evaluation of semi distributed and distributed hydrological model at the time of calibration and validation for the period of 1988 to 2016 is presented in figs 7 8 the weap model was auto calibrated by the parameter estimation tool the nse value for the period from 1988 to 2010 was 0 83 while during the validation period the values were never less than 0 88 the high nse values could be caused by the maximum variables of the input data precipitation temperature etc and by the fact that there was less variation in this data compare to daily input data during the calibration process soil water capacity and deep conductivity were found to be the most sensitive parameters which directly affect the hydrograph peak the hbv model ran for the same period and the nse value was found 0 80 while during the validation period the nse value was never less than 0 82 during analysis it was observed that parameters such as maxbas k1 and uzl were most influencing on high flow than the volume balance especially k1 ko and uzl that control interflow and overland flow the influence of these parameters on catchment in the form of changing of peak flow hydrograph abebe et al 2010 studied the sensitivity function of hbv model in the leaf river watershed of united states and concluded that parameters from transformation routine i e maxbas ko k1 and uzl directly influence the peak flows for swat model calibration of stream flow was done on daily time steps for the period of 1988 to 2010 the model well simulated the stream flow in the entire catchments the best nse value was found 0 81 while for validation period 2011 2016 the nse value was never less than 0 80 the calibration was done considering sensitive flow parameter that are described in table 6 for realistic simulation of stream flow the model parameters were manually adjusted and this procedure continued until the best values were obtained during the analysis the model parameters that directly influenced the surface runoff such as curve number cn2 soil water capacity sol awc and evaporation factor esco respectively high value of curve number reduces the base flow and increases the surface runoff while sol awc has inverse relation with hydric balance for example high value of sol awc reduces the amount of available water for percolation and surface runoff because high sol awc helps the soil maintain its humidity the correlation coefficient for distributed and semi distributed model was never less than 0 80 found during the whole simulation compared to observed stream flow table 5 moreover the semi distributed and distributed models well captured the peak flow compared to lumped models fig 9 this also suggested that consideration of distributed characteristics of land use geology topography is necessary for well assessment of hydrological process 4 4 comparison between hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat with the weap model the best nse value for the validation period was 0 88 similarly for the hbv and swat models it was 0 82 and 0 80 while for lumped models i e nam and gr4j the nse value was 0 80 and 0 64 respectively the hydrological models could not determine the origin of runoff in a reliable manner as a result it is necessary to compare the performance of hydrological models by a sensitive climatic input parameter such as precipitation for this purpose we employed 1988 to 2010 as a trial period based on an ensemble of corrected precipitation from seven gcms and other climatic parameters remained the same as the input in each model to evaluate the performance of hydrological models the percentage change in the variation of discharge that was calculated from five hydrological models based on forcing an ensemble of gcms are presented in fig 10 the results show that the change in variation in predicted discharge by swat was 3 qm and 13 linear scaling while those for hbv weap nam and gr4j were 2 25 6 3 4 29 7 29 respectively when compared with observed discharge under the same conditions the large reduction of projected discharge by models may have been associated with the bias correction method but models performed satisfactory when corrected precipitation by quantile method is used the srb experiences a harsh environment such as long cold winters with snow and short summers with days of heavy rain this was the first time these hydrological models have been used in this environment the satisfactory performance of gr4j based on nse statistics is caused by its limitations as pointed by perrin et al 2003 for example model does not work well when some key processes are active on a catchment such as if the catchment is significantly influenced by snow karstic influences catchment with dams and dry environments since the rainfall runoff relationship is much more non linear merz et al 2009 study the scale effects in conceptual hydrological modeling and concluded that some parameters may not be well estimated due to larger uncertainties that are associated with internal state variables the swat hbv weap and nam models displayed good performance in the srb which was confirmed by the nse values of greater than 0 80 respectively to analyze the performance of bias correction methods the long term monthly average was also taken for simulated stream flow fig 11 the results revealed that hydrological models forced by bias correction of gcms with quantile mapping well captured the peak flow of august only nam and hbv under estimated the peak flow in contrast the stream flow simulation based on precipitation extracted from ensembles of gcms that were corrected with linear scaling failed in capturing satisfactory peak flow the simulated stream flow was showing more spread in the winter months jan feb compared to summer months the peak flow curve with respect to base flow indicated that lumped models failed to capture peak flow compared to semi distributed and distributed models 4 5 projection of precipitation and stream flow for the period of 2070 2099 under rcp 8 5 the projected precipitation and stream flow variations for the period of 2070 to 2099 is presented in fig 12 for this purpose gcms under high emission scenario i e rcp 8 5 were used the radiating forcing in this scenario was expected to increase by 8 5 w m 2 at the end of 21st century compared to other pathways taylor et al 2012 based on results section 4 4 the bias in the gcms were corrected with quantile mapping method because this method showed good agreement with observations compared to linear scaling the results based on sen s slope estimator sen 1968 revealed that precipitation expected to increase 1 56 mm year the simulated monthly corrected precipitation plotted against the corresponding base line period 1961 to 1990 suggest that models are able to predict realistic precipitation cycle most of the models well produced the single peak the maximum precipitation was predicted in the summer season except cancm4 and ccsm4 the previous studies also documented that precipitation trend increases in the basin sun et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 furthermore the hydrological models were forced by predicted precipitation to estimate the variation in stream flow for far future period 2071 2099 the results exhibited that maximum increase in stream flow weap 25 and minimum 3 gr4j found with respect to base line period 1988 2016 4 6 uncertainties in climate change and hydrological impact studies there are number of uncertainties which are associated with quality of data and method used including model structure and parameters bosshard et al 2013 leng et al 2015 in this study historical outputs of gcms from cmip5 and gcms under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 were used to analyze the differences and comparison between hydrological models although the gcms were converted into common resolution of 0 5 0 5 and biases were corrected with linear scaling and quantile mapping methods but the accuracy was still uncertain the uncertainties related to hydrological models also influenced on the climate impact studies although different hydrological models were used to assess the stream flow variation in the basin but reliability of input data is important for accurate reflection of hydrological conditions for example digital elevation model soil map and land use maps have a resolution of 1 km which may not represent the parameters heterogeneity moreover agricultural and human management practices that have a significant effect on stream flow could be considered for comprehensive planning of water resources as well as to understand the hydrological process of the basin in addition to limitations and uncertainties the novelty of this study is application of multiple hydrological models gcms and bias correction methods were used to assess the variation in stream flow 5 conclusions in this article the hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat and gcms were used in the srb the performances of gcms were evaluated by bias correction methods the quantile mapping and linear scaling methods were used to translate gcms outputs at the site scale in this study for gcms precipitation simulations daily and monthly scale factors were used to improve the daily variation in precipitation furthermore hydrological models were forced by precipitation from an ensemble of bias corrected gcms the performance of the hydrological models were evaluated by correlation coefficient and nse criteria to evaluate the gcms seven gcms bcc csm 1 1 m bnu esm canesm2 ipsl cm5a lr giss e2 h ccsm4 and micro esm chem were obtained covering the srb moreover statistical indicators and graphical representation were also used for evaluation period 1961 1990 before applying the bias correction method raw gcms were plotted against the observational data the results showed that none of gcm performed better against the observational data after applying the modified bias correction in which daily scale factors were obtained and quantile mapping method an improvement was observed in all statistical indicators in comparison with the bias correction method in which monthly scale factors were obtained less improvement was observed than with the modified linear scaling and quantile mapping bias correction method to evaluate the hydrological models the models were forced by using both observed and bias corrected precipitation data when analyzing the performance of the models using observed precipitation data the final correlation coefficient and nse criterion values were found for the weap 0 86 and 0 83 the grj4 0 67 and 0 62 the nam 0 80 and 0 73 the hbv 0 86 and 0 80 and the swat 0 82 and 0 81 respectively however with bias corrected precipitation data the results showed variation and changes in the predicted discharge amounts by the swat 3 13 while results for the hbv 2 25 nam 4 29 gr4j 7 29 and weap 6 3 were comparable to the observed predicted discharge amounts the differences in projection of discharge may be related to biases of the gcms or usage of bias correction method moreover the projected precipitation results revealed that precipitation expected to increase 1 56 mm year and stream flow 3 to 25 with respect to base line for the period of 2071 2099 in summary this study stresses that hydrological models contribute notably to the variations in the projection of discharge in the srb therefore future studies should consider employing multiple hydrological models instead of using single model to conduct future planning and management of agricultural activities

7027,the songhua river basin srb plays a vital role in supplying water resources to northeast china this river has a substantial effect on agricultural grain producing region therefore the current study was carried out to evaluate the performances of multiple hydrological models driven by bias corrected precipitation estimates from a group of general circulation models gcms the variations in discharge obtained from multiple hydrological models were also analyzed for this purpose bias correction methods for gcms and five hydrological models lumped rainfall runoff nedbor afstromnings model nam grj4 semi distributed the water evaluation and planning tool weap hbv and the distributed soil water assessment tool swat were used in the srb before applying the bias correction method raw gcms were also plotted against observational data the results revealed that none of gcm performed well against observational data the results also showed that quantile mapping method corrects the biases of gcms better than daily and monthly scale factors distributed and semi distributed hydrological models performed better than lumped rainfall runoff models in the selected study area of srb by forcing hydrological models with bias corrected precipitation data the differences in the simulated discharge by swat hbv nam gr4j and weap were 3 2 4 7 and 3 respectively when compared with observed discharge the results also show that the overall performance of swat hbv nam and weap was better than grj4 the results also suggest that the application of multiple hydrological models is necessary to make improvements in the planning and management of agricultural and water resources in the srb region keywords general circulation models hydrological models climate change songhua river basin 1 introduction scientists and researchers worldwide agree that the global climate is warming and that warming will have major effects on the hydrological cycle after the 1950s unprecedented changes began to be observed in global climatic conditions intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 moreover emissions of greenhouse gases are also contributing to altering the earth s climate and the hydrological cycle the anticipated changes in climate variables are expected to change the magnitude and frequency of hydrological and climatic extremes in different regions giuntoli et al 2015 hagemann et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2014 teklesadik et al 2017 despite the availability of state of art hydrological models and global circulation models gcms the current emphasis of the effects of climate on water resources has dealt with the inherent structure of hydrological models and the related parameters and downscaling methods generally gcms represent conditions related to biogeochemical processes land surface ocean cryosphere and atmosphere on a geographical grid which covers the globe different gcms use different climate modeling systems that depend on the representative institute which provides the related data this means that the greenhouse gas scenario and spatial resolution of the gcms differ for the different gcms this fact restricts the direct application of gcms at local and regional scales and particularly impacts the study of the effects of climate change on hydrology and the environment wilby et al 2000 different downscaling methods such as statistical and dynamic methods have been developed to correct the biases found in gcms and to reduce higher resolution gcm output to smaller or site scales hay and clark 2003 wetterhall et al 2006 the statistical downscaling methods based on statistical relationships between local regional variables and large scale climate information while dynamical downscaling methods employ regional climate models rcms for limited regions with boundary conditions from gcm simulations maraun et al 2010 wilby et al 2004 these rcms with higher resolutions are able to capture smaller scale process more realistically the dynamic downscaling methods guarantee consistency with the gcm and models output variables internally consistent these methods are developed for rcms to study wave energy resource evaluation flooding risks assessment complex costliness and complex topography laugel et al 2014 tian et al 2013 but the disadvantage of dynamic downscaling is an intensive computation required to run a single scenario while statistical downscaling provides a simple and faster method for the computation required to run large scale gcms therefore most researchers and scientists have used statistical downscaling techniques to study the effects of climate change on hydrological and environmental behavior giuntoli et al 2015 wetterhall et al 2006 wilby et al 2000 recently some researchers have developed statistical models and bias correction techniques that have also been reported in literature such as the lars weather generator statistical downscaling model and automated statistical downscaling model power transformation linear scaling and distribution mapping hessami et al 2008 li et al 2013 semenov and barrow 1997 teutschbein and seibert 2012 wilby et al 2000 however these models only downscale hadcm3 a2 and cancm3 b2 scenarios of the 4th assessment report of the ipcc because the restrictions on models to successfully make predictors and then link with predictands in bias correction methods usually two steps are adopted 1 observed and simulated data are used to determine the scale factors and 2 adjustment of simulated gcms is employed with acquired scale factors to remove biases in the aforementioned techniques the calculation of scale factors is an important task the details of calculating scale factor are presented in section 3 1 in addition to bias correction of gcms past researches have also applied gcms and multiple hydrological models at regional and local scales to study the impact of climate change caused by differences between the structure of hydrological models and their parameters giuntoli et al 2015 hagemann et al 2013 jiang et al 2007 gosling et al 2011 documented that the difference in mean annual discharge depends on the selection of a specific hydrological model their results exhibited up to a 25 difference in the annual modeled discharge and this difference was larger after the selection of gcms than after the selection of a hydrological model poulin et al 2011 found significant uncertainty existed in hydrological model structure than in the uncertainty of hydrological model parameters likewise precipitation and land use have also affected the runoff for example bi et al 2009 yin et al 2017 studied the effect of land use and precipitation in different parts of china and documented a significant influence of land use changes on runoff fang et al 2012 found erosive effect of rainfall characteristics in the wangjiaqiao watershed as summarized above quantifying studies are very important for decision making related to water resources and agricultural management a recommendation based on a single hydrological model may be highly uncertain whereas the use of multiple hydrological models and their combination with gcms would highlight different sources of uncertainty and this can help decision makers to take appropriate mitigation measures before the occurrence of a natural hazard such as a flood or drought several studies have been carried out in the songhua river basin srb in northeastern china to assess the effects of climate variables and changes in water resources faiz et al 2017a faiz et al 2017b liu et al 2016 mu et al 2012 song et al 2015 scientists have usually reached a consensus that temperature is rising while changes in precipitation remain uncertain in the srb for example song et al 2015 khan et al 2016 and faiz et al 2018 studied the historical trend of precipitation temperature in the srb and documented that the precipitation has an increase and decrease trend while temperature has risen from 1 to 1 5 c in last five decades at 82 stations in the literature several studies in the srb have dealt with changes in precipitation projected by gcms but a literature gap of ensembles of gcms exists with hydrological models in the srb because stream flow is very sensitive to changes in precipitation the ambiguity in projected stream flow will complicate the future planning and management of water resources in this region the studies cited above mostly used non parametric trend tests to assess the changes in river discharge and climate variables such as precipitation although non parametric trend tests are sufficient to represent the best state of art methods for determining changes in river discharge and precipitation but during an impact evaluation study quantifying the contributions of climate variables e g precipitation an ensemble of multiple hydrological models and gcms should be used to provide a more reliable assessment of changes in river discharge in the context of the above literature three hydrological models the gr4j lumped precipitation runoff model water evaluation and planning tool weap a conceptual rainfall runoff nam model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv and soil water assessment tool swat along with the bias corrected precipitation obtained from an ensemble of seven gcms were used to analyze conditions in the srb of northeastern china the main goals of the study were 1 to evaluate the performance of the gr4j weap nam hbv and swat models under current climate conditions in the srb 2 to examine the reliability of the gr4j weap nam hbv and swat models forced by downscaled precipitation of an ensemble of gcms 2 study area the srb the seventh largest major river basin in china stretches between 41 42 51 48 n 119 52 132 31 e with an area of 556 800 km2 the srb is divided into three sub basins 1 the main stream of the songhua river 2 the second songhua river and 3 the nenjiang basins the second songhua river and the nenjiang are the southern and northern sources of the main stream of the songhua river respectively mu et al 2012 the current study emphasized the main stream of songhua river gauged at harbin gauging station that covers an area of 53 600 km2 and is located in the middle of the srb fig 1 this sub basin is the main agricultural area of the region and stands at an elevation of 80 1666 m a s l the mean annual precipitation in the selected basin ranges from 400 to 700 mm while mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 5 c faiz et al 2018 song et al 2015 according to hydrological bureau of harbin the mean monthly discharge at the yilan gauge station is 18 228 mcm the daily datasets for climate variables such as relative humidity temperature minimum and maximum wind speed precipitation evaporation and sunshine hours from 1961 to 2016 for ten climatic stations were obtained from the harbin metrological department heilongjiang province china fig 1 the quality of the data had already been reviewed by the harbin metrological department the daily discharge datasets gauged at yilan station for the period of 1988 to 2016 were also obtained from the harbin hydrological department fig 1 moreover historical outputs of seven gcms with different resolutions for precipitation 1961 to 2005 and outputs of gcms for the period of 2006 to 2010 under representative concentration pathway 2 6 rcp 2 6 from different institutes were also downloaded from https pcmdi llnl gov search cmip5 and these data were provided by the world climate research program table 1 the rcp 2 6 represents the lowest rcp scenario rogelj et al 2012 therefore in this study rcp 2 6 was taken for making ensemble of gcms to force hydrological models for the period of 1988 to 2010 these seven models performed well during a previous evaluation and projection of future changes in precipitation and temperature in china sun et al 2015 3 methods 3 1 linear scaling section 1 discussed a few bias correction methods for gcms that were needed because of their coarse resolution however linear scaling provides the simplest and easiest method of correcting the biases in gcms as a result a number of researchers worldwide have used linear scaling for bias correction of rcms and gcms lenderink et al 2007 mahmood and babel 2013 mahmood and shaofeng 2016 piani et al 2010a 2010b with these correction methods authors usually calculate scale factors on a monthly basis which limits its usefulness in exploring daily variations in the data in the modified linear scaling method the temporal resolution of scaling factors increased during the transition from a monthly to a daily basis by using eq 1 1 p c d a i l y p r a w d a i l y μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y where p c d a i l y is the corrected daily precipitation time series for any period e g 1990 2005 p r a w d a i l y is the raw daily precipitation simulated by a gcm for the period 1990 2005 p o b s d a i l y is the daily observed precipitation for the control period e g 1961 1975 and μ is the expectation operator for example μ p o b s d a i l y is the average value of precipitation for a given day in this proposed method 365 scales factors μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y were obtained from long term daily observed precipitation and gcm precipitation instead of 12 scaled factors intensive care is required at the time of calculating scale factors because they depend on the annual cycle of a gcm before applying the corrected precipitation data to hydrological models the modified linear scale method was used to evaluate the observed precipitation data for this purpose the observed and gcms data were divided into two sets a control and the scenario periods as defined above then mean daily scale factors for the control period were obtained by applying the formula μ p o b s d a i l y μ p r a w d a i l y before applying these scale factors using eq 1 a gaussian filter mitchell et al 1966 was applied by matlab to smooth the scale factors different filters such as running average low high and band pass filters can be used to smooth data chatfield 2016 in gaussian filter the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution can be related to 50 of frequency response of the filter therefore an appropriate gaussian distribution has standard distribution σ g λ 0 5 6 λ 0 5 is desired wave length the weights of the filter can be obtained by sampling the probability distribution functions of the standard normal distribution at t values 0 1 σ g 2 σ g 3 σ g in this study a wavelength of 30 years is taken to get a gaussian filter with frequency response of 0 5 for more detail of application of gaussian filter we refer readers to the paper of mitchell et al 1966 furthermore the monthly scale factors μ p o b s m o n t h l y μ p r a w m o n t h l y were also calculated to find the difference in downscaled data see fig 2 a for clarification it could be seen that from days 180 to 270 the monthly scale factors ranged from 1 7 to 2 2 while daily scale factors have different ranges this indicate that correction of gcms with monthly scale factors for a particular month might correct the mean values of that month but there might be different daily values for that month finally smooth scale factors were adjusted with daily precipitation of each gcm to obtain the correct gcm data for each station in the srb a graphical presentation of the corrected precipitation by daily scale and monthly factors for the bcc csm 1 1 m model is presented fig 2b c the corrected precipitation with daily scale factor is more consistent and accurate compared to monthly scale factors for more robust assessment the corrected precipitation determined by the modified linear scaling method based on daily scale factors was also evaluated using a taylor diagram a taylor diagram is a brief summary of the evaluation of the observed and simulated data in terms of the root mean square difference correlation and ratio of variances taylor 2001 the results show that the corrected daily precipitation data had good agreement and correlation between the observed and downscaled precipitation fig 3 3 2 quantile mapping the quantile mapping qm is a non parametric bias correction method this method is applicable for distributions of precipitation without any assumption on precipitation distribution this particular bias correction approach is based on empirical transformation and successfully implemented to correct the biases of rcms precipitation fang et al 2015 jakob themeßl et al 2011 sun et al 2011 the effective advantage of this method is to correct biases in quantiles wet day frequency mean and standard deviation the bias correction of gcms based on quantile mapping can be expressed based on empirical distribution function and inverse of empirical distribution function fang et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2012 piani et al 2010a 2010b 2 p c o r r e c t d a i l y e c d f o b s m o n t h 1 e c d f r a w m o n t h p r a w d a i l y where ecd f o b s m o n t h 1 represents the inverse cumulative distribution function of mean value of observed precipitation at given month m ecd f r a w m o n t h represents cumulative distribution function of mean value of non corrected gcm simulated precipitation at given month m and p r a w d a i l y is the raw daily precipitation simulated by a gcm at a given month 3 3 hydrological models the hydrological conditions in the srb were modeled using five hydrological models weap nam gr4j hbv and swat these five models were selected because they employed different runoff routing methods the brief description of each model and the related input parameters are summarized in table 2 the hydrological models were forced with observational data and the precipitation simulated in an ensemble of seven gcms including other climatic parameters that were fixed during the analysis such as temperature minimum maximum relative humidity and wind speed the calibration 1988 2010 and validation 2011 2016 of the hydrological models were carried out by stream flow gauging at yilan station that is located at the end of the main stream of the basin 4 results and discussions 4 1 performance evaluation of raw gcms the performance of daily mean precipitation for the raw gcms without correction for the period of 1961 1990 was evaluated by comparing that data with observed daily precipitation data for this purpose statistical indicators such as 1 the correlation co efficient r 2 error between mean of observed and gcm and 3 error between standard deviations of observed and gcm were calculated for the entire study area these statistical indicators were mostly used for performance evaluation of observational data against gcm data mahmood and babel 2013 mahmood and shaofeng 2016 to investigate the basin wide pattern of precipitation captured by gcms the mean monthly observational data and gcms data were plotted by taking the arithmetic mean of the observed and all the gcms grids that covered the basin the indicators were calculated based on daily time series raw precipitation data of seven gcms against the observational data all the gcms predicted a correlation of less than 0 50 the remaining indicators exhibited poor performance of all gcms in the region the errors in standard deviation and errors in mean ranged from 0 3 to 0 90 mm day and 0 2 to 0 8 mm day respectively table 3 the poor performance of gcms shows that raw gcms cannot be used for an analysis at either the basin or regional scale the mean monthly precipitation of all seven gcms against observed precipitation is presented in fig 4 a this graphical presentation revealed that somehow all models overestimated the predicted precipitation moreover the performance of gcms showed well agreement when bias corrected with daily scale factors compared to monthly scale factors fig 4b c 4 2 performance evaluation of gcms by modified linear scaling and quantile mapping methods according to the application of impact study different statistics could be used for evaluation of downscaling or bias correction methods such as temporal characteristics or intensity metrics maraun et al 2010 the mean variance percentile percentage wet wet and dry spell length and peak over threshold are commonly used statistics for bias corrected precipitation chen et al 2012 khan and coulibaly 2010 wetterhall et al 2006 the statistics calculated for corrected gcms with modified linear scaling of mean daily and mean monthly precipitation as well as quantile mapping for the period of 1961 90 are presented in table 4 the results demonstrate a good agreement between the corrected gcms and observational data in the basin the results indicate that means and variances were well improved when compared with raw gcms even the corrected gcms show better improvement when the statistics were calculated for quantile mapping method to examine the performance of corrected versus observational data the statistics for different seasons winter spring summer autumn and annual were also calculated for this purpose the precipitation threshold value was assumed 1 0 mm it is evident that quantile mapping showed better performance than linear scaling during analysis it was observed that quantile mapping caused an overwhelming advantage to linear scaling because most statistics exhibited better performance for quantile mapping than those of linear scaling table 4 for example wet day percentage and maximum dry day spell in winter and summer maximum wet day spell and peak over threshold in winter spring and annual showed better statistics than linear scaling methods in the current analysis precipitation corrected by daily scale factors was also compared with precipitation bias corrected by monthly scale factors table 4 the results indicate that daily scale factors exhibited an improvement in means and variances as well as percentage wet based on the statistics calculated for the period of 1961 90 precipitation time series the main purpose of modification in linear scaling was to correct the daily variation in the precipitation time series although both linear scaling methods showed an overestimation in the most of statistics results precipitation time series data corrected by daily scale factors somehow proved similar to the correction carried out by quantile mapping the graphical presentation and statistics showed that the modified linear scaling method and quantile mapping performed better than original linear scaling and can be used in daily precipitation time series that are based hydrological models fig 5 4 3 calibration and validation of hydrological models using observational data the performance of hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat was checked for the srb region based on observational data additionally non dimensional criteria such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 and pearson correlation coefficient lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 were also computed between observed and simulated runoff by using hydrological models the predicted values were calibrated using correction factors that generate predicted values that were consistent with the observed values while validation was done to judge the performance of each model using observational data that was not used during the calibration process and time period in this study the hydrological models are classified into two categories a lumped rainfall runoff models b semi distributed and distributed hydrological models a lumped rainfall runoff models to evaluate the best performance of gr4j the model was calibrated several times to obtain the best parameter values if new parameters provided better results than the previous ones the previous parameters were replaced by the new ones this procedure continued until the best values were obtained during the calibration period the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was not greater than 0 62 for the period from 1988 to 2010 likewise during the validation period the nse was never less than 0 64 the graphical representation of calibration and validation period is presented in fig 6 it was noted that gr4j model underestimates the peak flow while low flow showed a little bit over estimate this under and over estimation of flow directly related to model parameters for example during the calibration it was observed that the parameter x4 which is related to unit hydrograph is most sensitive to high flows while x2 that is related to groundwater is sensitive to low flows the parameters x1 production store and x3 routing store were sensitive to target function nse because target function is a statistical measure that calculate the performance of simulated and observed flows the results suggested that sensitivity of these four parameters could not be ignored because all these parameters directly affect the hydrograph lerat et al 2012 also confirm that stability of these four parameters is a primary importance at the time of applying gr4j in operational conditions the nam model was run for the same time period 1988 2010 to obtain the optimized parameter values for the basin during calibration the nse value was obtained as 0 73 likewise the value of nse was found to be 0 80 for the validation period during analysis the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated data for nam was never less than 0 80 while for gr4j the minimum correlation coefficient was found to be 0 70 table 5 during analysis it was also observed that for the nam model the parameters for the overland flow runoff coefficient lmax and ck1k2 were the most sensitive and had the most influence on the process of predicting discharge for instance it was revealed that increasing the lmax value tends to decrease the simulated accumulated volume as well as decrease in the simulated hydrograph peak and vice versa the overland flow runoff coefficient which divides the excess rainfall into overland flow and infiltration also had a substantial effect in this case the coefficient value close to zero showed a drastic decrease in the overland flow volume while a value close to or greater than 0 3 demonstrated the best agreement between simulated and observed discharges ck1 2 generally controls the hydrograph peak the analysis found that the most suitable value of ck1 2 was 16 showing the most appropriate match for predicting the discharge amount the optimized calibrated values for models are presented in table 6 moreover nam model captured the peak flow hydrograph better than the gr4j model fig 6 b semi distributed and distributed hydrological models the evaluation of semi distributed and distributed hydrological model at the time of calibration and validation for the period of 1988 to 2016 is presented in figs 7 8 the weap model was auto calibrated by the parameter estimation tool the nse value for the period from 1988 to 2010 was 0 83 while during the validation period the values were never less than 0 88 the high nse values could be caused by the maximum variables of the input data precipitation temperature etc and by the fact that there was less variation in this data compare to daily input data during the calibration process soil water capacity and deep conductivity were found to be the most sensitive parameters which directly affect the hydrograph peak the hbv model ran for the same period and the nse value was found 0 80 while during the validation period the nse value was never less than 0 82 during analysis it was observed that parameters such as maxbas k1 and uzl were most influencing on high flow than the volume balance especially k1 ko and uzl that control interflow and overland flow the influence of these parameters on catchment in the form of changing of peak flow hydrograph abebe et al 2010 studied the sensitivity function of hbv model in the leaf river watershed of united states and concluded that parameters from transformation routine i e maxbas ko k1 and uzl directly influence the peak flows for swat model calibration of stream flow was done on daily time steps for the period of 1988 to 2010 the model well simulated the stream flow in the entire catchments the best nse value was found 0 81 while for validation period 2011 2016 the nse value was never less than 0 80 the calibration was done considering sensitive flow parameter that are described in table 6 for realistic simulation of stream flow the model parameters were manually adjusted and this procedure continued until the best values were obtained during the analysis the model parameters that directly influenced the surface runoff such as curve number cn2 soil water capacity sol awc and evaporation factor esco respectively high value of curve number reduces the base flow and increases the surface runoff while sol awc has inverse relation with hydric balance for example high value of sol awc reduces the amount of available water for percolation and surface runoff because high sol awc helps the soil maintain its humidity the correlation coefficient for distributed and semi distributed model was never less than 0 80 found during the whole simulation compared to observed stream flow table 5 moreover the semi distributed and distributed models well captured the peak flow compared to lumped models fig 9 this also suggested that consideration of distributed characteristics of land use geology topography is necessary for well assessment of hydrological process 4 4 comparison between hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat with the weap model the best nse value for the validation period was 0 88 similarly for the hbv and swat models it was 0 82 and 0 80 while for lumped models i e nam and gr4j the nse value was 0 80 and 0 64 respectively the hydrological models could not determine the origin of runoff in a reliable manner as a result it is necessary to compare the performance of hydrological models by a sensitive climatic input parameter such as precipitation for this purpose we employed 1988 to 2010 as a trial period based on an ensemble of corrected precipitation from seven gcms and other climatic parameters remained the same as the input in each model to evaluate the performance of hydrological models the percentage change in the variation of discharge that was calculated from five hydrological models based on forcing an ensemble of gcms are presented in fig 10 the results show that the change in variation in predicted discharge by swat was 3 qm and 13 linear scaling while those for hbv weap nam and gr4j were 2 25 6 3 4 29 7 29 respectively when compared with observed discharge under the same conditions the large reduction of projected discharge by models may have been associated with the bias correction method but models performed satisfactory when corrected precipitation by quantile method is used the srb experiences a harsh environment such as long cold winters with snow and short summers with days of heavy rain this was the first time these hydrological models have been used in this environment the satisfactory performance of gr4j based on nse statistics is caused by its limitations as pointed by perrin et al 2003 for example model does not work well when some key processes are active on a catchment such as if the catchment is significantly influenced by snow karstic influences catchment with dams and dry environments since the rainfall runoff relationship is much more non linear merz et al 2009 study the scale effects in conceptual hydrological modeling and concluded that some parameters may not be well estimated due to larger uncertainties that are associated with internal state variables the swat hbv weap and nam models displayed good performance in the srb which was confirmed by the nse values of greater than 0 80 respectively to analyze the performance of bias correction methods the long term monthly average was also taken for simulated stream flow fig 11 the results revealed that hydrological models forced by bias correction of gcms with quantile mapping well captured the peak flow of august only nam and hbv under estimated the peak flow in contrast the stream flow simulation based on precipitation extracted from ensembles of gcms that were corrected with linear scaling failed in capturing satisfactory peak flow the simulated stream flow was showing more spread in the winter months jan feb compared to summer months the peak flow curve with respect to base flow indicated that lumped models failed to capture peak flow compared to semi distributed and distributed models 4 5 projection of precipitation and stream flow for the period of 2070 2099 under rcp 8 5 the projected precipitation and stream flow variations for the period of 2070 to 2099 is presented in fig 12 for this purpose gcms under high emission scenario i e rcp 8 5 were used the radiating forcing in this scenario was expected to increase by 8 5 w m 2 at the end of 21st century compared to other pathways taylor et al 2012 based on results section 4 4 the bias in the gcms were corrected with quantile mapping method because this method showed good agreement with observations compared to linear scaling the results based on sen s slope estimator sen 1968 revealed that precipitation expected to increase 1 56 mm year the simulated monthly corrected precipitation plotted against the corresponding base line period 1961 to 1990 suggest that models are able to predict realistic precipitation cycle most of the models well produced the single peak the maximum precipitation was predicted in the summer season except cancm4 and ccsm4 the previous studies also documented that precipitation trend increases in the basin sun et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 furthermore the hydrological models were forced by predicted precipitation to estimate the variation in stream flow for far future period 2071 2099 the results exhibited that maximum increase in stream flow weap 25 and minimum 3 gr4j found with respect to base line period 1988 2016 4 6 uncertainties in climate change and hydrological impact studies there are number of uncertainties which are associated with quality of data and method used including model structure and parameters bosshard et al 2013 leng et al 2015 in this study historical outputs of gcms from cmip5 and gcms under rcp 2 6 and 8 5 were used to analyze the differences and comparison between hydrological models although the gcms were converted into common resolution of 0 5 0 5 and biases were corrected with linear scaling and quantile mapping methods but the accuracy was still uncertain the uncertainties related to hydrological models also influenced on the climate impact studies although different hydrological models were used to assess the stream flow variation in the basin but reliability of input data is important for accurate reflection of hydrological conditions for example digital elevation model soil map and land use maps have a resolution of 1 km which may not represent the parameters heterogeneity moreover agricultural and human management practices that have a significant effect on stream flow could be considered for comprehensive planning of water resources as well as to understand the hydrological process of the basin in addition to limitations and uncertainties the novelty of this study is application of multiple hydrological models gcms and bias correction methods were used to assess the variation in stream flow 5 conclusions in this article the hydrological models gr4j weap nam hbv and swat and gcms were used in the srb the performances of gcms were evaluated by bias correction methods the quantile mapping and linear scaling methods were used to translate gcms outputs at the site scale in this study for gcms precipitation simulations daily and monthly scale factors were used to improve the daily variation in precipitation furthermore hydrological models were forced by precipitation from an ensemble of bias corrected gcms the performance of the hydrological models were evaluated by correlation coefficient and nse criteria to evaluate the gcms seven gcms bcc csm 1 1 m bnu esm canesm2 ipsl cm5a lr giss e2 h ccsm4 and micro esm chem were obtained covering the srb moreover statistical indicators and graphical representation were also used for evaluation period 1961 1990 before applying the bias correction method raw gcms were plotted against the observational data the results showed that none of gcm performed better against the observational data after applying the modified bias correction in which daily scale factors were obtained and quantile mapping method an improvement was observed in all statistical indicators in comparison with the bias correction method in which monthly scale factors were obtained less improvement was observed than with the modified linear scaling and quantile mapping bias correction method to evaluate the hydrological models the models were forced by using both observed and bias corrected precipitation data when analyzing the performance of the models using observed precipitation data the final correlation coefficient and nse criterion values were found for the weap 0 86 and 0 83 the grj4 0 67 and 0 62 the nam 0 80 and 0 73 the hbv 0 86 and 0 80 and the swat 0 82 and 0 81 respectively however with bias corrected precipitation data the results showed variation and changes in the predicted discharge amounts by the swat 3 13 while results for the hbv 2 25 nam 4 29 gr4j 7 29 and weap 6 3 were comparable to the observed predicted discharge amounts the differences in projection of discharge may be related to biases of the gcms or usage of bias correction method moreover the projected precipitation results revealed that precipitation expected to increase 1 56 mm year and stream flow 3 to 25 with respect to base line for the period of 2071 2099 in summary this study stresses that hydrological models contribute notably to the variations in the projection of discharge in the srb therefore future studies should consider employing multiple hydrological models instead of using single model to conduct future planning and management of agricultural activities

7028,multiple uncertainty sources directly cause inaccurate simulations for water related processes in complicated integrated models as such models include many interactive modules a majority of existing studies focus on the uncertainties of parameter and model structure and their effects on the model performance for a single process e g hydrological cycle or water quality however comprehensive uncertainties of different modules and their propagations are poorly understood particularly for the integrated water system model this study proposes a framework of uncertainty and its propagation estimation for integrated water system model heqm by coupling the bootstrap resampling method and sce ua auto calibration technique parameter and structure uncertainties of both hydrological cycle and water quality modules are estimated including final distributions of parameters and simulation uncertainty intervals additionally the effect of uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters is investigated results show that 1 heqm simulates daily hydrograph very well with the coefficient of efficiency of 0 81 and also simulates the daily concentrations of ammonia nitrogen satisfactorily with the coefficient of efficiency of 0 50 by auto calibration in the case study area 2 the final ranges of all interested hydrological parameters are reduced obviously and all the parameter distributions are well defined and show skew the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation at the 95 confidence level bracket 18 7 of all the runoff observations due to uncertainties of parameter and 86 0 due to both parameter and module structure respectively 3 the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters changes the optimal values of 37 5 of interested water quality parameters but does not obviously change the water quality simulations which match well with the prior simulations throughout the period and bracket only 1 7 of observations at the 95 confidence level due to the further introduction of module structure uncertainties 94 8 of observations are bracketed only except the extreme high and low water quality concentrations 4 the uncertainty of water quality parameters contributes 12 1 of total water quality simulations at the 95 confidence level the figure increases to 21 0 and 92 0 if the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters structure uncertainties of water quality module are considered respectively therefore although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation contribute a certain proportion of the whole simulation uncertainties the module structure itself is the primary uncertainty source for the integrated water system model heqm particular for the water quality modules keywords uncertainty propagation model

to the rapid growth of environmental science and the constantly emerging water issues e g drought flooding erosion pollution and ecological degradation gwsp 2005 integrated consideration or simulation of multiple water related processes become a new trend along with further explorations of interaction mechanisms among multiple processes rapid developments of computer facilities and observation techniques of multiple data sources paola et al 2006 zhang et al 2016a b many successful model integrations have been implemented with different objectives in the earth system studies for example land surface models e g vic variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 could be coupled with hydrological models to reveal interactions and feedbacks between atmosphere and hydrology at large scale similarly hydrological models e g swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 could be coupled with soil erosion or biogeochemical processes to reveal precipitation induced losses of water soil and nutrient from lands to river networks hydrological models are also able to be couple with hydrodynamic and water quality models of water bodies i e rivers or lakes to capture the migrations of waterborne variables with high spatial and temporal resolutions such as efdc environmental fluid dynamic code hamrick 1992 ecosystem models epic erosion productivity impact calculator sharpley and williams 1990 dndc denitrification decomposition li et al 1992 could also be coupled with evapotranspiration model and soil biogeochemical model to reveal vegetation growth processes with considerations of nutrient and water stresses furthermore integrated water system model is proposed and usually formed as a chain of water related modules to capture the interactions and feedbacks among physical biological and geochemical processes as well as the impacts of water related human activities gwsp 2005 such as clm series community land model dai et al 2003 however not all the processes are physically interpreted by mathematical equations due to the current insufficient knowledge willems 2008 empirical conceptualization and theoretical simplification are usually adopted and are easy to introduce potential uncertainties of parameters and model structures into the complicated models todini 2007 freni et al 2009 for the integrated models that are made up of many modules multiple uncertainty sources of upstream modules are transferred to the downstream modules as inputs freni et al 2008 therefore along with the increasing of coupled modules multiple uncertainty sources from different modules not only affect the simulation performance of their own modules but also might be accumulated and propagated to subsequent modules and thus distort their performances and even the whole model for example in the applications of integrated water quantity and quality models water quality simulation performance is not usually satisfying using the step by step calibration approach even though the water quality modules are well formulated which is probably caused by the uncertainty or error propagation from upstream modules zhang et al 2016b it is critical to investigate the estimations of uncertainty sources of different modules and their propagation as well as their effects on simulation performance large majorities of studies are implemented to identify model uncertainty sources and assess their effects on model performance the identified uncertainty sources mainly include model parameter uncertainty beven and binley 1992 bates and campbell 2001 beven and freer 2001 yang et al 2007 li et al 2010a b leta et al 2015 and model structure uncertainty beven and binley 1992 refsgaard et al 2006 li et al 2010a most of the existing techniques are categorized into two classes i e 1 the frequentist approach with model calibration techniques e g shuffled complex evolution sce ua particle swarm optimization pso which is advantageous to be implemented without timing consumption and the representative techniques are glue procedure generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 and parameter

engeland and gottschalk 2002 gallagher and doherty 2007 and only focus on the inherent uncertainties of single process model or model structure e g hydrological models beven and binley 1992 bates and

2018 the comprehensive uncertainty estimations in the integrated model of multiple processes are still deficient furthermore most of existing studies about uncertainty propagation analysis are limited to the impact assessments of observation quality on model performances which are induced by potential errors from sampling instrument laboratory observation method or algorithm harmel et al 2006 xu et al 2006 leta et al 2015 the related uncertainties include uncertainties associated with model inputs e g climate variables geographic information crosetto et al 2001 gabellani et al 2007 shao et al 2012 yen et al 2014 novic et al 2018 and observations used for the model calibration e g flow regime water quality variables harmel et al 2006 shao et al 2014 yen et al 2014 both of two uncertainty sources are propagated and probably distort the probability distributions of model parameters and thus disturb the capability of integrated models to portray the real world particularly for the simulations of subsequent modules for example harmel et al 2006 examined that the probable uncertainties for observed variables ranged from 6 to 19 for streamflow from 11 to 100 for nh4 n from 11 to 104 for total nitrogen tn and from 8 to 110 for total phosphorous tp among which the contributions of sample collection preservation storage and laboratory analysis were from 4 to 48 from 2 to 16 and from 5 to 21 respectively however only a few studies are reported about the uncertainty propagation investigation among different modules particularly for integrated water system models the main purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess the uncertainties of multiple modules and their propagations among different modules for complicated integrated water system models as a typical integrated water system model heqm hydrological ecological and water quality model is adopted to investigate the effect of multiple uncertainty sources on parameter distributions and simulation performances of both hydrological and water quality modules the specific objectives are to 1 propose a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty sources and their propagations for heqm by using bootstrap resampling with sce ua optimization technique 2 estimate the probability distributions of hydrological parameters and uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation caused by uncertainties of parameters and module structures 3 estimate the probability distributions of water quality parameters and uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation caused by parameter uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle module 4 estimate the probability distributions of water quality parameters and uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation caused by uncertainties of parameter and module structure this study is expected to extend the scope of model uncertainty analysis and assist modelers in further improvements and calibrations of complicated integrated models of multiple processes 2 models and methodology 2 1 integrated water system model heqm heqm is an integrated water system model proposed by zhang et al 2016a in order to investigate hydrological cycle processes its

are given in zhang et al 2016a and the detailed interactions between hydrological cycle and water quality processes are summarized in zhang et al 2016b and the supplementary material in order to consider spatial heterogeneities of catchment attributes and vegetation coverage three categories of spatial calculation units are designed including sub basin catchment land use land cover and crop the sub basin catchment unit is divided based on the digital elevation model dem using the spatial analyst tools of arcgis software the sub basin catchment unit is divided into the land use land cover unit according to the national land use land cover classification china s national standard 2007 and seven user defined types of land use land cover are considered for each sub basin catchment the land use land cover unit e g paddy dryland agriculture orchard where the agricultural activities occur is further divided into the crop unit the detailed functions of different spatial calculation units and their related modules are given in zhang et al 2016a 2 2 framework of uncertainty propagation analysis 2 2 1 model residual and model performance assessment model residual is the discrepancies between the simulated and observed variables it is formulated as 1 ε t o t s t s t f θ where ε t is the simulated variable residual o t and s t are the observed and simulated variables at time t the interested simulated variables are runoff and ammonia nitrogen concentration nh4 n in our study f θ is the mathematical expression for the variables from relevant heqm modules with θ being the estimated value of unknown parameter θ for runoff simulation θ q θ q 1 θ q 2 θ q pq and pq is the number of interested hydrological parameters for the nh4 n simulation θ c θ c 1 θ c 2 θ c pc and pc is the number of interested water quality parameters root mean square error rmse is adopted as the objective function for the auto optimizations of hydrological and water quality parameters because it is straightforward and widely used zhang et al 2016b the model performance is close to the optimal if rmse approaches to 0 0 additionally three other statistics are used to further evaluate the model performances including normalized bias nbias correlation coefficient r and coefficient of efficiency ns because several simulation performance ratings are usually divided based on these statistics such as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory according to the existing studies e g moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b all the equations are given as follows 2 root mean square error rmse r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 3 normalized bias nbias n b i a s i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 4 correlation coefficient r r i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 5 coefficient of efficiency ns n s 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o and s are the average values of observed and simulated variables respectively n is the total length of time series according to the model performance evaluation in zhang et al 2016b the runoff simulation performance is at the satisfactory rating if the statistic values are between 0 15 and 0 25 or between 0 25 and 0 15 for nbias between 0 75 and 0 80 for r and between 0 50 and 0 60 for ns and the performance is at the very good rating if the statistic values are between 0 10 and 0 10 for nbias greater than 0 85 for r and greater than 0 75 for ns for the nh4 n concentration simulation the performance is at the satisfactory rating if the statistic values are between 0 30 and 0 50 or between 0 50 and 0 30 for nbias between 0 75 and 0 80 for r and between 0 50 and 0 60 for ns and the performance is at the very good rating if the statistic values are between 0 15 and 0 15 for nbias greater than 0 85 for r and greater than 0 75 for ns 2 2 2 auto optimization algorithm and bootstrap method shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona sce ua is a powerful global optimization strategy based on a synthesis of best features of controlled random search competitive evolution and coupled with a newly complex shuffling duan et al 1994 this strategy is originally designed to solve the auto optimization problems of water related models duan et al 1992 and has been widely accepted so far due to its efficiency and effectiveness as well as its open sources arsenault et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 bootstrap is a nonparametric method for statistic estimation and its distribution testing proposed by professor efron 1979 the major feature of this method is that the sampling distribution of some pre specified random variables can be estimated on the basis of the original samples even though the true probability distribution is unknown it is a sample augmentation method and able to fully utilize the information of original samples which is strongly advantageous to solve the sampling problems when only small samples are available it has been widely used in hydrological community such as

adamson 1989 hu et al 2015 and risk analysis wucchini and adamson 1988 for both sce ua and bootstrap methods sufficient resampling is needed and the specific resampling of both two methods in our

5 t o t 7 p 95 c i n o in n 100 where s 97 5 and s 2 5 are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentages of maxb groups of runoff or water quality simulation series noin is the number of observations which are bracketed in the 95 confidence interval smaller values of aril indicate the uncertainty intervals are very narrow and the greater values of p 95ci indicate the uncertainty intervals are very reliable jin et al 2010 li et al 2010b the optimal values of aril and p 95ci are 0 00 and 95 respectively 2 3 study area and model setup shaying river catchment 111 56 116 31 e 32 28 34 54 n is the largest catchment of huai river basin with the total drainage area of 36 651 km2 fig s2 in the supplementary material as the major grain producing area of the huai river basin the dominating land use type is the agricultural land accounting for 85 of the total catchment area it is also the congeries of highly polluted cottage industries such as papermaking fertilizer leather chemistry and dipdye over 0 25 tons of industry wastewater per year are discharged into shaying river in which the emission loads of nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod are beyond the water environmental capacity of most streams zhang et al 2015 fuyang station 115 50 e 32 54 n located at the downstream of shaying river is selected as the outlet of our study area its control area accounts for 94 9 of the whole shaying river catchment it is a critical hydrological and water quality station of shaying river where water quality condition obviously affects that of the huai mainstream zhang et al 2015 the detailed procedure of heqm setup for fuyang controlled catchment is introduced in zhang et al 2016b involving sub catchment delineation and interpolation of climate and socio economic data the essential data sources are also provided in the supplementary material paddy dryland agriculture forest grass water urban and unused lands are considered as the land use land cover units of heqm in our study the daily runoff and nh4 n concentration from 2003 to 2005 are selected as the simulated variables of water quantity and quality respectively and the first half year from 1st january 2003 to 1st june 2003 is set as the warm up period for water quality simulation in the integrated framework nine interested hydrological parameters and eight water quality parameters of heqm table 1 are selected according to the previous studies e g zhang et al 2016b for calibration and uncertainty analysis i e pq 9 and pc 8 the related parameters are soil field capacity wfc soil saturation moisture capacity wsat basic runoff coefficient g1 and influence coefficient of soil moisture g2 for different land use types adjustment factor of evapotranspiration ket interflow yield coefficient kr delay time for aquifer recharge tg baseflow yield coefficient kg soil steady state infiltration rate fc for the hydrological cycle modules and settling rate of nh4 n at 20 c in reservoir kset nh4 cod deoxygenation rate at 20 c in

water quality simulation residual groups are implemented by the bootstrap method and the significant level is set as 5 i e maxb 1000 and α 5 in the sce ua algorithm the maximum iterations are set as 2000 for runoff calibration and 6000 for water quality calibration respectively while the other parameters are set as the default values in order to enhance the calculation efficiency 20 parallel optimizations are implemented with 50 residual groups each 3 results 3 1 model auto calibration the selected hydrological and water quality parameters of heqm are auto calibrated step by step using the sce ua approach the selected hydrological θ q and water quality θ c parameters are converged to the optimal values i e θ q and θ c the simulated daily hydrograph matches very well with the observations with the nbias r and ns of 0 01 0 90 and 0 81 fig 2 a and table 2 the simulated nh4 n performance is relatively good for the whole records with the nbias r and ns of 0 26 0 80 and 0 50 respectively the major deviations between simulations and observations are in the pre flood season january to may when the simulated nh4 n concentrations are underestimated fig 2b the probable explanation is that heqm neglects river sediment resuspension which is a frequent event and contributes high pollutant concentration during the pre flood season due to the sluice regulation for the flood discharge zhang et al 2015 according to the evaluation criteria in moriasi et al 2007 and zhang et al 2016b the heqm performance is at the very good rating for daily runoff simulation and at the satisfactory rating for daily nh4 n concentration simulation respectively 3 2 uncertainty estimation of hydrological cycle modules 3 2 1 hydrological parameter estimations the marginal final distributions of all the selected hydrological parameters are well defined and obey the skew distributions fig 3 among which those of wmc wm kg2 kr tg and krg show the positive skewness with the values from 0 061 wmc to 1 023 kg2 and the others show the negative skewness with the values from 0 022 fc to 0 530 ketp table 3 compared with the initial ranges of parameter values all the final ranges at the 95 confidence interval are shortened remarkably the change of ketp is the greatest with the reduction ratio of 70 1 while the change of krg is the least with the reduction ratio of 19 0 additionally the optimal parameter value is close to the median value for wmc kg1 ketp kr tg and fc to the minimum value for wm and to the maximum value for kg2 and krg 3 2 2 uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation fig 4 a shows the comparison between runoff observations and simulations at the 95 confidence interval due to parameter uncertainties the aril is 0 37 which is close to the corresponding optimal value 0 0 it indicates that the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation due to parameter uncertainties are quite narrow furthermore although only a few observations are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals i e p 95ci 18 7 the simulation performance is still very good with the nbias r and ns from 0 08 to 0 01 0 89 to 0 90 and 0 79 to 0 81 respectively the runoff simulation uncertainties due to the uncertainties of parameter and module structure are also considered fig 4b the simulation uncertainty intervals at the 95 confidence level i e aril 3 66 are much wider than those intervals only due to the parameter uncertainties most of observations are bracketed i e p 95ci 86 0 table 4 except the peak flow observations in the flood season due to their underestimations by heqm therefore the improvement of hydrological cycle module is likely to capture more runoff observations but is still disadvantageous to predict the high flow whose uncertainty is probably caused by the uncertainties of model inputs or runoff observations as well as the regulation of downstream reservoirs and sluices nonetheless the statistics of model performance assessment are from 0 10 to 0 04 for nbias from 0 84 to 0 89 for r and from 0 70 to 0 78 for ns the runoff simulation performance of uncertainty intervals is still good 3 3 propagation effects of hydrological parameter uncertainties on water quality simulation 3 3 1 effects on estimations of water quality parameters all the selected water quality parameter groups are auto calibrated by fixing the hydrological parameter groups at the optimal values which are calibrated according to the new runoff series the marginal final distributions of water quality parameters are given in fig 5 compared to the initial ranges of all the selected parameters the ranges of final distributions are reduced remarkably with the ratios from 30 7 to 100 0 and the reductions of kset nh4 rd cod kd nh4 and rd nh4 are the most remarkable the final distributions of selected parameters also obey the skew distributions except kd cod the distributions of all the water quality parameters show the positive skewness with the values from 0 774 rd cod to 9 254 kset nh4 for kset nh4 kd nh4 rset cod rd nh4 and rset nh4 most of their optimal values according to the new runoff series are very close to their initial optimal values however most of the optimal values of rd cod rset orgn are close to their initial minimum values and only that of kd cod is close to the initial maximum value both of the minimum and maximum values are quite different from their initial optimal values therefore the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters does not seem to affect the distributions of kset nh4 kd nh4 rset cod rd nh4 and rset nh4 but obviously affect the distributions of rd cod rset orgn and kd cod 3 3 2 effects on water quality simulation performance the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation at the 95 confidence level are quite narrow with the aril of 0 045 fig 6 a and are very close to the optimal simulated values throughout the period except in april and may only 1 7 of observations are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals i e p 95ci 1 7 moreover the criteria of simulation performance assessment are from 0 17 to 0 23 for nbias from 0 75 to 0 78 for r and from 0 48 to 0 55 for ns table 4 compared with the initial auto calibration results the nbias is improved slightly while the r is weakened slightly therefore the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters also does not affect the performance of water quality simulation obviously furthermore fig 6b presents the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations due to the uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle parameters and uncertainty of water quality module structure with the introduction of module structure uncertainty the aril increases a lot i e 5 94 which is much wider than the intervals only caused by the parameter uncertainty propagation a large majority of observations p 95ci 94 8 are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals which is very close to the optimum of p 95ci 95 thus the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations are very robust by our proposed integrated framework however the extremely high and low observations of water quality concentrations are still not captured and the probable explanations are the uncertainties of model inputs or runoff observations as well as the module structures therefore the existing water quality modules of heqm still have a large potential to capture most of the observations by improving their module structures e g adopting more physical formulas to replace the conceptual or simplified formulas 3 4 uncertainty estimation of water quality modules 3 4 1 water quality parameter estimations the marginal final distributions of all the selected water quality parameters are well defined and obey the skew distributions fig 7 the final distributions of kset nh4 kd nh4 kd cod rd nh4 and rset orgn show the positive skewness with the values from 0 102 to 11 930 and the others i e rd cod rset cod rset nh4 show the negative skewness with the values from 0 175 to 1 278 compared with the initial ranges of parameter values all the ranges of final distributions at the 95 confidence interval are shortened remarkably the changes of kset nh4 kd nh4 and rd nh4 are the greatest whose reduction ratios are close to 100 while the change of rset nh4 is the least with the reduction ratio of 0 3 additionally most optimal values of kset nh4 kd nh4 and rd nh4 according to the new water quality series are very close to their initial optimal values furthermore most of the optimal values of rd cod and rset nh4 are close to the maximum values most of the optimal values of rset cod and kd cod are close to the median values and those of rset orgn are close to the minimum values all of these optimal values are quite different from the initial optimal values due to the parameter uncertainties compared with the marginal final distributions due to uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters those of kset nh4 kd nh4 rd nh4 and rset orgn are not changed obviously which account for 50 of the total selected water quality parameters however the marginal final distributions of rd cod rset cod and rset nh4 are changed from the negative to positive skewness while the change of kd cod distribution is the opposite 3 4 2 uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation the water quality simulations due to the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules at the 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 8 a the uncertainty intervals are quite narrow with the aril of only 0 12 compared with the observations only some observations in the flood season june september are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals and account for 12 1 of total observations i e p 95ci 12 1 table 4 all the simulation groups at the 95 confidence interval are underestimated particularly in the nonflood season october may with the ranges of nbias from 0 27 to 0 44 the temporal variations of simulations match well with the observations i e the ranges of r are from 0 72 to 0 77 but the ns is slightly weakened with the ranges from 0 23 to 0 46 the uncertainties at the 95 confidence interval become larger when the parameter uncertainties of hydrological cycle modules are involved fig 8b the aril is 0 41 much greater than that only caused by the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules i e aril 0 12 the most obvious changes appear in the nonflood season particular the pre flood season from january to may furthermore the p 95ci is also increased to 21 0 particularly in january and february due to the wider uncertainty intervals the model performance criteria range from 0 27 to 0 68 for nbias from 0 59 to 0 78 for r and from 0 25 to 0 46 for ns all the simulation groups at the 95 confidence interval are still underestimated and the temporal variations of simulations do not change obviously but the minimum ns decreases a lot moreover due to further consideration of structure uncertainties of water quality modules the 95 confidence interval becomes much wider fig 8c and the aril further increases to 5 94 moreover most of total observations are bracketed only except some high observations in april of the nonflood season the p 95ci is 92 0 which is also close to the optimum of p 95ci 95 thus the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations due to the uncertainties of parameters and module structures are very robust by our proposed integrated framework although both aril and p 95ci are much greater than those caused by parameter uncertainties of water quality modules 0 12 and 21 0 and parameter uncertainties of both hydrological and water quality modules 0 41 and 92 0 they are very close to or even the same with these values due to the uncertainties of parameters of hydrological cycle modules and structure of water quality modules compared with the effect of uncertainties of module structures the effect of parameter uncertainties is much smaller particularly for the parameter uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle module however the model performance becomes weaker with the ranges of nbias from 0 09 to 0 46 the ranges of r from 0 07 to 0 64 and the ranges of ns from 0 52 to 0 38 4 discussion our study proposes an assessment framework of uncertainty and its propagation for integrated water system models by coupling the frequentist approach with model auto calibration techniques i e the bootstrap method and sce ua both of which are robust and widely adopted in the uncertainty analysis and model calibration respectively efron 1979 duan et al 1992 1994 it is much easier to implement than the bayesian approach because the model residuals used for the uncertainty analysis are able to be resampled efficiently without extensive programming by the bootstrap package of the r platform and are further off line coupled with heqm furthermore it does not need to determinate the subjective acceptance threshold of likelihood function compared with the glue which is also a widely used approach blasone et al 2008 freni et al 2008 li et al 2010a although this approach is conducted based on a great number of model iterations the parallel optimization is advantageous to enhance the computation efficiency li et al 2010b shao et al 2012 the results present that 18 7 of the whole runoff simulation uncertainties are from the parameter uncertainties of hydrological cycle module of heqm and the figure increases to 86 0 if the uncertainties of module structure are considered further although a majority of uncertainties are probably from the model structures the parameter estimation is also a critical uncertainty source which causes the inaccurate simulation performance of runoff to some extent our finding is basically in agreement with many existing studies for example the uncertainties from parameter parameter and model structure contribute 18 8 and 82 3 of the total runoff simulation uncertainties for dtvgm distributed time variant gain model respectively in the chaobai river basin wang et al 2009 li et al 2010a and 12 1 44 1 and 79 2 for wasmod water and snow balance modelling system respectively in the central sweden engeland et al 2005 chao river basin li et al 2010a and shuntian basin jin et al 2010 additionally the parameter uncertainty contributes 10 0 13 0 of total runoff simulation uncertainties for swat in the chao river basin yang et al 2007 and yingluoxia watershed li et al 2010b in consideration of the interactions between hydrological and water quality processes the uncertainties of hydrological parameters are inevitable to cause the inaccurate simulations of subsequent water quality concentrations freni et al 2008 quinton et al 2010 our results further highlight this viewpoint by the uncertainty propagation analysis and show that the uncertainties of hydrological parameters introduce a certain simulation uncertainties of water quality by changing the final distributions of water quality parameters the most affected parameters are the deoxygenation or settling rates of water quality variables e g rd cod rset orgn and kd cod all of which are highly related with the runoff magnitude and velocity adrian and sanders 1998 marttila and klove 2010 freni et al 2011 jung et al 2015 although the module structure is the major uncertainty source the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters still slightly weakens the simulation performance of water quality concentration the uncertainties of water quality parameters and module structures themselves also contribute a proportion of simulation uncertainties of water quality for swat 71 85 of the total sediment simulation uncertainties at the 95 confidence interval abbaspour et al 2007 talebizadeh et al 2010 and over 75 of total phosphorous simulation uncertainties at the 90 confidence interval gong et al 2011 are caused by the uncertainties of parameters and model structures due to the ill posed water quality modules of the stormwater model simple karen only 22 8 28 8 of total simulation uncertainties of total suspended solids at the 90 confidence interval are from the uncertainties of parameters and model structures dotto et al 2012 our study investigates the uncertainties of parameters and module structures step by step and finds that 12 1 of total nh4 n simulation uncertainties are from the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules and 92 0 are from the uncertainties of parameters and module structures which are very close to the optimal uncertainties 95 thus the results calculated by our proposed framework are much more satisfying than those of above mentioned studies additionally the uncertainty propagation of module structure is not investigated in our study because besides the river flow routing numerous of other hydrological processes and their corresponding parameters are able to affect the simulation performance of water quality such as surface runoff generation soil water and its flow infiltration tesoriero et al 2009 fiener et al 2011 parajuli et al 2013 in this study all the selected parameters of hydrological cycle module are about the soil water runoff generation and baseflow in the sub catchments rather than the river routing parameters based on the parameter sensitivity analysis although the runoff simulation residuals are deduced the residuals of the other hydrological variables e g soil water evapotranspiration are not obtained due to the observation limitations thus the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation are only a part of the whole structure uncertainties of hydrological cycle modules and the others are still not available for the assessment of uncertainty propagation effects on the simulation performance of water quality in next work the assessment of uncertainty contributions of specific hydrological or water quality processes should be conducted in details to support the investigations of the uncertainty propagation of module structure in the integrated models 5 conclusions multiple uncertainties of a complicated integrated water system are investigated by integrating the bootstrap resampling method and auto calibration algorithm sce ua including uncertainties of parameter and structure of hydrological cycle modules parameter uncertainty propagation to the subsequent water quality modules as well as uncertainties of parameter and structure of water quality modules results show that heqm is able to simulate the daily runoff very well and the nh4 n concentration satisfactorily by the auto calibration the uncertainty interval of runoff simulation due to parameter uncertainties is narrow and only 18 7 of all the observations fall into the uncertainty intervals at the 95 confidence level the uncertainty intervals due to the uncertainties of parameter and module structure become much wider and 86 0 of all the observations mainly excluding some high flows fall into the 95 confidence interval moreover the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters does not obviously change the simulated variations of water quality concentrations throughout the period and only 1 7 of observations fall into the uncertainty intervals however the simulation uncertainty intervals are further increased obviously due to the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules and the proportions of observations falling into the confidence interval are increased from 12 1 to 21 0 along with the consideration of structure uncertainties of water quality modules the intervals are much wider and contain 92 0 of total observations only except the extreme high values the module structure error is still a major uncertainty source for both runoff and water quality simulations although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation cannot be ignored the model structure improvement is still the priority for the integrated water system modelling and can greatly improve the simulation performance of individual modules and reduce their uncertainty propagation more mechanism investigation should be strengthened and the empirical or simplified equations should be replaced by the physically or mathematically based equations for instance more types of land use land cover units should be designed in the hydrological cycle module of heqm to relieve the impacts of spatial heterogeneities based on the high spatial resolutions of vegetation coverage river sediment resuspension and deposition processes should be introduced in the water quality module to improve the simulation of water quality particularly during the flood season in the regulated rivers acknowledgements this study was supported by natural science foundation of

7028,multiple uncertainty sources directly cause inaccurate simulations for water related processes in complicated integrated models as such models include many interactive modules a majority of existing studies focus on the uncertainties of parameter and model structure and their effects on the model performance for a single process e g hydrological cycle or water quality however comprehensive uncertainties of different modules and their propagations are poorly understood particularly for the integrated water system model this study proposes a framework of uncertainty and its propagation estimation for integrated water system model heqm by coupling the bootstrap resampling method and sce ua auto calibration technique parameter and structure uncertainties of both hydrological cycle and water quality modules are estimated including final distributions of parameters and simulation uncertainty intervals additionally the effect of uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters is investigated results show that 1 heqm simulates daily hydrograph very well with the coefficient of efficiency of 0 81 and also simulates the daily concentrations of ammonia nitrogen satisfactorily with the coefficient of efficiency of 0 50 by auto calibration in the case study area 2 the final ranges of all interested hydrological parameters are reduced obviously and all the parameter distributions are well defined and show skew the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation at the 95 confidence level bracket 18 7 of all the runoff observations due to uncertainties of parameter and 86 0 due to both parameter and module structure respectively 3 the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters changes the optimal values of 37 5 of interested water quality parameters but does not obviously change the water quality simulations which match well with the prior simulations throughout the period and bracket only 1 7 of observations at the 95 confidence level due to the further introduction of module structure uncertainties 94 8 of observations are bracketed only except the extreme high and low water quality concentrations 4 the uncertainty of water quality parameters contributes 12 1 of total water quality simulations at the 95 confidence level the figure increases to 21 0 and 92 0 if the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters structure uncertainties of water quality module are considered respectively therefore although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation contribute a certain proportion of the whole simulation uncertainties the module structure itself is the primary uncertainty source for the integrated water system model heqm particular for the water quality modules keywords uncertainty propagation model

to the rapid growth of environmental science and the constantly emerging water issues e g drought flooding erosion pollution and ecological degradation gwsp 2005 integrated consideration or simulation of multiple water related processes become a new trend along with further explorations of interaction mechanisms among multiple processes rapid developments of computer facilities and observation techniques of multiple data sources paola et al 2006 zhang et al 2016a b many successful model integrations have been implemented with different objectives in the earth system studies for example land surface models e g vic variable infiltration capacity liang et al 1994 could be coupled with hydrological models to reveal interactions and feedbacks between atmosphere and hydrology at large scale similarly hydrological models e g swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 could be coupled with soil erosion or biogeochemical processes to reveal precipitation induced losses of water soil and nutrient from lands to river networks hydrological models are also able to be couple with hydrodynamic and water quality models of water bodies i e rivers or lakes to capture the migrations of waterborne variables with high spatial and temporal resolutions such as efdc environmental fluid dynamic code hamrick 1992 ecosystem models epic erosion productivity impact calculator sharpley and williams 1990 dndc denitrification decomposition li et al 1992 could also be coupled with evapotranspiration model and soil biogeochemical model to reveal vegetation growth processes with considerations of nutrient and water stresses furthermore integrated water system model is proposed and usually formed as a chain of water related modules to capture the interactions and feedbacks among physical biological and geochemical processes as well as the impacts of water related human activities gwsp 2005 such as clm series community land model dai et al 2003 however not all the processes are physically interpreted by mathematical equations due to the current insufficient knowledge willems 2008 empirical conceptualization and theoretical simplification are usually adopted and are easy to introduce potential uncertainties of parameters and model structures into the complicated models todini 2007 freni et al 2009 for the integrated models that are made up of many modules multiple uncertainty sources of upstream modules are transferred to the downstream modules as inputs freni et al 2008 therefore along with the increasing of coupled modules multiple uncertainty sources from different modules not only affect the simulation performance of their own modules but also might be accumulated and propagated to subsequent modules and thus distort their performances and even the whole model for example in the applications of integrated water quantity and quality models water quality simulation performance is not usually satisfying using the step by step calibration approach even though the water quality modules are well formulated which is probably caused by the uncertainty or error propagation from upstream modules zhang et al 2016b it is critical to investigate the estimations of uncertainty sources of different modules and their propagation as well as their effects on simulation performance large majorities of studies are implemented to identify model uncertainty sources and assess their effects on model performance the identified uncertainty sources mainly include model parameter uncertainty beven and binley 1992 bates and campbell 2001 beven and freer 2001 yang et al 2007 li et al 2010a b leta et al 2015 and model structure uncertainty beven and binley 1992 refsgaard et al 2006 li et al 2010a most of the existing techniques are categorized into two classes i e 1 the frequentist approach with model calibration techniques e g shuffled complex evolution sce ua particle swarm optimization pso which is advantageous to be implemented without timing consumption and the representative techniques are glue procedure generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven and binley 1992 beven and freer 2001 and parameter

2018 the comprehensive uncertainty estimations in the integrated model of multiple processes are still deficient furthermore most of existing studies about uncertainty propagation analysis are limited to the impact assessments of observation quality on model performances which are induced by potential errors from sampling instrument laboratory observation method or algorithm harmel et al 2006 xu et

sources are propagated and probably distort the probability distributions of model parameters and thus disturb the capability of integrated models to portray the real world particularly for the simulations of subsequent modules for example harmel et al 2006 examined that the probable uncertainties for observed variables ranged from 6 to 19 for streamflow from 11 to 100 for nh4 n from 11 to 104 for total nitrogen tn and from 8 to 110 for total phosphorous tp among which the contributions of sample collection preservation storage and laboratory analysis were from 4 to 48 from 2 to 16 and from 5 to 21 respectively however only a few studies are reported about the uncertainty propagation investigation among different modules particularly for integrated water system models the main purpose of this study is to comprehensively assess the uncertainties of multiple modules and their propagations among different modules for complicated integrated water system models as a typical integrated water system model heqm hydrological ecological and water quality model is adopted to investigate the effect of multiple uncertainty sources on parameter distributions and simulation performances of both hydrological and water quality modules the specific objectives are to 1 propose a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty sources and their propagations for heqm by using bootstrap resampling with sce ua optimization technique 2 estimate the probability distributions of hydrological parameters and uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation caused by uncertainties of parameters and module structures 3 estimate the probability distributions of water quality parameters and uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation caused by parameter uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle module 4 estimate the probability distributions of water quality parameters and uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation caused by uncertainties of parameter and module structure this study is expected to extend the scope of model uncertainty analysis and assist modelers in further improvements and calibrations of complicated integrated models of multiple processes 2 models and methodology 2 1 integrated water system model heqm heqm is an integrated water system model proposed by zhang et al 2016a in order to investigate hydrological cycle processes its

are given in zhang et al 2016a and the detailed interactions between hydrological cycle and water quality processes are summarized in zhang et al 2016b and the supplementary material in order to consider spatial heterogeneities of catchment attributes and vegetation coverage three categories of spatial calculation units are designed including sub basin catchment land use land cover and crop the sub basin catchment unit is divided based on the digital elevation model dem using the spatial analyst tools of arcgis software the sub basin catchment unit is divided into the land use land cover unit according to the national land use land cover classification china s national standard 2007 and seven user defined types of land use land cover are considered for each sub basin catchment the land use land cover unit e g paddy dryland agriculture orchard where the agricultural activities occur is further divided into the crop unit the detailed functions of different spatial calculation units and their related modules are given in zhang et al 2016a 2 2 framework of uncertainty propagation analysis 2 2 1 model residual and model performance assessment model residual is the discrepancies between the simulated and observed variables it is formulated as 1 ε t o t s t s t f θ where ε t is the simulated variable residual o t and s t are the observed and simulated variables at time t the interested simulated variables are runoff and ammonia nitrogen concentration nh4 n in our study f θ is the mathematical expression for the variables from relevant heqm modules with θ

and pc is the number of interested water quality parameters root mean square error rmse is adopted as the objective function for the auto optimizations of hydrological and water quality parameters because it is straightforward and widely used zhang et al 2016b the model performance is close to the optimal if rmse approaches to 0 0 additionally three other statistics are used to further evaluate the model performances including normalized bias nbias correlation coefficient r and coefficient of efficiency ns because several simulation performance ratings are usually divided based on these statistics such as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory according to the existing studies e g moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2016b all the equations are given as follows 2 root mean square

ns n s 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where o and s are the average values of observed and simulated variables respectively n is the total length of time series according to the model performance evaluation in zhang et al 2016b the runoff simulation performance is at the satisfactory rating if the statistic values are between 0 15 and 0 25 or between 0 25 and 0 15 for nbias between 0 75 and 0 80 for r and between 0 50 and 0 60 for ns and the performance is at the very good rating if the statistic values are between 0 10 and 0 10 for nbias greater than 0 85 for r and greater than 0 75 for ns for the nh4 n concentration simulation the performance is at the satisfactory rating if the statistic values are between 0 30 and 0 50 or between 0 50 and 0 30 for nbias between 0 75 and 0 80 for r and between 0 50 and 0 60 for ns and the performance is at the very good rating if the statistic values are between 0 15 and 0 15 for nbias greater than 0 85 for r and greater than 0 75 for ns 2 2 2 auto optimization algorithm and bootstrap method shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona sce ua is a powerful global optimization strategy based on a synthesis of best features of controlled random search competitive evolution and coupled with a newly complex shuffling duan et al 1994 this strategy is originally designed to solve the auto optimization problems of water related models duan et al 1992 and has been widely accepted so far due to its efficiency and effectiveness as well as its open sources arsenault et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 bootstrap is a nonparametric method for statistic estimation and its distribution testing proposed by professor efron 1979 the major feature of this method is that the sampling distribution of some pre specified random variables can be estimated on the basis of the original samples even though the true probability distribution is unknown it is a sample augmentation method and able to fully utilize the information of original samples which is strongly advantageous to solve the sampling problems when only small samples are available it has been widely used in hydrological community such as

performance assessment mentioned above the other two statistics presented by li et al 2010a are adopted to assess the uncertainty intervals of both runoff and water quality simulations e g the average relative interval length aril at the 95 confidence level and the percent of observations bracketed by the 95 confidence interval p 95ci the equations are given as follows 6 aril 1 n t 1 n s 97 5 t s 2 5 t o t 7 p 95 c i n o in n 100 where s 97 5 and s 2 5 are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentages of maxb groups of runoff or water quality simulation series noin is the number of observations which are bracketed in the 95 confidence interval smaller values of aril indicate the uncertainty intervals are very narrow and the greater values of p 95ci indicate the uncertainty intervals are very reliable jin et al 2010 li et al 2010b the optimal values of aril and p 95ci are 0 00 and 95 respectively 2 3 study area and model setup shaying river catchment 111 56 116 31 e 32 28 34 54 n is the largest catchment of huai river basin with the total drainage area of 36 651 km2 fig s2 in the supplementary material as the major grain producing area of the huai river basin the dominating land use type is the agricultural land accounting for 85 of the total catchment area it is also the congeries of highly polluted cottage industries such as papermaking fertilizer leather chemistry and dipdye over 0 25 tons of industry wastewater per year are discharged into shaying river in which the emission loads of nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod are beyond the water environmental capacity of most streams zhang et al 2015 fuyang station 115 50 e 32 54 n located at the downstream of shaying river is selected as the outlet of our study area its control area accounts for 94 9 of the whole shaying river catchment it is a critical hydrological and water quality station of shaying river where water quality condition obviously affects that of the huai mainstream zhang et al 2015 the detailed procedure of heqm setup for fuyang controlled catchment is introduced in zhang et al 2016b involving sub catchment delineation and interpolation of climate and socio economic data the essential data sources are also provided in the supplementary material paddy dryland agriculture forest grass water urban and unused lands are considered as the land use land cover units of heqm in our study the daily runoff and nh4 n concentration from 2003 to 2005 are selected as the simulated variables of water quantity and quality respectively and the first half year from 1st january 2003 to 1st june 2003 is set as the warm up period for water quality simulation in the integrated framework nine interested hydrological parameters and eight water quality parameters of heqm table 1 are selected according to the previous studies e g zhang et al 2016b for calibration and uncertainty analysis i e pq 9 and pc 8 the related parameters are soil field capacity wfc soil saturation moisture capacity wsat basic runoff

water quality simulation residual groups are implemented by the bootstrap method and the significant level is set as 5 i e maxb 1000 and α 5 in the sce ua algorithm the maximum iterations are set as 2000 for runoff calibration and 6000 for water quality calibration respectively while the other parameters are set as the default values in order to enhance the calculation efficiency 20 parallel optimizations are implemented with 50 residual groups each 3 results 3 1 model auto calibration the selected hydrological and water quality parameters of heqm are auto calibrated step by step using the sce ua approach the selected hydrological θ q and water quality θ c parameters are converged to the optimal values i e θ q and θ c the simulated daily hydrograph matches very well with the observations with the nbias r and ns of 0 01 0 90 and 0 81 fig 2 a and table 2 the simulated nh4 n performance is relatively good for the whole records with the nbias r and ns of 0 26 0 80 and 0 50 respectively the major deviations between simulations and observations are in the pre flood season january to may when the simulated nh4 n concentrations are underestimated fig 2b the probable explanation is that heqm neglects river sediment resuspension which is a frequent event and contributes high pollutant concentration during the pre flood season due to the sluice regulation for the flood discharge zhang et al 2015 according to the evaluation criteria in moriasi et al 2007 and zhang et al 2016b the heqm performance is at the very good rating for daily runoff simulation and at the satisfactory rating for daily nh4 n concentration simulation respectively 3 2 uncertainty estimation of hydrological cycle modules 3 2 1 hydrological parameter estimations the marginal final distributions of all the selected hydrological parameters are well defined and obey the skew distributions fig 3 among which those of wmc wm kg2 kr tg and krg show the positive skewness with the values from 0 061 wmc to 1 023 kg2 and the others show the negative skewness with the values from 0 022 fc to 0 530 ketp table 3 compared with the initial ranges of parameter values all the final ranges at the 95 confidence interval are shortened remarkably the change of ketp is the greatest with the reduction ratio of 70 1 while the change of krg is the least with the reduction ratio of 19 0 additionally the optimal parameter value is close to the median value for wmc kg1 ketp kr tg and fc to the minimum value for wm and to the maximum value for kg2 and krg 3 2 2 uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation fig 4 a shows the comparison between runoff observations and simulations at the 95 confidence interval due to parameter uncertainties the aril is 0 37 which is close to the corresponding optimal value 0 0 it indicates that the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation due to parameter uncertainties are quite narrow furthermore although only a few observations are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals i e p 95ci 18 7 the simulation performance is still very good with the nbias r and ns from 0 08 to 0 01 0 89 to 0 90 and 0 79 to 0 81 respectively the runoff simulation uncertainties due to the uncertainties of parameter and module structure are also considered fig 4b the simulation uncertainty intervals at the 95 confidence level i e aril 3 66 are much wider than those intervals only due to the parameter uncertainties most of observations are bracketed i e p 95ci 86 0 table 4 except the peak flow observations in the flood season due to their underestimations by heqm therefore the improvement of hydrological cycle module is likely to capture more runoff observations but is still disadvantageous to predict the high flow whose uncertainty is probably caused by the uncertainties of model inputs or runoff observations as well as the regulation of downstream reservoirs and sluices nonetheless the statistics of model performance assessment are from 0 10 to 0 04 for nbias from 0 84 to 0 89 for r and from 0 70 to 0 78 for ns the runoff simulation performance of uncertainty intervals is still good 3 3 propagation effects of hydrological parameter uncertainties on water quality simulation 3 3 1 effects on estimations of water quality parameters all the selected water quality parameter groups are auto calibrated by fixing the hydrological parameter groups at the optimal values which are calibrated according to the new runoff series the marginal final distributions of water quality parameters are given in fig 5 compared to the initial ranges of all the selected parameters the ranges of final distributions are reduced remarkably with the ratios from 30 7 to 100 0 and the reductions of kset nh4 rd cod kd nh4 and rd nh4 are the most remarkable the final distributions of selected parameters also obey the skew distributions except kd cod the distributions of all the water quality parameters show the positive skewness with the values from 0 774 rd cod to 9 254 kset nh4 for kset nh4 kd nh4 rset cod rd nh4 and rset nh4 most of their optimal values according to the new runoff series are very close to their initial optimal values however most of the optimal values of rd cod rset orgn are close to their initial minimum values and only that of kd cod is close to the initial maximum value both of the minimum and maximum values are quite different from their initial optimal values therefore the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters does not seem to affect the distributions of kset nh4 kd nh4 rset cod rd nh4 and rset nh4 but obviously affect the distributions of rd cod rset orgn and kd cod 3 3 2 effects on water quality simulation performance the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation at the 95 confidence level are quite narrow with the aril of 0 045 fig 6 a and are very close to the optimal simulated values throughout the period except in april and may only 1 7 of observations are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals i e p 95ci 1 7 moreover the criteria of simulation performance assessment are from 0 17 to 0 23 for nbias from 0 75 to 0 78 for r and from 0 48 to 0 55 for ns table 4 compared with the initial auto calibration results the nbias is improved slightly while the r is weakened slightly therefore the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters also does not affect the performance of water quality simulation obviously furthermore fig 6b presents the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations due to the uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle parameters and uncertainty of water quality module structure with the introduction of module structure uncertainty the aril increases a lot i e 5 94 which is much wider than the intervals only caused by the parameter uncertainty propagation a large majority of observations p 95ci 94 8 are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals which is very close to the optimum of p 95ci 95 thus the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations are very robust by our proposed integrated framework however the extremely high and low observations of water quality concentrations are still not captured and the probable explanations are the uncertainties of model inputs or runoff observations as well as the module structures therefore the existing water quality modules of heqm still have a large potential to capture most of the observations by improving their module structures e g adopting more physical formulas to replace the conceptual or simplified formulas 3 4 uncertainty estimation of water quality modules 3 4 1 water quality parameter estimations the marginal final distributions of all the selected water quality parameters are well defined and obey the skew distributions fig 7 the final distributions of kset nh4 kd nh4 kd cod rd nh4 and rset orgn show the positive skewness with the values from 0 102 to 11 930 and the others i e rd cod rset cod rset nh4 show the negative skewness with the values from 0 175 to 1 278 compared with the initial ranges of parameter values all the ranges of final distributions at the 95 confidence interval are shortened remarkably the changes of kset nh4 kd nh4 and rd nh4 are the greatest whose reduction ratios are close to 100 while the change of rset nh4 is the least with the reduction ratio of 0 3 additionally most optimal values of kset nh4 kd nh4 and rd nh4 according to the new water quality series are very close to their initial optimal values furthermore most of the optimal values of rd cod and rset nh4 are close to the maximum values most of the optimal values of rset cod and kd cod are close to the median values and those of rset orgn are close to the minimum values all of these optimal values are quite different from the initial optimal values due to the parameter uncertainties compared with the marginal final distributions due to uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters those of kset nh4 kd nh4 rd nh4 and rset orgn are not changed obviously which account for 50 of the total selected water quality parameters however the marginal final distributions of rd cod rset cod and rset nh4 are changed from the negative to positive skewness while the change of kd cod distribution is the opposite 3 4 2 uncertainty intervals of water quality simulation the water quality simulations due to the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules at the 95 confidence interval are shown in fig 8 a the uncertainty intervals are quite narrow with the aril of only 0 12 compared with the observations only some observations in the flood season june september are bracketed in the uncertainty intervals and account for 12 1 of total observations i e p 95ci 12 1 table 4 all the simulation groups at the 95 confidence interval are underestimated particularly in the nonflood season october may with the ranges of nbias from 0 27 to 0 44 the temporal variations of simulations match well with the observations i e the ranges of r are from 0 72 to 0 77 but the ns is slightly weakened with the ranges from 0 23 to 0 46 the uncertainties at the 95 confidence interval become larger when the parameter uncertainties of hydrological cycle modules are involved fig 8b the aril is 0 41 much greater than that only caused by the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules i e aril 0 12 the most obvious changes appear in the nonflood season particular the pre flood season from january to may furthermore the p 95ci is also increased to 21 0 particularly in january and february due to the wider uncertainty intervals the model performance criteria range from 0 27 to 0 68 for nbias from 0 59 to 0 78 for r and from 0 25 to 0 46 for ns all the simulation groups at the 95 confidence interval are still underestimated and the temporal variations of simulations do not change obviously but the minimum ns decreases a lot moreover due to further consideration of structure uncertainties of water quality modules the 95 confidence interval becomes much wider fig 8c and the aril further increases to 5 94 moreover most of total observations are bracketed only except some high observations in april of the nonflood season the p 95ci is 92 0 which is also close to the optimum of p 95ci 95 thus the uncertainty intervals of water quality simulations due to the uncertainties of parameters and module structures are very robust by our proposed integrated framework although both aril and p 95ci are much greater than those caused by parameter uncertainties of water quality modules 0 12 and 21 0 and parameter uncertainties of both hydrological and water quality modules 0 41 and 92 0 they are very close to or even the same with these values due to the uncertainties of parameters of hydrological cycle modules and structure of water quality modules compared with the effect of uncertainties of module structures the effect of parameter uncertainties is much smaller particularly for the parameter uncertainty propagation of hydrological cycle module however the model performance becomes weaker with the ranges of nbias from 0 09 to 0 46 the ranges of r from 0 07 to 0 64 and the ranges of ns from 0 52 to 0 38 4 discussion our study proposes an assessment framework of uncertainty and its propagation for integrated water system models by coupling the frequentist approach with model auto calibration techniques i e the bootstrap method and sce ua both of which are robust and widely adopted in the uncertainty analysis and model calibration respectively efron 1979 duan et al 1992 1994 it is much easier to implement than the bayesian approach because the model residuals used for the uncertainty analysis are able to be resampled efficiently without extensive programming by the bootstrap package of the r platform and are further off line coupled with heqm furthermore it does not need to determinate the subjective acceptance threshold of likelihood function compared with the glue which is also a widely used approach blasone et al 2008 freni et al 2008 li et al 2010a although this approach is conducted based on a great number of model iterations the parallel optimization is advantageous to enhance the computation efficiency li et al 2010b shao et al 2012 the results present that 18 7 of the whole runoff simulation uncertainties are from the parameter uncertainties of hydrological cycle module of heqm and the figure increases to 86 0 if the uncertainties of module structure are considered further although a majority of uncertainties are probably from the model structures the parameter estimation is also a critical uncertainty source which causes the inaccurate simulation performance of runoff to some extent our finding is basically in agreement with many existing studies for example the uncertainties from parameter parameter and model structure contribute 18 8 and 82 3 of the total runoff simulation uncertainties for dtvgm distributed time variant gain model respectively in the chaobai river basin wang et al 2009 li et al 2010a and 12 1 44 1 and 79 2 for wasmod water and snow balance modelling system respectively in the central sweden engeland et al 2005 chao river basin li et al 2010a and shuntian basin jin et al 2010 additionally the parameter uncertainty contributes 10 0 13 0 of total runoff simulation uncertainties for swat in the chao river basin yang et al 2007 and yingluoxia watershed li et al 2010b in consideration of the interactions between hydrological and water quality processes the uncertainties of hydrological parameters are inevitable to cause the inaccurate simulations of subsequent water quality concentrations freni et al 2008 quinton et al 2010 our results further highlight this viewpoint by the uncertainty propagation analysis and show that the uncertainties of hydrological parameters introduce a certain simulation uncertainties of water quality by changing the final distributions of water quality parameters the most affected parameters are the deoxygenation or settling rates of water quality variables e g rd cod rset orgn and kd cod all of which are highly related with the runoff magnitude and velocity adrian and sanders 1998 marttila and klove 2010 freni et al 2011 jung et al 2015 although the module structure is the major uncertainty source the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters still slightly weakens the simulation performance of water quality concentration the uncertainties of water quality parameters and module structures themselves also contribute a proportion of simulation uncertainties of water quality for swat 71 85 of the total sediment simulation uncertainties at the 95 confidence interval abbaspour et al 2007 talebizadeh et al 2010 and over 75 of total phosphorous simulation uncertainties at the 90 confidence interval gong et al 2011 are caused by the uncertainties of parameters and model structures due to the ill posed water quality modules of the stormwater model simple karen only 22 8 28 8 of total simulation uncertainties of total suspended solids at the 90 confidence interval are from the uncertainties of parameters and model structures dotto et al 2012 our study investigates the uncertainties of parameters and module structures step by step and finds that 12 1 of total nh4 n simulation uncertainties are from the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules and 92 0 are from the uncertainties of parameters and module structures which are very close to the optimal uncertainties 95 thus the results calculated by our proposed framework are much more satisfying than those of above mentioned studies additionally the uncertainty propagation of module structure is not investigated in our study because besides the river flow routing numerous of other hydrological processes and their corresponding parameters are able to affect the simulation performance of water quality such as surface runoff generation soil water and its flow infiltration tesoriero et al 2009 fiener et al 2011 parajuli et al 2013 in this study all the selected parameters of hydrological cycle module are about the soil water runoff generation and baseflow in the sub catchments rather than the river routing parameters based on the parameter sensitivity analysis although the runoff simulation residuals are deduced the residuals of the other hydrological variables e g soil water evapotranspiration are not obtained due to the observation limitations thus the uncertainty intervals of runoff simulation are only a part of the whole structure uncertainties of hydrological cycle modules and the others are still not available for the assessment of uncertainty propagation effects on the simulation performance of water quality in next work the assessment of uncertainty contributions of specific hydrological or water quality processes should be conducted in details to support the investigations of the uncertainty propagation of module structure in the integrated models 5 conclusions multiple uncertainties of a complicated integrated water system are investigated by integrating the bootstrap resampling method and auto calibration algorithm sce ua including uncertainties of parameter and structure of hydrological cycle modules parameter uncertainty propagation to the subsequent water quality modules as well as uncertainties of parameter and structure of water quality modules results show that heqm is able to simulate the daily runoff very well and the nh4 n concentration satisfactorily by the auto calibration the uncertainty interval of runoff simulation due to parameter uncertainties is narrow and only 18 7 of all the observations fall into the uncertainty intervals at the 95 confidence level the uncertainty intervals due to the uncertainties of parameter and module structure become much wider and 86 0 of all the observations mainly excluding some high flows fall into the 95 confidence interval moreover the uncertainty propagation of hydrological parameters does not obviously change the simulated variations of water quality concentrations throughout the period and only 1 7 of observations fall into the uncertainty intervals however the simulation uncertainty intervals are further increased obviously due to the parameter uncertainties of water quality modules and the proportions of observations falling into the confidence interval are increased from 12 1 to 21 0 along with the consideration of structure uncertainties of water quality modules the intervals are much wider and contain 92 0 of total observations only except the extreme high values the module structure error is still a major uncertainty source for both runoff and water quality simulations although the parameter uncertainty and its propagation cannot be ignored the model structure improvement is still the priority for the integrated water system modelling and can greatly improve the simulation performance of individual modules and reduce their uncertainty propagation more mechanism investigation should be strengthened and the empirical or simplified equations should be replaced by the physically or mathematically based equations for instance more types of land use land cover units should be designed in the hydrological cycle module of heqm to relieve the impacts of spatial heterogeneities based on the high spatial resolutions of vegetation coverage river sediment resuspension and deposition processes should be introduced in the water quality module to improve the simulation of water quality particularly during the flood season in the regulated rivers acknowledgements this study was supported by natural science foundation of

scenario for future climate change global climate models gcm daily downscaled bias and altitude corrected time series for lebanon 2020 2099 unravel that precipitation recharge and discharge have moderate to highly significant decreasing trends with time over the 21st century moreover recession flowrates are expected to drop drastically starting in the year 2070 to 1 l s with shortage periods reaching up to six months the latter is due to a temperature rise of 1 5 2 5 c and subsequent shrinking of snow cover by almost 100 e g 2073 2074 furthermore this is accompanied by a decline in annual spring volume by 73 with respect to the current status with real evapotranspiration consisting of up to 50 from total water budget currently around 12 17 in 2014 2017 moreover decreasing snow accumulation and a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways will lead to peak spring discharges this study allows decision makers to implement best informed practices for future water resources management especially for karst systems under semi arid conditions in the regions keywords karst climate change integrated numerical modelling 1 introduction freshwater has been under stress in recent decades due to climate change and increasing water demands kløve et al 2014 in response numerous water management methods have been developed iglesias et al 2007 to overcome water shortage prevent further degradation of groundwater quality and quantity and ensure sustainable water supply in the future taylor et al 2013 several studies aimed at highlighting the impact of climate change on groundwater resources gleeson et al 2012 green et al 2011 goderniaux et al 2015 to assess the extent of the problem and to ensure that management and

fresh water availability and recharge is affected by climatic parameters namely precipitation temperature and evaporation bates et al 2008 in addition to land use and land cover as well as the response of specific types of aquifer the development and application of integrated groundwater flow and solute transport models are ideal tools for decision makers to predict the transient behavior of aquifers under various stress conditions such as decrease of precipitation increase of temperature christensen et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 and increased likelihood of floods or droughts hartmann

2017 for example the mediterranean region is expected to undergo pronounced droughts periods and a subsequent unusual decline of groundwater resources giorgi and lionello 2008 additionally other studies have taken into account the effect of the anthropogenic activities such as over pumping and increase in population and water demand on future groundwater resources dar et al 2014 gurdak 2017 sapriza azuri et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 hartmann et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 in another example from a catchment in the mediterranean region hydrological model simulations to future climate change and increase in pumping predicted a 3 month extended dry period in the future in addition to a 50 decline in groundwater recharge and a 20 increase in evapotranspiration sapriza azuri et al 2015 other parameters such as groundwater surface water exchange stream flow and runoff generation were also expected to decrease by 60 sapriza azuri et al 2015 while the future variation in precipitation patterns negligibly affects stream responses to precipitation a considerable increase in evaporation and decrease in rainfall amount is to be expected in the future samuels et al 2010 sharma et al 2015 shows that the estimated change in temperature an increase of 0 32 1 28 c in years 2021 2051 will result in an annual decline in groundwater level by 4 6 and 17 8 in 2021 and 2051 respectively it was also noted that climate variation might become more pronounced in the future which may have escalating effects on groundwater sustainability sharma et al 2015 moreover rainfall under tropical conditions is thought to decrease in the dry season and to increase in the wet season shrestha et al 2016 an application using projections based on future representative concentrating pathways rcps scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 shows that the expected change in temperature by the end of the 21st century ranging between 1 5 c and 4 9 c will yield an important decrease in groundwater recharge and therefore water level and storage shrestha et al 2016 in such groundwater and climate change simulations the validity of the predicted output depends to a large extent on the resolution uncertainty and uniqueness of the base hydrological model unlike most porous unconsolidated systems the selection and construction of a hydrological model for future projections is particularly challenging in highly responsive karst aquifers systems due to their duality of infiltration and flow kiraly 2002 geyer et al 2008 the duality of flow requires the simulation of both fast high response to precipitation events and slow flow components birk et al 2004 geyer et al 2008 moreover as karst aquifers have been known to be highly impacted by environmental changes butscher and huggenberger 2009 ravbar et al 2017 their sensitivity to climate change has been recently given particular attention hartmann et al 2014 charlier et al 2015 chen et al 2017 hao et al 2006 loaiciga et al 2000 samuels et al 2010 hartmann et al 2014 used a combination of spatially distributed recharge as percentage of precipitation andreo et al 2008 and a process based lumped model and others such as hao et al 2000 applied a gray box model to simulate variation of recharge rate discharge and their relationship to precipitation under future climatic variability in a mediterranean karst region hartmann et al 2012 samuels et al 2010 it is worth noting that simulation of this type of aquifer requires both high resolution time series and detailed catchment characterization ranjan et al 2006 to account for the spatial distribution of point source fast infiltration land use and soil type distribution which are key parameters in climatic components such as evapotranspiration manrique alba et al 2017 such information may be scarce and unavailable at the scale of a catchment but is needed to set up and calibrate a representative integrated hydrogeological model valid for future climate scenarios simulations taylor et al 2013 the aim of this study is to use a spatially distributed model to simulate the response of an important karst spring in lebanon to future climatic scenarios

cm5 global climate model gcm with representative concentration pathway rcp 6 0 scenario to depict the daily variation of discharge in 2021 2099 the study further highlights the variation of recession coefficients with time that is indicative of the flow pathways duration of the recession periods below a specific threshold and the lag of spring response to snowmelt under future climatic conditions these findings have important implications for water management decisions and policy in similar catchment types across the greater mediterranean region 2 methodology in the framework of a monitoring project funded by usaid since 2014 a full climatic station campbell scientific alpine type with a heated gauge mounted with a data logger was installed at about 1700 m above sea level to record climatic parameters such as precipitation temperature humidity wind direction and speed and radiation at an hour interval additionally a multi parameter probe insitu troll 9500 measuring parameters such as water level electrical conductivity temperature turbidity chloride ph and redox potential at a 30 min interval daily data for these parameters was obtained purchased from local authorities for the period extending from 2010 till 2013 a rating curve polynomial relationship between water level and discharge was constructed based on bi monthly measured discharge rate over a period of two years the error of the measurement is about 8 10 during recession the methods to develop a calibrated integrated hydrological model to simulate spring responses to future climatic scenarios use the following three consecutive steps fig 1 1 construct an integrated numerical model with mike she dhi 2016 with high resolution time series data 2010 2015 based on detailed geological characterization calibrate the model based on spring discharge data and to validate it 2015 2017 2 perform sensitivity analysis on single climate parameters such as precipitation and temperature to evaluate their impact on the modelling results and 3 conduct future simulations 2020 2099 based on time series of forecast climatic data downscaled from a gcm apply different statistical tests for distribution and significance and highlight the impact of climate change scenarios on spring discharge and on different signals within the various hydrologic compartments in the karst system and other spring characteristics 2 1 set up and calibration of an integrated hydrological model in this work the simulation of flow in a karst system at a catchment scale was done using mike she dhi 2016 the catchment area of a karst spring is sub divided spatially into a 33 33 m cell size grid and vertically into three main compartments atmosphere a unsaturated zone uz and saturated zone sz the development of the model and its parametrization was based on a similar approach used in doummar et al 2012 with the same set of calibration parameters fitted and physically based parameters the a compartment includes climatic processes rainfall snow evapotranspiration and interception by vegetation the snow model used for the purpose of this study is a simple one governed mostly by air temperature dhi 2016 if air temperature is above the threshold melting temperature then the snow will begin to melt according to 1 m t d d t air t 0 where mt is the rate of melting due to the air temperature dd is the degree day factor for snow melting that reflects the amount of snow melt per positive degree day mm c day zuzel and cox 1975 t air is the air temperature of the cell spatially variant and t0 is the threshold melting temperature considered as invariant the air temperature melting will be positive if the air temperature is above the threshold temperature and negative if it is below thus if the air temperature falls below the threshold melting temperature then wet snow will be reconverted back to dry snow the uz represents the unsaturated zone below land surface governed by drainage by gravity in 1 d parameterization of the uz includes calibrated physical properties of the soils and epikarst the epikarst layer simulates the properties of the unsaturated rock matrix the bypass function in mike she allows for the simulation of the fast flow component rapid recharge by routing infiltrating water directly to the groundwater table the bypass flow is calculated as a fraction of the net rainfall for each uz time step the actual bypass fraction is a function of a user specified maximum fraction and the actual water content of the unsaturated zone assuming macropore flow only in wet conditions dhi 2016 thus the bypass flow is distributed spatially differently in diffuse bare rocks and point source infiltration points dolines and is calculated as follows 2 q bypass p net p frac α 10 β 50 δ t where pnet is the net rainfall rate and pfrac is the maximum fraction of the net rainfall which can bypass the matrix under wet conditions α10 and β50 are used to reduce the total bypass fraction under dry conditions calculated depending on user input values and the actual water contents of the unsaturated zone 10 cm and 50 cm below the ground surface respectively the sz is simulated as a continuum using 3 d finite differences with an incorporated zone of high hydraulic conductivity representing pathways of high groundwater velocities e g ephemeral valleys believed to be preferential pathways taylor et al 2013 xanke et al 2016 the calibration was performed using the autocal by mike she based on a population simplex evolution pse optimization algorithm for the years 2010 and 2016 and refined on the high resolution monitored years 2014 2016 while validation was done for year 2017 additionally calibration was done manually to refine selected parameters based on their impact on model results as per doummar et al 2012 the model output data were compared with daily observed discharge downscaled from 30 min monitoring at the spring since 2014 using objective functions such as residual mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency e coefficient the rmse and e are defined as follows 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n c i c 2 4 e 1 c i c 2 c i 1 n c i 2 where ci is the simulated value at ti and c is the calibrated value 2 2 sensitivity analysis on single climatic parameters the spring discharge sensitivity to precipitation temperature temperature and precipitation lapse rates variation of precipitation amount and temperature with 100 m elevation wind and humidity and degree day coefficient was investigated using 17 different scenarios table 1 the results of these scenarios are compared to the baseline scenario for the hydrogeological year 2016 2017 the selection of the different scenarios relied on historical climate variability from the study area and existing literature the 20 to 20 variation in precipitation was based on the variation of percent change in simulated average annual precipitation observed from 16 global climatic models gcms under high global warming conditions lauffenburger et al 2018 the variation of temperature lies within the approximate range expected as future climatic models van vuuren et al 2011 additionally lauffenburger et al 2018 shows that an increase in temperature of 1 c and 2 4 c are expected in low and high warming scenarios respectively scenarios 1 and 2 consist of a change in the precipitation daily values by an increase or decrease of 20 table 1 scenarios 3 4 and 5 represent variations 1 3 and 8 of the precipitation lapse rate per change of 100 m altitude with respect to calibrated value the temperature varying scenarios included increasing and decreasing temperature time series by 2 c scenarios 8 and 9 varying it by 20 scenarios 6 and 7 and changing the temperature lapse rate per 100 m equivalent to a change of 3 with respect to the temperature time series at an average elevation scenarios 10 11 similarly wind and humidity time series data points were increased and decreased by 20 in the calculations of potential evapotranspiration scenarios 12 15 lastly scenarios 16 and 17 vary the degree day coefficient in this model a simple degree day snow melt model based on an experimental average value of 6 mm c day aouad rizk et al 2005 is used to compute the amount of snow melt occurring daily for each sensitivity scenario discharge time series were compared and contrasted to those of the calibrated spring to outline the sensitivity of the model to each of the climatic parameters additionally specific events such as spring responses to melting and spring recession that are characteristic of highly responsive karst catchments were selected for detailed analysis 2 3 future simulations using climate change scenarios precipitation temperature and radiation data for the years 2020 2099 were downloaded from the ipsl cm5 gcm for lebanon with a resolution of 0 25 based on the agmerra dataset ruane et al 2015 the model ipsl cm5 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project j l dufresne et al 2013 was selected because of its ability to reproduce historical data for years 2014 2017 for the study area the scenario rcp 6 0 was adopted meaning a stabilization of the radiative forcing value without overshoot pathway at 6 w m2 after 2100 shrestha et al 2016 van vuuren et al 2011 moreover the projected raw daily output data was bias corrected bc hawkins et al 2013 using the differences in the mean and variability between gcm and observations in a reference period the bias extracted corrected data were reflective of an elevation of 14 m above sea level and thus do not account for the elevation of the catchment area 1500 2200 m in order to correct for elevations the raw historical data were compared and adjusted to the actual observation collected in the field for the years 2015 2017 using a calculated lapse rate for t 0 24 c and p 5 5 per 100 m elevation based on an ensemble of 16 gcms the uncertainties associated with the climate parameters from the ipsl cm5 gm may be on the order of 7 for low warming scenarios rcp 2 6 and 20 for high warming scenarios rcp 8 5 lauffenburger et al 2018 therefore our use of the rcp 6 0 indicates that the uncertainties in climate parameters from the ipsl cm5 gm are likely between 7 and 20 2 4 data analysis the input values were varied according to the 17 scenarios presented in table 1 while the output functions were as follows 1 total volume vt total recharge r 2 snow cover snc 3 maximum qmax and minimum flowrates qmin 4 recession duration rec since t qmax 5 number of recession days wsd where discharge falls below supply value qs additionally the sensitivity of the model to climate parameters was evaluated based on two objective functions rmse and a linear regression analysis between the calibrated daily discharge and the one retrieved from single sensitivity scenarios r2 the rmse and r2 of the calibrated scenario are considered 0 m3 s and 1 respectively for the purpose of sensitivity analysis standardization was applied to normalize the time series for comparison purposes by transforming the normally distributed output xi to a new variable zi that is also normally distributed the normalized time series were cross correlated using a cross correlation function to determine the lag time where the highest correlation coefficient is obtained between the simulated flowrates of the 17 scenarios predictand and the calibrated ones predictor the lag time represents the start of the recession period and the sensitivity of the tested parameter the distribution and the significance of the data were evaluated using linear regression and hypothesis testing with an alpha α level of 0 05 anova and tukey kramer tests for management purposes water volume deficit and water shortage ws to be compensated during one hydrogeological year under various climatic scenarios can be calculated using the inferred recession coefficient and duration as modified from maillet 1905 5 ws 1 v a v n 1 0 ws d q s e α t q s ws d where v n is the needed supply volume and v a is the available spring volume q s is the needed daily supply in m3 d ws d is the duration of recession since t q s till end of hydrogeological year oct in days and α is the snow melt recession coefficient estimated for each scenario 1 d note that v n and q s can be varied according to the increase of population and subsequent future demand 3 field site el assal karst spring is located at 1552 m above sea level in mount lebanon lebanon about 50 km from beirut fig 2 its catchment area of about 12 km2 was outlined based on five artificial tracer experiments fig 2 the aquifer consists of three members of highly fissured thinly layered basal dolostone overlain by dolomitic limestone and limestone of albian to cenomanian age the spring emerges at the top of underlying marls and volcanics of aptian age the annual discharge of assal spring is estimated at 15 22 mm3 based on ongoing high resolution monitoring since 2014 dolines were mapped on the catchment area and hydraulic properties of soil were estimated from representative samples collected on the catchment dolines and their characteristics were mapped on the catchment to determine zones of point source infiltration dry valleys are also considered fast flow pathways the recharge area is located between 1600 m and 2200 m and is mostly dominated by snow melt the spring provides downstream villages in the kesrouane district with about 24 000 m3 0 28 m3 s of water daily for domestic use 4 results and discussion 4 1 model results the observed hydrographs 2013 2017 were successfully simulated with the integrated spatially distributed model the calibrated parameters used in the model in the three compartments are shown in table 2 selected results of the single parameter sensitivity analysis are highlighted in table 3 results in table 4 and fig 3 show that the rmse of 0 218 m3 s lies within the recession discharge of the spring the e of 0 77 implies a satisfactory fit for the purpose of this work it is to be noted that in the simulated discharge peaks are not well reproduced with respect to the flowrates of the recession period the latter is due to the duality of the flow components fast versus slow that are represented with a single continuum model with varying hydraulic conductivities and thus resulting in the inability of the model to reproduce the fast flow component to a certain level of precision the total precipitation including rain and snow ranges between 1350 mm and 1950 mm reference evapotranspiration was calculated to be about 500 600 mm however most of the real evapotranspiration etr occurs during the summer period where there is no availability of water for evapotranspiration the latter explains the relatively low amount of real evapotranspiration between 12 and 15 of the total budget which is similar to values obtained for this region by hartmann et al 2014 surface runoff is considered negligible as it occurs for a maximum of 7 days during the hydrological year only in the dry valleys the total simulated cumulative recharge on the catchment ranges between 84 and 85 of the total precipitation which is considered relatively high but very comparable to recharge rates in well developed karst systems with significant point source infiltration under semi arid conditions hartmann et al 2014 nikolaidis et al 2013 the calibrated recharge and discharge are well correlated together with a lag of 14 days between recharge and discharge r2 0 882 4 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity revealed the impact of temperature t and precipitation p along with other model parameters such as wind humidity and rate of snow melt per change of temperature the effect of each parameter is evaluated based on the rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 between the calibrated discharge rates q cal and the sensitivity analysis ones q sens fig 4 with a ratio of etr to p ranging between 0 1 and 0 15 the ratio of recharge to precipitation varies between 0 85 and 0 9 in all the sensitivity scenarios moreover the ratio of snow to precipitation remains invariant except in temperature scenarios 6 11 e g it decreases from 0 36 in baseline scenario to 0 14 in scenario 8 fig 5 4 2 1 effect of precipitation scenarios 1 5 the change of precipitation rates results in a maximum rmse of 0 011 0 015 m3 s with a coefficient of determination of 0 87 0 91 fig 4 the increase in precipitation leads to the linear increase of annual snow cover recharge and annual volume of the spring along with maximum and minimum discharge according to the trends shown in fig 6 generally the number of recession days decreases linearly by 0 03 day mm and the recession flow rate increases by 0 0001 m3 s mm with increasing annual precipitation fig 6 the recession coefficient increases slightly 0 014 0 019 with increasing precipitation which indicates a relatively faster recession slope and a higher input from fast flow pathways additionally an increase of precipitation by about 20 will result in the decrease of the shortage period ws d by 8 days while a 20 decrease in precipitation will lead to its lengthening by 21 days as illustrated by the lags observed in the standardized sensitivity time series with respect to the calibrated one fig 7 the real evapotranspiration etr appears to remain relatively constant fig 6 even with increasing precipitation which is a result that agrees with hartmann et al 2014 additionally the ratio of recharge to precipitation increases with higher precipitation amounts fig 5 the lapse rate for precipitation plapse was varied around the value of 6 mm per 100 m 1 3 and 8 to test the effect of the change of the precipitation amount with elevation on model results table 1 fig 6 in future climatic models a decrease of the precipitation lapse rate scenarios 3 and 4 is to be anticipated with an intensified warming rate in altitude isotta et al 2014 mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 leading to a decrease of total precipitation amounts under these conditions the variation of recharge spring volume and discharge maximum and minimum can be quantified using a linear relationship as well fig 6 scenarios 3 and 4 4 2 2 effect of temperature the decrease of the daily temperature values by 2 c results in a maximum rmse of 0 06 m3 s and a r2 of 0 30 fig 4 scenario 9 the variation of both minimum and maximum temperature yields variable impacts on snow cover but has little effect on annual recharge and volume fig 6 model results show that the variation of temperature within the 5 scenarios ranges have a little effect on etr not exceeding 15 the discharge obtained in scenario 9 lags the calibrated discharge by 24 days thus resulting in a decrease of the recession period and an increase in both recession and maximum flowrate fig 7 contrarily in scenario 8 an increase of temperature by 2 c yields an increase in the shortage period by 10 days fig 7 4 2 3 effect of wind and humidity a change of 20 in humidity and wind speed scenarios 12 and 13 in the model revealed to have minimal influence on the recharge and discharge signals figs 3 and 4 as shown in fig 5 the change of wind and humidity impact cumulative reference evapotranspiration etpref and the ratio of total etr p for example an increase of wind speed by 20 leads to a decrease in total etr 7 while a change in humidity by 20 inversely affects total etr 11 4 2 4 effect of degree day coefficient however an increase of this factor scenario 17 is expected in future climatic scenarios according to snow degree day models bliss et al 2014 yang et al 2014 therefore accelerated snow melt yields as expected scenario 17 a longer recession period and a decrease in the recession flow rate figs 6 7 however compared to p and t this parameter has a less significant effect on total volumes discharge recharge or snow cover fig 6 a decrease in the degree day coefficient 0 5 mm c day scenario 16 will result in a smoothening effect of the recession and decrease of the recession coefficient allowing a considerable shortening of the recession period fig 7 the single parameter sensitivity analysis shows that temperature plays the most significant role in the discharge output highest rmse and lowest r2 when compared with the calibrated series temperature is significant because it greatly affects recession parameters volumes and the shape of the time series an increase of a minimum of 2 c as predicted by climatic scenarios shrestha et al 2016 leads to an exponential lengthening of the recession period and flowrate and to a substantial decrease in snow cover while the effect on annual recharge annual spring volumes remains less significant any increase in temperature will eventually translate into longer shortage periods with subsequent lower recession flowrates for instance an urgent need to seek alternative resources up to 77 of the needed supply volumes arises with an increase of 2 c in t 4 3 climate change model results the trends of the model signals precipitation etr maximum and minimum temperatures snow recharge discharge rate fig 8 between years 2020 and 2099 were evaluated to estimate the expected change in the model as a response of future projected precipitation and temperatures a shapiro wilk test for normality that was run on precipitation etp recharge and discharge indicate that the data are drawn from a non normal population p values α 0 05 spearman s ρ indicate a statistically significant p value 0 0001 a moderate ρ 0 33 positive correlation between precipitation and recharge and a strong p value 0 0001 ρ 0 88 positive correlation between recharge and spring discharge the linear regression models for each of precipitation etp recharge and discharge are statistically significant p values 0 05 indicating temporal trends with each of these variables over the 21st century linear regressions for model outputs are characterized by low r2 indicating that linear trends could only explain little variance 0 03 1 18 in precipitation real evapotranspiration etr recharge and discharge over the entire time domain 2020 2099 fig 9 nevertheless the trend indicates that precipitation time series decreases with a slope of 2 33 mm y while etp increases at a moderate rate of 0 22 mm year fig 9 moreover with an increase of minimum and maximum temperature of 0 03 c per year snow cover is expected to decline at a rate of 3 1 mm y additionally the trend of recharge is 2 6 mm year coupled with a decrease of the spring annual volume at a rate of 38 300 m3 y equivalent to 12 l s y the expected maximum discharge decreases as well at a yearly rate of 0 003 m3 s 3 l s to further evaluate the temporal trends in discharge and recharge the data series were divided into intervals of 25 year periods 2020 2044 2045 2069 and 2070 2099 results of an anova test indicate that there are statistical differences p value 0 0001 in the mean values of recharge and discharge in the three time periods the tukey kramer test indicate that mean rates of recharge and discharge are not statistically different between 2020 and 2044 and 2045 2069 but are statistically lower by the final third of the 21st century 2070 2099 moreover all the output signals time series were also evaluated in 10 year interval to depict outliers and varying trends in the future fig 10 in concordance with the tukey kramer test starting year 2070 decreasing precipitation varying around a mean average of 800 mm leads to a drastic decline of recharge and annual volume at the spring fig 10 after 2070 recharge and discharge rates are less than 50 of the rates prior to 2070 fig 10 similarly to this study hartmann et al 2012 shows that after 2068 flowrates of a simulated karst mediterranean spring start portraying considerable variabilities the significant decline in recharge and discharge by the end of the 21st century is driven by mostly positive temperatures all year long leading to the decrease of snow cover to nil maximum discharges and minimum flowrates at the springs are projected to reach as low as 0 24 0 5 m3 s and 0 012 0 016 m3 s respectively with annual spring volumes dropping to 0 37 5 00 mm3 equivalent to about 20 drop with respect to current status based on simulations of an ensemble of 50 climate change models water availability in a mediterranean karst is expected to decrease by a similar range 15 30 hartmann et al 2012 recession coefficients vary between 0 014 and 0 025 1 d indicative of conduit and fissured matrix storage baedke and krothe 2001 the length of the recession period increases at an overall rate of 0 55 day year while the shortage in supply volume ws during recession can reach up to 65 to be supplied by alternative means it varies from a minimum of 131 days year 2030 to about 291 days year 2071 and 2091 corresponding to 4 5 10 months in comparison to the calibrated year 155 days 5 months its duration is moderately correlated with snow cover especially in the years 2020 2069 fig 11 after year 2070 snow cover decreases to below 200 mm where the length recession period becomes majorly controlled by minimum temperature a minimum of 2 25 c fig 10 with increasing temperature rapid infiltration of snowmelt into fast preferential pathways is highly reflected in rapid increase of discharge and indirectly impacts the duration and time of recession geyer et al 2008 chen et al 2017 shows that the spatial temporal distribution of discharge under snow governed aquifers is highly dependent on temperature variation because of snow storage decline under varying climatic scenarios the forward simulation of the model using future climate projections allows identifying wet and dry years and the quantitative impact of extreme climatic conditions on the spring therefore model results for selected years average wet year p 1000 mm dry year p 500 mm and extremely dry year p 400 mm were also compared and contrasted to those of 2015 table 5 to evaluate the spring response to unusual hydrogeological years in extremely dry and dry years snow cover decreases to 1 77 mm and the recharge to precipitation ratio drops to 0 5 e g 2073 2074 notwithstanding the decrease in total etr during dry years real evapotranspiration makes up to 50 of the total precipitation similarly an increase of 15 25 in evapotranspiration is expected with a decrease of 53 98 in recharge lauffenburger et al 2018 under different global warming scenarios wet years results e g 2036 2037 are comparable to the calibrated model of year 2015 2016 while in forthcoming average years e g 2034 2035 with decreasing annual discharge volumes snow cover and recharge to precipitation ratio an earlier recession is to be expected table 5 the lag time between the recharge and discharge signals increases slightly during wet periods and decreases during drought periods mostly due to the decrease of snow cover and melt which makes the spring highly responsive to rain events higher maxima and subsequently running dry early during recession q below 0 001 m3 s the latter is highly dependent on an increasing minimum temperature coupled with decreasing temperature table 5 5 conclusions a calibrated integrated spatially distributed hydrological model of a karst catchment in semi arid conditions lebanon was used to perform sensitivity analysis on single climate parameters and to simulate future spring responses to a projected climate scenario for the 21st century temperature appears to be most important parameter that significantly impacts model output and results especially snow cover flow minimum and maximum as well as the duration of recession period while having little effect on total spring volumes the variation in precipitation yields a linear variation in all model output real evapotranspiration etr constitutes between 12 and 18 of the overall water budget and remains relatively constant in the 17 single parameter sensitivity scenarios other parameters such as increasing degree day coefficient have considerable effect on enhancing snow cover melting and subsequent increase in recession duration the forward simulation using daily downscaled climatic p and t data model ipsl cm5 scenario rcp 6 0 shows that recharge and discharge are highly correlated together and time dependent snow cover is the most affected hydrological parameter because of critical increasing temperature above snow freezing melting point in the region as a result the recession duration is expected to increase at a rate of 0 55 day year the decreasing snow accumulation will lead to a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways thus increasing discharge magnitude at the spring over short periods of times moreover as a response to the predicted temporal trends in precipitation and temperature negative trends are expected to occur in recharge and annual spring volumes with a negligible increase in etr especially starting around the year 2070 the response of the spring to a less significant snow cover and melt will be clearly evident in the decreasing flowrate maxima and a lengthening of the recession period and its early arrival 30 days with respect to current situation finally this study quantified the effect of a changing climate for the region on spring output such as 1 spring volume or annual recharge rates 2 recession coefficient and duration 3 maximum and minimum flowrate 4 variation of snow cover and 5 deficit volume below demand rate during shortage periods which constitute key parameters in groundwater management and decision making therefore the model results could be up scaled on other similar catchments and snow melt driven water supplies in lebanon or in semi arid climates of the greater mediterranean region additionally findings from this study allow decision makers to implement best informed practices for long term water resources planning and management especially in complex karst systems to overcome the impacts of climate change on water availability these practices may include finding alternative resources or investigate or implement managed aquifer recharge in the case of water exceedance during the high flow period to increase the storage capacity acknowledgement this work was funded by a usaid peer science project award number 102881

7029,flow in a karst system in lebanon important water supply source assal spring discharge 0 2 2 5 m3 s yearly volume of 22 30 mm3 which is dominated by snow and semi arid conditions was simulated using an integrated numerical model mike she 2016 the calibrated model nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 77 is based on high resolution input data 2014 2017 and detailed catchment characterization a sensitivity analysis of individual climatic parameters shows that spring hydrograph characteristics are most sensitive to temperature a forward simulation using the ips cm5 model with the rcp6 0 scenario for future climate change global climate models gcm daily downscaled bias and altitude corrected time series for lebanon 2020 2099 unravel that precipitation recharge and discharge have moderate to highly significant decreasing trends with time over the 21st century moreover recession flowrates are expected to drop drastically starting in the year 2070 to 1 l s with shortage periods reaching up to six months the latter is due to a temperature rise of 1 5 2 5 c and subsequent shrinking of snow cover by almost 100 e g 2073 2074 furthermore this is accompanied by a decline in annual spring volume by 73 with respect to the current status with real evapotranspiration consisting of up to 50 from total water budget currently around 12 17 in 2014 2017 moreover decreasing snow accumulation and a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways will lead to peak spring discharges this study allows decision makers to implement best informed practices for future water resources management especially for karst systems under semi arid conditions in the regions keywords karst climate change integrated numerical modelling 1 introduction freshwater has been under stress in recent decades due to climate change and increasing water demands kløve et al 2014 in response numerous water management methods have been developed

at highlighting the impact of climate change on groundwater resources gleeson et al 2012 green et al 2011 goderniaux et al 2015 to assess the extent of the problem and to ensure that management and

fresh water availability and recharge is affected by climatic parameters namely precipitation temperature and evaporation bates et al 2008 in addition to land use and land cover as well as the response of specific types of aquifer the development and application of integrated groundwater flow and solute transport models are ideal tools for decision makers to predict the transient behavior of aquifers under various stress conditions such as decrease of precipitation increase of temperature christensen et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 and increased likelihood of floods or droughts hartmann

2017 for example the mediterranean region is expected to undergo pronounced droughts periods and a subsequent unusual decline of groundwater resources giorgi and lionello 2008 additionally other studies have taken into account the effect of the anthropogenic activities such as over pumping and increase in population and water demand on future groundwater resources dar et al 2014 gurdak 2017 sapriza azuri et al 2015 sharma et al 2015 hartmann et al 2016 shrestha et al 2016 in another example from a catchment in the mediterranean region hydrological model simulations to future climate

2015 other parameters such as groundwater surface water exchange stream flow and runoff generation were also expected to decrease by 60 sapriza azuri et al 2015 while the future variation in precipitation patterns negligibly affects stream responses to precipitation a considerable increase in evaporation and decrease in rainfall amount is to be expected in the future samuels et al 2010 sharma et al 2015 shows that the estimated change in temperature an increase of 0 32 1 28 c in years 2021 2051 will result in an annual decline in groundwater level by 4 6 and 17 8 in 2021 and 2051 respectively it was also noted that climate variation might become more pronounced in the future which may have escalating effects on groundwater sustainability sharma et al 2015 moreover rainfall under tropical conditions is thought to decrease in the dry season and to increase in the wet season shrestha et al 2016 an application using projections based on future representative concentrating pathways rcps scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 shows that the expected change in temperature by the end of the 21st century ranging between 1 5 c and 4 9 c will yield an important decrease in groundwater recharge and therefore water level and storage shrestha et al 2016 in such groundwater and climate change simulations the validity of the predicted output depends to a large extent on the resolution uncertainty and uniqueness of the base hydrological model unlike most porous unconsolidated systems the selection and construction of a hydrological model for future projections is particularly challenging in highly responsive karst aquifers systems due to their duality of infiltration and flow kiraly 2002 geyer et al 2008 the duality of flow requires the simulation of both fast high response to precipitation events and slow flow components birk et al 2004 geyer et al 2008 moreover as karst aquifers have been known to be highly impacted by environmental changes butscher and huggenberger 2009 ravbar et al 2017 their sensitivity to climate change has been recently given particular attention hartmann et al 2014 charlier et al 2015 chen et al 2017 hao et al 2006 loaiciga et al 2000 samuels et al 2010 hartmann et al 2014 used a combination of spatially distributed recharge as percentage of precipitation andreo et al 2008 and a process based lumped model and others such as hao et al 2000 applied a gray box model to simulate variation of recharge rate discharge and their relationship to precipitation under future climatic variability in a mediterranean karst region hartmann et al 2012 samuels et al 2010 it is worth noting that simulation of this type of aquifer requires both high resolution time series and detailed catchment characterization ranjan et al 2006 to account for the spatial distribution of point source fast infiltration land use and soil type distribution which are key parameters in climatic components such as evapotranspiration manrique alba et al 2017 such information may be scarce and unavailable at the scale of a catchment but is needed to set up and calibrate a representative integrated hydrogeological model valid for future climate scenarios simulations taylor et al 2013 the aim of this study is to use a spatially distributed model to simulate the response of an important karst spring in lebanon to future climatic scenarios based on bias corrected downscaled projected climatic data for the region flow in the small scale pilot catchment influenced highly by snowmelt in a semi arid region was simulated with an integrated process based hydrological model mike she dhi 2016 to account for the atmosphere unsaturated zone and saturated zone and depict the variation of response signals in each of these layers snow melt was regarded as an important factor controlling recharge processes in snow dominated areas chen et al 2017 the calibrated and validated model is based on high resolution collected data for spring discharge and climatic parameters 2014 2017 and detailed catchment characterization from tracer experiments and soil sampling the influence of climate change is evaluated using two approaches first we evaluated the sensitivity of spring discharge to historical climate data such as precipitation p and temperature t etc second we conducted future flow simulations using downscaled data from the ipsl cm5 global climate model gcm with representative concentration pathway rcp 6 0 scenario to depict the daily variation of discharge in 2021 2099 the study further highlights the variation of recession coefficients with time that is indicative of the flow pathways duration of the recession periods below a specific threshold and the lag of spring response to snowmelt under future climatic conditions these findings have important implications for water management decisions and policy in similar catchment types across the greater mediterranean region 2 methodology in the framework of a monitoring project funded by usaid since 2014 a full climatic station campbell scientific alpine type with a heated gauge mounted with a data logger was installed at about 1700 m above sea level to record climatic parameters such as precipitation temperature humidity wind direction and speed and radiation at an hour interval additionally a multi parameter probe insitu troll 9500 measuring parameters such as water level electrical conductivity temperature turbidity chloride ph and redox potential at a 30 min interval daily data for these parameters was obtained purchased from local authorities for the period extending from 2010 till 2013 a rating curve polynomial relationship between water level and discharge was constructed based on bi monthly measured discharge rate over a period of two years the error of the measurement is about 8 10 during recession the methods to develop a calibrated integrated hydrological model to simulate spring responses to future climatic scenarios use the following three consecutive steps fig 1 1 construct an integrated numerical model with mike she dhi 2016 with high resolution time series data 2010 2015 based on detailed geological characterization calibrate the model based on spring discharge data and to validate it 2015 2017 2 perform sensitivity analysis on single climate parameters such as precipitation and temperature to evaluate their impact on the modelling results and 3 conduct future simulations 2020 2099 based on time series of forecast climatic data downscaled from a gcm apply different statistical tests for distribution and significance and highlight the impact of climate change scenarios on spring discharge and on different signals within the various hydrologic compartments in the karst system and other spring characteristics 2 1 set up and calibration of an integrated hydrological model in this work the simulation of flow in a karst system at a catchment scale was done using mike she dhi 2016 the catchment area of a karst spring is sub divided spatially into a 33 33 m cell size grid and vertically into three main compartments atmosphere a unsaturated zone uz and saturated zone sz the development of the model and its parametrization was based on a similar approach used in doummar et al 2012 with the same set of calibration parameters fitted and physically based parameters the a compartment includes climatic processes rainfall snow evapotranspiration and interception by vegetation the snow model used for the purpose of this study is a simple one governed mostly by air temperature dhi 2016 if air temperature is above the threshold melting temperature then the snow will begin to melt according to 1 m t d d t air t 0 where mt is the rate of melting due to the air temperature dd is the degree day factor for snow melting that reflects the amount of snow melt per positive degree day mm c day zuzel and cox 1975 t air is the air temperature of the cell spatially variant and t0 is the threshold melting temperature considered as invariant the air temperature melting will be positive if the air temperature is above the threshold temperature and negative if it is below thus if the air temperature falls below the threshold melting temperature then wet snow will be reconverted back to dry snow the uz represents the unsaturated zone below land surface governed by drainage by gravity in 1 d parameterization of the uz includes calibrated physical properties of the soils and epikarst the epikarst layer simulates the properties of the unsaturated rock matrix the bypass function in mike she allows for the simulation of the fast flow component rapid recharge by routing infiltrating water directly to the groundwater table the bypass flow is calculated as a fraction of the net rainfall for each uz time step the actual bypass fraction is a function of a user specified maximum fraction and the actual water content of the unsaturated zone assuming macropore flow only in wet conditions dhi 2016 thus the bypass flow is distributed spatially differently in diffuse bare rocks and point source infiltration points dolines and is calculated as follows 2 q bypass p net p frac α 10 β 50 δ t where pnet is the net rainfall rate and pfrac is the maximum fraction of the net rainfall which can bypass the matrix under wet conditions α10 and β50 are used to reduce the total bypass fraction under dry conditions calculated depending on user input values and the actual water contents of the unsaturated zone 10 cm and 50 cm below the ground surface respectively the sz is simulated as a continuum using 3 d finite differences with an incorporated zone of high hydraulic conductivity representing pathways of high groundwater velocities e g ephemeral valleys believed to be preferential pathways taylor et al 2013 xanke et al 2016 the calibration was performed using the autocal by mike she based on a population simplex evolution pse optimization algorithm for the years 2010 and 2016 and refined on the high resolution monitored years 2014 2016 while validation was done for year 2017 additionally calibration was done manually to refine selected parameters based on their impact on model results as per doummar et al 2012 the model output data were compared with daily observed discharge downscaled from 30 min monitoring at the spring since 2014 using objective functions such as residual mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency e coefficient the rmse and e are defined as follows 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n c i c 2 4 e 1 c i c 2 c i 1 n c i 2 where ci is the simulated value at ti and c is the calibrated value 2 2 sensitivity analysis on single climatic parameters the spring discharge sensitivity to precipitation temperature temperature and precipitation lapse rates variation of precipitation amount and temperature with 100 m elevation wind and humidity and degree day coefficient was investigated using 17 different scenarios table 1 the results of these scenarios are compared to the baseline scenario for the hydrogeological year 2016 2017 the selection of the different scenarios relied on historical climate variability from the study area and existing literature the 20 to 20 variation in precipitation was based on the variation of percent change in simulated average annual precipitation observed from 16 global climatic models gcms under high global warming conditions lauffenburger et al 2018 the variation of temperature lies within the approximate range expected as future climatic models van vuuren et al 2011 additionally lauffenburger et al 2018 shows that an increase in temperature of 1 c and 2 4 c are expected in low and high warming scenarios respectively scenarios 1 and 2 consist of a change in the precipitation daily values by an increase or decrease of 20 table 1 scenarios 3 4 and 5 represent variations 1 3 and 8 of the precipitation lapse rate per change of 100 m altitude with respect to calibrated value the temperature varying scenarios included increasing and decreasing temperature time series by 2 c scenarios 8 and 9 varying it by 20 scenarios 6 and 7 and changing the temperature lapse rate per 100 m equivalent to a change of 3 with respect to the temperature time series at an average elevation scenarios 10 11 similarly wind and humidity time series data points were increased and decreased by 20 in the calculations of potential evapotranspiration scenarios 12 15 lastly scenarios 16 and 17 vary the degree day coefficient in this model a simple degree day snow melt model based on an experimental average value of 6 mm c day aouad rizk et al 2005 is used to compute the amount of snow melt occurring daily for each sensitivity scenario discharge time series were compared and contrasted to those of the calibrated spring to outline the sensitivity of the model to each of the climatic parameters additionally specific events such as spring responses to melting and spring recession that are characteristic of highly responsive karst catchments were selected for detailed analysis 2 3 future simulations using climate change scenarios precipitation temperature and radiation data for the years 2020 2099 were downloaded from the ipsl cm5 gcm for lebanon with a resolution of 0 25 based on the agmerra dataset ruane et al 2015 the model ipsl cm5 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project j l dufresne et al 2013 was selected because of its ability to reproduce historical data for years 2014 2017 for the study area the scenario rcp 6 0 was adopted meaning a stabilization of the radiative forcing value without overshoot pathway at 6 w m2 after 2100 shrestha et al 2016 van vuuren et al 2011 moreover the projected raw daily output data was bias corrected bc hawkins et al 2013 using the differences in the mean and variability between gcm and observations in a reference period the bias extracted corrected data were reflective of an elevation of 14 m above sea level and thus do not account for the elevation of the catchment area 1500 2200 m in order to correct for elevations the raw historical data were compared and adjusted to the actual observation collected in the field for the years 2015 2017 using a calculated lapse rate for t 0 24 c and p 5 5 per 100 m elevation based on an ensemble of 16 gcms the uncertainties associated with the climate parameters from the ipsl cm5 gm may be on the order of 7 for low warming scenarios rcp 2 6 and 20 for high warming scenarios rcp 8 5 lauffenburger et al 2018 therefore our use of the rcp 6 0 indicates that the uncertainties in climate parameters from the ipsl cm5 gm are likely between 7 and 20 2 4 data analysis the input values were varied according to the 17 scenarios presented in table 1 while the output functions were as follows 1 total volume vt total recharge r 2 snow cover snc 3 maximum qmax and minimum flowrates qmin 4 recession duration rec since t qmax 5 number of recession days wsd where discharge falls below supply value qs additionally the sensitivity of the model to climate parameters was evaluated based on two objective functions rmse and a linear regression analysis between the calibrated daily discharge and the one retrieved from single sensitivity scenarios r2 the rmse and r2 of the calibrated scenario are considered 0 m3 s and 1 respectively for the purpose of sensitivity analysis standardization was applied to normalize the time series for comparison purposes by transforming the normally distributed output xi to a new variable zi that is also normally distributed the normalized time series were cross correlated using a cross correlation function to determine the lag time where the highest correlation coefficient is obtained between the simulated flowrates of the 17 scenarios predictand and the calibrated ones predictor the lag time represents the start of the recession period and the sensitivity of the tested parameter the distribution and the significance of the data were evaluated using linear regression and hypothesis testing with an alpha α level of 0 05 anova and tukey kramer tests for management purposes water volume deficit and water shortage ws to be compensated during one hydrogeological year under various climatic scenarios can be calculated using the inferred recession coefficient and duration as modified from maillet 1905 5 ws 1 v a v n 1 0 ws d q s e α t q s ws d where v n is the needed supply volume and v a is the available spring volume q s is the needed daily supply in m3 d ws d is the duration of recession since t q s till end of hydrogeological year oct in days and α is the snow melt recession coefficient estimated for each scenario 1 d note that v n and q s can be varied according to the increase of population and subsequent future demand 3 field site el assal karst spring is located at 1552 m above sea level in mount lebanon lebanon about 50 km from beirut fig 2 its catchment area of about 12 km2 was outlined based on five artificial tracer experiments fig 2 the aquifer consists of three members of highly fissured thinly layered basal dolostone overlain by dolomitic limestone and limestone of albian to cenomanian age the spring emerges at the top of underlying marls and volcanics of aptian age the annual discharge of assal spring is estimated at 15 22 mm3 based on ongoing high resolution monitoring since 2014 dolines were mapped on the catchment area and hydraulic properties of soil were estimated from representative samples collected on the catchment dolines and their characteristics were mapped on the catchment to determine zones of point source infiltration dry valleys are also considered fast flow pathways the recharge area is located between 1600 m and 2200 m and is mostly dominated by snow melt the spring provides downstream villages in the kesrouane district with about 24 000 m3 0 28 m3 s of water daily for domestic use 4 results and discussion 4 1 model results the observed hydrographs 2013 2017 were successfully simulated with the integrated spatially distributed model the calibrated parameters used in the model in the three compartments are shown in table 2 selected results of the single parameter sensitivity analysis are highlighted in table 3 results in table 4 and fig 3 show that the rmse of 0 218 m3 s lies within the recession discharge of the spring the e of 0 77 implies a satisfactory fit for the purpose of this work it is to be noted that in the simulated discharge peaks are not well reproduced with respect to the flowrates of the recession period the latter is due to the duality of the flow components fast versus slow that are represented with a single continuum model with varying hydraulic conductivities and thus resulting in the inability of the model to reproduce the fast flow component to a certain level of precision the total precipitation including rain and snow ranges between 1350 mm and 1950 mm reference evapotranspiration was calculated to be about 500 600 mm however most of the real evapotranspiration etr occurs during the summer period where there is no availability of water for evapotranspiration the latter explains the relatively low amount of real evapotranspiration between 12 and 15 of the total budget which is similar to values obtained for this region by hartmann et al 2014 surface runoff is considered negligible as it occurs for a maximum of 7 days during the hydrological year only in the dry valleys the total simulated cumulative recharge on the catchment ranges between 84 and 85 of the total precipitation which is considered relatively high but very comparable to recharge rates in well developed karst systems with significant point source infiltration under semi arid conditions hartmann et al 2014 nikolaidis et al 2013 the calibrated recharge and discharge are well correlated together with a lag of 14 days between recharge and discharge r2 0 882 4 2 single parameter sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity revealed the impact of temperature t and precipitation p along with other model parameters such as wind humidity and rate of snow melt per change of temperature the effect of each parameter is evaluated based on the rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 between the calibrated discharge rates q cal and the sensitivity analysis ones q sens fig 4 with a ratio of etr to p ranging between 0 1 and 0 15 the ratio of recharge to precipitation varies between 0 85 and 0 9 in all the sensitivity scenarios moreover the ratio of snow to precipitation remains invariant except in temperature scenarios 6 11 e g it decreases from 0 36 in baseline scenario to 0 14 in scenario 8 fig 5 4 2 1 effect of precipitation scenarios 1 5 the change of precipitation rates results in a maximum rmse of 0 011 0 015 m3 s with a coefficient of determination of 0 87 0 91 fig 4 the increase in precipitation leads to the linear increase of annual snow cover recharge and annual volume of the spring along with maximum and minimum discharge according to the trends shown in fig 6 generally the number of recession days decreases linearly by 0 03 day mm and the recession flow rate increases by 0 0001 m3 s mm with increasing annual precipitation fig 6 the recession coefficient increases slightly 0 014 0 019 with increasing precipitation which indicates a relatively faster recession slope and a higher input from fast flow pathways additionally an increase of precipitation by about 20 will result in the decrease of the shortage period ws d by 8 days while a 20 decrease in precipitation will lead to its lengthening by 21 days as illustrated by the lags observed in the standardized sensitivity time series with respect to the calibrated one fig 7 the real evapotranspiration etr appears to remain relatively constant fig 6 even with increasing precipitation which is a result that agrees with hartmann et al 2014 additionally the ratio of recharge to precipitation increases with higher precipitation amounts fig 5 the lapse rate for precipitation plapse was varied around the value of 6 mm per 100 m 1 3 and 8 to test the effect of the change of the precipitation amount with elevation on model results table 1 fig 6 in future climatic models a decrease of the precipitation lapse rate scenarios 3 and 4 is to be anticipated with an intensified warming rate in altitude isotta et al 2014 mountain research initiative edw working group 2015 leading to a decrease of total precipitation amounts under these conditions the variation of recharge spring volume and discharge maximum and minimum can be quantified using a linear relationship as well fig 6 scenarios 3 and 4 4 2 2 effect of temperature the decrease of the daily temperature values by 2 c results in a maximum rmse of 0 06 m3 s and a r2 of 0 30 fig 4 scenario 9 the variation of both minimum and maximum temperature yields variable impacts on snow cover but has little effect on annual recharge and volume fig 6 model results show that the variation of temperature within the 5 scenarios ranges have a little effect on etr not exceeding 15 the discharge obtained in scenario 9 lags the calibrated discharge by 24 days thus resulting in a decrease of the recession period and an increase in both recession and maximum flowrate fig 7 contrarily in scenario 8 an increase of temperature by 2 c yields an increase in the shortage period by 10 days fig 7 4 2 3 effect of wind and humidity a change of 20 in humidity and wind speed scenarios 12 and 13 in the model revealed to have minimal influence on the recharge and discharge signals figs 3 and 4 as shown in fig 5 the change of wind and humidity impact cumulative reference evapotranspiration etpref and the ratio of total etr p for example an increase of wind speed by 20 leads to a decrease in total etr 7 while a change in humidity by 20 inversely affects total etr 11 4 2 4 effect of degree day coefficient however an increase of this factor scenario 17 is expected in future climatic scenarios according to snow degree day models bliss et al 2014 yang et al 2014 therefore accelerated snow melt yields as expected scenario 17 a longer recession period and a decrease in the recession flow rate figs 6 7 however compared to p and t this parameter has a less significant effect on total volumes discharge recharge or snow cover fig 6 a decrease in the degree day coefficient 0 5 mm c day scenario 16 will result in a smoothening effect of the recession and decrease of the recession coefficient allowing a considerable shortening of the recession period fig 7 the single parameter sensitivity analysis shows that temperature plays the most significant role in the discharge output highest rmse and lowest r2 when compared with the calibrated series temperature is significant because it greatly affects recession parameters volumes and the shape of the time series an increase of a minimum of 2 c as predicted by climatic scenarios shrestha et al 2016 leads to an exponential lengthening of the recession period and flowrate and to a substantial decrease in snow cover while the effect on annual recharge annual spring volumes remains less significant any increase in temperature will eventually translate into longer shortage periods with subsequent lower recession flowrates for instance an urgent need to seek alternative resources up to 77 of the needed supply volumes arises with an increase of 2 c in t 4 3 climate change model results the trends of the model signals precipitation etr maximum and minimum temperatures snow recharge discharge rate fig 8 between years 2020 and 2099 were evaluated to estimate the expected change in the model as a response of future projected precipitation and temperatures a shapiro wilk test for normality that was run on precipitation etp recharge and discharge indicate that the data are drawn from a non normal population p values α 0 05 spearman s ρ indicate a statistically significant p value 0 0001 a moderate ρ 0 33 positive correlation between precipitation and recharge and a strong p value 0 0001 ρ 0 88 positive correlation between recharge and spring discharge the linear regression models for each of precipitation etp recharge and discharge are statistically significant p values 0 05 indicating temporal trends with each of these variables over the 21st century linear regressions for model outputs are characterized by low r2 indicating that linear trends could only explain little variance 0 03 1 18 in precipitation real evapotranspiration etr recharge and discharge over the entire time domain 2020 2099 fig 9 nevertheless the trend indicates that precipitation time series decreases with a slope of 2 33 mm y while etp increases at a moderate rate of 0 22 mm year fig 9 moreover with an increase of minimum and maximum temperature of 0 03 c per year snow cover is expected to decline at a rate of 3 1 mm y additionally the trend of recharge is 2 6 mm year coupled with a decrease of the spring annual volume at a rate of 38 300 m3 y equivalent to 12 l s y the expected maximum discharge decreases as well at a yearly rate of 0 003 m3 s 3 l s to further evaluate the temporal trends in discharge and recharge the data series were divided into intervals of 25 year periods 2020 2044 2045 2069 and 2070 2099 results of an anova test indicate that there are statistical differences p value 0 0001 in the mean values of recharge and discharge in the three time periods the tukey kramer test indicate that mean rates of recharge and discharge are not statistically different between 2020 and 2044 and 2045 2069 but are statistically lower by the final third of the 21st century 2070 2099 moreover all the output signals time series were also evaluated in 10 year interval to depict outliers and varying trends in the future fig 10 in concordance with the tukey kramer test starting year 2070 decreasing precipitation varying around a mean average of 800 mm leads to a drastic decline of recharge and annual volume at the spring fig 10 after 2070 recharge and discharge rates are less than 50 of the rates prior to 2070 fig 10 similarly to this study hartmann et al 2012 shows that after 2068 flowrates of a simulated karst mediterranean spring start portraying considerable variabilities the significant decline in recharge and discharge by the end of the 21st century is driven by mostly positive temperatures all year long leading to the decrease of snow cover to nil maximum discharges and minimum flowrates at the springs are projected to reach as low as 0 24 0 5 m3 s and 0 012 0 016 m3 s respectively with annual spring volumes dropping to 0 37 5 00 mm3 equivalent to about 20 drop with respect to current status based on simulations of an ensemble of 50 climate change models water availability in a mediterranean karst is expected to decrease by a similar range 15 30 hartmann et al 2012 recession coefficients vary between 0 014 and 0 025 1 d indicative of conduit and fissured matrix storage baedke and krothe 2001 the length of the recession period increases at an overall rate of 0 55 day year while the shortage in supply volume ws during recession can reach up to 65 to be supplied by alternative means it varies from a minimum of 131 days year 2030 to about 291 days year 2071 and 2091 corresponding to 4 5 10 months in comparison to the calibrated year 155 days 5 months its duration is moderately correlated with snow cover especially in the years 2020 2069 fig 11 after year 2070 snow cover decreases to below 200 mm where the length recession period becomes majorly controlled by minimum temperature a minimum of 2 25 c fig 10 with increasing temperature rapid infiltration of snowmelt into fast preferential pathways is highly reflected in rapid increase of discharge and indirectly impacts the duration and time of recession geyer et al 2008 chen et al 2017 shows that the spatial temporal distribution of discharge under snow governed aquifers is highly dependent on temperature variation because of snow storage decline under varying climatic scenarios the forward simulation of the model using future climate projections allows identifying wet and dry years and the quantitative impact of extreme climatic conditions on the spring therefore model results for selected years average wet year p 1000 mm dry year p 500 mm and extremely dry year p 400 mm were also compared and contrasted to those of 2015 table 5 to evaluate the spring response to unusual hydrogeological years in extremely dry and dry years snow cover decreases to 1 77 mm and the recharge to precipitation ratio drops to 0 5 e g 2073 2074 notwithstanding the decrease in total etr during dry years real evapotranspiration makes up to 50 of the total precipitation similarly an increase of 15 25 in evapotranspiration is expected with a decrease of 53 98 in recharge lauffenburger et al 2018 under different global warming scenarios wet years results e g 2036 2037 are comparable to the calibrated model of year 2015 2016 while in forthcoming average years e g 2034 2035 with decreasing annual discharge volumes snow cover and recharge to precipitation ratio an earlier recession is to be expected table 5 the lag time between the recharge and discharge signals increases slightly during wet periods and decreases during drought periods mostly due to the decrease of snow cover and melt which makes the spring highly responsive to rain events higher maxima and subsequently running dry early during recession q below 0 001 m3 s the latter is highly dependent on an increasing minimum temperature coupled with decreasing temperature table 5 5 conclusions a calibrated integrated spatially distributed hydrological model of a karst catchment in semi arid conditions lebanon was used to perform sensitivity analysis on single climate parameters and to simulate future spring responses to a projected climate scenario for the 21st century temperature appears to be most important parameter that significantly impacts model output and results especially snow cover flow minimum and maximum as well as the duration of recession period while having little effect on total spring volumes the variation in precipitation yields a linear variation in all model output real evapotranspiration etr constitutes between 12 and 18 of the overall water budget and remains relatively constant in the 17 single parameter sensitivity scenarios other parameters such as increasing degree day coefficient have considerable effect on enhancing snow cover melting and subsequent increase in recession duration the forward simulation using daily downscaled climatic p and t data model ipsl cm5 scenario rcp 6 0 shows that recharge and discharge are highly correlated together and time dependent snow cover is the most affected hydrological parameter because of critical increasing temperature above snow freezing melting point in the region as a result the recession duration is expected to increase at a rate of 0 55 day year the decreasing snow accumulation will lead to a more prominent flushing of precipitation event waters into fast preferential pathways thus increasing discharge magnitude at the spring over short periods of times moreover as a response to the predicted temporal trends in precipitation and temperature negative trends are expected to occur in recharge and annual spring volumes with a negligible increase in etr especially starting around the year 2070 the response of the spring to a less significant snow cover and melt will be clearly evident in the decreasing flowrate maxima and a lengthening of the recession period and its early arrival 30 days with respect to current situation finally this study quantified the effect of a changing climate for the region on spring output such as 1 spring volume or annual recharge rates 2 recession coefficient and duration 3 maximum and minimum flowrate 4 variation of snow cover and 5 deficit volume below demand rate during shortage periods which constitute key parameters in groundwater management and decision making therefore the model results could be up scaled on other similar catchments and snow melt driven water supplies in lebanon or in semi arid climates of the greater mediterranean region additionally findings from this study allow decision makers to implement best informed practices for long term water resources planning and management especially in complex karst systems to overcome the impacts of climate change on water availability these practices may include finding alternative resources or investigate or implement managed aquifer recharge in the case of water exceedance during the high flow period to increase the storage capacity acknowledgement this work was funded by a usaid peer science project award number 102881
