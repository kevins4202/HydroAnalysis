4810,in low lying fluvial lacustrine plain anthropogenic activities and climatic variation could have a comprehensive influence on the interactions between surface water and groundwater sw gw involving lake river aquifer quantification of the changes in sw gw interaction in spatial and temporal scale causing by the two driving sources could help to the understanding of the regional water cycle mechanism and the adjustment of the decision making however it is usually difficult to distinguish the impact of anthropogenic activities from the climatic variation on a regional scale here by using a regional three dimensional groundwater numerical model with long term monitoring of the hydrological dynamic in poyang lake basin plb china we found that groundwater storage variation in the bank storage districts can be used as an indicator to quantify each source and sink in the process of sw gw interactions and surface water infiltration plays a more dominant role in constructing bank storage which is meant to preserve groundwater storage our research in plb demonstrates that the hydrological change caused by the operation of the three gorges dam tgd since 2003 is mainly responsible for the autumn drought in plb the surface water recession due to the impoundment in tgd from september to october has an impact about 7 times stronger than the rainfall reduction moreover the groundwater storage deficit caused by the insufficient recharge from the surface water infiltration would maintain the whole year unlike the surface water system which would easily recover at the end of the year the results demonstrate the chain interactions among lake river aquifer failing to distinguish the magnitude of each influence factor may lead to underestimating the impact on the whole water system the results also highlight the function and the vulnerability of the groundwater system which might be vital to the riparian and estuarine wetland ecosystem keywords spatiotemporal variation surface water groundwater interaction groundwater modeling bank storage three gorges dam tgd poyang lake basin plb 1 introduction interaction between surface water sw and groundwater gw affects the recharge discharge process in the water cycle that is vital to the aquifer environment and groundwater sustainability sw gw interaction is complicated by anthropogenic and climatic influences human activities such as dam operation and groundwater pumping and irrigation have a strong influence on the natural river stage dynamics and the relative recharge and discharge relationship between sw gw de graaf et al 2019 francis et al 2010 jaramillo and destouni 2015 masaki et al 2017 the change in hydrological condition modifies the dynamics of water chemical and thermal exchange in riparian aquifers and hyporheic zone hancock 2002 yang et al 2018 yi et al 2018 and could persist for long distances downstream sawyer et al 2009 on the other hand climate variation adds complexity to the study of sw gw interactions firstly climate variation influences the temporal patterns of groundwater contribution to streamflow saha et al 2017 tran et al 2020 secondly in catchments with extreme climate conditions the groundwater system is especially sensitive to the dynamics of surface water regime caused by seasonal precipitation variation bartsch et al 2014 vu et al 2018 there are many cases around the world demonstrating the importance of identifying the dominant influence factor of environmental and hydrological degradation jaramillo and destouni 2015 khazaei et al 2019 madani 2014 wine 2019 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 misidentification of the main factor will lead to serious socio economic consequences wine and davison 2019 wine 2020 thus it is crucial to distinguish and quantify the impact of the anthropogenic and meteorological influences on the sw gw interactions for adequate water resources management in this paper we set the poyang lake basin plb of southeast china as a typical example to evaluate the sw gw interactions influenced by human activity and contemporary climate conditions poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china hu et al 2007 the drastically seasonal variation of poyang lake is comprehensively controlled by gentle slope topography subtropical monsoon climate and the inflow outflow from the five tributaries to the yangtze river shankman et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 mei et al 2016 the prominent characteristic of poyang lake can be described as flooding immensely and receding fleetly implying that in flood season from late june through august poyang lake features the largest freshwater lake occupying an area of 3960 km2 and reaches its maximum capacity of 30 109 m3 with a water depth of 21 m while in the dry season from january to february the lake shrinks drastically to a narrow channel with the maximum water depth less than 10 m exposing extensive floodplains and wetland areas the rest of the lake turns into the wetland dramatic variation of the surface water system led to intensified sw gw interactions in the gan fu plain gfp formed by alluvial sediments of the ganjiang river fuhe river and xiuhe river on the west side of poyang lake interactions among poyang lake tributaries and alluvial aquifer guarantee the water supply for agricultural irrigation of 4445 km2 rice farmland in jiangxi province and domestic use for about 22 million people in the northern part of jiangxi province and also facilitate the eco function of plb as one of the world s six major wetland systems with high biological diversity zhang et al 2012 hu et al 2015 mei et al 2016 qian et al 2016 ye et al 2019 however plb has been suffering a long term seasonal drought during the winter season since 2003 which is claimed to be the conjunct influence of climate change in the poyang lake and the upper yangtze reaches coincided with the operation of the three gorges dam tgd ye et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 researchers concluded that climate change and human activity advance the dry season one month earlier in plb guo et al 2012 gao et al 2013 lai et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2014 zhan et al 2016 hydrological droughts occur when lake water storage decrease significantly below normal conditions led to the degradation of the wetland which is the vital habitat for endangered species like the finless porpoise and the siberian crane lai et al 2014a 2014b tang et al 2016 the drought also caused groundwater pumping difficulty and groundwater resource deficiency especially to the rural district on the east side of nanchang the capital city of china s jiangxi province due to groundwater over abstraction in the past several decades a drastic regional cone of groundwater depression had gradually enlarged up to about190 km2 till 2016 based on the data collected from the local government fig 1 previous studies have emphasized investigating the anthropogenic and climatic impact on interactions between surface water features including yangtze river poyang lake and its tributaries such hydrological interactions can be summarized as blocking drainage effects which means the yangtze river has a larger fluctuation of the surface water level than the poyang lake in flooding dry season high low water level in the yangtze river has a blocking drainage effect to the outflow from poyang lake to the yangtze river hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 li and zhang 2018 backflow caused by the blocking effect from the yangtze river during july september could contribute to about 3 of the total lake inflow and the backflow may travel 20 km southward from the yangtze river into the lake li et al 2017 some researchers suggested that the lake shrinkage was not a long term trend but a regime shift triggered by the stage decrease of the yangtze river liu et al 2013 and the water impoundment in tgd from late september to early november is mainly responsible for the drought and should be modified gao et al 2013 mei et al 2016 nevertheless it remains unknown how the tgd contributes to the water shortage in plb and further quantitative assessment should be made zhang et al 2015 besides since surface water and groundwater system is closely connected in gfp it is significant to incorporate groundwater system into the analysis of the sw gw interaction influenced by the operation of tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions some researchers took the groundwater system into account and found the flux rate between the riverine aquifer and river reaches were around 4 to 7 times higher than that of the isolated lake groundwater interactions li et al 2019 whereas the middle region between rivers in gfp has a much weaker hydraulic connection with surface water thus possibly arousing soil gleyization under future climate change yang et al 2019 however how much the impact adverse natural conditions and human activities have on the groundwater system in the gfp is still unclear in low lying flat fluvial lacustrine plain like gfp the main replenishment sources of groundwater are precipitation and river water vrzel et al 2018 temporary storage in flood plain aquifer around riparian zone plays an important role in attenuating flood peak in surface water features hung et al 2012 and the storage could also become an important part of the base flow in the dry season brunke and gonser 1997 gardner 1999 smakhtin 2001 krause et al 2007 hung et al 2012 gebreyohannes et al 2013 rhodes et al 2017 kaandorp et al 2018 the water stored in flood season and released after the flood is referred to as bank storage singh 1968 usually the buffer capacity of the bank storage is dependent on several geologic and hydrological parameters of the aquifer and stream chen and chen 2003 bartsch et al 2014 vouillamoz et al 2015 hénault ethier et al 2017 to figure out how much influence the operation of tgd and the variation in climatic conditions have on the sw gw interactions in gfp it is quite necessary to probe into the major areas of sw gw interactions the proportion of various water sources stored in the bank storage district and alluvial aquifer should be distinguished and the effects of different interference factors on the seasonal dynamics of the water sources should also be estimated this study focuses on the annual dynamic change of the groundwater system under complex lake river aquifer interactions the main objective is to address how the alluvial aquifer reacts to the variation of the hydrological and meteorological conditions to address this problem several items should be evaluated 1 variation of the groundwater storage at spatial and temporal scale 2 annual dynamics of the river aquifer exchange and precipitation variation 3 interactions between lake river aquifer and 4 change of water regime resulting from the operation of the tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions to evaluate these items we attempt to interpolate the temporal and spatial fluctuation of surface water into a groundwater numerical model detailed surface water groundwater sw gw exchange was calculated based on realistic scenarios to analyze the impact of human activity and contemporary climatic conditions on the sw gw interactions 2 study area and available data 2 1 brief description of the study area poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake located at the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the northern border of jiangxi province china fig 1 poyang lake basin plb has a seasonal monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of about 1343 1843 mm which is mostly concentrated in the summer season fig 3 b the average evaporation is about 1044 mm per year and the average temperature is around 16 20 c poyang lake catchment with an area of 162 000 km2 consists of lacustrine plain surrounding poyang lake and the broad alluvial valleys of the five tributary streams including xiuhe river ganjiang river fuhe river raohe river and xinjiang river the total inflow into the lake is around 148 109 m3 y with an average monthly inflow ranging from 5 1 109 m3 in january to 28 9 109 m3 in june fig 3d the runoff from the tributaries converges in the lake and then heading north to the outlet the only outlet of poyang lake is a narrow channel connecting with the yangtze river located at hukou county and the discharge runoff is decided by the respective water level of poyang lake and yangtze river fig 1 the three gorges dam tgd is located at the upper stream of the yangtze river about 800 km west of hukou county tgd started to operate in the year 2003 which has a significant influence on the runoff downstream of the yangtze river the regulated runoff needs about 5 days to reach the hukou station under the conjunctive influence from the yangtze river and the five tributaries the lake level of poyang lake fluctuates between 8 m and 16 m gan fu alluvial plain gfp as shown in fig 1 is the largest sub catchment 3649 5 km2 in plb bounded by xiuhe river in the north fuhe river in the southeast and the three branches of ganjiang river flowing through the center of the plain all the rivers cut through the lower alluvial aquifer and run separately into the poyang lake which constitutes a relatively independent hydrogeological unit the groundwater system can be seasonally recharged by precipitation infiltration and surface water bodies including lakes and rivers having a renewable and abundant source of groundwater in quaternary shallow aquifers according to groundwater extraction statistics by the local geological survey institute about 89 7 of total groundwater extraction is dispersedly extracted for agricultural irrigation and domestic usage and 10 3 of the total amount is associated with centralized groundwater pumping in nanchang city for industrial use xiao et al 2001 2 2 data collection daily water level and precipitation data were observed from gauging stations in poyang lake and the lower reaches of five tributaries fig 1 the five gauging stations namely hukou hk xingzi xz duchang dc tangyin ty and kangshan ks distributed from the north to the south in the main lake area sanyang sy in junshan lake in the south also there are several tributary gauging stations distributed in the different rivers including waizhou wz changyi cy and wucheng wc in ganjiang river qiujin qj and yongxiu yx in xiuhe river and lijiadu ljd in fuhe river the data of hydro stratigraphic were collected based on 276 boreholes collected from the geological survey report by zhang 2008 and 144 boreholes from the local geological survey institute the lithological and stratigraphic data help to delineate heterogeneities geological structures and bedding planes long term groundwater levels with an interval of 3 5 days were collected based on the 50 boreholes conducted by the geological survey since the 1980s gdinjp 2018 nmic 2018 a total number of 133 in site aquifer tests were manipulated in gfp the location of pumping tests and hydrogeological parameter estimation are shown in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the main alluvial aquifer ranges from 0 6 to 258 6 m d with a typical alluvial sediment characteristic table 1 the locations of the pumping test for in situ hydrogeological parameter estimation are shown in fig 2 the terrain datasets used in the groundwater model were collected from the combination of the bathymetry of the lake and river bed with 5 m spatial resolution obtained from topographic survey files and the 30 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data the datasets include bathymetry covering the entire lake area and the river channels of the tributaries 3 groundwater modeling 3 1 hydrogeological conceptual model the principal aquifer in gfp that comprises alluvial lacustrine sediments has a mean thickness of about 25 m ranging from 5 m to 119 2 m the aquifer can be divided into two units the upper aquifer ua and the lower aquifer la the ua is the holocene and upper pleistocene unit that is composed of alluvial lacustrine silty clay filling with organic components and is of a mean thickness of about 8 m in general the hydraulic conductivity of the ua is less than 10 m d the la is the middle lower pleistocene unit which mainly comprises fluvial deposits like cobble and gravel with sand and it is of a mean thickness of about 16 5 m ranging from 1 m to 87 m the hydraulic conductivity of the la ranges from about 10 m d to 300 m d according to the in situ aquifer tests the underlying unit of the aquifer is the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone that is relatively impermeable and is considered as the bottom of the aquifer based on surficial hydrogeological mapping see fig 1 and the hydrogeological parameters the quaternary aquifer of interest in gfp can be divided into 7 zones subdomains in the numerical model fig 2 a g for model calibration subdomain a denotes the part of the poyang lake and the wetland b the alluvium from the downstream reaches of ganjiang river c the alluvium from the fuhe river d the alluvium from the mainstream of the ganjiang river e the alluvium from the xiuhe river and wucheng branch of ganjiang river f the residual deposit of the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone and g the outcrop of bedrock in gfp river water infiltration and rainfall are two parts of the groundwater recharge the river reaches are well connected with the riparian aquifer by vertical infiltration into the aquifer during flood season and exfiltration out of the aquifer during the dry season the annual average rainfall as shown in fig 3 was about 1536 mm during the period from 1956 to 2003 of which about 74 rainfall was from april to august and the largest monthly rainfall is 272 mm in june and then during the period from 2003 to 2010 annual average rainfall reduced to 1411 mm fig 3a avg rainfall reduction was mainly recorded by the gauging stations at the northern part of the plb including qj yx cy dc and xz stations the groundwater depletion is mainly through evapotranspiration lateral outflow to the surface water features and groundwater abstraction the annual abstraction of the groundwater at the east of nanchang city was about 40 106 m3 y but due to the lack of detailed information the amount of groundwater pumping is equally distributed to the groundwater over abstraction district in general the dynamics of the groundwater system in gfp is driven by seasonal rainfall and surface water level variation groundwater flow direction in general consistent with the topography is from the southwest to the northeast however when groundwater comes to the riverside of the aquifer the flow direction is mainly dominated by the water level difference between the aquifer and the nearest surface water feature 3 2 groundwater numerical model 3 2 1 mathematical model to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the regional groundwater regime and quantify the exchange flux between sw gw and variation of groundwater storage in response to the variations in hydrological conditions a three dimensional finite element transient numerical groundwater flow model was built based on the previous study by using the combination of feflow code and 3 d spatial analysis function of gis yang et al 2019 diersch 2014 feflow is capable of simulating sw gw interactions in a flexible time step length by using time series and convenient for refining the triangle mesh at any position of the model diersch 2014 the mathematical representation of the conceptual model can be described as 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t h x y z 0 φ x y z x y z φ h b 1 h 1 x y z t x y z b 1 k h n b 2 v x y z t x y z b 2 where kxx kyy and kzz are the respective principal components of hydraulic conductivity tensor along the x y and z coordinates lt 1 h is the hydraulic head w is the volumetric flux that represents sources or sinks t 1 ss is the specific storage l 1 and t is time t φ is the model domain and φ is the spatial distribution of the initial hydraulic head l b 1 is the specified head boundary condition and h 1 represents the hydrograph of the boundary condition over time b2 is the flux boundary condition and the v represents the groundwater flow speed along the vertical direction of the boundary 3 2 2 spatial and temporal discretization as shown in fig 4 the numerical model was discretized into 3 layers vertically based on the statistics of the stratigraphic information from the boreholes representing the respective ua layer 1 la layer 2 and the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone layer 3 from the surface to the bottom horizontally the model was discretized into 34 951 triangular prismatic mesh elements with the lateral size less than 1000 m also some meshes along river reach and lakeshore were moderately refined to the lateral size ranging from 100 m to 400 m to delineate the topographic variation as accurately as possible 3 2 3 implementing boundary conditions the regional groundwater model was designed for simulating the dynamic lake river aquifer interactions under different scenarios associated with human activity and climate variation thus the variation of hydraulic gradient among the three parts of the water system must be well simulated based on the historical datasets of the gauging stations in plb and landsat remote sensing images of the poyang lake by addressing an interpolation of the boundary conditions and spatial temporal discretization of the model the variation of surface and underground interaction can be reasonably described to reproduce the real situation in gfp a rivers in gfp surface water features fig 2 are well connected with the alluvial aquifer so they can be defined as specified head boundary conditions in the numerical model to portray the surface water infiltration and exfiltration the time varying specified heads along the river and lake boundaries are given into the numerical model as time series monitored by gauging stations with a time resolution of 1 day all the rivers are piecewise interpolated between two gauging stations from upstream to downstream and each segment of the interpolated river reaches will be given a time series interpolated by the 2 time series of the river stage monitored by 2 gauging stations at the upstream and the downstream the time series along the river are interpolated as follows firstly the river between the two gauging stations l is the total length of the river between the two gauging stations is sub divided into several segments l x represents the length of each segment of the river by equally dividing river bed elevation difference which is extracted from the bathymetry dem dataset 5 5 pixels secondly the river level of each segment can be calculated through a weighted average manner according to the following formulation 2 t i t d 1 x 1 θ i 1 t u t d θ i t u t d 2 where θ i is the length proportion θ x l x l of the i th i 1 2 3 4 segment t u and t d are the time series of the annual river stage collected by the upstream gauging station and downstream gauging station the length proportion θ i is treated as a weight factor multiplier to the river level series as a result a river is scattered into segments and each river segment has its corresponding time series t i during the simulation period for example the ganjiang river is divided into 5 segments between wucheng station and waizhou station fig 5 a the time series of wc and wz are interpolated into 5 time series for the 5 river segments as shown in fig 5b b lake spatial and temporal variations of the poyang lake stage is influenced by the natural hydraulic gradient between ks and hk stations and seasonal fluctuation of lake size in the groundwater model the lake body is represented as a specified head boundary condition at the mesh points at the top of the model the lake area where the boundary condition nodes were placed in the specific head is adjusted monthly under the monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 specified head nodes along the lake boundaries are assigned segmental constant values that are interpolated between monitored transient water levels recorded at six gauging stations using eq 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the calibration included three steps firstly a steady state model was calibrated using the groundwater level on january 1th 1986 to generate the initial conditions of the groundwater flow for the transient model besides the material property and infiltration coefficient was initially adjusted to meet the confidence interval of the groundwater level which is 0 5 m secondly the continuous groundwater level data from 1 1 1986 to 12 31 1986 was chosen to manipulate a transient state calibration for all the transient simulation in this study the fixed time step of the simulation was set to 5 days to meet the unstable variation driven by the surface water level fluctuation for model calibration the convergence criterion for the groundwater flow equation was set to be 0 001 m after the transient calibration the parameters of hydraulic conductivity k infiltration coefficient specific yield sy were calibrated to achieve a reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured groundwater levels and an acceptable water budget thirdly the calibrated model was validated based on whether it matched the set of field data of 11 observation wells from 1 1 2010 to 12 31 2010 the initial values of hydrogeological parameters in each sub domain table 1 are the average value obtained from in site pumping tests as shown in fig 2 we assume the homogeneous and isotropic material property in each sub domain as shown in fig 2 two fitting criteria including the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were used to calibrate and validate the numerical model the main target was to minimize the groundwater head rmse and mae in each time step of 5 days during the calibration and validation process 3 r m s e j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j 2 n 4 m a e j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j n where hc and ho are the calculated head at the jth time step from the simulation model and observed head at ith observation location n is the number of observation locations m is the number of time steps after the calibration process an oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine how the groundwater storage would respond to the changes in the influence factors through increasing and decreasing the initial value of the influence factors by 5 to 10 morris 1991 feng et al 2018 the influence factors include the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer k rainfall infiltration coefficient ic and the surface water level swl appendix a fig a2 the sensitivity analysis aims to identify the main influence factor on the interaction between sw gw which is calculated by the volume of the groundwater storage so that we can improve the qualitative understanding of the influence factors 3 4 simulation scenarios to distinguish the impact of the anthropogenic activities from the contemporary climatic condition the monthly rainfall and the hydrograph of the surface water features from 1956 to 2010 were statistically analyzed the monthly average rainfall in gfp from 1956 to 2010 shows that precipitation had a decreasing trend after 2003 as shown in fig 3a b c on the other hand the stage decrease of the lake and rivers in the plb water system is attributable to a weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river after the operation of tgd in 2003 zhang et al 2014 considering the influence of climate condition and anthropogenic factors on the hydrological and hydrogeological process three model scenarios were designed including 1 s 1 under daily averaged surface water level and recharge from precipitation from 1956 to 2003 2 s 2 under daily averaged surface water level from 2003 to 2010 and precipitation from 1956 to 2003 and 3 s 3 under daily averaged surface water level from 2003 to 2010 and changing precipitation from 2003 to 2010 in response to climate variation the daily averaged surface water level in different gauging stations are shown in the left column in fig 6 and the monthly averaged precipitation in the two periods are shown in fig 3b s 1 represented the natural state before the operation of tgd in 2003 s 2 only considered the impact of human activity not the role of climate variation s 3 provided a comprehensive influence induced by anthropogenic factor and meteorological factor the comparison between s 2 and s 3 can distinguish the influence of meteorological factor on the groundwater flow system interpolation manner of the boundary conditions of these three scenarios was also based on eq 1 discussed in section 3 2 the changing meteorological and hydrological data associated with the three scenarios were implemented in the numerical model for running 30 years to generate an annual quasi stable state of groundwater flow which means the annual dynamic of the groundwater table will be driven only by the two factors including annual rainfall variation and the surface water stage variation and the noises of the random events in a typical year are filtered so we can use the dynamic of a complete hydrological year to represent the multi year average dynamic of the groundwater system 4 results and analyses 4 1 impacts of tgd on lake river interaction the impacts of tgd on the lake river interaction in plb include two aspects i e the temporal and spatial variations 4 1 1 temporal variation of the interaction the water budget of the poyang lake is determined by the inflow from the tributaries and the outflow from hukou into the yangtze river as shown in fig 3d before june the lake level is much higher than the river stage in yangtze river because the lake level is mainly controlled by the strong inflow of the tributaries from march to july after june the surface water level in poyang lake and yangtze river become consistent till november representing a unified hydraulic connection between the lake and the yangtze river in the meanwhile the total inflow reduced drastically from 28 92 109 m3 in june to 9 77 109 m3 in august which is only about 1 3 of the maximum inflow without enough inflow for keeping the high lake level the blocking effect from yangtze river to poyang lake from august to november becomes the main factor to keep the lake level from drastic decline after july after 2003 the river level of yangtze river in the autumn season occurred a significant water level difference compared to the period before 2003 fig 6 illustrated the daily averaged water level of the 4 gauging stations before and after 2003 s 1 and s 2 in the left column of fig 6 and the water level difference wld in the right column of fig 6 between the two periods we list 3 other stations of duchang qiujin lijiadu in appendix b the black line as shown in the right column of fig 6 illustrated the water level in tgd in 2007 the hydrograph was chosen to represent the reservoir regulation process of the tgd after 2003 the releasement and impoundment cycle during a hydrological year making the water level in tgd ranges from 145 m to 155 m the low level of 145 kept from june to september and the high level of 155 m kept from october to february the adjustment process of tgd during a year could be divided into 5 phases table 2 by comparing the natural river stage in yangtze river represented by the water level at hk station and the regulated water level in tgd phase 1 and phase 2 from february to mid july represent the rising of the yangtze river and a mild releasing process in tgd which have slightly increased the runoff in the yangtze river at the beginning of phase 3 in mid july the yangtze river reached its highest annual river stage indicating that the river stage in the yangtze river shifted from rising to falling in mid july while the water level in tgd remained unchanged at 145 m implying that the adjustment of tgd shifted from releasing phase 2 to impounding phase 3 therefore mid july is the turning point of positive and negative influence from the tgd on the downstream the negative influence of runoff reduction in the yangtze river lies in lowering the river stage since the beginning of phase 3 the wld at hk station and ks station gradually increased from 0 m in phase 2 to 0 87 0 78 m till the end of phase 3 fig 6 after september the intense impoundment in phase 4 raised the water level in tgd from 145 m to above 155 m in only one month the intense impoundment further cut down the runoff in the yangtze river aggravated the river level decline in the whole downstream making the wld at hk station and ks station further increased to 3 00 1 26 m after the impoundment period the runoff of the yangtze river gradually regained the natural state of low flow in phase 5 the wld at hk station and ks station reduced to 0 78 0 06 m in november and completely recovered to the pre tgd state at the end of december 4 1 2 spatial variation of the interaction there was spatial variability in the influence of the tgd on poyang lake that the influence gradually weakened from north to south so the maximum wld gradually decreased from hk station to ks station from 3 m to 1 26 m in late october the main reason for the spatial variability was due to the differences in the degree of the hydraulic connection among different parts of the surface water system the hydraulic connection is controlled by both the surface water level and the topography of the river lake bed as shown in fig 7 poyang lake has a unified hydraulic connection in flood season july with a high flat lake surface from hk station to ks station so the river stage change in yangtze river could directly change the lake level at ks station s 1 in jul and s 2 in jul in fig 7 however in november the water depth of the lake reduced to less than 5 m at the southern part and the higher lake bed at ty station blocked the lake discharge from ty to dc station leaving only the northern part of the lake from hk to dc station maintained the consistent hydrological connection with yangtze river so that the weakened blocking effect caused by the river level drop in yangtze river will have a much strong influence to the northern part of the poyang lake compared to the southern part the spatial variability made the hydraulic gradient in poyang lake from ks to hk increase from 0 007 s 1 to 0 021 s 2 in late october which led to accelerated drainage from the lake to the yangtze river as the base level of the watershed the changing lake level also has an influence on the river stage in the lower reaches of the tributaries so the impact from the tgd could also spread upstream from the lake to the tributaries for example as shown in fig 7 the lake level had a blocking effect on the runoff in the wucheng branch of ganjiang river in july even with the similar runoff in s 1 and s 2 the river stage in s 2 was about 1 26 m lower than that in s 1 due to the lake level drop at xz station in the drainage process the weakened blocking effect further aggravated in october making the wld between s 1 and s 1 increased to 2 37 m at wc station which is much larger than the 1 53 m at wz station fig 6 therefore the hydraulic gradient in wucheng branch also increases from 0 033 s 1 to 0 047 s 2 implying an accelerated drainage effect from the river to the lake however there are exceptions ljd station at the upper reaches of the fuhe river is out of range from the influence of the poyang lake thus the wld of the upper river reaches were not clearly responsive to the operation of the tgd and has a range of less than 1 m river levels at these gauging stations were mainly controlled by inflow from the runoff generation district 4 2 groundwater dynamics 4 2 1 result of the calibration process the calibration process of the groundwater numerical model is based on the identification of the regional hydrological regime and the monitored data the scatter diagrams and hydrographs of simulated groundwater level in every 5 days against the observed value after transient calibration and validation were shown in appendix a and the calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 results show that the calculated groundwater level is consistent with the observed groundwater level during the calibration period and the validation period the mae is less than 0 5 m and the rmse is less than 0 6 m because the natural groundwater table is affected by random incidents and heterogeneity of the rainfall distribution and the hydrogeological condition the homogeneous and isotropic material property of the model led to a smoother variation of the calculated groundwater level however in this study an annual averaged dynamic of the quasi stable state is the objective so it is adequate to filter out the sudden change of the groundwater level caused by random events in a typical hydrological year and the heterogeneity of the material properties or the precipitation change the result of the sensitivity analysis also proves the main influence factor is the swl ic and k have no significant influence on groundwater storage therefore by using the daily averaged surface water level even the rmse is larger than the criteria of 0 5 m we think the model is adequate for simulating a seasonal average condition 4 2 2 groundwater level differences of the scenarios in response to the changes in hydrological and meteorological conditions associated with three model scenarios the groundwater system will also experience spatial and temporal variation fig 8 illustrates the simulated seasonally low and high groundwater levels in february and july for s 1 and the differences between scenarios in february and july we set 14 observation points op1 op14 in the problem domain fig 8 to examine and compare the simulated groundwater levels for the three scenarios appendix c for all three scenarios the groundwater system has the same annual dynamic that has a lower groundwater table in february and a higher groundwater table in july following the seasonal variation of the rainfall in terms of the riparian aquifer as shown in fig 8a due to the low river stage in the river channel in february groundwater discharge to all the surface water features in most parts of the model area while in july the groundwater flow reversed due to the inversion in relative water level difference between surface water features and the aquifer however the cone of depression is caused by historical over pumping exits in the east of nanchang city the water level is lower than 10 m which is about 5 0 m below the ganjiang river stage yearly making the surface water continuously infiltrate from the ganjiang river to the alluvial aquifer in s 2 as shown in fig 8b and e the groundwater level declined about less than 0 5 m in most parts of the inner compartments between the river reaches compared to s 1 represented by the observation points like op4 op6 op10 in districts like the downstream area of wucheng branch and xiuhe river and the riparian aquifer represented by op1 op2 op3 op8 op9 op11 op12 the groundwater level difference between s 1 and s 2 is up to 1 5 m indicating the riparian aquifer along the lower river reaches suffered the most from the river stage decline in s 2 the declined area is larger in july compared to february in s 3 as shown in fig 8c and f groundwater level further declined by up to 0 15 m from the situation in s 2 to the situation in s 3 the water level drop can be recognized at the inner parts of the compartments with a long distance to the surface water features represented by the area among op1 2 13 and op4 op10 op14 the groundwater level decline in s 3 is much smaller compared to the decline from s 1 to s 2 4 2 3 spatial distribution of the impact of surface water and precipitation the impact of surface water recession and precipitation reduction on groundwater dynamics has a significant difference in spatial distribution to identify the spatial differences annual water table fluctuation in gfp was calculated based on the annual lowest highest groundwater level as shown in fig 9 a the annual fluctuation varied from less than 1 0 m to 13 0 m the closer to the river the larger the groundwater level varied among one hydrological year because of the tributaries cutting through the alluvial aquifer a high degree of seasonal fluctuation in the poyang lake surface water system leads to the dramatic fluctuation of the groundwater table in the riparian zone in gfp a transition zone with fluctuation larger than 1 m is restricted to these districts within 3 km from the lake and rivers while in the inner compartments separated by the river reaches the fluctuation of less than 1 m is mainly contributed by the seasonal variation of precipitation in s 2 as shown in fig 9b groundwater table fluctuation is reduced by up to 1 5 m in the transition zone and wetland districts in s 3 as shown in fig 9c the influence from the precipitation change to the groundwater table fluctuation is less than 0 03 m which is almost negligible from this we can conclude that the surface water recession has a much stronger influence on the groundwater level compared to the precipitation reduction in gfp 4 3 variation of lake river aquifer interaction 4 3 1 spatial and temporal variation of the water level in sw and gw the dynamics of the groundwater system reflects the change in sw gw interactions as shown in figs 10 and 11 two water table profiles were used to identify the main characteristics of the interactions among the poyang lake tributaries alluvial aquifer the water table variation during july october next february represented a floodwater recession process overall both two transects illustrated a synchronous linkage between the ganjiang river and poyang lake taking profile 1 as an example for s 1 the river stage declined from 15 75 m jul to 14 25 m oct to 11 07 m feb quickly responding to the decrease of lake level from 15 43 m jul to 13 44 m oct to 10 62 m feb form s 2 as the recent droughts in the poyang lake water system the river stage decreased from 14 89 m jul to 13 33 m oct to 10 81 m feb and correspondingly the lake level declined from 14 95 m jul to 12 21 m oct to 10 17 m feb it can be concluded from fig 11 that 1 the changes of water table at different periods between points op15 op35 in profile 1 for both s 1 and s 2 were negligible because the area was located in zone c where the aquitard had no direct hydraulic connection with surface water features 2 water table in the lakeshore area points op44 op46 in profile 1 points op130 op132 in profile 2 had a smaller amplitude of fluctuation although the lake level had the larger amplitude because the low permeability of the lacustrine silty sediments on the lake bed reduced the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer 3 water table variation between points op72 op110 in profile 2 for both s 1 and s 2 showed the synchronization of the change in surface water level because the area was located in zone a where the aquifer had close hydraulic connection with surface water bodies 4 there was a hysteresis effects on the groundwater recharge from zone a to zone b such as the water level kept rising by 0 4 m and 0 25 m in op115 from july to october for s1 and s2 respectively because the ephemeral increment of bank storage in zone a till july took some more time to replenish to zone b due to the slow velocity of the groundwater flow and its long flow path from the river channel to the inner compartments and 5 compared with s 1 the water table in two profiles for s 2 decreased due to the reduction of recharge from rivers to groundwater in sum the water table variation in two profiles for s 1 and s 2 during july october next february demonstrated the synchronization and hysteresis of interactions between surface water and groundwater the dramatic seasonal variation of the surface water stages leads to bidirectional flow between the riparian aquifer and surface water features resulting in the temporal variation of the groundwater flow system in the gfp aquifer 4 3 2 water budget of the groundwater storage for quantitative analysis on the volume of groundwater recharge and discharge to explore the temporal and spatial variation of lake river aquifer interactions the model area was divided into 4 subdomains according to the standard of 1 m in water table fluctuation in s 1 as shown in fig 10 zone a is the bank storage district with a fluctuation larger than 1 m the area of zone a is about 1423 km2 zone b is the inner compartments surrounded by the surface water and the zone a with a fluctuation less than 1 m the area of zone b is about 812 km2 zone c is the hilly region at the north west part of the model domain with an area of 462 km2 zone d is the poyang lake in the wet season the groundwater storage change in the total budget area including zone a zone b and zone c was calculated to average monthly based on dynamic water budget analysis as shown in tables 3 and 4 to show the groundwater storage gs difference clearly and also to simplify the table we used v storage to show the net groundwater storage increment and the groundwater budget equation can be simply stated as follows 5 v storage n δ v rain n δ v sw g w n v storage n 1 gs max gs min v storage max where v storage is the net increase in groundwater storage from the minimum groundwater storage gsmin illustrated in the row of total in table 3 δ v rain is the monthly volume of groundwater recharge originating as rainfall infiltration δ v sw g w is the monthly volume of exchange flux between sw gw in table 3 indicates flow direction from the surface water to the groundwater n 1 2 3 12 corresponding to january february march december respectively if n 12 then n 1 represents january of next year the monthly groundwater balance illustrated in table 3 is calculated using the recursion formula as shown in eq 5 for the whole problem domain in s 1 the annual groundwater storage variation was 66 4 106 m3 ranging from 21 618 1 106 m3 gsmin total in table 3 to 21 684 5 106 m3 gsmax total in table 3 and the annual rainfall infiltration was about 38 5 106 m3 last row of the column δ v rain in table 3 during the flood season from march to july table 3 marked in bold fonts the total surface water infiltration tsi of 40 9 106 m3 and the recharge from δvrain in the five months from march to july bold fonts of in table 3 led to the maximum vstorage of 66 4 106 m3 represents the gsmax of 21 684 5 106 m3 till early august during the recession period from august to next february river stage decline forced the aquifer to drain off to the minimum vstorage of 0 represents the gsmin of 21 618 1 106 m3 in early march the total groundwater discharge was about 79 4 106 m3 including the tsi of 40 9 106 m3 and the annual total precipitation tp of 38 5 106 m3 during the whole year in s 2 annual groundwater storage variation was 64 5 106 m3 ranging from 21 597 5 106 m3 gsmin total in table 3 to 21 662 0 106 m3 gsmax the tsi reduced by 2 4 106 m3 from 40 9 106 m3 to 38 5 106 m3 total of δ v sw g w for s 1 and s 2 in table 3 in s 3 annual groundwater storage variation was 64 3 106 m3 ranging from 21 594 5 106 m3 gsmin to 21 658 8 106 m3 gsmax annual rainfall infiltration decreased by 4 106 m3 from 38 5 106 m3 to 34 5 106 m3 total of δ v rain for s 2 and s 3 in table 3 as a result the gsmax reduced by 22 5 106 m3 from 21 684 5 106 m3 s 1 to 21 662 0 106 m3 s 2 and by 3 2 106 m3 from 21 662 0 106 m3 s 2 to 21 658 8 106 m3 s 3 the gsmax decrement of 22 5 106 m3 derived from the reduction in tsi was about 7 times larger than the decrement of 3 2 106 m3 derived from the tp reduction the impact of tsi on groundwater storage the operation of the tgd changed the temporal river aquifer interaction in gfp firstly till june the cumulative δvsw gw during flood season from march to june was almost the same in s 1 and s 2 so it was the δvsw gw reduction from 6 1 106 m3 to 3 8 106 m3 in july contributed to most of the decrement in tsi 2 4 106 m3 secondly the negative influence from the impoundment of tgd in phase 3 and phase 4 fig 6 accelerated the exfiltration of the alluvial aquifer during the period from august to october table 3 δ v sw g w marked in underlined fonts the total δvsw gw in these three months increased about 11 106 m3 from 27 0 106 m3 in s 1 to 38 106 m3 in s 2 making the deficit in gs increase from 22 5 106 m3 in early august to 33 5 106 m3 in early november and in s 3 the tp reduction further reduced the gs by 3 2 106 m3 increased the deficit in gs to 25 7 106 m3 in august and 36 7 106 m3 in november the impact ratio of tsi and tp increased from 7 times to about 10 times in phase 5 of the operation in tgd after november the recovery of surface water level in s 2 made the exfiltration from the aquifer to the river channel reduce but without enough water resource to compensate for the deficit caused by accelerated drainage from august to october table 3 δ v sw g w marked in underlined fonts the gsmin would remain the gap of 20 6 106 m3 between 21 618 1 106 m3 s 1 and 21 597 5 106 m3 s 2 an accelerated drainage process increased the groundwater storage deficit which is caused by inadequate recharge this is why after years of supply reduction the budget deficit accumulated for years till the situation in s 2 that the actual reduction in gs of 22 5 106 m3 is greater than the loss in tsi of 2 4 106 m3 and the deficit will last a whole year unlike the surface water system which would recover to nature condition in december to the inner compartments of the aquifer as shown in table 4 the internal transfer from zone a to zone b was about the same for s 1 and s 2 total in table 4 but both the gsmax and the gsmin of zone b in s 2 were reduced by 7 0 106 m3 total in table 4 that was because the decline in surface water level would finally spread to the inner compartments with a hysteresis effect the annual average water level and the groundwater storage would decrease till another annual quasi stable state after years of drainage process of the alluvial aquifer the same recharge to the inner compartments would lead to the groundwater fluctuation in a relatively lower position with the same amplitude the impact of tp on groundwater storage to further analyze the impact from the tp reduction groundwater storage increment and flux exchange between zone a and zone b were calculated average monthly as shown in table 4 indicates flow direction from zone a to zone b the amount of groundwater exchange between zone a and zone c was negligible in s 1 the total groundwater storage of zone a varied between 12 120 106 m3 and 12 180 106 m3 representing the gsmin and the gsmax total in table 4 and the maximum vstorage of 60 106 m3 was in august which accounted for 90 4 of the maximum vstorage in gfp 66 4 106 m3 tsi of 40 9 106 m3 as described in table 3 contributed to most of the vstorage in zone a during the flood season on the other hand storage in zone b varied between 7560 5 106 m3 and 7568 5 106 m3 the maximum vstorage of 8 106 m3 in zone b was contributed by rainfall infiltration and internal transfer between zone a and zone b the positive flow from zone a to zone b was only in july and august for s 1 and from june to august in s 2 and s 3 table 4 internal transfer from zone a zone b marked in positive bold fonts in these months only about 1 4 106 m3 of floodwater was transferred from zone a to zone b for s 1 accounting for only 3 4 of the tsi 40 9 106 m3 in s 2 and s 3 the positive internal transfer was about 1 4 106 m3 and 1 8 106 m3 respectively also very small compared to the tsi of 38 5 106 m3 in s 2 and 34 5 106 m3 in s 3 the floodwater barely reached zone b so it was the rainfall that mainly contributed to the groundwater storage of the inner compartments in gfp however the riparian district is the only pathway for the rainfall infiltration to discharge from the inner compartments to the river reaches which act as the base level of the groundwater discharge and the source of the bank storage think backward from s 3 to s 2 even if the rainfall would recover from 34 5 106 m3 for s 3 to 38 5 106 m3 for s 2 table 3 t o t a l δ v rain the gsmax in zone b would increase only 1 5 106 m3 from 7560 106 m3 for s 3 to 7561 5 106 m3 for s 2 not regain 7568 5 106 m3 for s 1 total in table 4 that was because rainfall infiltration increment will increase the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater flow reducing the internal transfer from zone a to zone b from 1 8 106 m3 to 1 4 106 m3 and increasing the annual total discharge for zone b from 12 6 106 m3 to 13 4 106 m3 table 4 total as a result most of the rainfall increment will not turn into groundwater storage in zone b but flow to zone a and finally discharge to the river channel on the contrary under the condition of the same tp with a higher blocking effect from the zone a as the situation in s 1 zone b will increase the groundwater storage year by year due to the reduction of groundwater discharge therefore the blocking effect from bank storage is the decisive factor of the groundwater storage in the inner compartments to sum up the groundwater system in gfp serves as a large subsurface water reservoir which stores water during flood season and releases water during the dry season surface water level drop after july which is mainly caused by the impoundment of tgd during phase 3 and phase 4 from july to late october is mainly responsible for the groundwater storage recession by reducing the tsi into the groundwater and changing the schedule of the sw gw interaction tp reduction in plb had a relatively stronger influence on the inner compartments compared to the bank storage however the bank storage acted as the threshold for the inner compartments a higher and lasting river stage will activate a larger capacity of the bank storage by extending the volume of the bank storage so that the blocking effect of the bank storage on the inner compartments could grow stronger for detaining more water deriving from precipitation recharge 4 3 3 exchange flux differences of the river reaches in terms of bank storage reduction there are spatial and temporal differences in the contribution of the river reaches fig 12 illustrated the simulated exchange flux between rivers and aquifer in each month of a year and fig 13 is the detailed daily water budget of the model in july and october it is shown that the change of surface water regime affected the river aquifer interaction in gfp involving four aspects as follows first as described in section 4 3 2 was the δvsw gw reduction in july contributed to most of the decrement in tsi 2 4 106 m3 and all the river reaches were responsible for the decrement for example in july fig 13a the infiltration in the tangyin branch of ganjiang river reduced about 242 73 103 m3 d from 354 31 103 m3 d to 111 58 103 m3 d and in xiuhe river the infiltration reduced about 195 35 103 m3 d from 226 17 103 m3 d to 30 82 103 m3 d the total surface water infiltration reduction of the five river reaches as shown in fig 13a was about 908 32 103 m3 d the sum of the infiltration reduction of the five river reaches from s 1 to s 2 as shown in the left column of fig 13a ganjiang river including waizhou branch tangyin branch wucheng branch xiuhe river fuhe river contributed to about 46 8 21 5 and 31 7 of the total surface water infiltration reduction ganjiang river is mainly responsible for the infiltration reduction in plb especially along the wucheng branch and tangyin branch second the recharge period was shortened in some of the river reaches for s 2 because the infiltration shifted to exfiltration in advance due to the lowered level of the surface water system during the summer season as shown in fig 12 the exfiltration advanced about 1 month to august along the tangyin branch and wucheng branch and advanced about 2 months to july along fuhe river the infiltration along the fuhe river in july reduced about 288 19 103 m3 d from 185 43 103 m3 d to 102 76 103 m3 d fig 13a surface water level drop in july and august has a stronger influence on the southern part of the plb because the groundwater level at this part of the plb is generally higher than 15 m only if the blocking effect is strong enough to keep the surface water level in poyang lake and yangtze river higher than 15 m can the river stage in fuhe river generally higher than the groundwater table otherwise the infiltration from fuhe river to the surrounding aquifer will shift to exfiltration however after october the direct hydraulic connection between fuhe river and poyang lake is basically severed the interaction between fuhe and the surrounding groundwater will no longer be affected by the yangtze river third in october and november the accelerated groundwater drainage was mainly due to the impoundment process in tgd the total exfiltration flux of the five river reaches as shown in figs 12 and 13b increased about 308 9 103 m3 d and 419 2 103 m3 d respectively the sum of the infiltration reduction of the five river reaches from s 1 to s 2 as shown in the left column of fig 13b in october ganjiang river including waizhou branch tangyin branch wucheng branch xiuhe river fuhe river contributed to about 50 2 24 6 and 25 2 of the total surface water exfiltration increment of 308 9 103 m3 d and in november the contribution of the three tributaries is 70 9 28 2 and 0 9 respectively the result implies that the impact from the yangtze river to the plb gradually retreated from south to north during the recession period from august to november in november while the hydraulic connection between fuhe river and poyang lake is basically severed the accelerated groundwater drainage caused by the weakened blocking effect from the yangtze river is still working in the wucheng tangyin branch of ganjiang river and xiuhe river fourth precipitation reduction has an indirect influence on the exchange flux between sw gw in july as shown in fig 13a groundwater level drop due to the precipitation reduction inversely increased the relative water level difference between river and aquifer so that the river infiltration in s 3 is larger than that in s 2 such as tangyin branch the infiltration increased from 111 58 103 m3 d to 115 56 103 m3 d the total increment in the infiltration of the five river reaches was about 12 193 103 m3 d sum of the difference between the second and the third digits in the left column of fig 13a which is mainly stored in zone a and had little influence on the internal transfer between zone a and zone b or zone a and zone c as a result without the compensation from the river infiltration the groundwater storage decrease due to the precipitation reduction in zone b and zone c is larger than that in zone a in october as shown in fig 13b the situation is reversed the reduced precipitation led to less exfiltration from zone a to the river reaches and the total decrement in exfiltration was about 11 92 103 m3 d sum of the difference between the second and the third digits in the left column of fig 13b which is not enough for compensating all the precipitation decrement for the zone abc and also had little influence to the internal transfer between zone a and zone b or zone a and zone c so the precipitation reduction tends to increase the river infiltration in flood season and reduce exfiltration during the dry season but the change in infiltration is not enough for compensating for the groundwater storage decrement caused by precipitation reduction 5 conclusions this study mainly focused on investigating the river lake aquifer interactions by emphasizing the anthropogenic and climatic influences on the sw gw interaction to further extend the previous understanding of the poyang lake basin plb water system a regional groundwater flow numerical model was built to quantify inflow or outflow between sw gw in gan fu plain gfp three model scenarios based on the historical monitoring data were designed to compare the impact considering the operation of the tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions the simulation results indicate that the hydrograph change of the yangtze river due to the operation of the tgd is mainly responsible for the autumn drought in plb not the local precipitation reduction the research results emphasize that the groundwater system plays an important role in the water cycle and will be seriously affected by the regime change in the surface water system the results conclude that the lake rive aquifer interaction in gfp is complicated by many factors 1 the dramatic seasonal fluctuation of the river stage and the alluvial sediment property leads to intensified sw gw interactions in the riparian aquifer and the formation of bank storage which is the main transitional zone between sw gw interactions bank storage is located in the districts within 3 km from the lake and rivers and accounted for 90 4 of the groundwater storage increment in gfp the surface water infiltration contributes to most of the bank storage but less than 5 of the infiltration is transmitted from bank storage to the inner part of the alluvial aquifer bank storage is not meant to recharge the inner compartments but to block the discharge from the inner compartments to the river channel like a water curtain 2 the operation of tgd can be divided into 5 phases the operation in phase 3 to phase 5 from mid july to december had a negative influence on plb by weakening the blocking effect to the lake drainage and the negative impact was the largest in early november due to the sharp impoundment during october tgd operation has a chain effect on the downstream water system including the yangtze river and the poyang lake in plb the impact from the tgd spread upstream to the downstream of the five tributaries and gradually weakened from north to south 3 hydrological change causes the groundwater storage recession in gfp by reducing the total surface water infiltration and by changing the schedule of the sw gw interaction as a result the maximum groundwater storage reduced by 22 5 106 m3 in august and then the deficit aggravated to 33 5 106 m3 in early november leading to the advanced dry season by one month in plb among all the tributaries ganjiang river contributed to about 46 8 of the infiltration reduction and during the drainage period ganjiang river contributed to about 50 2 and 70 9 of the exfiltration increment from the riparian aquifer in october and november the groundwater storage deficit would maintain the whole year unlike the surface water system which would recover to pre tgd state in december 4 impact of the hydrological change is much strong than the impact of precipitation reduction in some alluvial plain in gfp the reduction in groundwater storage of 22 5 106 m3 due to the hydrological change was about 7 times larger than the reduction in groundwater storage of 3 2 106 m3 caused by precipitation reduction the impact ratio of hydrological change and precipitation reduction could increase to 10 times in early november due to the drastic impoundment in tgd this research provides a typical reference for exploring the synergetic effect of anthropogenic and meteorological impact on a lake river aquifer system it is of great significance to the assessment of the evolution of the plb water system which is the basis of the evolution of the riparian and estuarine wetland ecosystem the results also provide useful information for further optimization of the schedule in tgd to reduce the impact on the downstream water system and help to enhance and strengthen water resources management in gfp and other similar lake river aquifer systems further research should focus on the regional climate change induced by the evaporation in tgd and its influences on the plb also further research into the variation of the unsaturated zone and its impact on the ecosystem of the riparian estuarine districts in plb may be significant for improving the systematic recognition of the role that the hydrological system plays in the ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement zhenchen wang methodology

4810,in low lying fluvial lacustrine plain anthropogenic activities and climatic variation could have a comprehensive influence on the interactions between surface water and groundwater sw gw involving lake river aquifer quantification of the changes in sw gw interaction in spatial and temporal scale causing by the two driving sources could help to the understanding of the regional water cycle mechanism and the adjustment of the decision making however it is usually difficult to distinguish the impact of anthropogenic activities from the climatic variation on a regional scale here by using a regional three dimensional groundwater numerical model with long term monitoring of the hydrological dynamic in poyang lake basin plb china we found that groundwater storage variation in the bank storage districts can be used as an indicator to quantify each source and sink in the process of sw gw interactions and surface water infiltration plays a more dominant role in constructing bank storage which is meant to preserve groundwater storage our research in plb demonstrates that the hydrological change caused by the operation of the three gorges dam tgd since 2003 is mainly responsible for the autumn drought in plb the surface water recession due to the impoundment in tgd from september to october has an impact about 7 times stronger than the rainfall reduction moreover the groundwater storage deficit caused by the insufficient recharge from the surface water infiltration would maintain the whole year unlike the surface water system which would easily recover at the end of the year the results demonstrate the chain interactions among lake river aquifer failing to distinguish the magnitude of each influence factor may lead to underestimating the impact on the whole water system the results also highlight the function and the vulnerability of the groundwater system which might be vital to the riparian and estuarine wetland ecosystem keywords spatiotemporal variation surface water groundwater interaction groundwater modeling bank storage three gorges dam tgd poyang lake basin plb 1 introduction interaction between surface water sw and groundwater gw affects the recharge discharge process in the water cycle that is vital to the aquifer environment and groundwater sustainability sw gw interaction is complicated by anthropogenic and climatic influences human activities such as dam operation and groundwater pumping and irrigation have a strong influence on the natural river stage dynamics and the relative recharge and discharge

complexity to the study of sw gw interactions firstly climate variation influences the temporal patterns of groundwater contribution to streamflow saha et al 2017 tran et al 2020 secondly in catchments with extreme climate conditions the groundwater system is especially sensitive to the dynamics of surface water regime caused by seasonal precipitation variation bartsch et al 2014 vu et al 2018 there are many cases around the world demonstrating the importance of identifying the dominant influence factor of environmental and hydrological degradation jaramillo and destouni 2015 khazaei et al 2019 madani 2014 wine 2019 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 misidentification of the main factor will lead to serious socio economic consequences wine and davison 2019 wine 2020 thus it is crucial to distinguish and quantify the impact of the anthropogenic and meteorological influences on the sw gw interactions for adequate water resources management in this paper we set the poyang lake basin plb of southeast china as a typical example to evaluate the sw gw interactions influenced by human activity and contemporary climate conditions poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake in china hu et al 2007 the drastically seasonal variation of poyang lake is comprehensively controlled by gentle slope topography subtropical monsoon climate and the inflow outflow from the five tributaries to the yangtze river shankman et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 mei et al 2016 the prominent characteristic of poyang lake can be described as flooding immensely and receding fleetly implying that in flood season from late june through august poyang lake features the largest freshwater lake occupying an area of 3960 km2 and reaches its maximum capacity of 30 109 m3 with a water depth of 21 m while in the dry season from january to february the lake shrinks drastically to a narrow channel with the maximum water depth less than 10 m exposing extensive floodplains and wetland areas the rest of the lake turns into the wetland dramatic variation of the surface water system led to intensified sw gw interactions in the gan fu plain gfp formed by alluvial sediments of the ganjiang river fuhe river and xiuhe river on the west side of poyang lake interactions among poyang lake tributaries and alluvial aquifer guarantee the water supply for agricultural irrigation of 4445 km2 rice farmland in jiangxi province and domestic use for about 22 million people in the northern part of jiangxi province and also facilitate the eco function of plb as one of the world s six major wetland systems with high biological diversity zhang et al 2012 hu et al 2015 mei et al 2016 qian et al 2016 ye et al 2019 however plb has been suffering a long term seasonal drought during the winter season since 2003 which is claimed to be the conjunct influence of climate change in the poyang lake and the upper yangtze reaches coincided with the operation of the three gorges dam tgd ye et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 researchers concluded that climate change and human activity advance the dry season one month earlier in plb guo et al 2012 gao et al 2013 lai et al 2014a 2014b zhang et al 2014 zhan et al 2016 hydrological droughts occur when lake water storage decrease significantly below normal conditions led to the degradation of the wetland which is the vital habitat for endangered species like the finless porpoise and the siberian crane lai et al 2014a 2014b tang et al 2016 the drought also caused groundwater pumping difficulty and groundwater resource deficiency especially to the rural district on the east side of nanchang the capital city of china s jiangxi province due to groundwater over abstraction in the past several decades a drastic regional cone of groundwater depression had gradually enlarged up to about190 km2 till 2016 based on the data collected from the local government fig 1 previous studies have emphasized investigating the anthropogenic and climatic impact on interactions between surface water features including yangtze river poyang lake and its tributaries such hydrological interactions can be summarized as blocking drainage effects which means the yangtze river has a larger fluctuation of the surface water level than the poyang lake in flooding dry season high low water level in the yangtze river has a blocking drainage effect to the outflow from poyang lake to the yangtze river hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 li and zhang 2018 backflow caused by the blocking effect from the yangtze river during july september could contribute to about 3 of the total lake inflow and the backflow may travel 20 km southward from the yangtze river into the lake li et al 2017 some researchers suggested that the lake shrinkage was not a long term trend but a regime shift triggered by the stage decrease of the yangtze river liu et al 2013 and the water impoundment in tgd from late september to early november is mainly responsible for the drought and should be modified gao et al 2013 mei et al 2016 nevertheless it remains unknown how the tgd contributes to the water shortage in plb and further quantitative assessment should be made zhang et al 2015 besides since surface water and groundwater system is closely connected in gfp it is significant to incorporate groundwater system into the analysis of the sw gw interaction influenced by the operation of tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions some researchers took the groundwater system into account and found the flux rate between the riverine aquifer and river reaches were around 4 to 7 times higher than that of the isolated lake groundwater interactions li et al 2019 whereas the middle region between rivers in gfp has a much weaker hydraulic connection with surface water thus possibly arousing soil gleyization under future climate change yang et al 2019 however how much the impact adverse natural conditions and human activities have on the groundwater system in the gfp is still unclear in low lying flat fluvial lacustrine plain like gfp the main replenishment sources of groundwater are precipitation and river water vrzel et al 2018 temporary storage in flood plain aquifer around riparian zone plays an important role in attenuating flood peak in surface water features hung et al 2012 and the storage could also become an important part of the base flow in the dry season brunke and gonser 1997 gardner 1999 smakhtin 2001 krause et al 2007 hung et al 2012 gebreyohannes et al 2013 rhodes et al 2017 kaandorp et al 2018 the water stored in flood season and released after the flood is referred to as bank storage singh 1968 usually the buffer capacity of the bank storage is dependent on several geologic and hydrological parameters of the aquifer and stream chen and chen 2003 bartsch et al 2014 vouillamoz et al 2015 hénault ethier et al 2017 to figure out how much influence the operation of tgd and the variation in climatic conditions have on the sw gw interactions in gfp it is quite necessary to probe into the major areas of sw gw interactions the proportion of various water sources stored in the bank storage district and alluvial aquifer should be distinguished and the effects of different interference factors on the seasonal dynamics of the water sources should also be estimated this study focuses on the annual dynamic change of the groundwater system under complex lake river aquifer interactions the main objective is to address how the alluvial aquifer reacts to the variation of the hydrological and meteorological conditions to address this problem several items should be evaluated 1 variation of the groundwater storage at spatial and temporal scale 2 annual dynamics of the river aquifer exchange and precipitation variation 3 interactions between lake river aquifer and 4 change of water regime resulting from the operation of the tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions to evaluate these items we attempt to interpolate the temporal and spatial fluctuation of surface water into a groundwater numerical model detailed surface water groundwater sw gw exchange was calculated based on realistic scenarios to analyze the impact of human activity and contemporary climatic conditions on the sw gw interactions 2 study area and available data 2 1 brief description of the study area poyang lake is the largest freshwater lake located at the south bank of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river the northern border of jiangxi province china fig 1 poyang lake basin plb has a seasonal monsoon climate with an annual average precipitation of about 1343 1843 mm which is mostly concentrated in the summer season fig 3 b the average evaporation is about 1044 mm per year and the average temperature is around 16 20 c poyang lake catchment with an area of 162 000 km2 consists of lacustrine plain surrounding poyang lake and the broad alluvial valleys of the five tributary streams including xiuhe river ganjiang river fuhe river raohe river and xinjiang river the total inflow into the lake is around 148 109 m3 y with an average monthly inflow ranging from 5 1 109 m3 in january to 28 9 109 m3 in june fig 3d the runoff from the tributaries converges in the lake and then heading north to the outlet the only outlet of poyang lake is a narrow channel connecting with the yangtze river located at hukou county and the discharge runoff is decided by the respective water level of poyang lake and yangtze river fig 1 the three gorges dam tgd is located at the upper stream of the yangtze river about 800 km west of hukou county tgd started to operate in the year 2003 which has a significant influence on the runoff downstream of the yangtze river the regulated runoff needs about 5 days to reach the hukou station under the conjunctive influence from the yangtze river and the five tributaries the lake level of poyang lake fluctuates between 8 m and 16 m gan fu alluvial plain gfp as shown in fig 1 is the largest sub catchment 3649 5 km2 in plb bounded by xiuhe river in the north fuhe river in the southeast and the three branches of ganjiang river flowing through the center of the plain all the rivers cut through the lower alluvial aquifer and run separately into the poyang lake which constitutes a relatively independent hydrogeological unit the groundwater system can be seasonally recharged by precipitation infiltration and surface water bodies including lakes and rivers having a renewable and abundant source of groundwater in quaternary shallow aquifers according to groundwater extraction statistics by the local geological survey institute about 89 7 of total groundwater extraction is dispersedly extracted for agricultural irrigation and domestic usage and 10 3 of the total amount is associated with centralized groundwater pumping in nanchang city for industrial use xiao et al 2001 2 2 data collection daily water level and precipitation data were observed from gauging stations in poyang lake and the lower reaches of five tributaries fig 1 the five gauging stations namely hukou hk xingzi xz duchang dc tangyin ty and kangshan ks distributed from the north to the south in the main lake area sanyang sy in junshan lake in the south also there are several tributary gauging stations distributed in the different rivers including waizhou wz changyi cy and wucheng wc in ganjiang river qiujin qj and yongxiu yx in xiuhe river and lijiadu ljd in fuhe river the data of hydro stratigraphic were collected based on 276 boreholes collected from the geological survey report by zhang 2008 and 144 boreholes from the local geological survey institute the lithological and stratigraphic data help to delineate heterogeneities geological structures and bedding planes long term groundwater levels with an interval of 3 5 days were collected based on the 50 boreholes conducted by the geological survey since the 1980s gdinjp 2018 nmic 2018 a total number of 133 in site aquifer tests were manipulated in gfp the location of pumping tests and hydrogeological parameter estimation are shown in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity of the main alluvial aquifer ranges from 0 6 to 258 6 m d with a typical alluvial sediment characteristic table 1 the locations of the pumping test for in situ hydrogeological parameter estimation are shown in fig 2 the terrain datasets used in the groundwater model were collected from the combination of the bathymetry of the lake and river bed with 5 m spatial resolution obtained from topographic survey files and the 30 m strm version1 http dds cr usgs gov srtm digital elevation model dem data the datasets include bathymetry covering the entire lake area and the river channels of the tributaries 3 groundwater modeling 3 1 hydrogeological conceptual model the principal aquifer in gfp that comprises alluvial lacustrine sediments has a mean thickness of about 25 m ranging from 5 m to 119 2 m the aquifer can be divided into two units the upper aquifer ua and the lower aquifer la the ua is the holocene and upper pleistocene unit that is composed of alluvial lacustrine silty clay filling with organic components and is of a mean thickness of about 8 m in general the hydraulic conductivity of the ua is less than 10 m d the la is the middle lower pleistocene unit which mainly comprises fluvial deposits like cobble and gravel with sand and it is of a mean thickness of about 16 5 m ranging from 1 m to 87 m the hydraulic conductivity of the la ranges from about 10 m d to 300 m d according to the in situ aquifer tests the underlying unit of the aquifer is the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone that is relatively impermeable and is considered as the bottom of the aquifer based on surficial hydrogeological mapping see fig 1 and the hydrogeological parameters the quaternary aquifer of interest in gfp can be divided into 7 zones subdomains in the numerical model fig 2 a g for model calibration subdomain a denotes the part of the poyang lake and the wetland b the alluvium from the downstream reaches of ganjiang river c the alluvium from the fuhe river d the alluvium from the mainstream of the ganjiang river e the alluvium from the xiuhe river and wucheng branch of ganjiang river f the residual deposit of the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone and g the outcrop of bedrock in gfp river water infiltration and rainfall are two parts of the groundwater recharge the river reaches are well connected with the riparian aquifer by vertical infiltration into the aquifer during flood season and exfiltration out of the aquifer during the dry season the annual average rainfall as shown in fig 3 was about 1536 mm during the period from 1956 to 2003 of which about 74 rainfall was from april to august and the largest monthly rainfall is 272 mm in june and then during the period from 2003 to 2010 annual average rainfall reduced to 1411 mm fig 3a avg rainfall reduction was mainly recorded by the gauging stations at the northern part of the plb including qj yx cy dc and xz stations the groundwater depletion is mainly through evapotranspiration lateral outflow to the surface water features and groundwater abstraction the annual abstraction of the groundwater at the east of nanchang city was about 40 106 m3 y but due to the lack of detailed information the amount of groundwater pumping is equally distributed to the groundwater over abstraction district in general the dynamics of the groundwater system in gfp is driven by seasonal rainfall and surface water level variation groundwater flow direction in general consistent with the topography is from the southwest to the northeast however when groundwater comes to the riverside of the aquifer the flow direction is mainly dominated by the water level difference between the aquifer and the nearest surface water feature 3 2 groundwater numerical model 3 2 1 mathematical model to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the regional groundwater regime and quantify the exchange flux between sw gw and variation of groundwater storage in response to the variations in hydrological conditions a three dimensional finite element transient numerical groundwater flow model was built based on the previous study by using the combination of feflow code and 3 d spatial analysis function of gis yang et al 2019 diersch 2014 feflow is capable of simulating sw gw interactions in a flexible time step length by using time series and convenient for refining the triangle mesh at any position of the model diersch 2014 the mathematical representation of the conceptual model can be described as 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t h x y z 0 φ x y z x y z φ h b 1 h 1 x y z t x y z b 1 k h n b 2 v x y z t x y z b 2 where kxx kyy and kzz are the respective principal components of hydraulic conductivity tensor along the x y and z coordinates lt 1 h is the hydraulic head w is the volumetric flux that represents sources or sinks t 1 ss is the specific storage l 1 and t is time t φ is the model domain and φ is the spatial distribution of the initial hydraulic head l b 1 is the specified head boundary condition and h 1 represents the hydrograph of the boundary condition over time b2 is the flux boundary condition and the v represents the groundwater flow speed along the vertical direction of the boundary 3 2 2 spatial and temporal discretization as shown in fig 4 the numerical model was discretized into 3 layers vertically based on the statistics of the stratigraphic information from the boreholes representing the respective ua layer 1 la layer 2 and the cretaceous argillaceous siltstone layer 3 from the surface to the bottom horizontally the model was discretized into 34 951 triangular prismatic mesh elements with the lateral size less than 1000 m also some meshes along river reach and lakeshore were moderately refined to the lateral size ranging from 100 m to 400 m to delineate the topographic variation as accurately as possible 3 2 3 implementing boundary conditions the regional groundwater model was designed for simulating the dynamic lake river aquifer interactions under different scenarios associated with human activity and climate variation thus the variation of hydraulic gradient among the three parts of the water system must be well simulated based on the historical datasets of the gauging stations in plb and landsat remote sensing images of the poyang lake by addressing an interpolation of the boundary conditions and spatial temporal discretization of the model the variation of surface and underground interaction can be reasonably described to reproduce the real situation in gfp a rivers in gfp surface water features fig 2 are well connected with the alluvial aquifer so they can be defined as specified head boundary conditions in the numerical model to portray the surface water infiltration and exfiltration the time varying specified heads along the river and lake boundaries are given into the numerical model as time series monitored by gauging stations with a time resolution of 1 day all the rivers are piecewise interpolated between two gauging stations from upstream to downstream and each segment of the interpolated river reaches will be given a time series interpolated by the 2 time series of the river stage monitored by 2 gauging stations at the upstream and the downstream the time series along the river are interpolated as follows firstly the river between the two gauging stations l is the total length of the river between the two gauging stations is sub divided into several segments l x represents the length of each segment of the river by equally dividing river bed elevation difference which is extracted from the bathymetry dem dataset 5 5 pixels secondly the river level of each segment can be calculated through a weighted average manner according to the following formulation 2 t i t d 1 x 1 θ i 1 t u t d θ i t u t d 2 where θ i is the length proportion θ x l x l of the i th i 1 2 3 4 segment t u and t d are the time series of the annual river stage collected by the upstream gauging station and downstream gauging station the length proportion θ i is treated as a weight factor multiplier to the river level series as a result a river is scattered into segments and each river segment has its corresponding time series t i during the simulation period for example the ganjiang river is divided into 5 segments between wucheng station and waizhou station fig 5 a the time series of wc and wz are interpolated into 5 time series for the 5 river segments as shown in fig 5b b lake spatial and temporal variations of the poyang lake stage is influenced by the natural hydraulic gradient between ks and hk stations and seasonal fluctuation of lake size in the groundwater model the lake body is represented as a specified head boundary condition at the mesh points at the top of the model the lake area where the boundary condition nodes were placed in the specific head is adjusted monthly under the monthly landsat remote sensing images 2004 2016 specified head nodes along the lake boundaries are assigned segmental constant values that are interpolated between monitored transient water levels recorded at six gauging stations using eq 2 3 3 model calibration and validation the calibration included three steps firstly a steady state model was calibrated using the groundwater level on january 1th 1986 to generate the initial conditions of the groundwater flow for the transient model besides the material property and infiltration coefficient was initially adjusted to meet the confidence interval of the groundwater level which is 0 5 m secondly the continuous groundwater level data from 1 1 1986 to 12 31 1986 was chosen to manipulate a transient state calibration for all the transient simulation in this study the fixed time step of the simulation was set to 5 days to meet the unstable variation driven by the surface water level fluctuation for model calibration the convergence criterion for the groundwater flow equation was set to be 0 001 m after the transient calibration the parameters of hydraulic conductivity k infiltration coefficient specific yield sy were calibrated to achieve a reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured groundwater levels and an acceptable water budget thirdly the calibrated model was validated based on whether it matched the set of field data of 11 observation wells from 1 1 2010 to 12 31 2010 the initial values of hydrogeological parameters in each sub domain table 1 are the average value obtained from in site pumping tests as shown in fig 2 we assume the homogeneous and isotropic material property in each sub domain as shown in fig 2 two fitting criteria including the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were used to calibrate and validate the numerical model the main target was to minimize the groundwater head rmse and mae in each time step of 5 days during the calibration and validation process 3 r m s e j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j 2 n 4 m a e j 1 m i 1 n h c i h o i j n where hc and ho are the calculated head at the jth time step from the simulation model and observed head at ith observation location n is the number of observation locations m is the number of time steps after the calibration process an oat one factor at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine how the groundwater storage would respond to the changes in the influence factors through increasing and decreasing the initial value of the influence factors by 5 to 10 morris 1991 feng et al 2018 the influence factors include the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer k rainfall infiltration coefficient ic and the surface water level swl appendix a fig a2 the sensitivity analysis aims to identify the main influence factor on the interaction between sw gw which is calculated by the volume of the groundwater storage so that we can improve the qualitative understanding of the influence factors 3 4 simulation scenarios to distinguish the impact of the anthropogenic activities from the contemporary climatic condition the monthly rainfall and the hydrograph of the surface water features from 1956 to 2010 were statistically analyzed the monthly average rainfall in gfp from 1956 to 2010 shows that precipitation had a decreasing trend after 2003 as shown in fig 3a b c on the other hand the stage decrease of the lake and rivers in the plb water system is attributable to a weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river after the operation of tgd in 2003 zhang et al 2014 considering the influence of climate condition and anthropogenic factors on the hydrological and hydrogeological process three model scenarios were designed including 1 s 1 under daily averaged surface water level and recharge from precipitation from 1956 to 2003 2 s 2 under daily averaged surface water level from 2003 to 2010 and precipitation from 1956 to 2003 and 3 s 3 under daily averaged surface water level from 2003 to 2010 and changing precipitation from 2003 to 2010 in response to climate variation the daily averaged surface water level in different gauging stations are shown in the left column in fig 6 and the monthly averaged precipitation in the two periods are shown in fig 3b s 1 represented the natural state before the operation of tgd in 2003 s 2 only considered the impact of human activity not the role of climate variation s 3 provided a comprehensive influence induced by anthropogenic factor and meteorological factor the comparison between s 2 and s 3 can distinguish the influence of meteorological factor on the groundwater flow system interpolation manner of the boundary conditions of these three scenarios was also based on eq 1 discussed in section 3 2 the changing meteorological and hydrological data associated with the three scenarios were implemented in the numerical model for running 30 years to generate an annual quasi stable state of groundwater flow which means the annual dynamic of the groundwater table will be driven only by the two factors including annual rainfall variation and the surface water stage variation and the noises of the random events in a typical year are filtered so we can use the dynamic of a complete hydrological year to represent the multi year average dynamic of the groundwater system 4 results and analyses 4 1 impacts of tgd on lake river interaction the impacts of tgd on the lake river interaction in plb include two aspects i e the temporal and spatial variations 4 1 1 temporal variation of the interaction the water budget of the poyang lake is determined by the inflow from the tributaries and the outflow from hukou into the yangtze river as shown in fig 3d before june the lake level is much higher than the river stage in yangtze river because the lake level is mainly controlled by the strong inflow of the tributaries from march to july after june the surface water level in poyang lake and yangtze river become consistent till november representing a unified hydraulic connection between the lake and the yangtze river in the meanwhile the total inflow reduced drastically from 28 92 109 m3 in june to 9 77 109 m3 in august which is only about 1 3 of the maximum inflow without enough inflow for keeping the high lake level the blocking effect from yangtze river to poyang lake from august to november becomes the main factor to keep the lake level from drastic decline after july after 2003 the river level of yangtze river in the autumn season occurred a significant water level difference compared to the period before 2003 fig 6 illustrated the daily averaged water level of the 4 gauging stations before and after 2003 s 1 and s 2 in the left column of fig 6 and the water level difference wld in the right column of fig 6 between the two periods we list 3 other stations of duchang qiujin lijiadu in appendix b the black line as shown in the right column of fig 6 illustrated the water level in tgd in 2007 the hydrograph was chosen to represent the reservoir regulation process of the tgd after 2003 the releasement and impoundment cycle during a hydrological year making the water level in tgd ranges from 145 m to 155 m the low level of 145 kept from june to september and the high level of 155 m kept from october to february the adjustment process of tgd during a year could be divided into 5 phases table 2 by comparing the natural river stage in yangtze river represented by the water level at hk station and the regulated water level in tgd phase 1 and phase 2 from february to mid july represent the rising of the yangtze river and a mild releasing process in tgd which have slightly increased the runoff in the yangtze river at the beginning of phase 3 in mid july the yangtze river reached its highest annual river stage indicating that the river stage in the yangtze river shifted from rising to falling in mid july while the water level in tgd remained unchanged at 145 m implying that the adjustment of tgd shifted from releasing phase 2 to impounding phase 3 therefore mid july is the turning point of positive and negative influence from the tgd on the downstream the negative influence of runoff reduction in the yangtze river lies in lowering the river stage since the beginning of phase 3 the wld at hk station and ks station gradually increased from 0 m in phase 2 to 0 87 0 78 m till the end of phase 3 fig 6 after september the intense impoundment in phase 4 raised the water level in tgd from 145 m to above 155 m in only one month the intense impoundment further cut down the runoff in the yangtze river aggravated the river level decline in the whole downstream making the wld at hk station and ks station further increased to 3 00 1 26 m after the impoundment period the runoff of the yangtze river gradually regained the natural state of low flow in phase 5 the wld at hk station and ks station reduced to 0 78 0 06 m in november and completely recovered to the pre tgd state at the end of december 4 1 2 spatial variation of the interaction there was spatial variability in the influence of the tgd on poyang lake that the influence gradually weakened from north to south so the maximum wld gradually decreased from hk station to ks station from 3 m to 1 26 m in late october the main reason for the spatial variability was due to the differences in the degree of the hydraulic connection among different parts of the surface water system the hydraulic connection is controlled by both the surface water level and the topography of the river lake bed as shown in fig 7 poyang lake has a unified hydraulic connection in flood season july with a high flat lake surface from hk station to ks station so the river stage change in yangtze river could directly change the lake level at ks station s 1 in jul and s 2 in jul in fig 7 however in november the water depth of the lake reduced to less than 5 m at the southern part and the higher lake bed at ty station blocked the lake discharge from ty to dc station leaving only the northern part of the lake from hk to dc station maintained the consistent hydrological connection with yangtze river so that the weakened blocking effect caused by the river level drop in yangtze river will have a much strong influence to the northern part of the poyang lake compared to the southern part the spatial variability made the hydraulic gradient in poyang lake from ks to hk increase from 0 007 s 1 to 0 021 s 2 in late october which led to accelerated drainage from the lake to the yangtze river as the base level of the watershed the changing lake level also has an influence on the river stage in the lower reaches of the tributaries so the impact from the tgd could also spread upstream from the lake to the tributaries for example as shown in fig 7 the lake level had a blocking effect on the runoff in the wucheng branch of ganjiang river in july even with the similar runoff in s 1 and s 2 the river stage in s 2 was about 1 26 m lower than that in s 1 due to the lake level drop at xz station in the drainage process the weakened blocking effect further aggravated in october making the wld between s 1 and s 1 increased to 2 37 m at wc station which is much larger than the 1 53 m at wz station fig 6 therefore the hydraulic gradient in wucheng branch also increases from 0 033 s 1 to 0 047 s 2 implying an accelerated drainage effect from the river to the lake however there are exceptions ljd station at the upper reaches of the fuhe river is out of range from the influence of the poyang lake thus the wld of the upper river reaches were not clearly responsive to the operation of the tgd and has a range of less than 1 m river levels at these gauging stations were mainly controlled by inflow from the runoff generation district 4 2 groundwater dynamics 4 2 1 result of the calibration process the calibration process of the groundwater numerical model is based on the identification of the regional hydrological regime and the monitored data the scatter diagrams and hydrographs of simulated groundwater level in every 5 days against the observed value after transient calibration and validation were shown in appendix a and the calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 results show that the calculated groundwater level is consistent with the observed groundwater level during the calibration period and the validation period the mae is less than 0 5 m and the rmse is less than 0 6 m because the natural groundwater table is affected by random incidents and heterogeneity of the rainfall distribution and the hydrogeological condition the homogeneous and isotropic material property of the model led to a smoother variation of the calculated groundwater level however in this study an annual averaged dynamic of the quasi stable state is the objective so it is adequate to filter out the sudden change of the groundwater level caused by random events in a typical hydrological year and the heterogeneity of the material properties or the precipitation change the result of the sensitivity analysis also proves the main influence factor is the swl ic and k have no significant influence on groundwater storage therefore by using the daily averaged surface water level even the rmse is larger than the criteria of 0 5 m we think the model is adequate for simulating a seasonal average condition 4 2 2 groundwater level differences of the scenarios in response to the changes in hydrological and meteorological conditions associated with three model scenarios the groundwater system will also experience spatial and temporal variation fig 8 illustrates the simulated seasonally low and high groundwater levels in february and july for s 1 and the differences between scenarios in february and july we set 14 observation points op1 op14 in the problem domain fig 8 to examine and compare the simulated groundwater levels for the three scenarios appendix c for all three scenarios the groundwater system has the same annual dynamic that has a lower groundwater table in february and a higher groundwater table in july following the seasonal variation of the rainfall in terms of the riparian aquifer as shown in fig 8a due to the low river stage in the river channel in february groundwater discharge to all the surface water features in most parts of the model area while in july the groundwater flow reversed due to the inversion in relative water level difference between surface water features and the aquifer however the cone of depression is caused by historical over pumping exits in the east of nanchang city the water level is lower than 10 m which is about 5 0 m below the ganjiang river stage yearly making the surface water continuously infiltrate from the ganjiang river to the alluvial aquifer in s 2 as shown in fig 8b and e the groundwater level declined about less than 0 5 m in most parts of the inner compartments between the river reaches compared to s 1 represented by the observation points like op4 op6 op10 in districts like the downstream area of wucheng branch and xiuhe river and the riparian aquifer represented by op1 op2 op3 op8 op9 op11 op12 the groundwater level difference between s 1 and s 2 is up to 1 5 m indicating the riparian aquifer along the lower river reaches suffered the most from the river stage decline in s 2 the declined area is larger in july compared to february in s 3 as shown in fig 8c and f groundwater level further declined by up to 0 15 m from the situation in s 2 to the situation in s 3 the water level drop can be recognized at the inner parts of the compartments with a long distance to the surface water features represented by the area among op1 2 13 and op4 op10 op14 the groundwater level decline in s 3 is much smaller compared to the decline from s 1 to s 2 4 2 3 spatial distribution of the impact of surface water and precipitation the impact of surface water recession and precipitation reduction on groundwater dynamics has a significant difference in spatial distribution to identify the spatial differences annual water table fluctuation in gfp was calculated based on the annual lowest highest groundwater level as shown in fig 9 a the annual fluctuation varied from less than 1 0 m to 13 0 m the closer to the river the larger the groundwater level varied among one hydrological year because of the tributaries cutting through the alluvial aquifer a high degree of seasonal fluctuation in the poyang lake surface water system leads to the dramatic fluctuation of the groundwater table in the riparian zone in gfp a transition zone with fluctuation larger than 1 m is restricted to these districts within 3 km from the lake and rivers while in the inner compartments separated by the river reaches the fluctuation of less than 1 m is mainly contributed by the seasonal variation of precipitation in s 2 as shown in fig 9b groundwater table fluctuation is reduced by up to 1 5 m in the transition zone and wetland districts in s 3 as shown in fig 9c the influence from the precipitation change to the groundwater table fluctuation is less than 0 03 m which is almost negligible from this we can conclude that the surface water recession has a much stronger influence on the groundwater level compared to the precipitation reduction in gfp 4 3 variation of lake river aquifer interaction 4 3 1 spatial and temporal variation of the water level in sw and gw the dynamics of the groundwater system reflects the change in sw gw interactions as shown in figs 10 and 11 two water table profiles were used to identify the main characteristics of the interactions among the poyang lake tributaries alluvial aquifer the water table variation during july october next february represented a floodwater recession process overall both two transects illustrated a synchronous linkage between the ganjiang river and poyang lake taking profile 1 as an example for s 1 the river stage declined from 15 75 m jul to 14 25 m oct to 11 07 m feb quickly responding to the decrease of lake level from 15 43 m jul to 13 44 m oct to 10 62 m feb form s 2 as the recent droughts in the poyang lake water system the river stage decreased from 14 89 m jul to 13 33 m oct to 10 81 m feb and correspondingly the lake level declined from 14 95 m jul to 12 21 m oct to 10 17 m feb it can be concluded from fig 11 that 1 the changes of water table at different periods between points op15 op35 in profile 1 for both s 1 and s 2 were negligible because the area was located in zone c where the aquitard had no direct hydraulic connection with surface water features 2 water table in the lakeshore area points op44 op46 in profile 1 points op130 op132 in profile 2 had a smaller amplitude of fluctuation although the lake level had the larger amplitude because the low permeability of the lacustrine silty sediments on the lake bed reduced the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer 3 water table variation between points op72 op110 in profile 2 for both s 1 and s 2 showed the synchronization of the change in surface water level because the area was located in zone a where the aquifer had close hydraulic connection with surface water bodies 4 there was a hysteresis effects on the groundwater recharge from zone a to zone b such as the water level kept rising by 0 4 m and 0 25 m in op115 from july to october for s1 and s2 respectively because the ephemeral increment of bank storage in zone a till july took some more time to replenish to zone b due to the slow velocity of the groundwater flow and its long flow path from the river channel to the inner compartments and 5 compared with s 1 the water table in two profiles for s 2 decreased due to the reduction of recharge from rivers to groundwater in sum the water table variation in two profiles for s 1 and s 2 during july october next february demonstrated the synchronization and hysteresis of interactions between surface water and groundwater the dramatic seasonal variation of the surface water stages leads to bidirectional flow between the riparian aquifer and surface water features resulting in the temporal variation of the groundwater flow system in the gfp aquifer 4 3 2 water budget of the groundwater storage for quantitative analysis on the volume of groundwater recharge and discharge to explore the temporal and spatial variation of lake river aquifer interactions the model area was divided into 4 subdomains according to the standard of 1 m in water table fluctuation in s 1 as shown in fig 10 zone a is the bank storage district with a fluctuation larger than 1 m the area of zone a is about 1423 km2 zone b is the inner compartments surrounded by the surface water and the zone a with a fluctuation less than 1 m the area of zone b is about 812 km2 zone c is the hilly region at the north west part of the model domain with an area of 462 km2 zone d is the poyang lake in the wet season the groundwater storage change in the total budget area including zone a zone b and zone c was calculated to average monthly based on dynamic water budget analysis as shown in tables 3 and 4 to show the groundwater storage gs difference clearly and also to simplify the table we used v storage to show the net groundwater storage increment and the groundwater budget equation can be simply stated as follows 5 v storage n δ v rain n δ v sw g w n v storage n 1 gs max gs min v storage max where v storage is the net increase in groundwater storage from the minimum groundwater storage gsmin illustrated in the row of total in table 3 δ v rain is the monthly volume of groundwater recharge originating as rainfall infiltration δ v sw g w is the monthly volume of exchange flux between sw gw in table 3 indicates flow direction from the surface water to the groundwater n 1 2 3 12 corresponding to january february march december respectively if n 12 then n 1 represents january of next year the monthly groundwater balance illustrated in table 3 is calculated using the recursion formula as shown in eq 5 for the whole problem domain in s 1 the annual groundwater storage variation was 66 4 106 m3 ranging from 21 618 1 106 m3 gsmin total in table 3 to 21 684 5 106 m3 gsmax total in table 3 and the annual rainfall infiltration was about 38 5 106 m3 last row of the column δ v rain in table 3 during the flood season from march to july table 3 marked in bold fonts the total surface water infiltration tsi of 40 9 106 m3 and the recharge from δvrain in the five months from march to july bold fonts of in table 3 led to the maximum vstorage of 66 4 106 m3 represents the gsmax of 21 684 5 106 m3 till early august during the recession period from august to next february river stage decline forced the aquifer to drain off to the minimum vstorage of 0 represents the gsmin of 21 618 1 106 m3 in early march the total groundwater discharge was about 79 4 106 m3 including the tsi of 40 9 106 m3 and the annual total precipitation tp of 38 5 106 m3 during the whole year in s 2 annual groundwater storage variation was 64 5 106 m3 ranging from 21 597 5 106 m3 gsmin total in table 3 to 21 662 0 106 m3 gsmax the tsi reduced by 2 4 106 m3 from 40 9 106 m3 to 38 5 106 m3 total of δ v sw g w for s 1 and s 2 in table 3 in s 3 annual groundwater storage variation was 64 3 106 m3 ranging from 21 594 5 106 m3 gsmin to 21 658 8 106 m3 gsmax annual rainfall infiltration decreased by 4 106 m3 from 38 5 106 m3 to 34 5 106 m3 total of δ v rain for s 2 and s 3 in table 3 as a result the gsmax reduced by 22 5 106 m3 from 21 684 5 106 m3 s 1 to 21 662 0 106 m3 s 2 and by 3 2 106 m3 from 21 662 0 106 m3 s 2 to 21 658 8 106 m3 s 3 the gsmax decrement of 22 5 106 m3 derived from the reduction in tsi was about 7 times larger than the decrement of 3 2 106 m3 derived from the tp reduction the impact of tsi on groundwater storage the operation of the tgd changed the temporal river aquifer interaction in gfp firstly till june the cumulative δvsw gw during flood season from march to june was almost the same in s 1 and s 2 so it was the δvsw gw reduction from 6 1 106 m3 to 3 8 106 m3 in july contributed to most of the decrement in tsi 2 4 106 m3 secondly the negative influence from the impoundment of tgd in phase 3 and phase 4 fig 6 accelerated the exfiltration of the alluvial aquifer during the period from august to october table 3 δ v sw g w marked in underlined fonts the total δvsw gw in these three months increased about 11 106 m3 from 27 0 106 m3 in s 1 to 38 106 m3 in s 2 making the deficit in gs increase from 22 5 106 m3 in early august to 33 5 106 m3 in early november and in s 3 the tp reduction further reduced the gs by 3 2 106 m3 increased the deficit in gs to 25 7 106 m3 in august and 36 7 106 m3 in november the impact ratio of tsi and tp increased from 7 times to about 10 times in phase 5 of the operation in tgd after november the recovery of surface water level in s 2 made the exfiltration from the aquifer to the river channel reduce but without enough water resource to compensate for the deficit caused by accelerated drainage from august to october table 3 δ v sw g w marked in underlined fonts the gsmin would remain the gap of 20 6 106 m3 between 21 618 1 106 m3 s 1 and 21 597 5 106 m3 s 2 an accelerated drainage process increased the groundwater storage deficit which is caused by inadequate recharge this is why after years of supply reduction the budget deficit accumulated for years till the situation in s 2 that the actual reduction in gs of 22 5 106 m3 is greater than the loss in tsi of 2 4 106 m3 and the deficit will last a whole year unlike the surface water system which would recover to nature condition in december to the inner compartments of the aquifer as shown in table 4 the internal transfer from zone a to zone b was about the same for s 1 and s 2 total in table 4 but both the gsmax and the gsmin of zone b in s 2 were reduced by 7 0 106 m3 total in table 4 that was because the decline in surface water level would finally spread to the inner compartments with a hysteresis effect the annual average water level and the groundwater storage would decrease till another annual quasi stable state after years of drainage process of the alluvial aquifer the same recharge to the inner compartments would lead to the groundwater fluctuation in a relatively lower position with the same amplitude the impact of tp on groundwater storage to further analyze the impact from the tp reduction groundwater storage increment and flux exchange between zone a and zone b were calculated average monthly as shown in table 4 indicates flow direction from zone a to zone b the amount of groundwater exchange between zone a and zone c was negligible in s 1 the total groundwater storage of zone a varied between 12 120 106 m3 and 12 180 106 m3 representing the gsmin and the gsmax total in table 4 and the maximum vstorage of 60 106 m3 was in august which accounted for 90 4 of the maximum vstorage in gfp 66 4 106 m3 tsi of 40 9 106 m3 as described in table 3 contributed to most of the vstorage in zone a during the flood season on the other hand storage in zone b varied between 7560 5 106 m3 and 7568 5 106 m3 the maximum vstorage of 8 106 m3 in zone b was contributed by rainfall infiltration and internal transfer between zone a and zone b the positive flow from zone a to zone b was only in july and august for s 1 and from june to august in s 2 and s 3 table 4 internal transfer from zone a zone b marked in positive bold fonts in these months only about 1 4 106 m3 of floodwater was transferred from zone a to zone b for s 1 accounting for only 3 4 of the tsi 40 9 106 m3 in s 2 and s 3 the positive internal transfer was about 1 4 106 m3 and 1 8 106 m3 respectively also very small compared to the tsi of 38 5 106 m3 in s 2 and 34 5 106 m3 in s 3 the floodwater barely reached zone b so it was the rainfall that mainly contributed to the groundwater storage of the inner compartments in gfp however the riparian district is the only pathway for the rainfall infiltration to discharge from the inner compartments to the river reaches which act as the base level of the groundwater discharge and the source of the bank storage think backward from s 3 to s 2 even if the rainfall would recover from 34 5 106 m3 for s 3 to 38 5 106 m3 for s 2 table 3 t o t a l δ v rain the gsmax in zone b would increase only 1 5 106 m3 from 7560 106 m3 for s 3 to 7561 5 106 m3 for s 2 not regain 7568 5 106 m3 for s 1 total in table 4 that was because rainfall infiltration increment will increase the hydraulic gradient of the groundwater flow reducing the internal transfer from zone a to zone b from 1 8 106 m3 to 1 4 106 m3 and increasing the annual total discharge for zone b from 12 6 106 m3 to 13 4 106 m3 table 4 total as a result most of the rainfall increment will not turn into groundwater storage in zone b but flow to zone a and finally discharge to the river channel on the contrary under the condition of the same tp with a higher blocking effect from the zone a as the situation in s 1 zone b will increase the groundwater storage year by year due to the reduction of groundwater discharge therefore the blocking effect from bank storage is the decisive factor of the groundwater storage in the inner compartments to sum up the groundwater system in gfp serves as a large subsurface water reservoir which stores water during flood season and releases water during the dry season surface water level drop after july which is mainly caused by the impoundment of tgd during phase 3 and phase 4 from july to late october is mainly responsible for the groundwater storage recession by reducing the tsi into the groundwater and changing the schedule of the sw gw interaction tp reduction in plb had a relatively stronger influence on the inner compartments compared to the bank storage however the bank storage acted as the threshold for the inner compartments a higher and lasting river stage will activate a larger capacity of the bank storage by extending the volume of the bank storage so that the blocking effect of the bank storage on the inner compartments could grow stronger for detaining more water deriving from precipitation recharge 4 3 3 exchange flux differences of the river reaches in terms of bank storage reduction there are spatial and temporal differences in the contribution of the river reaches fig 12 illustrated the simulated exchange flux between rivers and aquifer in each month of a year and fig 13 is the detailed daily water budget of the model in july and october it is shown that the change of surface water regime affected the river aquifer interaction in gfp involving four aspects as follows first as described in section 4 3 2 was the δvsw gw reduction in july contributed to most of the decrement in tsi 2 4 106 m3 and all the river reaches were responsible for the decrement for example in july fig 13a the infiltration in the tangyin branch of ganjiang river reduced about 242 73 103 m3 d from 354 31 103 m3 d to 111 58 103 m3 d and in xiuhe river the infiltration reduced about 195 35 103 m3 d from 226 17 103 m3 d to 30 82 103 m3 d the total surface water infiltration reduction of the five river reaches as shown in fig 13a was about 908 32 103 m3 d the sum of the infiltration reduction of the five river reaches from s 1 to s 2 as shown in the left column of fig 13a ganjiang river including waizhou branch tangyin branch wucheng branch xiuhe river fuhe river contributed to about 46 8 21 5 and 31 7 of the total surface water infiltration reduction ganjiang river is mainly responsible for the infiltration reduction in plb especially along the wucheng branch and tangyin branch second the recharge period was shortened in some of the river reaches for s 2 because the infiltration shifted to exfiltration in advance due to the lowered level of the surface water system during the summer season as shown in fig 12 the exfiltration advanced about 1 month to august along the tangyin branch and wucheng branch and advanced about 2 months to july along fuhe river the infiltration along the fuhe river in july reduced about 288 19 103 m3 d from 185 43 103 m3 d to 102 76 103 m3 d fig 13a surface water level drop in july and august has a stronger influence on the southern part of the plb because the groundwater level at this part of the plb is generally higher than 15 m only if the blocking effect is strong enough to keep the surface water level in poyang lake and yangtze river higher than 15 m can the river stage in fuhe river generally higher than the groundwater table otherwise the infiltration from fuhe river to the surrounding aquifer will shift to exfiltration however after october the direct hydraulic connection between fuhe river and poyang lake is basically severed the interaction between fuhe and the surrounding groundwater will no longer be affected by the yangtze river third in october and november the accelerated groundwater drainage was mainly due to the impoundment process in tgd the total exfiltration flux of the five river reaches as shown in figs 12 and 13b increased about 308 9 103 m3 d and 419 2 103 m3 d respectively the sum of the infiltration reduction of the five river reaches from s 1 to s 2 as shown in the left column of fig 13b in october ganjiang river including waizhou branch tangyin branch wucheng branch xiuhe river fuhe river contributed to about 50 2 24 6 and 25 2 of the total surface water exfiltration increment of 308 9 103 m3 d and in november the contribution of the three tributaries is 70 9 28 2 and 0 9 respectively the result implies that the impact from the yangtze river to the plb gradually retreated from south to north during the recession period from august to november in november while the hydraulic connection between fuhe river and poyang lake is basically severed the accelerated groundwater drainage caused by the weakened blocking effect from the yangtze river is still working in the wucheng tangyin branch of ganjiang river and xiuhe river fourth precipitation reduction has an indirect influence on the exchange flux between sw gw in july as shown in fig 13a groundwater level drop due to the precipitation reduction inversely increased the relative water level difference between river and aquifer so that the river infiltration in s 3 is larger than that in s 2 such as tangyin branch the infiltration increased from 111 58 103 m3 d to 115 56 103 m3 d the total increment in the infiltration of the five river reaches was about 12 193 103 m3 d sum of the difference between the second and the third digits in the left column of fig 13a which is mainly stored in zone a and had little influence on the internal transfer between zone a and zone b or zone a and zone c as a result without the compensation from the river infiltration the groundwater storage decrease due to the precipitation reduction in zone b and zone c is larger than that in zone a in october as shown in fig 13b the situation is reversed the reduced precipitation led to less exfiltration from zone a to the river reaches and the total decrement in exfiltration was about 11 92 103 m3 d sum of the difference between the second and the third digits in the left column of fig 13b which is not enough for compensating all the precipitation decrement for the zone abc and also had little influence to the internal transfer between zone a and zone b or zone a and zone c so the precipitation reduction tends to increase the river infiltration in flood season and reduce exfiltration during the dry season but the change in infiltration is not enough for compensating for the groundwater storage decrement caused by precipitation reduction 5 conclusions this study mainly focused on investigating the river lake aquifer interactions by emphasizing the anthropogenic and climatic influences on the sw gw interaction to further extend the previous understanding of the poyang lake basin plb water system a regional groundwater flow numerical model was built to quantify inflow or outflow between sw gw in gan fu plain gfp three model scenarios based on the historical monitoring data were designed to compare the impact considering the operation of the tgd and the contemporary climatic conditions the simulation results indicate that the hydrograph change of the yangtze river due to the operation of the tgd is mainly responsible for the autumn drought in plb not the local precipitation reduction the research results emphasize that the groundwater system plays an important role in the water cycle and will be seriously affected by the regime change in the surface water system the results conclude that the lake rive aquifer interaction in gfp is complicated by many factors 1 the dramatic seasonal fluctuation of the river stage and the alluvial sediment property leads to intensified sw gw interactions in the riparian aquifer and the formation of bank storage which is the main transitional zone between sw gw interactions bank storage is located in the districts within 3 km from the lake and rivers and accounted for 90 4 of the groundwater storage increment in gfp the surface water infiltration contributes to most of the bank storage but less than 5 of the infiltration is transmitted from bank storage to the inner part of the alluvial aquifer bank storage is not meant to recharge the inner compartments but to block the discharge from the inner compartments to the river channel like a water curtain 2 the operation of tgd can be divided into 5 phases the operation in phase 3 to phase 5 from mid july to december had a negative influence on plb by weakening the blocking effect to the lake drainage and the negative impact was the largest in early november due to the sharp impoundment during october tgd operation has a chain effect on the downstream water system including the yangtze river and the poyang lake in plb the impact from the tgd spread upstream to the downstream of the five tributaries and gradually weakened from north to south 3 hydrological change causes the groundwater storage recession in gfp by reducing the total surface water infiltration and by changing the schedule of the sw gw interaction as a result the maximum groundwater storage reduced by 22 5 106 m3 in august and then the deficit aggravated to 33 5 106 m3 in early november leading to the advanced dry season by one month in plb among all the tributaries ganjiang river contributed to about 46 8 of the infiltration reduction and during the drainage period ganjiang river contributed to about 50 2 and 70 9 of the exfiltration increment from the riparian aquifer in october and november the groundwater storage deficit would maintain the whole year unlike the surface water system which would recover to pre tgd state in december 4 impact of the hydrological change is much strong than the impact of precipitation reduction in some alluvial plain in gfp the reduction in groundwater storage of 22 5 106 m3 due to the hydrological change was about 7 times larger than the reduction in groundwater storage of 3 2 106 m3 caused by precipitation reduction the impact ratio of hydrological change and precipitation reduction could increase to 10 times in early november due to the drastic impoundment in tgd this research provides a typical reference for exploring the synergetic effect of anthropogenic and meteorological impact on a lake river aquifer system it is of great significance to the assessment of the evolution of the plb water system which is the basis of the evolution of the riparian and estuarine wetland ecosystem the results also provide useful information for further optimization of the schedule in tgd to reduce the impact on the downstream water system and help to enhance and strengthen water resources management in gfp and other similar lake river aquifer systems further research should focus on the regional climate change induced by the evaporation in tgd and its influences on the plb also further research into the variation of the unsaturated zone and its impact on the ecosystem of the riparian estuarine districts in plb may be significant for improving the systematic recognition of the role that the hydrological system plays in the ecosystem credit authorship contribution statement zhenchen wang methodology

4811,speleothems are used as a promising proxy for high resolution paleoclimate reconstruction partial pressures of co2 pco2 is one of the most important factors in the processes of speleothem formation in caves the objective of our study was to monitor the co2 variations in the overlying soil the cave air and the stream and distinguish its sources and processes based on stable carbon isotopes in the xueyu cave system from october 2014 to february 2017 overlying soil co2 was influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture the cave air pco2 and equilibrium pco2 in the stream water during two years showed very similar seasonal variations fluctuating with high values in wet seasons and low values in dry seasons the average δ13csoil air value was 19 3 0 8 and δ13ccave air value was 18 8 0 4 in november while the average δ13csoil air value was 23 9 1 4 and δ13ccave air value was 23 3 0 3 in june moreover the contribution from soil during the transitional ventilation in november was calculated based on the two end members model of stable carbon isotopes on the contrary in wet season cave air co2 were mainly controlled by soil co2 inputs the total amount of c from stream degassing was calculated which was higher in june than in november high resolution monitoring of cave air co2 and its sources reveals the highly sensitive nature of co2 dynamics within cave

lang et al 2015 in shallow or ventilated caves co2 concentration is generally lower than that in the overlying soils ranging from 500 to 10 000 ppmv and most co2 concentration is no more than 6500 ppmv spötl et al 2005 faimon and ličbinská 2010 pu et al 2018 a few studies reveal that co2 concentration is very high in deep and confined karst e g average vadose co2 concentration is between 10 000

co2 concentration because of different temperatures in and out of caves liñán et al 2008 wong and banner 2010 in summer the temperature out of the cave is higher which increases co2 concentration in confined conditions however the thing is different in winter the external air enters the caves by large openings or fractures when caves are better ventilated which decreases co2 levels christelle et

organic matters atkinson 1977 mattey et al 2016 5 from deep magmatic or metamorphic sources bergel et al 2017 among these factors soil inputs and atmospheric air are traditionally considered to be the most significant inputs for most of caves ridley et al 2015 lang et al 2017 the cave outputs are controlled by cave ventilation mainly driven by cave geometry and temperature difference between the exterior and interior environment lang et al 2017 the production and transport of subterranean co2 within surface soils or subsurface cavities have been widely studied especially the surface atmosphere co2 exchanges davidson et al 1998 soil co2 one of the most important sources of cave air can directly enter the cave by gaseous form or by aqueous solution wood 1985 baldini et al 2006 cuezva et al 2011 on one side water moves downward via fissures and fractures some of it enters caves as drips and seepage and some of it as shaft flow and stream water ford and williams 2007 on the other side air moves around in a more complex pattern which may circulate rapidly through high permeability conduits or slowly as ground air in the vadose zone benavente et al 2010 specifically there may be co2 contributions from decomposition of organic matter in the caves mattey et al 2016 pla et al 2017 the importance of understanding specific cave ventilation mechanisms has been well highlighted in previous studies kowalczk and froelich 2010 mattey et al 2010 benavente et al 2015 breitenbach et al 2015 the magnitude and variability of soil co2 production is mainly driven by soil temperature pumpanen et al 2003 and soil water content vargas et al 2012 in this case soil co2 and dissolved co2 in karst settings always display seasonal variability atkinson 1977 pu et al 2014 the

discharge of the subterranean stream ranges from 4 1 l s in dry period to 26 6 l s in wet period meteoric water recharges the karst aquifer through carbonate matrix and conduits as a show cave xueyu cave receives a great number of visitors every year especially in summer two doors have been installed at the cave entrance in order to prevent frequent exchange of indoor and outdoor gas the cave is not well ventilated in most of the time the relationships between specific conductance spc ca2 and hco3 have been established and variations of co2 concentrations in the cave atmosphere and cave stream showed different changes in wet and dry season due to the ventilation pu et al 2015 2018 high 222rn and co2 concentrations typically occur during the warm summer and low concentrations are typical in cold winter yang et al 2013 pu et al 2018 xueyu cave presents chimney effect based on monitoring of seasonal radon pattern wang et al 2019 which is consistent with seasonality of cave air co2 concentration as changes in radon production are expected to be small within the cave the ventilation process is the main factor controlling changes of radon concentrations in the cave przylibski 1999 storms result in the most dramatic stream pco2 variations for a short time pu et al 2018 cao et al 2019 3 methods and materials meteorological data including precipitation with the precision of 0 01 mm and temperature with the precision of 0 1 c were recorded every 15 min using a devis vp 2 weather station the continuous and automatic measurement of soil air co2 with a co2 sensor gmm221 was fixed at 40 cm depth in the soil profile above xueyu cave from october 2014 seeing the site s in fig 1e and fig s1 the soil temperature and moisture were obtained by a temperature and humidity sensor av 10t and av ec5 co2 recordings were calibrated using a handheld probe gt901 two sites lf and mz in xueyu cave have been selected for the monitoring of co2 from cave air and the subterranean stream fig 1e using gmm221 sensors with rr 1008 data logging that was calibrated by cdu 440 co2 meter stream pco2 values calculated by hydrochemical parameters are used to compare with continuous logging data to obtain the detailed hydrochemical variations a cdtp300 multi parameter water quality meter was installed to record water temperature water level spc and ph respectively the data from co2 measurement system and water quality data logger was set at the same time interval of 15 min see more details about these instruments in supplementary material soil and cave air samples for δ13cco2 analyses were collected using a pump and carefully sealed in the 100 ml trace gas bags all samples were stored at room temperature before analysis the measurement was performed at the environmental stable isotope lab chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas where δ13cco2 in the bags was introduced to delta v plus δ13cdic samples from the stream were filtered and injected in 15 ml brown bottles without bubbles and two drops of hgcl2 were added in order to prevent microbial activities analyses were performed using a delta plus xl continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry the results of carbon isotope were reported relative to v pdb based on comparison to known carbonate standards and the analysis precision was better than 0 15 1σ 4 results during oct 2014 and feb 2017 the monthly air temperature ranged from 3 3 c to 39 5 c with an average of 19 5 7 2 c fig 2 a mean annual rainfall amount was over 1100 mm moreover there were few rainfall events in august every year because of the strong effect of northwest pacific subtropical high pressure fig 2b the mean atmospheric co2 concentration during the study period was 467 33 ppmv with a significant seasonal trend low values in summer but high values in winter the soil temperature ranged from 8 0 c in december to 24 0 c in august with a mean value of 18 5 5 1 c fig 2a the soil moisture varied between 0 5 and 24 0 with a mean value of 9 4 4 4 showing low values in winter and high values in summer which is highly correlated with local rainfall events fig 2c the complex cave geometry with three layers strongly influences airflow direction and velocity in different parts of the cave but the inner cave temperatures are stable with the average temperature of 17 2 0 2 c throughout the year the stream water temperatures ranged from 16 0 c to 18 7 c during 150 days from may to october the external temperature was above the cave temperatures and only 90 days from december to march the external temperature was below the cave temperature fig 2a the correlations between different monitored items have been listed in table 1 showing good correlations between soil temperature and soil co2 cave air pco2 and stream pco2 the soil co2 concentrations obtained in situ are highly correlated with the results from the spectrometric analysis in the laboratory r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 46 soil co2 at 40 cm depth showed noticeable seasonal variations throughout the annual cycle the soil co2 concentrations ranged from 4000 ppmv in december to 17 000 ppmv in june with a mean value of 8890 4576 ppmv showing higher values in wet summer than in dry summer fig 2d in winter cave air pco2 was relatively steady and low 1000 ppmv similar to caves in texas and florida in the us that experience fastest ventilation in winter banner et al 2007 kowalczk and froelich 2010 whereas it fluctuated largely and increased to be relatively abundant in summer 6000 ppmv cave air pco2 showed the mean value of 5691 ppmv at lf the innermost part in the cave and that of 4447 ppmv at mz the entrance part fig 2d stream water pco2 showed a mean value of 6873 ppmv at lf and of 5558 ppmv at mz the continuous variational trend of stream pco2 at mz are very similar to that at lf pco2 values in the cave and the stream are generally lower than those in the soil to make lines that depict pco2 trends more distinctive we only showed monitoring results of stream pco2 from lf in the fig 2d specifically abrupt changes of cave air and stream pco2 occurred at the moments of transitional seasons autumn to winter or spring to summer with large variational magnitudes e g cave air co2 concentrations had increased to 16 000 ppmv and decreased to 1000 ppmv within several days in november 2015 and 2016 during the rainfall events cave air and stream pco2 responded quickly to rainfall events fig 3 at the end of october 2014 soil co2 concentrations increased gradually from 4000 ppmv to 9000 ppmv at the beginning of the rainfall event and then decreased gradually to below 5000 ppmv on the contrary cave air pco2 at lf and mz were higher than soil co2 ranging from 8000 ppm to 12000 ppm however we did not grasp the initial increasing changes that corresponded to the onset of rainfall events because the equipment for the monitoring in the stream started to work only when the pco2 had increased and kept on the high level fig 3d that is cave air and stream were initially characterized by high pco2 values and pco2 stream pco2 cave air at lf with the external air entering the cave cave air and stream pco2 decreased below 2000 ppmv in the next several days low cave air co2 concentrations indicated beneficial conditions for gas exchange and low concentration recharge was gradually predominant in the cave fig 3d pco2 cave air was only slightly lower than pco2 stream at lf while at mz pco2 cave air was the lowest confirming that ventilation near the cave entrance is more significant in june 2016 before the rainfall stream water pco2 was equilibrium with cave air pco2 showing increasing pco2 responding to rainfall events rainwater dissolved soil co2 and brought more co2 to the stream the main source of cave air pco2 was rarely related to external air due to poor ventilation stream and cave pco2 were in equilibrium before rainfall and they increased along rainfall events stream pco2 cave pco2 at lf and mz sites and stream pco2 was higher at lf than at mz all pco2 decreased in the flood recession period finally stream pco2 at mz was the highest the δ13cair values of background atmospheric air co2 were from 10 0 to 9 6 during the two high resolution monitoring intervals δ13c value was 19 3 0 8 in the overlying soil gas in november but 23 9 1 4 in june on average δ13ccave air values ranged from 18 8 19 4 18 2 in november to 23 3 23 6 22 7 in june at lf and mz sites during rainfall events there was no significant difference of δ13ccave air at both sites δ13cdic in the stream ranged from 11 9 12 6 10 6 in november to 13 3 13 9 12 8 in june at mz from 12 7 13 1 12 2 in november to 13 5 13 9 13 2 in june at lf the average value of δ13cco2 from stream degassing at mz should be 21 0 and 22 3 in november and june respectively considering carbon isotopic fractionation of 9 between water and gas zhang et al 1995 similarly the average value of δ13cco2 from stream degassing at lf was 22 4 in november to 23 9 in june at lf respectively table 2 5 discussion the cave air co2 concentration at a given time is the result of the balance between co2 fluxes into and out the cave breecker et al 2012 seasonal variations in cave air co2 could be related to changes in different sources and transport mechanisms according to monthly monitoring results the seasonality of cave co2 variations occurred cave co2 concentration was generally higher in summer and lower in winter wang et al 2016 pu et al 2018 our data provide further high frequency records of temperatures precipitation and co2 variations that allow us to see the details of variations and the processes in the cave 5 1 sources and variations of co2 concentrations in xueyu soil cave system 5 1 1 co2 production and variation in xueyu soils the time series of seasonal soil co2 concentrations suggest that the seasonality of soil co2 concentrations above xueyu cave were generally corresponding to the variations in soil temperature fig 2a 2d soil co2 is the combination of co2 produced by root respiration and microbial decomposition of organic matter breecker et al 2012 normally soil co2 peaks in wet and warm summer in subtropical area soil co2 production rates will rise with temperature when soil moisture is not limited fang and moncrieff 2001 however the study area always suffered summer drought in august due to the control of west pacific subtropical high wpsh which results in high air temperature but low precipitation zhou et al 2009 leading to lower soil moisture during the dry period fig 2c lower soil co2 concentrations could be due to reduced co2 production rates or greater gas permeability in dry environment which also facilitates the escape of co2 to the surface mattey et al 2016 soil moisture enhances co2 production when soils are not saturated with water moyano et al 2013 the soil co2 concentrations of the study area were increased along with soil moisture in plant growth period gibraltar soil co2 concentrations were minimum in the late summer each year consistent with dry soil and died vegetation and rose in winter with abundant precipitation mattey et al 2016 however the effect of soil moisture on soil co2 concentrations was not always positive fig 2c for example during rainfall events soil co2 concentrations might rise up fig 3d or just decreased fig 3h the reason for the increase could be that mineralization of carbon containing compound enhances the microbial activities and activate their metabolism more co2 is trapped and concentrated in soil under suitable temperature and moisture while the reason for the decrease would be that too much water in the soil pores prevents the microbial activities and finally limits soil respiration 5 1 2 co2 in xueyu cave air although the drivers on cave air co2 are complex many studies have confirmed that high cave air co2 concentrations are mainly imputable to high soil co2 wong and banner 2010 frisia et al 2011 air co2 in xueyu cave is maximum in rainy seasons april october the site near the entrance has more variable cave air co2 concentration indicating that the influence of external air is greatest near the cave entrance where air exchanges in and out of the cave in many previous studies about caves the dominant sources of cave co2 are mixed with soil respiration and atmospheric air ek and gewelt 1985 baldini et al 2008 low co2 production in the overlying soils in winter aggravates the scarcity of co2 in the cave external air temperature drops below the internal cave air temperature causing cold dense air to flow inwards resulting in a decline in cave temperature and co2 levels breecker et al 2012 however the sites in xueyu cave except the one near the entrance mz have relatively steady cave air temperature co2 concentrations in cave air were sometimes higher than in contemporaneous soil air in transitional periods suggesting a deeper source for cave air co2 benavente et al 2010 2015 atkinson 1977 proposed that ground air co2 could be related to slow and steady decomposition of particulate organic matter of soils washed down by infiltrating water the contribution to cave c source from old organic matter oxidation was emphasized too noronha et al 2015 similar phenomenon was also found but in winter in gibraltar karst caves which was considered to be a source of co2 from vadose zone mattey et al 2016 a previous study of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom in xueyu cave stream showed that cdom was mainly from autochthonous source fan et al 2019 which confirms that cave air co2 is only partly influenced by decomposition of soil organic matter the delay of co2 concentration peaks in xueyu cave would be attributed to the slow movement of co2 that stores in karst fissures and voids in the vadose zone though the contemporaneous soil co2 concentration might be low fig 4 one of the most striking features of the co2 time series is the similar trend of cave air co2 and stream co2 fig 2d however they still show some contradictions when we focus on the pco2 difference in water and gas fig 5 troester and white 1984 showed that seasonal degassing from a cave stream contributes to cave air co2 in xueyu cave stream flow may also play an important role for variations of cave air pco2 as co2 degassing and absorption by stream water like in ballynamintra cave baldini et al 2006 strong stream flow can induce air velocities proportional to that of the stream via friction between water and air cigna 1968 fairchild and baker 2012 breitenbach et al 2015 degassing rates are greatest when cave air pco2 is lowest in winter in other seasons it is uncertain whether degassing occurs or not monitoring data from lf and mz sites showed that stream pco2 variations were consistent with that of the cave air on the seasonal scale fig 2d specifically the higher stream pco2 at lf than that at mz confirmed co2 degassing from the upstream lf to the downstream mz other c sources for the cave air co2 can be neglected e g the effect of human respiration in the cave is of minor importance based on co2 measurements in peak tourist seasons wang et al 2010 5 2 cave air co2 dynamics controlled by rainfall events soil co2 is considered as an important component in the chemical weathering of limestone previous studies in xueyu cave have revealed that precipitation rather than temperature exerts a significant impact on cave co2 variations on the storm scale pu et al 2014 wang et al 2016 cao et al 2019 during storms soil co2 dissolves in water and enters the karst system to dissolve limestone the higher the precipitation the higher the dissolution rate is the higher the rainfall intensity the higher the variations in stream and cave air pco2 stream pco2 variations are considered as the most important control on the variation of dissolution rates and higher rates are observed with the high pco2 flow during summer covington and vaughn 2018 the stream starts at a high pco2 level and then would enhance dissolution along the flow path in a closed system condition ford and williams 2007 covington and vaughn 2018 at the beginning of november both the degassing and ventilation are responsible for the decrease of stream and cave air pco2 because of the ventilation mz is the most striking part for air exchange which could explain the lowest concentration of cave air pco2 the epi karstic porous system is not water saturated in the cold and dry seasons opening paths are beneficial for co2 movement fig 4 the mechanism is depending on water that seals the pores where gas transport through the overlying soil is determined by the pore size distribution inter particle porosity and water content cuezva et al 2011 large pco2 difference between stream water and cave air will result in faster degassing rates fig 5 this pco2 difference started to become large at the beginning of rainfall events as the dissolution increased stream water interacted with cave atmosphere to get equilibrated with the cave air co2 within 3 4 days from the beginning of the rainfall events fig 3d and 3h in contrast the system of epi karstic fissures in the warm and wet seasons is almost temporarily saturated with water making the host rock membrane impermeable to prevent the co2 diffusion from the cave ventilation is minimized and cool stagnant air could accumulate resulting in higher co2 concentration in the cave noticeably stream water co2 was higher at mz than lf inputs from different water sources or increased dissolution rates may explain for a higher stream pco2 along flow path from lf to mz a drip water in nearby site from mz showed its pco2 nearly two times higher suggesting high pco2 drip water and air seepage as plausible sources pu et al 2018 during the flood recession period of rainfall events the dissolution of calcite took co2 from cave air which decreased the cave air pco2 but increased the stream pco2 at mz 5 3 δ13c isotope calculating contributions from soil to cave air co2 mean δ13cco2 in the overlying soil of xueyu cave was 21 5 0 5 ranging from 23 9 to 18 5 it indicates that c3 plants are responsible for most of the biogenic co2 production in the soil and cave air δ13cco2 was generally lower in the summer than other seasons wang et al 2016 in the karst cave hco3 constituted the main dic with the ph values above 7 4 the δ13c of dic δ13cdic in xueyu stream was generally higher in dry seasons and lower in wet seasons as the degassing occurs and ph increases lighter δ13c would be going to the cave air and the remaining δ13cdic becomes heavier our observation has shown that soil co2 concentration with seasonality was similar to that from other soil sites in the study area which was enriched from shallow to deep soil wang et al 2016 soil co2 was transported by advection and diffusion the former would be changed by temperature variations mattey et al 2016 while the latter always results in reduced co2 concentrations and increased δ13c values relative to the root respiration cerling 1984 besides transport by diffusion is slower than advection the identification of δ13c compositions of the end member components in each reservoir has been carried out to completely understand the underlying processes that control the generation and dispersal of co2 in karst systems the source of the isotopically light end member co2 in the standard model is soil respiration that is dominant in cave air baldini et al 2006 frisia et al 2011 breecker et al 2012 other potential sources include degassing from co2 riched groundwater deep sourced co2 breecker et al 2012 in xueyu cave there is a linear relationship between δ13cco2 and 1 co2 during the transitional period indicating a mixing process fig 6 the mixing model has two end members one of which from the degassing of stream water or soil inputs ground air is isotopically light and the other from the external air fig 6 within the linear relationships the cave air δ13cco2 values are extremely close to soil air values that are far from the data of exterior air the lowest cave air pco2 and heaviest δ13cco2 occurred in the more exterior influenced sites mz inside the cave the keeling plot shows that the linear regression of the co2 transported via diffusive movement resulted in a higher intercept value 19 5 than that dominated by advection 20 5 with the influence of degassing the sample collected at mz the last time deviated far from the mixing line soil δ13c co2 agrees well with that in cave air especially in june there is no linear relationship between δ13cco2 and 1 co2 to indicate a mixing process however the lighter values of cave air δ13c from the beginning of the rainfall events might confirm a direct contribution from soil co2 cave air δ13c values only slightly changed along with the large variations in co2 concentrations here we excluded other sources such as human respiration that contributed very little co2 concentration wang et al 2016 besides the contribution from deep sources can be neglected as it has more positive δ13c value soil co2 would dominate the cave air co2 in wet summer table 2 this indicates that co2 is gradually accumulated in the cave due to increased soil inputs that are induced by high infiltration during storms 5 4 implications the xueyu a karstic cave could be representative of a series of natural shallow caves in vadose zone the analysis of this particular cave summarized the complex relationships between the outdoor atmosphere the soil rock membrane and the underground atmosphere which comprise a multicomponent system results presented in this study demonstrate the seasonality and processes of cave air pco2 dynamics occurring in xueyu cave changes of ventilation is controlled by a mixed effect of temperature difference in and out of the cave and rainfall events synchronous sharp variations in cave water and cave air pco2 of two locations in the cave from march to april or from october to november were recorded the cave is assumed to be closed in summer despite small exchanges with the external air take place the main source of cave air pco2 is overlying soil however more contributions from external air and degassing may dominate in pco2 variations from november this study grasped the declining process of stream and cave air pco2 suggesting how the mixing occurred within several days however there are still limitations to our current quantitative understanding of the distribution of cave co2 production and transport from more than two sources 6 conclusions soil air pco2 cave air pco2 and stream pco2 as well as soil temperature soil moisture and precipitation have been monitored at high resolution above and in xueyu cave importantly the high co2 values of cave air and stream and the similarity of their seasonal patterns indicate fast exchange of co2 in water gas state and they are always in dynamical equilibrium the production and transport of soil co2 control the main variations in cave co2 rainfall events can largely influence the co2 fluctuations thus high flow periods are always consistent with high pco2 the temperature difference between external and inside cave seems to work as the threshold of ventilation for air in and out of xueyu cave during the transitional period ventilation regimes had changed and the entering of external air contributed more to the total cave air co2 especially the sites near the entrance cave air pco2 near those observed outside were found after several days of a strong winter ventilation the contribution from external air is still below 20 in better ventilated winter soil input is the main source of cave air co2 in summer higher discharge in the stream after storms is equilibrated by co2 degassing too as cave air pco2 increased to its peaks over one day after the stream pco2 peaks keeling plot were used to assess the different contributions from soil and external air in the strong mixing process the combined effects of different co2 sources ventilation conditions and the occurrence of rainfall events could impact the final variations of cave air co2 through a year more attention should also be paid to estimates of extreme events and sub daily flow variation given their significant impacts to cave air co2 credit authorship contribution statement min cao formal analysis visualization

4811,speleothems are used as a promising proxy for high resolution paleoclimate reconstruction partial pressures of co2 pco2 is one of the most important factors in the processes of speleothem formation in caves the objective of our study was to monitor the co2 variations in the overlying soil the cave air and the stream and distinguish its sources and processes based on stable carbon isotopes in the xueyu cave system from october 2014 to february 2017 overlying soil co2 was influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture the cave air pco2 and equilibrium pco2 in the stream water during two years showed very similar seasonal variations fluctuating with high values in wet seasons and low values in dry seasons the average δ13csoil air value was 19 3 0 8 and δ13ccave air value was 18 8 0 4 in november while the average δ13csoil air value was 23 9 1 4 and δ13ccave air value was 23 3 0 3 in june moreover the contribution from soil during the transitional ventilation in november was calculated based on the two end members model of stable carbon isotopes on the contrary in wet season cave air co2 were mainly controlled by soil co2 inputs the total amount of c from stream degassing was calculated which was higher in june than in november high resolution monitoring of cave air co2 and its sources reveals the highly sensitive nature of co2 dynamics within cave environments and highlights its sensitivity to hydrological conditions in the cave system keywords rainfall cave air pco2 carbon isotope stream degassing xueyu cave 1 introduction co2 concentrations in karst environments epikarst and soil largely affect karst landscapes that cover 7 12 of the earth s continental area ford and williams 2007 co2 enriched shallow caves are widely distributed in the terrestrial environment faimon et al 2006 bourges et al 2014 covington and vaughn 2018 the earliest measurements for cave air co2 dated from 1859 ce ek and gewelt 1985 modern sensors and logging techniques have been deployed to provide detailed records of co2 pressure temperature and humidity in cave atmosphere spötl et al 2005 frisia et al 2011 bourges et al 2014 however the controls on co2 concentration variations in the karst system are still poorly quantified in most cases the cave air co2 concentration is higher than that in the open atmosphere a proper understanding of the sources and dynamics of seasonality in cave air co2 is fundamental for speleothem palaeoclimatology fairchild and baker 2012 caves with low co2 concentrations are always better ventilated bourges et al 2014 lang et al 2015 in shallow or ventilated caves co2 concentration is generally lower than that in the overlying soils ranging from 500 to 10 000 ppmv and most co2 concentration is no more than 6500 ppmv spötl et al 2005 faimon and ličbinská 2010 pu et al 2018 a few studies reveal that co2 concentration is very high in deep and confined karst e g average vadose co2 concentration is between 10 000 and 40 000 ppmv with a maximum of nearly 60 000 ppmv in boreholes near nerja cave spain benavente et al 2010 2015 many studies have found that gas dynamics in caves often show seasonal variations in co2 concentration because of different temperatures in and out of caves liñán et al 2008 wong and banner 2010 in summer the temperature out of the cave is higher which increases co2 concentration in confined conditions however the thing is different in winter the external air enters the caves by large openings or fractures when caves are better ventilated which decreases co2 levels christelle et al 2007 however high co2 concentrations were observed in some mediterranean caves with lower temperature but higher precipitation in winter mattey et al 2016 the co2 concentrations in the karst caves are controlled by the input and output co2 fluxes lang et al 2017 there are several main co2 inputs 1 from soils epikarst e g ek and gewelt 1985 cuezva et al 2011 pla et al 2017 2 from dripwater stream water degassing baldini et al 2006 breitenbach et al 2015 hao et al 2018 and 3 anthropogenic inputs from visitors in some show caves faimon et al 2006 lang et al 2015 4 from microbial decay of organic matters atkinson 1977 mattey et al 2016 5 from deep magmatic or metamorphic sources bergel et al 2017 among these factors soil inputs and atmospheric air are traditionally considered to be the most significant inputs for most of caves ridley et al 2015 lang et al 2017 the cave outputs are controlled by cave ventilation mainly driven by cave geometry and temperature difference between the exterior and interior environment lang et al 2017 the production and transport of subterranean co2 within surface soils or subsurface cavities have been widely studied especially the surface atmosphere co2 exchanges davidson et al 1998 soil co2 one of the most important sources of cave air can directly enter the cave by gaseous form or by aqueous solution wood 1985 baldini et al 2006 cuezva et al 2011 on one side water moves downward via fissures and fractures some of it enters caves as drips and seepage and some of it as shaft flow and stream water ford and williams 2007 on the other side air moves around in a more complex pattern which may circulate rapidly through high permeability conduits or slowly as ground air in the vadose zone benavente et al 2010 specifically there may be co2 contributions from decomposition of organic matter in the caves mattey et al 2016 pla et al 2017 the importance of understanding specific cave ventilation mechanisms has been well highlighted in previous studies kowalczk and froelich 2010 mattey et al 2010 benavente et al 2015 breitenbach et al 2015 the magnitude and variability of soil co2 production is mainly driven by soil temperature pumpanen et al 2003 and soil water content vargas et al 2012 in this case soil co2 and dissolved co2 in karst settings always display seasonal variability atkinson 1977 pu et al 2014 the cave stream water had initially higher pco2 during high flow periods summer and has degassed along its flow path in the cave system anthony et al 2003 pu et al 2014 cao et al 2019 the stable carbon isotope is a useful tool to understand the mixing process inside a cave some authors used the keeling plot keeling 1958 to consider cave air as a mix between two end members spötl et al 2005 kowalczk and froelich 2010 frisia et al 2011 the light end member source is with high pco2 but depleted δ13cco2 value mattey et al 2010 peyraube et al 2013 close to the δ13c values 30 24 from roots of c3 type vegetation vogel 1993 both bulk and root free soil respired δ13cco2 exhibiting depleted values ranging from 29 to 26 unger et al 2010 soil air co2 is enriched by about 4 4 due to a different diffusion coefficient for δ12c and δ13c compared to root respired and decomposed co2 cerling et al 1991 the δ13cco2 derived from geothermal sources e g magmatic or metamorphic sources typically ranges from 2 to 6 faure 1986 in this study we have investigated the data of soil co2 concentration stream pco2 and cave air pco2 with their δ13c values in high frequency from xueyu cave sw china during the period of october 2014 and february 2017 the aim of this paper is to 1 identify the main factors that drive dynamics of carbon distribution and transfer between cave air co2 soil air co2 and stream co2 and 2 identify how they respond to hydrological processes in a karst cave 2 study area xueyu cave 29 47 00 n 107 47 13 e is located in fengdu county chongqing china fig 1 a where a typical subtropical monsoon climate is dominant with an average annual precipitation of approximately 1072 mm and a mean annual cave air temperature of 17 2 c fig 1b and without seasonality xu 2013 pu et al 2016 the

limestone embedded with silty shales fig 1c the thickness of the roof rocks of xueyu cave is over 150 m the cave system has only one entrance at 233 m above sea level fig 1e and the space of the cave chambers has been 18040 m3 xu 2013 the geological formation and secondary carbonate deposits including soda straw stalactites stalagmites cave flags cave shields were explored in the cave zhu et al 2004 the systemic study of the links between the host rock water and speleothems has been performed to explain the universal cementation of magnesium bearing minerals wu et al 2015 most parts of the cave are narrow and deep passages canyon passages which are developed along strata and composed of three levels level i 233 236 m level ii 249 262 m and level iii 281 283 m pu et al 2014 there is no allogenic stream sinking underground at the head of xueyu cave pu et al 2015 a cave stream with the explored length of 1644 m and the total length of 8 km flows at the bottom level i and out of xueyu cave with only one natural opening pu et al 2016 previous investigations have described the hydrogeological and hydrochemical functioning of xueyu cave stream zhu et al 2004 pu et al 2016 the discharge of the subterranean stream ranges from 4 1 l s in dry period to 26 6 l s in wet period meteoric water recharges the karst aquifer through carbonate matrix and conduits as a show cave xueyu cave receives a great number of visitors every year especially in summer two doors have been installed at the cave entrance in order to prevent frequent exchange of indoor and outdoor gas the cave is not well ventilated in most of the time the relationships between specific conductance spc ca2 and hco3 have been established and variations of co2 concentrations in the cave atmosphere and cave stream showed different changes in wet and dry season due to the ventilation pu et al 2015 2018 high 222rn and co2 concentrations typically occur during the warm summer and low concentrations are typical in cold winter yang et al 2013 pu et al 2018 xueyu cave presents chimney effect based on monitoring of seasonal radon pattern wang et al 2019 which is consistent with seasonality of cave air co2 concentration as changes in radon production are expected to be small within the cave the ventilation process is the main factor controlling changes of radon concentrations in the cave przylibski 1999 storms result in the most dramatic stream pco2 variations for a short time pu et al 2018 cao et al 2019 3 methods and materials meteorological data including precipitation with the precision of 0 01 mm and temperature with the precision of 0 1 c were recorded every 15 min using a devis vp 2 weather station the continuous and automatic measurement of soil air co2 with a co2 sensor gmm221 was fixed at 40 cm depth in the soil profile above xueyu cave from october 2014 seeing the site s in fig 1e and fig s1 the soil temperature and moisture were obtained by a temperature and humidity sensor av 10t and av ec5 co2 recordings were calibrated using a handheld probe gt901 two sites lf and mz in xueyu cave have been selected for the monitoring of co2 from cave air and the subterranean stream fig 1e using gmm221 sensors with rr 1008 data logging that was calibrated by cdu 440 co2 meter stream pco2 values calculated by hydrochemical parameters are used to compare with continuous logging data to obtain the detailed hydrochemical variations a cdtp300 multi parameter water quality meter was installed to record water temperature water level spc and ph respectively the data from co2 measurement system and water quality data logger was set at the same time interval of 15 min see more details about these instruments in supplementary material soil and cave air samples for δ13cco2 analyses were collected using a pump and carefully sealed in the 100 ml trace gas bags all samples were stored at room temperature before analysis the measurement was performed at the environmental stable isotope lab chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas where δ13cco2 in the bags was introduced to delta v plus δ13cdic samples from the stream were filtered and injected in 15 ml brown bottles without bubbles and two drops of hgcl2 were added in order to prevent microbial activities analyses were performed using a delta plus xl continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry the results of carbon isotope were reported relative to v pdb based on comparison to known carbonate standards and the analysis precision was better than 0 15 1σ 4 results during oct 2014 and feb 2017 the monthly air temperature ranged from 3 3 c to 39 5 c with an average of 19 5 7 2 c fig 2 a mean annual rainfall amount was over 1100 mm moreover there were few rainfall events in august every year because of the strong effect of northwest pacific subtropical high pressure fig 2b the mean atmospheric co2 concentration during the study period was 467 33 ppmv with a significant seasonal trend low values in summer but high values in winter the soil temperature ranged from 8 0 c in december to 24 0 c in august with a mean value of 18 5 5 1 c fig 2a the soil moisture varied between 0 5 and 24 0 with a mean value of 9 4 4 4 showing low values in winter and high values in summer which is highly correlated with local rainfall events fig 2c the complex cave geometry with three layers strongly influences airflow direction and velocity in different parts of the cave but the inner cave temperatures are stable with the average temperature of 17 2 0 2 c throughout the year the stream water temperatures ranged from 16 0 c to 18 7 c during 150 days from may to october the external temperature was above the cave temperatures and only 90 days from december to march the external temperature was below the cave temperature fig 2a the correlations between different monitored items have been listed in table 1 showing good correlations between soil temperature and soil co2 cave air pco2 and stream pco2 the soil co2 concentrations obtained in situ are highly correlated with the results from the spectrometric analysis in the laboratory r2 0 93 p 0 01 n 46 soil co2 at 40 cm depth showed noticeable seasonal variations throughout the annual cycle the soil co2 concentrations ranged from 4000 ppmv in december to 17 000 ppmv in june with a mean value of 8890 4576 ppmv showing higher values in wet summer than in dry summer fig 2d in winter cave air pco2 was relatively steady and low 1000 ppmv similar to caves in texas and florida in the us that experience fastest ventilation in winter banner et al 2007 kowalczk and froelich 2010 whereas it fluctuated largely and increased to be relatively abundant in summer 6000 ppmv cave air pco2 showed the mean value of 5691 ppmv at lf the innermost part in the cave and that of 4447 ppmv at mz the entrance part fig 2d stream water pco2 showed a mean value of 6873 ppmv at lf and of 5558 ppmv at mz the continuous variational trend of stream pco2 at mz are very similar to that at lf pco2 values in the cave and the stream are generally lower than those in the soil to make lines that depict pco2 trends more distinctive we only showed monitoring results of stream pco2 from lf in the fig 2d specifically abrupt changes of cave air and stream pco2 occurred at the moments of transitional seasons autumn to winter or spring to summer with large variational magnitudes e g cave air co2 concentrations had increased to 16 000 ppmv and decreased to 1000 ppmv within several days in november 2015 and 2016 during the rainfall events cave air and stream pco2 responded quickly to rainfall events fig 3 at the end of october 2014 soil co2 concentrations increased gradually from 4000 ppmv to 9000 ppmv at the beginning of the rainfall event and then decreased gradually to below 5000 ppmv on the contrary cave air pco2 at lf and mz were higher than soil co2 ranging from 8000 ppm to 12000 ppm however we did not grasp the initial increasing changes that corresponded to the onset of rainfall events because the equipment for the monitoring in the stream started to work only when the pco2 had increased and kept on the high level fig 3d that is cave air and stream were initially characterized by high pco2 values and pco2 stream pco2 cave air at lf with the external air entering the cave cave air and stream pco2 decreased below 2000 ppmv in the next several days low cave air co2 concentrations indicated beneficial conditions for gas exchange and low concentration recharge was gradually predominant in the cave fig 3d pco2 cave air was only slightly lower than pco2 stream at lf while at mz pco2 cave air was the lowest confirming that ventilation near the cave entrance is more significant in june 2016 before the rainfall stream water pco2 was equilibrium with cave air pco2 showing increasing pco2 responding to rainfall events rainwater dissolved soil co2 and brought more co2 to the stream the main source of cave air pco2 was rarely related to external air due to poor ventilation stream and cave pco2 were in equilibrium before rainfall and they increased along rainfall events stream pco2 cave pco2 at lf and mz sites and stream pco2 was higher at lf than at mz all pco2 decreased in the flood recession period finally stream pco2 at mz was the highest the δ13cair values of background atmospheric air co2 were from 10 0 to 9 6 during the two high resolution monitoring intervals δ13c value was 19 3 0 8 in the overlying soil gas in november but 23 9 1 4 in june on average δ13ccave air values ranged from 18 8 19 4 18 2 in november to 23 3 23 6 22 7 in june at lf and mz sites during rainfall events there was no significant difference of δ13ccave air at both sites δ13cdic in the stream ranged from 11 9 12 6 10 6 in november to 13 3 13 9 12 8 in june at mz from 12 7 13 1 12 2 in november to 13 5 13 9 13 2 in june at lf the average value of δ13cco2 from stream degassing at mz should be 21 0 and 22 3 in november and june respectively considering carbon isotopic fractionation of 9 between water and gas zhang et al 1995 similarly the average value of δ13cco2 from stream degassing at lf was 22 4 in november to 23 9 in june at lf respectively table 2 5 discussion the cave air co2 concentration at a given time is the result of the balance between co2 fluxes into and out the cave breecker et al 2012 seasonal variations in cave air co2 could be related to changes in different sources and transport mechanisms according to monthly monitoring results the seasonality of cave co2 variations occurred cave co2 concentration was generally higher in summer and lower in winter wang et al 2016 pu et al 2018 our data provide further high frequency records of temperatures precipitation and co2 variations that allow us to see the details of variations and the processes in the cave 5 1 sources and variations of co2 concentrations in xueyu soil cave system 5 1 1 co2 production and variation in xueyu soils the time series of seasonal soil co2 concentrations suggest that the seasonality of soil co2 concentrations above xueyu cave were generally corresponding to the variations in soil temperature fig 2a 2d soil co2 is the combination of co2 produced by root respiration and microbial decomposition of organic matter breecker et al 2012 normally soil co2 peaks in wet and warm summer in subtropical area soil co2 production rates will rise with temperature when soil moisture is not limited fang and moncrieff 2001 however the study area always suffered summer drought in august due to the control of west pacific subtropical high wpsh which results in high air temperature but low precipitation zhou et al 2009 leading to lower soil moisture during the dry period fig 2c lower soil co2 concentrations could be due to reduced co2 production rates or greater gas permeability in dry environment which also facilitates the escape of co2 to the surface mattey et al 2016 soil moisture enhances co2 production when soils are not saturated with water moyano et al 2013 the soil co2 concentrations of the study area were increased along with soil moisture in plant growth period gibraltar soil co2 concentrations were minimum in the late summer each year consistent with dry soil and died vegetation and rose in winter with abundant precipitation mattey et al 2016 however the effect of soil moisture on soil co2 concentrations was not always positive fig 2c for example during rainfall events soil co2 concentrations might rise up fig 3d or just decreased fig 3h the reason for the increase could be that mineralization of carbon containing compound enhances the microbial activities and activate their metabolism more co2 is trapped and concentrated in soil under suitable temperature and moisture while the reason for the decrease would be that too much water in the soil pores prevents the microbial activities and finally limits soil respiration 5 1 2 co2 in xueyu cave air although the drivers on cave air co2 are complex many studies have confirmed that high cave air co2 concentrations are mainly imputable to high soil co2 wong and banner 2010 frisia et al 2011 air co2 in xueyu cave is maximum in rainy seasons april october the site near the entrance has more variable cave air co2 concentration indicating that the influence of external air is greatest near the cave entrance where air exchanges in and out of the cave in many previous studies about caves the dominant sources of cave co2 are mixed with soil respiration and atmospheric air ek and gewelt 1985 baldini et al 2008 low co2 production in the overlying soils in winter aggravates the scarcity of co2 in the cave external air temperature drops below the internal cave air temperature causing cold dense air to flow inwards resulting in a decline in cave temperature and co2 levels breecker et al 2012 however the sites in xueyu cave except the one near the entrance mz have relatively steady cave air temperature co2 concentrations in cave air were sometimes higher than in contemporaneous soil air in transitional periods suggesting a deeper source for cave air co2 benavente et al 2010 2015 atkinson 1977 proposed that ground air co2 could be related to slow and steady decomposition of particulate organic matter of soils washed down by infiltrating water the contribution to cave c source from old organic matter oxidation was emphasized too noronha et al 2015 similar phenomenon was also found but in winter in gibraltar karst caves which was considered to be a source of co2 from vadose zone mattey et al 2016 a previous study of chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom in xueyu cave stream showed that cdom was mainly from autochthonous source fan et al 2019 which confirms that cave air co2 is only partly influenced by decomposition of soil organic matter the delay of co2 concentration peaks in xueyu cave would be attributed to the slow movement of co2 that stores in karst fissures and voids in the vadose zone though the contemporaneous soil co2 concentration might be low fig 4 one of the most striking features of the co2 time series is the similar trend of cave air co2 and stream co2 fig 2d however they still show some contradictions when we focus on the pco2 difference in water and gas fig 5 troester and white 1984 showed that seasonal degassing from a cave stream contributes to cave air co2 in xueyu cave stream flow may also play an important role for variations of cave air pco2 as co2 degassing and absorption by stream water like in ballynamintra cave baldini et al 2006 strong stream flow can induce air velocities proportional to that of the stream via friction between water and air cigna 1968 fairchild and baker 2012 breitenbach et al 2015 degassing rates are greatest when cave air pco2 is lowest in winter in other seasons it is uncertain whether degassing occurs or not monitoring data from lf and mz sites showed that stream pco2 variations were consistent with that of the cave air on the seasonal scale fig 2d specifically the higher stream pco2 at lf than that at mz confirmed co2 degassing from the upstream lf to the downstream mz other c sources for the cave air co2 can be neglected e g the effect of human respiration in the cave is of minor importance based on co2 measurements in peak tourist seasons wang et al 2010 5 2 cave air co2 dynamics controlled by rainfall events soil co2 is considered as an important component in the chemical weathering of limestone previous studies in xueyu cave have revealed that precipitation rather than temperature exerts a significant impact on cave co2 variations on the storm scale pu et al 2014 wang et al 2016 cao et al 2019 during storms soil co2 dissolves in water and enters the karst system to dissolve limestone the higher the precipitation the higher the dissolution rate is the higher the rainfall intensity the higher the variations in stream and cave air pco2 stream pco2 variations are considered as the most important control on the variation of dissolution rates and higher rates are observed with the high pco2 flow during summer covington and vaughn 2018 the stream starts at a high pco2 level and then would enhance dissolution along the flow path in a closed system condition ford and williams 2007 covington and vaughn 2018 at the beginning of november both the degassing and ventilation are responsible for the decrease of stream and cave air pco2 because of the ventilation mz is the most striking part for air exchange which could explain the lowest concentration of cave air pco2 the epi karstic porous system is not water saturated in the cold and dry seasons opening paths are beneficial for co2 movement fig 4 the mechanism is depending on water that seals the pores where gas transport through the overlying soil is determined by the pore size distribution inter particle porosity and water content cuezva et al 2011 large pco2 difference between stream water and cave air will result in faster degassing rates fig 5 this pco2 difference started to become large at the beginning of rainfall events as the dissolution increased stream water interacted with cave atmosphere to get equilibrated with the cave air co2 within 3 4 days from the beginning of the rainfall events fig 3d and 3h in contrast the system of epi karstic fissures in the warm and wet seasons is almost temporarily saturated with water making the host rock membrane impermeable to prevent the co2 diffusion from the cave ventilation is minimized and cool stagnant air could accumulate resulting in higher co2 concentration in the cave noticeably stream water co2 was higher at mz than lf inputs from different water sources or increased dissolution rates may explain for a higher stream pco2 along flow path from lf to mz a drip water in nearby site from mz showed its pco2 nearly two times higher suggesting high pco2 drip water and air seepage as plausible sources pu et al 2018 during the flood recession period of rainfall events the dissolution of calcite took co2 from cave air which decreased the cave air pco2 but increased the stream pco2 at mz 5 3 δ13c isotope calculating contributions from soil to cave air co2 mean δ13cco2 in the overlying soil of xueyu cave was 21 5 0 5 ranging from 23 9 to 18 5 it indicates that c3 plants are responsible for most of the biogenic co2 production in the soil and cave air δ13cco2 was generally lower in the summer than other seasons wang et al 2016 in the karst cave hco3 constituted the main dic with the ph values above 7 4 the δ13c of dic δ13cdic in xueyu stream was generally higher in dry seasons and lower in wet seasons as the degassing occurs and ph increases lighter δ13c would be going to the cave air and the remaining δ13cdic becomes heavier our observation has shown that soil co2 concentration with seasonality was similar to that from other soil sites in the study area which was enriched from shallow to deep soil wang et al 2016 soil co2 was transported by advection and diffusion the former would be changed by temperature variations mattey et al 2016 while the latter always results in reduced co2 concentrations and increased δ13c values relative to the root respiration cerling 1984 besides transport by diffusion is slower than advection the identification of δ13c compositions of the end member components in each reservoir has been carried out to completely understand the underlying processes that control the generation and dispersal of co2 in karst systems the source of the isotopically light end member co2 in the standard model is soil respiration that is dominant in cave air baldini et al 2006 frisia et al 2011 breecker et al 2012 other potential sources include degassing from co2 riched groundwater deep sourced co2 breecker et al 2012 in xueyu cave there is a linear relationship between δ13cco2 and 1 co2 during the transitional period indicating a mixing process fig 6 the mixing model has two end members one of which from the degassing of stream water or soil inputs ground air is isotopically light and the other from the external air fig 6 within the linear relationships the cave air δ13cco2 values are extremely close to soil air values that are far from the data of exterior air the lowest cave air pco2 and heaviest δ13cco2 occurred in the more exterior influenced sites mz inside the cave the keeling plot shows that the linear regression of the co2 transported via diffusive movement resulted in a higher intercept value 19 5 than that dominated by advection 20 5 with the influence of degassing the sample collected at mz the last time deviated far from the mixing line soil δ13c co2 agrees well with that in cave air especially in june there is no linear relationship between δ13cco2 and 1 co2 to indicate a mixing process however the lighter values of cave air δ13c from the beginning of the rainfall events might confirm a direct contribution from soil co2 cave air δ13c values only slightly changed along with the large variations in co2 concentrations here we excluded other sources such as human respiration that contributed very little co2 concentration wang et al 2016 besides the contribution from deep sources can be neglected as it has more positive δ13c value soil co2 would dominate the cave air co2 in wet summer table 2 this indicates that co2 is gradually accumulated in the cave due to increased soil inputs that are induced by high infiltration during storms 5 4 implications the xueyu a karstic cave could be representative of a series of natural shallow caves in vadose zone the analysis of this particular cave summarized the complex relationships between the outdoor atmosphere the soil rock membrane and the underground atmosphere which comprise a multicomponent system results presented in this study demonstrate the seasonality and processes of cave air pco2 dynamics occurring in xueyu cave changes of ventilation is controlled by a mixed effect of temperature difference in and out of the cave and rainfall events synchronous sharp variations in cave water and cave air pco2 of two locations in the cave from march to april or from october to november were recorded the cave is assumed to be closed in summer despite small exchanges with the external air take place the main source of cave air pco2 is overlying soil however more contributions from external air and degassing may dominate in pco2 variations from november this study grasped the declining process of stream and cave air pco2 suggesting how the mixing occurred within several days however there are still limitations to our current quantitative understanding of the distribution of cave co2 production and transport from more than two sources 6 conclusions soil air pco2 cave air pco2 and stream pco2 as well as soil temperature soil moisture and precipitation have been monitored at high resolution above and in xueyu cave importantly the high co2 values of cave air and stream and the similarity of their seasonal patterns indicate fast exchange of co2 in water gas state and they are always in dynamical equilibrium the production and transport of soil co2 control the main variations in cave co2 rainfall events can largely influence the co2 fluctuations thus high flow periods are always consistent with high pco2 the temperature difference between external and inside cave seems to work as the threshold of ventilation for air in and out of xueyu cave during the transitional period ventilation regimes had changed and the entering of external air contributed more to the total cave air co2 especially the sites near the entrance cave air pco2 near those observed outside were found after several days of a strong winter ventilation the contribution from external air is still below 20 in better ventilated winter soil input is the main source of cave air co2 in summer higher discharge in the stream after storms is equilibrated by co2 degassing too as cave air pco2 increased to its peaks over one day after the stream pco2 peaks keeling plot were used to assess the different contributions from soil and external air in the strong mixing process the combined effects of different co2 sources ventilation conditions and the occurrence of rainfall events could impact the final variations of cave air co2 through a year more attention should also be paid to estimates of extreme events and sub daily flow variation given their significant impacts to cave air co2 credit authorship contribution statement min cao formal analysis visualization

rainfall threshold tourist attractions 1 introduction flash floods cause widespread fatalities and economic losses every year to improve understanding of past events predictions and early warnings and to reduce potential losses many countries around the world have invested in specific projects for flash floods such as hydrate in europe borga et al 2011 flash in the united states gourley et al 2017 and cffse in china yuan et al 2017 in the us from 1996 to 2017 approximately 75 000 flash flood events occurred ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 during 2007 2015 278 fatalities resulted from more than 28 000 flash food events gourley et al 2017 in china flash floods have been even more catastrophic more than 60 000 flash flood events with accurate spatial and temporal information have been reported since 1949 liu et al 2018 during 2000 2018 flash flood events claimed approximately 16 000 lives in china accounting for 74 of the total flood related fatalities ministry of water resources 2018 in an unequivocally warming climate water holding capacity of the air increases theoretically at a rate of approximately 7 c according to the clausius clapeyron c c relation zhang et al 2017 observations and model projections in some parts of the world for example the us china and australia have shown that extreme precipitation has a higher increasing rate than mean precipitation kunkel et al 2013 wu et al 2016 bao et al 2017 a scaling rate between extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature that is higher than the c c rate has been observed in large parts of china gao et al 2020 even worse for flash flood risk management extreme precipitation at sub daily scales is intensifying more rapidly than at the daily scale westra et al 2014 climate change is likely to have a significant impact on flash floods since they are mainly induced by short duration extreme precipitation prein et al 2017 assessment of flash flood hazard is the foundation of risk management various methods have been used to assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazard mainly through flood intensity and or frequency inundation depth and area flood volume and peak discharge are the main indices for flash flood intensity for example wang et al 2019 used hydrological and hydrodynamic models to reproduce a historic flash flood event induced by a 50 year rainfall event in the baiyangdian lake area bla china then a synthetic event induced by a future 50 year storm from general circulation models gcms projections under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenario was designed and the results suggested that the change in precipitation might greatly increase the flood volume inundation depth and area in the bla ryu and kim 2019 combined hydrological simulation and flood frequency analysis based on extreme value distribution and projected that climate change under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios may increase the maximum 3 day running total streamflow in boise river watershed in the united states in terms of assessing climate related change in flash flood frequency current literature can be classified into two categories studies in one category used the occurrence of extreme precipitation event as a proxy for flash flood occurrence kermanshah et al 2017 set the 95th percentile of daily precipitation as a threshold for triggering flash floods and found flash flood frequency is likely to increase during 2006 2100 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to 1950 2005 modrick and georgakakos 2015 integrated outputs from a gcm two hydrological models and flash flood guidance ffg in southern california in the united states a flash flood event will occur if the projected precipitation at an aggregated time interval exceeds the ffg for the same interval flash flood occurrence in this region is projected to increase by 30 40 during 2070 2099 under the a1b scenario compared to 1970 1999 debortoli et al 2017 constructed a flash flood index for brazil by weighting extreme precipitation indices compared with 1961 1990 an overall increase in flash flood frequency is projected during 2071 2100 under rcp8 5 due to climate change although the change direction and magnitude vary for different regions and climate models studies in another category define flash floods occurrence in a more direct way a flash flood event will occur when streamflow of the event exceeds a threshold for example velasco et al 2013 used outputs from a regional climate model to drive a hydrological model and performed a peak over threshold analysis in two sub basins of the llobregat river basin spain during three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under the a2 and b1 emission scenarios flash flood occurrence is projected to increase in one sub basin while decreasing in another compared to 1980 2008 flash floods are extremely dangerous because they rise and fall rapidly the average lag time of major flash flood events in europe is less than 5 h marchi et al 2010 the average duration of flash floods during 1996 2017 in the united states is shorter than 4 h ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 therefore climate variables at a finer temporal scale should be used to assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazard however relatively few studies have used sub daily climate variables mainly because most gcms or regional climate models rcms provide raw outputs at the daily scale nevertheless downscaling methods namely dynamical statistical and stochastic methods have been adopted in some studies in the climate change and hydrological fields peleg et al 2019 a weather generator is a relatively parsimonious stochastic method for downscaling daily outputs from climate models to sub daily scales fatichi et al 2011

precipitation during 1962 1992 as a baseline fatichi et al 2013 sunyer et al 2015 used three change factor based methods including a weather generator to assess the change in hourly extreme precipitation during 2071 2100 from 13 rcms under the a1b scenario with respect to 1961 1990 in denmark camici et al 2014 generated hourly precipitation and temperature from 2 gcms under the a2 scenario using a weather generator for the upper tiber river basin in italy and assessed the flood frequency change between 2070 2099 and 1961 1990 through a hydrological model in recent years ultra

november 2018 flash floods in jordan resulted in 11 fatalities and the evacuation of nearly 4 000 tourists morsy et al 2020 flash floods at chinese tourist attractions need special attention in the context of climate change not only because many chinese scenic spots are located in areas highly susceptible to flash floods but also because of a high concentration of tourists a typical example is hainan island which is a unique tropical tourist destination in china with a reputation as the oriental hawaii in 2010 hainan island attracted nearly 26 million tourists while hawaii received approximately 7 million world travel and tourism council 2012 the overarching aim of this study is to project precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence in the nanshan scenic zone of hainan island which includes two famous 5a tourist attractions and has approximately 6 million annual visitors a stochastic hourly weather generator and an empirical rainfall threshold for flash floods occurrence are used for this purpose historical hourly precipitation series 1991 2012 set a baseline future hourly precipitation series for 13 selected gcms and multi model means mme during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 under the rcp4 5 scenario are simulated by the downscaling weather generator with a change factor method an empirical threshold for cumulative event rainfall and rainfall duration e d for triggering flash floods are used to determine the number of flash flood events during historical and future periods changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change are projected by comparing the frequency of historical and future flash floods the modeling framework is presented in section 2 and the results for the nanshan scenic zone are in section 3 uncertainly analysis and implications are discussed in section 4 and the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 modeling procedure the schematic flowchart of the framework for projecting the changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change is shown in fig 1 the modeling procedure mainly includes 7 steps 1 calculate historical rainfall statistical properties and estimate historical hourly rainfall parameters of the weather generator using observed hourly precipitation data 2 select gcms calculate change factors for rainfall statistical properties from each gcm and mme and calculate future rainfall statistical properties 3 downscale future rainfall statistical properties to finer time scales and estimate future hourly rainfall parameters of the weather generator 4 simulate historical and future hourly precipitation series using the weather generator 5 partition historical and future hourly precipitation series into historical and future rainfall events 6 calculate historical and future flash flood occurrence by using a rainfall threshold to detect the number of rainfall events over the threshold 7 compare historical and future flash flood occurrence and project the changes under climate change 2 2 selection of gcms although many gcms are available from the recent phases of the coupled model intercomparison project such as cmip3 cmip5 including the nex gddp dataset and cmip6 selecting models to construct a multi model ensemble is essential for obtaining relatively reliable results and saving computational resources giri et al 2020 the selection of models is on the basis of three criteria availability of daily precipitation relative independence among different models and relatively good performance when simulating heavy precipitation fatichi et al 2011 projections of climate change impacts are presented as the mme with the range of models as a measure of uncertainty eyring et al 2019 however many gcms may share some parameterization schemes or components which will undermine the model independence assumption and result in a biased mme a simple and widely used solution to this problem is assuming climate models developed by different institutions are relatively independent and selecting only one model from each institution the third criterion aims to produce a more reliable multi model ensemble previous studies have demonstrated that different climate models have divergent performances when simulating precipitation in different parts of the world when simulating heavy precipitation which is relevant to flash floods there is evidence that some climate models outperform others for specific regions jiang et al 2015 li et al 2016 2 3 weather generator awe gen the advanced weather generator awe gen is a stochastic weather generator which can reproduce statistical properties of precipitation and simulate hourly precipitation series at the station scale ivanov et al 2007 fatichi et al 2011 a detailed description of awe gen can be found in fatichi et al 2011 and in the online technical reference http www personal umich edu ivanov hydrowit models html the attractive features of awe gen are its capability of simulating precipitation at the hourly scale and good performance when simulating heavy precipitation which are essential for flash floods briefly the precipitation component in awe gen is based on the neyman scott rectangular pulse method this method describes the origin time of a storm as a poission process uses a geometrical distribution to determine the number of cells in each storm and generates the time difference between each cell and the origin time of a storm from an exponential distribution for each precipitation cell there are two properties a life time described by another exponential distribution and a rainfall intensity described by a gamma distribution therefore the stochastic precipitation process at any temporal scale is fully defined by 6 parameters mean origin time of a storm λ 1 h mean time difference between each cell and the origin time of a storm β 1 h mean life time of a cell η 1 h mean number of cells in each storm μ c and shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution of rainfall intensity α and θ mm h 1 in the parameters fitting procedure eight statistical properties mean variance coefficient of variation lag 1 autocorrelation skewness non precipitation frequency transition probability of dry dry and transition probability of wet wet of the precipitation process at four time intervals 1 6 24 and 72 h are utilized to minimize the objective function applications of the weather generator in climate change fields are presented in fatichi et al 2011 fatichi et al 2013 caracciolo et al 2014 and yang et al 2020 the change factor method is used when estimating parameters of the weather generator for future hourly precipitation eq 1 this method only infers climate change signals from climate models since they represent the change in the statistical properties of precipitation better than does the amount of precipitation anandhi et al 2011 sunyer et al 2015 this is a widely used method because use change factors derived from simulated precipitation of gcms during historical and future periods can avoid the prevalent mismatch between simulated precipitation from gcms and observed precipitation during the historical period e g caracciolo et al 2014 peres and cancelliere 2018 change factors for statistical properties the ratio of s h gcm fut to s h gcm his are derived from daily precipitation simulated by each gcm and the mme change factors can be calculated the statistical properties of future precipitation are obtained by multiplying change factors by s h obs change factors are only calculated for a limited number of dominant statistical properties for instance proper relationships for change factors of lag 1 autocorrelation are lacking and the simulation results of the weather generator are less sensitive to this statistic thus lag 1 autocorrelation is set as time invariant fatichi et al 2011 1 s h fut s h obs s h gcm f u t s h gcm h i s where s h fut is the statistical properties of future precipitation s h obs is the statistical properties of observed historical precipitation s h gcm fut and s h gcm his are the statistical properties of the simulated historical and future precipitation from a gcm respectively since the temporal resolution of gcms precipitation is daily statistical properties at coarse aggregation scales h 24 h are extended to finer scales 1 h and 6 h the temporal downscaling methods are presented in fatichi et al 2011 briefly this method assumes empirical functional relationships exist between statistical properties at a time interval and the length of the time interval parameters of these empirical functions are fitted with statistical properties at coarse aggregation scales h 24 h downscaling procedure for rainfall variance in this study is slightly different from the procedure described in fatichi et al 2011 a power law scaling instead of the analytical form in marani 2003 is used for downscaling the variance because the power law scaling has similar performance to the recommended analytical form at the required time scales 1 h and 6 h and the fitting procedure is easier once statistical properties are obtained for future precipitation at 1 6 24 and 72 h the weather generator parameters of the hourly precipitation can be estimated then historical and future hourly precipitation series can be simulated 2 4 rainfall events partitioning and rainfall thresholds using the definition in melillo et al 2015 as a reference a rainfall event in this study is a period of continuous wet hours or a chronological ensemble of several periods of continuous wet hours sub events separated from any preceding and following rainfall events by dry periods therefore wet hours and dry periods are two parameters for the definition of a rainfall event the power law rainfall threshold between the amount of rainfall or rainfall intensity in a rainfall event and the duration often referred to as e d or i d thresholds is an empirical tool widely used for hydrometeorological and hydrogeological hazards early warnings maréchal et al 2008 proposed e d thresholds for a karst region in southeastern france by analyzing past flash flood events melillo et al 2018 developed an algorithm to identify rainfall events related to landslides occurrence and established e d thresholds for the liguria region italy lin et al 2020 used an e d threshold to study the impact of climate change on landslide occurrence in china the power law eq 2 is also used in this study to represent the rainfall threshold for flash flood occurrence 2 e a d b where e mm is the cumulative event rainfall d hour is the rainfall duration and a and b are scaling and slope parameters respectively the number of events over the threshold is used as a proxy for flash flood occurrence if the cumulative event rainfall and rainfall duration of a rainfall event or a sub event of a rainfall event are on or above the e d threshold a flash flood event is considered to occur in projecting the precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence the rainfall threshold for trigging flash floods is assumed to be time invariant 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the projection framework is applied to the nanshan scenic zone in sanya city on hainan island fig 2 sanya city 18 09 18 38 n 108 56 109 49 e is the southernmost city in china located in the pan pearl river delta along the south china sea it has a tropical marine monsoon climate with annual average precipitation of approximately 1500 mm and annual average temperature of approximately 26 c 1991 2012 sanya city has distinct dry and wet seasons precipitation in the rainy season may october accounts for 87 of the total precipitation annually three neighboring stations baoting lingshui and wuzhishan show similar temporal patterns to sanya station although with greater monthly precipitation fig 2 the unique tropical seaside city is one of the most popular tourist destinations in china li et al 2015 in 2018 sanya city attracted approximately 21 million overnight visitors however part of the peak tourist season september april coincides with the autumn flood season sanya city is prone to flash floods because rivers and streams originating from steep northern mountains flow into the sea at this city according to the results from the cffse project during 2000 2015 18 major flash flood events occurred causing 15 recorded deaths and more than 700 million yuan approximately 100 million u s dollar in direct economic losses personal communication with rihong luo the nanshan scenic zone is the most popular place in sanya city or even on hainan island it comprises two famous 5a tourist attractions and supporting facilities and received approximately 6 million domestic and international tourists in 2018 the nearest meteorological station around the nanshan scenic zone is sanya station the hourly precipitation series spans from 1991 to 2012 at this station was provided by china meteorological administration for use in this study daily precipitation data simulated by gcms are from the nex gddp dataset https www nccs nasa gov services data collections land based products nex gddp the nex gddp dataset is generated by bias correcting and spatially downscaling the cmip5 outputs thrasher et al 2012 it includes 21 gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios the historical period is 1950 2005 and the future period for most gcms is 2006 2100 for 2 gcms it is 2006 2099 and for 1 gcm it is 2006 2095 compared with cmip5 outputs which have a horizontal resolution of no less than 0 5 0 5 approximately 50 km the nex gddp dataset has a relatively high resolution of 0 25 0 25 previous studies have found that the nex gddp dataset has better performances than the raw outputs from cmip5 when simulating extreme precipitation chen et al 2017 not surprisingly some climate models are more skillful in simulating extreme precipitation in china li et al 2016 based on the model selection criteria presented in section 2 2 13 gcms in nex gddp are selected namely access1 0 bcc csm1 1 bnu esm canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2g inmcm4 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 mpi esm lr mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m fatichi et al 2011 found that change factors or climate change signals from a gcm are insensitive to the location of the grid cell in a specific region i e change factors for neighboring cells in a gcm are very similar following previous studies this study used precipitation simulated by gcms at the grid cell that contained the tourist attraction fatichi et al 2011 2013 ciabatta et al 2016 the historical baseline period in this study is 1991 2012 and the near and far future periods are 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively the rcp4 5 emission scenario is investigated since it matches present emission control measures 3 2 rainfall thresholds in china typical rainfall thresholds for flash flood occurrence are empirical e d thresholds developed by the local flood management agency these rainfall thresholds are represented as discrete points instead of continuous formulas luo et al 2018 analyzed major flash floods that caused severe consequences in sanya city during 2000 2015 and determined the critical cumulative rainfall at 1 3 6 12 and 24 h for triggering flash floods as shown in fig 3 the power law threshold in eq 2 is fitted based on these points the upper and lower thresholds are determined by parameters of the 95 confidence intervals although the uncertainty is relatively high the fitting is acceptable with a r 2 of 0 98 and a p value of 0 001 3 3 historical flash flood occurrence since the weather generator simulates precipitation series stochastically following ciabatta et al 2016 an ensemble of 10 statistically equivalent hourly series are simulated by the weather generator for the historical period 1991 2012 wet hours are defined as hours with no less than 0 1 mm precipitation and the dry period threshold is set at 6 h rainfall events are partitioned for 10 simulated hourly precipitation series and the observed series then flash flood occurrence are calculated for these 11 precipitation series there are 37 flash flood events according to the observed precipitation during 1991 2012 through a field investigation of cffse project in 2015 aiming to understand past major flash flood events 16 flash flood events during 1991 2012 are identified around the nanshan scenic zone many flash flood events occurred in this region during this period but only these 16 recorded events caused fatalities or direct economic losses greater than 30 000 yuan approximately 4285 u s dollars the fitted e d threshold successfully identifies 14 major flash flood events accounting for 87 5 of the aforementioned 16 major events the false alarm rate cannot be estimated since an exhaustive inventory including flash flood events with minor or no losses is not available nevertheless the performance of the fitted rainfall threshold is acceptable and can be used in further analysis the mean number of flash flood events during 1991 2012 from the 10 simulated precipitation series is 39 7 the simulated mean annual number of flash flood events 1 8 is similar to the observed number 1 7 if the upper and lower rainfall thresholds are considered the simulated figures are 0 5 and 4 6 while those of the observed figures are 0 8 and 4 3 the high uncertainty underlines the importance of a reliable rainfall threshold to further assess the simulation performance of the weather generator the number of flash flood events total rainfall and two extreme precipitation indices table 1 at the monthly scale are shown in fig 4 comparing the observed data with the mean simulation of the weather generator in fig 4 the overall seasonal distribution of flash flood events is simulated well with summer june july and august having the most events followed by autumn september october and november and spring march april and may no flash flood occurred in winter december january and february in autumn the number of flash flood events is overestimated in september and underestimated in october the simulation bias in autumn can be attributed to the unique rainfall regime of sanya city where the interannual variability of the monthly rainfall is very large and peaks in september october the peak interannual variability in september october can be attributed to the sea surface temperature anomaly tropical cyclones and intraseasonal oscillations feng et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the mean monthly rainfall is peaked in september but there are more intense and short duration extreme rainfall in october as is reflected by the highest observed h95 and ph95 for simulation performance of the rainfall indices the monthly rainfall is simulated very well the h95 and ph95 are overestimated slightly before september and underestimated slightly after that notwithstanding these small biases the overall trends of the two extreme heavy precipitation indices at the seasonal and monthly scales are well captured 3 4 projection of changes in flash flood occurrence at the annual scale the trends of climate change are represented by change factors of rainfall properties change factors from each gcm are calculated with the methodology presented in section 2 3 and the mme change factors are generated by averaging them with equal weights hourly rainfall parameters for each gcm and the mme are then estimated an ensemble of 10 hourly precipitation series are simulated by the weather generator for each gcm and the mme in near 2020 2049 and far 2070 2099 future periods the results from the mme series can be regarded as the most likely future scenario although novel and more sophisticated methods for generating mean values from a multi model ensemble exist such as bayesian weighted averaging and reliability ensemble averaging fatichi et al 2013 found that the mean climate change signals from bayesian weighted averaging and simple averaging are very similar the mean number of flash flood events simulated by the weather generator during the historical period 1991 2012 is set as a baseline the mean simulated number of events is used instead of the observed number to reduce uncertainties caused by the stochastic weather generator under the rcp4 5 scenario the projected mean annual number of flash flood events in future periods and mean annual variations or relative changes with respect to the baseline are shown in table 2 these projections vary significantly for different future periods climate models and rainfall thresholds the different climate models and rainfall thresholds are the two biggest uncertainty sources and thus the use of an ensemble of the most skillful climate models and the most reliable rainfall threshold are highly recommended using the fitted rainfall threshold the mme annual number of flash flood events are projected to be 3 1 and 3 2 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively and thus the variations compared to 1991 2012 are 72 and 78 respectively the mme results indicate that mean annual flash flood occurrence in the near and far future are likely to be similar individual climate models present high uncertainty for projections for 2020 2049 the mean annual number of flash flood events is projected to vary from 2 2 miroc5 to 3 8 canesm2 with variations between 22 and 111 for 2070 2099 the number is projected to vary from 2 5 bcc csm1 1 to 3 9 inmcm4 and ipsl cm5a lr with variations between 39 and 117 the relative changes are more staggering 60 260 and 80 300 for the near and far future respectively when the upper rainfall threshold is used and less pronounced 11 48 and 20 63 for the near and far future respectively when the lower threshold is used although high uncertainties exist there is a consensus among different gcms that flash flood occurrence is projected to increase significantly in both the near and far future in the nanshan scenic zone therefore adaptation and flash flood disaster risk reduction measures are urgently needed 3 5 projection of changes in flash flood occurrence at the monthly scale monthly distribution of variations in total rainfall h95 and ph95 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 are shown in fig 5 the monthly fluctuations are pronounced in both future periods the far future period is likely to have more and heavier precipitation than the near future period the mme projections for two future periods are analyzed in detail total rainfall at the monthly scale is projected to increase by more than 30 during 2020 2049 and by more than 37 during 2070 2099 during 2020 2049 the variation in total rainfall peaks in spring followed by autumn and there are four months with variation in total rainfall more than 50 i e april 59 march 58 january 55 and september 52 during 2070 2099 the largest variation in total rainfall is in autumn and the second largest is in spring and there are seven months with variation in total rainfall no less than 50 i e november 89 april 82 december 67 july 62 september 54 february 50 and may 50 in terms of the variation in extreme heavy precipitation the staggering numbers in january and december can be attributed to near zero baselines in addition the variation in the number of flash flood events at the monthly scale fig 6 indicates that flash floods are still unlikely to occur in future winters therefore winter is excluded from the following analysis autumn and spring have the largest variations in h95 and ph95 overall the variations in all seasons during 2070 2099 are greater than those during 2020 2049 the variations in h95 and ph95 for in summer are is relatively modest in the near 12 15 and 6 27 respectively and far 13 27 and 14 47 respectively future periods the monthly distribution of variation in flash flood occurrence is presented in fig 6 the temporal distribution and magnitude of the variation vary significantly among the different climate models and different future periods here we only focus on the mme results since they may give insights into a most likely future scenario the mme projections show the highest uncertainty in march april and november during both future periods there are still no flash floods in future winters during 2020 2049 the median variation is over 50 in march 214 november 206 april 96 october 94 august 76 and july 62 during 2070 2099 there are also six months with variations over 50 november 358 april 193 march 110 october 108 july 100 and june 64 among the three rainfall indices shown in fig 5 the variation in the ph95 is most closely related to the median variation in the number of flash flood event in both future periods the correlation coefficients between the two variations are 0 88 during 2020 2049 and 0 94 during 2070 2099 in other words the increase in future flash flood events might be attributed to the increase in the total amount of extreme heavy precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis in this study the impact of climate change on flash flood occurrence is investigated through precipitation changes different gcms and the use of time invariant rainfall threshold are two main sources of uncertainty in the case study of the nanshan scenic zone although the projections of all 13 selected gcms show a unanimous increase for flash flood occurrence at both annual and seasonal scale except during winter the magnitude of change varies significantly for example using the fitted rainfall threshold the range of the mean annual number of future flash flood events 1 6 for 2020 2049 and 1 4 for 2070 2099 is nearly equal to the mean annual historical flash flood occurrence the large spread of the projections resulting from the different gcms underlines the importance of constructing an ensemble of skillful models kwon et al 2019 the mme projection from such an ensemble might give us insights into a most likely future scenario the mme results under the rcp4 5 scenario suggested that annual mean precipitation and annual extreme precipitation are projected to increase by 6 and 34 during 2020 2049 respectively the percentages of increase for 2070 2099 are 10 and 42 these projections are largely consistent with previous studies zhou et al 2014 showed that annual total precipitation in wet days precipitation 1 mm is likely to increase by 5 10 under rcp4 5 during the late 21st century in sanya city guo et al 2017 simulated future precipitation changes through multiple rcms with a horizontal resolution of 25 km the projected annual precipitation change in sanya city are approximately 5 mm d in 2020s and approximately 9 mm d in 2080s zhou et al 2014 projected that annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation exceeds the 95th percentile of the wet day precipitation is likely to increase by 20 30 under rcp4 5 during the late 21st century the discrepancy between the relative increase for extreme precipitation in this study and the results of zhou et al 2014 might be due to different definitions and temporal scales hourly vs daily nevertheless both studies showed that the relative increase in extreme precipitation is much larger than the mean precipitation implying a potential increase in the flash flood risk further studies can compare the results of this study with the results from an ensemble of rcms when more models from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment or other convective permitting initiatives are available the stationary assumption of the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods is another main source of uncertainty storm surface runoff dominating flash floods mainly has two generation mechanisms infiltration excess or saturation excess yin et al 2018 in addition to the intensity and duration of precipitation land use cover lulc vegetation and antecedent soil moisture are also influencing factors for example the lulc change caused by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization will increase the impervious surfaces and decrease the infiltration rate and thus less precipitation is required to trigger flash floods however increases in temperature may result in higher evapotranspiration and more abundant vegetation reducing antecedent soil moisture and thus more precipitation is required to generate critical surface runoff gariano and guzzetti 2016 despite many factors influencing fast runoff precipitation has been reported to be the dominant factor in long term analysis and this dominant effect is more significant with increasing flood magnitude yin et al 2018 liu et al 2018 used a geo detector method to investigate the driving factors of flash flood events during 2000 2015 in china and found that precipitation is more closely related to flash flood occurrence than human activities dosdogrua et al 2020 assessed the potential impacts of climate change and lulc change on streamflow in a rapidly urbanizing watershed in alabama usa precipitation and temperature outputs from 11 gcms under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios during 2050s and a projected future lulc dataset were used to drive the soil and water assessment tool the results showed that precipitation change is projected to be the main driver of increase in maximum monthly streamflow li et al 2020 found the contribution of precipitation change 90 2 is much larger than that of human activities 9 8 in changing flood susceptibility in guangdong province a major province in the pearl river basin bennett et al 2018 investigated the effect of antecedent soil moisture with antecedent precipitation as a proxy on flood volume in 100 australian catchments and their results revealed that the elasticity of flow to causative precipitation is between 2 7 and 3 6 times the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation in the late 21st century the annual mean temperature might increase 1 5 c 2 c under rcp4 5 and 3 6 c 5 c under rcp8 5 in sanya city zhou et al 2014 to minimize the impact of increasing temperature on vegetation and antecedent soil moisture the rcp4 5 rather than the rcp8 5 emission scenario is investigated in this study therefore although the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods may change slightly in the future its impact on change in flash flood occurrence might be insignificant compared to the impact of precipitation change however the interaction between different factors in hydrological processes is quite complex for example in snowmelt dominated mountainous basins the impact of changes in vegetation and soil may offset or even reverse the impact of climate change on annual runoff rasouli et al 2019 since the nanshan scenic zone is snow free and we only focus on flash floods the results of this study can provide some scientific insights into the future even if the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods in sanya city change significantly in the future we may roughly estimate the combined impact of climate change and rainfall threshold change if less precipitation is required to trigger flash floods we can assume the lower 95 threshold in section 3 3 as the future threshold and the mean annual number of flash flood events might increase by 239 and 261 for 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively if more precipitation is required and the upper 95 threshold is assumed to be the future threshold mean annual number of flash flood events might decrease by 33 and 28 respectively further studies will consider antecedent soil conditions to produce more sophisticated results 4 2 implications the peak tourist season in the nanshan scenic zone is roughly september through april when the temperature is mild and pleasant unfortunately according to our projections for the future most of the peak season coincides with the sharpest increase in total rainfall extreme heavy precipitation and flash flood occurrence in spring and autumn flash flood risk is likely to increase in spring and autumn since the increasing flash flood hazard and the high flow of tourists might result in more exposures in the short term to reduce flash flood risk and ensure the safety of tourists local flood managers and the tourism management agency should work more closely in summer and autumn especially in autumn in 2012 sanya meteorological bureau and sanya tourism administration signed an agreement to promote early warning services for tourism sectors according to this agreement tour guides managers of travelling agencies and hotels and administrators of tourist attractions were added into the database of the early warning system so they could receive text messages when early warnings were issued sanya city 2013 however general tourists could only receive early warnings through tour guides or managers in mid may of 2020 ministry of water resources in china made a joint effort with 3 major telecommunications network operators to expand the coverage of the flash flood early warning systems in the foreseeable future all people including tourists will receive text messages directly if early warnings for flash floods are issued in their region building such flash flood early warning systems that are available to the general public will have a promising effect on reducing tourist exposure to flash floods in the long term adaptation and disaster reduction measures are needed to negate the impact of climate change in the nanshan scenic zone as mentioned above the annual mean temperature might increase 1 5 c 2 c or 3 6 c 5 c at the late 21st century in sanya city depending on the emission scenarios zhou et al 2014 along the coastal south china sea extreme precipitation has been increasing at a very high c c rate over 20 c mainly because the ocean has sufficient capacity to supply the water vapor yin et al 2018 dong et al 2019 to reduce the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes and the ensuing flash floods or at least to maintain the status quo emission reduction measures are urgently needed in addition in the recent decade the number of annual visitors to the nanshan scenic zone has been increasing at a rate of approximately 10 it is reasonable to predict that more tourism facilities will be built around the tourist attraction to accommodate these visitors to reduce flash flood risk it is prudent for local flood managers and stake holders to complete thorough assessments to identify areas highly susceptible to flash floods and ensure that future construction projects adhere to non stationary flood defense standards in these areas the results of this study can also provide insights regarding future flash flood hazards in other tourist attractions in neighboring regions on hainan island since the precipitation regimes in these regions are quite similar the hydrometeorological impacts of climate change vary in direction and magnitude in different regions of the world tourist attractions around the world that are prone to flash floods should also assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazards plan short term emergency response strategies and adopt long term risk reduction measures 5 conclusion this study presents a framework to project precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change a stochastic downscaling weather generator is applied for simulating hourly precipitation and an empirical rainfall threshold is used to detect flash flood events the framework is applied to the nanshan scenic zone in china which has 6 million annual visitors and is vulnerable to flash floods the results based on an ensemble of 13 gcms under the rcp4 5 emission scenario project a significant increase in flash flood occurrence compared to 1991 2012 the annual flash flood occurrence in nanshan scenic zone is projected to increase by 72 and 78 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively the uncertainty ranges from the different gcms for the near and far future periods are 22 111 and 39 117 respectively variation in extreme heavy precipitation 40 is much greater than variation in mean precipitation 10 in the nanshan scenic zone the increase in flash flood occurrence might be attributed to the increase in the total amount of extreme heavy precipitation peak tourist season in nanshan scenic zone largely coincides with the sharpest increase in total rainfall extreme heavy precipitation and flash flood occurrence in spring and autumn flood managers and stake holders in the nanshan scenic zone should invest more in adaptation and risk reduction measures such as building effective early warning systems and reduce tourist exposure to flash floods this framework can be used for impact assessment under climate change in other tourist attractions prone to flash floods given the large uncertainty range an ensemble of skillful climate models and a reliable rainfall threshold are highly recommended credit

rainfall threshold tourist attractions 1 introduction flash floods cause widespread fatalities and economic losses every year to improve understanding of past events predictions and early warnings and to reduce potential losses many countries around the world have invested in specific projects for flash floods such as hydrate in europe borga et al 2011 flash in the united states gourley et al 2017 and cffse in china yuan et al 2017 in the us from 1996 to 2017 approximately 75 000 flash flood events occurred ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 during 2007 2015 278 fatalities resulted from more than 28 000 flash food events gourley et al 2017 in china flash floods have been even more catastrophic more than 60 000 flash flood events with accurate spatial and temporal information have been reported since 1949 liu et al 2018 during 2000 2018 flash flood events claimed approximately 16 000 lives in china accounting for 74 of the total flood related fatalities ministry of water resources 2018 in an unequivocally warming climate water holding capacity of the air increases theoretically at a rate of approximately 7 c according to the clausius clapeyron c c relation zhang et al 2017 observations and model projections in some parts of the world for example the us china and australia have shown that extreme precipitation has a higher increasing rate than mean precipitation kunkel et al 2013 wu et al 2016 bao et al 2017 a scaling rate between extreme precipitation and daily mean temperature that is higher than the c c rate has been observed in large parts of china gao et al 2020 even worse for flash flood risk management extreme precipitation at sub daily scales is intensifying more rapidly than at the daily scale westra et al 2014 climate change is likely to have a significant impact on flash floods since they are mainly induced by short duration extreme precipitation prein et al 2017 assessment of flash flood hazard is the foundation of risk management various methods have been used to assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazard mainly through flood intensity and or frequency inundation depth and area flood volume and peak discharge are the main indices for flash flood intensity for example wang et al 2019 used hydrological and hydrodynamic models to reproduce a historic flash flood event induced by a 50 year rainfall event in the baiyangdian lake area bla china then a synthetic event induced by a future 50 year storm from general circulation models gcms projections under the representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 emission scenario was designed and the results suggested that the change in precipitation might greatly increase the flood volume inundation depth and area in the bla ryu and kim 2019 combined hydrological simulation and flood frequency analysis based on extreme value distribution and projected that climate change under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios may increase the maximum 3 day running total streamflow in boise river watershed in the united states in terms of assessing climate related change in flash flood frequency current literature can be classified into two categories studies in one category used the occurrence of extreme precipitation event as a proxy for flash flood occurrence kermanshah et al 2017 set the 95th percentile of daily precipitation as a threshold for triggering flash floods and found flash flood frequency is likely to increase during 2006 2100 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios compared to 1950 2005 modrick and georgakakos 2015 integrated outputs from a gcm two hydrological models and flash flood guidance ffg in southern california in the united states a flash flood event will occur if the projected precipitation at an aggregated time interval exceeds the ffg for the same interval flash flood occurrence in this region is projected to increase by 30 40 during 2070 2099 under the a1b scenario compared to 1970 1999 debortoli et al 2017 constructed a flash flood index for brazil by weighting extreme precipitation indices compared with 1961 1990 an overall increase in flash flood frequency is projected during 2071 2100 under rcp8 5 due to climate change although the change direction and magnitude vary for different regions and climate models studies in another category define flash floods occurrence in a more direct way a flash flood event will occur when streamflow of the event exceeds a threshold for example velasco et al 2013 used outputs from a regional climate model to drive a hydrological model and performed a peak over threshold analysis in two sub basins of the llobregat river basin spain during three future periods 2011 2040 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 under the a2 and b1 emission scenarios flash flood occurrence is projected to increase in one sub basin while decreasing in another compared to 1980 2008 flash floods are extremely dangerous because they rise and fall rapidly the average lag time of major flash flood events in europe is less than 5 h marchi et al 2010 the average duration of flash floods during 1996 2017 in the united states is shorter than 4 h ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 therefore climate variables at a finer temporal scale should be used to assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazard however relatively few studies have used sub daily climate variables mainly because most gcms or regional climate models rcms provide raw outputs at the daily scale nevertheless downscaling methods namely dynamical statistical and stochastic methods have been adopted in some studies in the climate change and hydrological fields peleg et al 2019 a weather generator is a relatively parsimonious stochastic method for downscaling daily outputs from climate models to sub daily scales fatichi et al 2011 developed an hourly downscaling weather generator and assessed changes in precipitation for firenze italy during two future periods 2046 2065 and 2081 2100 under the a1b scenario from 12 gcms with precipitation during 1962 1992 as a baseline fatichi et al 2013 sunyer et al 2015 used three change factor based methods including a weather generator to assess the change in hourly extreme precipitation during 2071 2100 from 13 rcms under the a1b scenario with respect to 1961 1990 in denmark camici et al 2014 generated hourly precipitation and temperature from 2 gcms under the a2 scenario using a weather generator for the upper tiber river basin in italy and assessed the flood frequency change between 2070 2099 and 1961 1990 through a hydrological model in recent years ultra high resolution gridded weather generators that can simulate precipitation at the minute scale have emerged and can be used to study climate change impacts on hydrological responses i e peleg et al 2017 singer et al 2018 tourist facilities around the world are particularly vulnerable to flash floods ipcc 2012 in the united states flash flood fatalities per fatal event in tourist related

flood triggered by torrential rainfall hit yesanpo a nature based tourist attraction near beijing leaving more than 15 000 tourists stranded overnight https www yeshanpo com news 721djy htm in november 2018 flash floods in jordan resulted in 11 fatalities and the evacuation of nearly 4 000 tourists morsy et al 2020 flash floods at chinese tourist attractions need special attention in the context of climate change not only because many chinese scenic spots are located in areas highly susceptible to flash floods but also because of a high concentration of tourists a typical example is hainan island which is a unique tropical tourist destination in china with a reputation as the oriental hawaii in 2010 hainan island attracted nearly 26 million tourists while hawaii received approximately 7 million world travel and tourism council 2012 the overarching aim of this study is to project precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence in the nanshan scenic zone of hainan island which includes two famous 5a tourist attractions and has approximately 6 million annual visitors a stochastic hourly weather generator and an empirical rainfall threshold for flash floods occurrence are used for this purpose historical hourly precipitation series 1991 2012 set a baseline future hourly precipitation series for 13 selected gcms and multi model means mme during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 under the rcp4 5 scenario are simulated by the downscaling weather generator with a change factor method an empirical threshold for cumulative event rainfall and rainfall duration e d for triggering flash floods are used to determine the number of flash flood events during historical and future periods changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change are projected by comparing the frequency of historical and future flash floods the modeling framework is presented in section 2 and the results for the nanshan scenic zone are in section 3 uncertainly analysis and implications are discussed in section 4 and the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 modeling procedure the schematic flowchart of the framework for projecting the changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change is shown in fig 1 the modeling procedure mainly includes 7 steps 1 calculate historical rainfall statistical properties and estimate historical hourly rainfall parameters of the weather generator using observed hourly precipitation data 2 select gcms calculate change factors for rainfall statistical properties from each gcm and mme and calculate future rainfall statistical properties 3 downscale future rainfall statistical properties to finer time scales and estimate future hourly rainfall parameters of the weather generator 4 simulate historical and future hourly precipitation series using the weather generator 5 partition historical and future hourly precipitation series into historical and future rainfall events 6 calculate historical and future flash flood occurrence by using a rainfall threshold to detect the number of rainfall events over the threshold 7 compare historical and future flash flood occurrence and project the changes under climate change 2 2 selection of gcms although many gcms are available from the recent phases of the coupled model intercomparison project such as cmip3 cmip5 including the nex gddp dataset and cmip6 selecting models to construct a multi model ensemble is essential for obtaining relatively reliable results and saving computational resources giri et al 2020 the selection of models is on the basis of three criteria availability of daily precipitation relative independence among different models and relatively good performance when simulating heavy precipitation fatichi et al 2011 projections of climate change impacts are presented as the mme with the range of models as a measure of uncertainty eyring et al 2019 however many gcms may share some parameterization schemes or components which will undermine the model independence assumption and result in a biased mme a simple and widely used solution to this problem is assuming climate models developed by different institutions are relatively independent and selecting only one model from each institution the third criterion aims to produce a more reliable multi model ensemble previous studies have demonstrated that different climate models have divergent performances when simulating precipitation in different parts of the world when simulating heavy precipitation which is relevant to flash floods there is evidence that some climate models outperform others for specific regions jiang et al 2015 li et al 2016 2 3 weather generator awe gen the advanced weather generator awe gen is a stochastic weather generator which can reproduce statistical properties of precipitation and simulate hourly precipitation series at the station scale ivanov et al 2007 fatichi et al 2011 a detailed description of awe gen can be found in fatichi et al 2011 and in the online technical reference http www personal umich edu ivanov hydrowit models html the attractive features of awe gen are its capability of simulating precipitation at the hourly scale and good performance when simulating heavy precipitation which are essential for flash floods briefly the precipitation component in awe gen is based on the neyman scott rectangular pulse method this method describes the origin time of a storm as a poission process uses a geometrical distribution to determine the number of cells in each storm and generates the time difference between each cell and the origin time of a storm from an exponential distribution for each precipitation cell there are two properties a life time described by another exponential distribution and a rainfall intensity described by a gamma distribution therefore the stochastic precipitation process at any temporal scale is fully defined by 6 parameters mean origin time of a storm λ 1 h mean time difference between each cell and the origin time of a storm β 1 h mean life time of a cell η 1 h mean number of cells in each storm μ c and shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution of rainfall intensity α and θ mm h 1 in the parameters fitting procedure eight statistical properties mean variance coefficient of variation lag 1 autocorrelation skewness non precipitation frequency transition probability of dry dry and transition probability of wet wet of the precipitation process at four time intervals 1 6 24 and 72 h are utilized to minimize the objective function applications of the weather generator in climate change fields are presented in fatichi et al 2011 fatichi et al 2013 caracciolo et al 2014 and yang et al 2020 the change factor method is used when estimating parameters of the weather generator for future hourly precipitation eq 1 this method only infers climate change signals from climate models since they represent the change in the statistical properties of precipitation better than does the amount of precipitation anandhi et al 2011 sunyer et al 2015 this is a widely used method because use change factors derived from simulated precipitation of gcms during historical and future periods can avoid the prevalent mismatch between simulated precipitation from gcms and observed precipitation during the historical period e g caracciolo et al 2014 peres and cancelliere 2018 change factors for statistical properties the ratio of s h gcm fut to s h gcm his are derived from daily precipitation simulated by each gcm and the mme change factors can be calculated the statistical properties of future precipitation are obtained by multiplying change factors by s h obs change factors are only calculated for a limited number of dominant statistical properties for instance proper relationships for change factors of lag 1 autocorrelation are lacking and the simulation results of the weather generator are less sensitive to this statistic thus lag 1 autocorrelation is set as time invariant fatichi et al 2011 1 s h fut s h obs s h gcm f u t s h gcm h i s where s h fut is the statistical properties of future precipitation s h obs is the statistical properties of observed historical precipitation s h gcm fut and s h gcm his are the statistical properties of the simulated historical and future precipitation from a gcm respectively since the temporal resolution of gcms precipitation is daily statistical properties at coarse aggregation scales h 24 h are extended to finer scales 1 h and 6 h the temporal downscaling methods are presented in fatichi et al 2011 briefly this method assumes empirical functional relationships exist between statistical properties at a time interval and the length of the time interval parameters of these empirical functions are fitted with statistical properties at coarse aggregation scales h 24 h downscaling procedure for rainfall variance in this study is slightly different from the procedure described in fatichi et al 2011 a power law scaling instead of the analytical form in marani 2003 is used for downscaling the variance because the power law scaling has similar performance to the recommended analytical form at the required time scales 1 h and 6 h and the fitting procedure is easier once statistical properties are obtained for future precipitation at 1 6 24 and 72 h the weather generator parameters of the hourly precipitation can be estimated then historical and future hourly precipitation series can be simulated 2 4 rainfall events partitioning and rainfall thresholds using the definition in melillo et al 2015 as a reference a rainfall event in this study is a period of continuous wet hours or a chronological ensemble of several periods of continuous wet hours sub events separated from any preceding and following rainfall events by dry periods therefore wet hours and dry periods are two parameters for the definition of a rainfall event the power law rainfall threshold between the amount of rainfall or rainfall intensity in a rainfall event and the duration often referred to as e d or i d thresholds is an empirical tool widely used for hydrometeorological and hydrogeological hazards early warnings maréchal et al 2008 proposed e d thresholds for a karst region in southeastern france by analyzing past flash flood events melillo et al 2018 developed an algorithm to identify rainfall events related to landslides occurrence and established e d thresholds for the liguria region italy lin et al 2020 used an e d threshold to study the impact of climate change on landslide occurrence in china the power law eq 2 is also used in this study to represent the rainfall threshold for flash flood occurrence 2 e a d b where e mm is the cumulative event rainfall d hour is the rainfall duration and a and b are scaling and slope parameters respectively the number of events over the threshold is used as a proxy for flash flood occurrence if the cumulative event rainfall and rainfall duration of a rainfall event or a sub event of a rainfall event are on or above the e d threshold a flash flood event is considered to occur in projecting the precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence the rainfall threshold for trigging flash floods is assumed to be time invariant 3 case study 3 1 study area and data the projection framework is applied to the nanshan scenic zone in sanya city on hainan island fig 2 sanya city 18 09 18 38 n 108 56 109 49 e is the southernmost city in china located in the pan pearl river delta along the south china sea it has a tropical marine monsoon climate with annual average precipitation of approximately 1500 mm and annual average temperature of approximately 26 c 1991 2012 sanya city has distinct dry and wet seasons precipitation in the rainy season may october accounts for 87 of the total precipitation annually three neighboring stations baoting lingshui and wuzhishan show similar temporal patterns to sanya station although with greater monthly precipitation fig 2 the unique tropical seaside city is one of the most popular tourist destinations in china li et al 2015 in 2018 sanya city attracted approximately 21 million overnight visitors however part of the peak tourist season september april coincides with the autumn flood season sanya city is prone to flash floods because rivers and streams originating from steep northern mountains flow into the sea at this city according to the results from the cffse project during 2000 2015 18 major flash flood events occurred causing 15 recorded deaths and more than 700 million yuan approximately 100 million u s dollar in direct economic losses personal communication with rihong luo the nanshan scenic zone is the most popular place in sanya city or even on hainan island it comprises two famous 5a tourist attractions and supporting facilities and received approximately 6 million domestic and international tourists in 2018 the nearest meteorological station around the nanshan scenic zone is sanya station the hourly precipitation series spans from 1991 to 2012 at this station was provided by china meteorological administration for use in this study daily precipitation data simulated by gcms are from the nex gddp dataset https www nccs nasa gov services data collections land based products nex gddp the nex gddp dataset is generated by bias correcting and spatially downscaling the cmip5 outputs thrasher et al 2012 it includes 21 gcms under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios the historical period is 1950 2005 and the future period for most gcms is 2006 2100 for 2 gcms it is 2006 2099 and for 1 gcm it is 2006 2095 compared with cmip5 outputs which have a horizontal resolution of no less than 0 5 0 5 approximately 50 km the nex gddp dataset has a relatively high resolution of 0 25 0 25 previous studies have found that the nex gddp dataset has better performances than the raw outputs from cmip5 when simulating extreme precipitation chen et al 2017 not surprisingly some climate models are more skillful in simulating extreme precipitation in china li et al 2016 based on the model selection criteria presented in section 2 2 13 gcms in nex gddp are selected namely access1 0 bcc csm1 1 bnu esm canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2g inmcm4 ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 mpi esm lr mri cgcm3 and noresm1 m fatichi et al 2011 found that change factors or climate change signals from a gcm are insensitive to the location of the grid cell in a specific region i e change factors for neighboring cells in a gcm are very similar following previous studies this study used precipitation simulated by gcms at the grid cell that contained the tourist attraction fatichi et al 2011 2013 ciabatta et al 2016 the historical baseline period in this study is 1991 2012 and the near and far future periods are 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively the rcp4 5 emission scenario is investigated since it matches present emission control measures 3 2 rainfall thresholds in china typical rainfall thresholds for flash flood occurrence are empirical e d thresholds developed by the local flood management agency these rainfall thresholds are represented as discrete points instead of continuous formulas luo et al 2018 analyzed major flash floods that caused severe consequences in sanya city during 2000 2015 and determined the critical cumulative rainfall at 1 3 6 12 and 24 h for triggering flash floods as shown in fig 3 the power law threshold in eq 2 is fitted based on these points the upper and lower thresholds are determined by parameters of the 95 confidence intervals although the uncertainty is relatively high the fitting is acceptable with a r 2 of 0 98 and a p value of 0 001 3 3 historical flash flood occurrence since the weather generator simulates precipitation series stochastically following ciabatta et al 2016 an ensemble of 10 statistically equivalent hourly series are simulated by the weather generator for the historical period 1991 2012 wet hours are defined as hours with no less than 0 1 mm precipitation and the dry period threshold is set at 6 h rainfall events are partitioned for 10 simulated hourly precipitation series and the observed series then flash flood occurrence are calculated for these 11 precipitation series there are 37 flash flood events according to the observed precipitation during 1991 2012 through a field investigation of cffse project in 2015 aiming to understand past major flash flood events 16 flash flood events during 1991 2012 are identified around the nanshan scenic zone many flash flood events occurred in this region during this period but only these 16 recorded events caused fatalities or direct economic losses greater than 30 000 yuan approximately 4285 u s dollars the fitted e d threshold successfully identifies 14 major flash flood events accounting for 87 5 of the aforementioned 16 major events the false alarm rate cannot be estimated since an exhaustive inventory including flash flood events with minor or no losses is not available nevertheless the performance of the fitted rainfall threshold is acceptable and can be used in further analysis the mean number of flash flood events during 1991 2012 from the 10 simulated precipitation series is 39 7 the simulated mean annual number of flash flood events 1 8 is similar to the observed number 1 7 if the upper and lower rainfall thresholds are considered the simulated figures are 0 5 and 4 6 while those of the observed figures are 0 8 and 4 3 the high uncertainty underlines the importance of a reliable rainfall threshold to further assess the simulation performance of the weather generator the number of flash flood events total rainfall and two extreme precipitation indices table 1 at the monthly scale are shown in fig 4 comparing the observed data with the mean simulation of the weather generator in fig 4 the overall seasonal distribution of flash flood events is simulated well with summer june july and august having the most events followed by autumn september october and november and spring march april and may no flash flood occurred in winter december january and february in autumn the number of flash flood events is overestimated in september and underestimated in october the simulation bias in autumn can be attributed to the unique rainfall regime of sanya city where the interannual variability of the monthly rainfall is very large and peaks in september october the peak interannual variability in september october can be attributed to the sea surface temperature anomaly tropical cyclones and intraseasonal oscillations feng et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 the mean monthly rainfall is peaked in september but there are more intense and short duration extreme rainfall in october as is reflected by the highest observed h95 and ph95 for simulation performance of the rainfall indices the monthly rainfall is simulated very well the h95 and ph95 are overestimated slightly before september and underestimated slightly after that notwithstanding these small biases the overall trends of the two extreme heavy precipitation indices at the seasonal and monthly scales are well captured 3 4 projection of changes in flash flood occurrence at the annual scale the trends of climate change are represented by change factors of rainfall properties change factors from each gcm are calculated with the methodology presented in section 2 3 and the mme change factors are generated by averaging them with equal weights hourly rainfall parameters for each gcm and the mme are then estimated an ensemble of 10 hourly precipitation series are simulated by the weather generator for each gcm and the mme in near 2020 2049 and far 2070 2099 future periods the results from the mme series can be regarded as the most likely future scenario although novel and more sophisticated methods for generating mean values from a multi model ensemble exist such as bayesian weighted averaging and reliability ensemble averaging fatichi et al 2013 found that the mean climate change signals from bayesian weighted averaging and simple averaging are very similar the mean number of flash flood events simulated by the weather generator during the historical period 1991 2012 is set as a baseline the mean simulated number of events is used instead of the observed number to reduce uncertainties caused by the stochastic weather generator under the rcp4 5 scenario the projected mean annual number of flash flood events in future periods and mean annual variations or relative changes with respect to the baseline are shown in table 2 these projections vary significantly for different future periods climate models and rainfall thresholds the different climate models and rainfall thresholds are the two biggest uncertainty sources and thus the use of an ensemble of the most skillful climate models and the most reliable rainfall threshold are highly recommended using the fitted rainfall threshold the mme annual number of flash flood events are projected to be 3 1 and 3 2 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively and thus the variations compared to 1991 2012 are 72 and 78 respectively the mme results indicate that mean annual flash flood occurrence in the near and far future are likely to be similar individual climate models present high uncertainty for projections for 2020 2049 the mean annual number of flash flood events is projected to vary from 2 2 miroc5 to 3 8 canesm2 with variations between 22 and 111 for 2070 2099 the number is projected to vary from 2 5 bcc csm1 1 to 3 9 inmcm4 and ipsl cm5a lr with variations between 39 and 117 the relative changes are more staggering 60 260 and 80 300 for the near and far future respectively when the upper rainfall threshold is used and less pronounced 11 48 and 20 63 for the near and far future respectively when the lower threshold is used although high uncertainties exist there is a consensus among different gcms that flash flood occurrence is projected to increase significantly in both the near and far future in the nanshan scenic zone therefore adaptation and flash flood disaster risk reduction measures are urgently needed 3 5 projection of changes in flash flood occurrence at the monthly scale monthly distribution of variations in total rainfall h95 and ph95 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 are shown in fig 5 the monthly fluctuations are pronounced in both future periods the far future period is likely to have more and heavier precipitation than the near future period the mme projections for two future periods are analyzed in detail total rainfall at the monthly scale is projected to increase by more than 30 during 2020 2049 and by more than 37 during 2070 2099 during 2020 2049 the variation in total rainfall peaks in spring followed by autumn and there are four months with variation in total rainfall more than 50 i e april 59 march 58 january 55 and september 52 during 2070 2099 the largest variation in total rainfall is in autumn and the second largest is in spring and there are seven months with variation in total rainfall no less than 50 i e november 89 april 82 december 67 july 62 september 54 february 50 and may 50 in terms of the variation in extreme heavy precipitation the staggering numbers in january and december can be attributed to near zero baselines in addition the variation in the number of flash flood events at the monthly scale fig 6 indicates that flash floods are still unlikely to occur in future winters therefore winter is excluded from the following analysis autumn and spring have the largest variations in h95 and ph95 overall the variations in all seasons during 2070 2099 are greater than those during 2020 2049 the variations in h95 and ph95 for in summer are is relatively modest in the near 12 15 and 6 27 respectively and far 13 27 and 14 47 respectively future periods the monthly distribution of variation in flash flood occurrence is presented in fig 6 the temporal distribution and magnitude of the variation vary significantly among the different climate models and different future periods here we only focus on the mme results since they may give insights into a most likely future scenario the mme projections show the highest uncertainty in march april and november during both future periods there are still no flash floods in future winters during 2020 2049 the median variation is over 50 in march 214 november 206 april 96 october 94 august 76 and july 62 during 2070 2099 there are also six months with variations over 50 november 358 april 193 march 110 october 108 july 100 and june 64 among the three rainfall indices shown in fig 5 the variation in the ph95 is most closely related to the median variation in the number of flash flood event in both future periods the correlation coefficients between the two variations are 0 88 during 2020 2049 and 0 94 during 2070 2099 in other words the increase in future flash flood events might be attributed to the increase in the total amount of extreme heavy precipitation 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis in this study the impact of climate change on flash flood occurrence is investigated through precipitation changes different gcms and the use of time invariant rainfall threshold are two main sources of uncertainty in the case study of the nanshan scenic zone although the projections of all 13 selected gcms show a unanimous increase for flash flood occurrence at both annual and seasonal scale except during winter the magnitude of change varies significantly for example using the fitted rainfall threshold the range of the mean annual number of future flash flood events 1 6 for 2020 2049 and 1 4 for 2070 2099 is nearly equal to the mean annual historical flash flood occurrence the large spread of the projections resulting from the different gcms underlines the importance of constructing an ensemble of skillful models kwon et al 2019 the mme projection from such an ensemble might give us insights into a most likely future scenario the mme results under the rcp4 5 scenario suggested that annual mean precipitation and annual extreme precipitation are projected to increase by 6 and 34 during 2020 2049 respectively the percentages of increase for 2070 2099 are 10 and 42 these projections are largely consistent with previous studies zhou et al 2014 showed that annual total precipitation in wet days precipitation 1 mm is likely to increase by 5 10 under rcp4 5 during the late 21st century in sanya city guo et al 2017 simulated future precipitation changes through multiple rcms with a horizontal resolution of 25 km the projected annual precipitation change in sanya city are approximately 5 mm d in 2020s and approximately 9 mm d in 2080s zhou et al 2014 projected that annual total precipitation when the daily precipitation exceeds the 95th percentile of the wet day precipitation is likely to increase by 20 30 under rcp4 5 during the late 21st century the discrepancy between the relative increase for extreme precipitation in this study and the results of zhou et al 2014 might be due to different definitions and temporal scales hourly vs daily nevertheless both studies showed that the relative increase in extreme precipitation is much larger than the mean precipitation implying a potential increase in the flash flood risk further studies can compare the results of this study with the results from an ensemble of rcms when more models from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment or other convective permitting initiatives are available the stationary assumption of the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods is another main source of uncertainty storm surface runoff dominating flash floods mainly has two generation mechanisms infiltration excess or saturation excess yin et al 2018 in addition to the intensity and duration of precipitation land use cover lulc vegetation and antecedent soil moisture are also influencing factors for example the lulc change caused by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization will increase the impervious surfaces and decrease the infiltration rate and thus less precipitation is required to trigger flash floods however increases in temperature may result in higher evapotranspiration and more abundant vegetation reducing antecedent soil moisture and thus more precipitation is required to generate critical surface runoff gariano and guzzetti 2016 despite many factors influencing fast runoff precipitation has been reported to be the dominant factor in long term analysis and this dominant effect is more significant with increasing flood magnitude yin et al 2018 liu et al 2018 used a geo detector method to investigate the driving factors of flash flood events during 2000 2015 in china and found that precipitation is more closely related to flash flood occurrence than human activities dosdogrua et al 2020 assessed the potential impacts of climate change and lulc change on streamflow in a rapidly urbanizing watershed in alabama usa precipitation and temperature outputs from 11 gcms under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios during 2050s and a projected future lulc dataset were used to drive the soil and water assessment tool the results showed that precipitation change is projected to be the main driver of increase in maximum monthly streamflow li et al 2020 found the contribution of precipitation change 90 2 is much larger than that of human activities 9 8 in changing flood susceptibility in guangdong province a major province in the pearl river basin bennett et al 2018 investigated the effect of antecedent soil moisture with antecedent precipitation as a proxy on flood volume in 100 australian catchments and their results revealed that the elasticity of flow to causative precipitation is between 2 7 and 3 6 times the elasticity of flow to antecedent precipitation in the late 21st century the annual mean temperature might increase 1 5 c 2 c under rcp4 5 and 3 6 c 5 c under rcp8 5 in sanya city zhou et al 2014 to minimize the impact of increasing temperature on vegetation and antecedent soil moisture the rcp4 5 rather than the rcp8 5 emission scenario is investigated in this study therefore although the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods may change slightly in the future its impact on change in flash flood occurrence might be insignificant compared to the impact of precipitation change however the interaction between different factors in hydrological processes is quite complex for example in snowmelt dominated mountainous basins the impact of changes in vegetation and soil may offset or even reverse the impact of climate change on annual runoff rasouli et al 2019 since the nanshan scenic zone is snow free and we only focus on flash floods the results of this study can provide some scientific insights into the future even if the rainfall threshold for triggering flash floods in sanya city change significantly in the future we may roughly estimate the combined impact of climate change and rainfall threshold change if less precipitation is required to trigger flash floods we can assume the lower 95 threshold in section 3 3 as the future threshold and the mean annual number of flash flood events might increase by 239 and 261 for 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively if more precipitation is required and the upper 95 threshold is assumed to be the future threshold mean annual number of flash flood events might decrease by 33 and 28 respectively further studies will consider antecedent soil conditions to produce more sophisticated results 4 2 implications the peak tourist season in the nanshan scenic zone is roughly september through april when the temperature is mild and pleasant unfortunately according to our projections for the future most of the peak season coincides with the sharpest increase in total rainfall extreme heavy precipitation and flash flood occurrence in spring and autumn flash flood risk is likely to increase in spring and autumn since the increasing flash flood hazard and the high flow of tourists might result in more exposures in the short term to reduce flash flood risk and ensure the safety of tourists local flood managers and the tourism management agency should work more closely in summer and autumn especially in autumn in 2012 sanya meteorological bureau and sanya tourism administration signed an agreement to promote early warning services for tourism sectors according to this agreement tour guides managers of travelling agencies and hotels and administrators of tourist attractions were added into the database of the early warning system so they could receive text messages when early warnings were issued sanya city 2013 however general tourists could only receive early warnings through tour guides or managers in mid may of 2020 ministry of water resources in china made a joint effort with 3 major telecommunications network operators to expand the coverage of the flash flood early warning systems in the foreseeable future all people including tourists will receive text messages directly if early warnings for flash floods are issued in their region building such flash flood early warning systems that are available to the general public will have a promising effect on reducing tourist exposure to flash floods in the long term adaptation and disaster reduction measures are needed to negate the impact of climate change in the nanshan scenic zone as mentioned above the annual mean temperature might increase 1 5 c 2 c or 3 6 c 5 c at the late 21st century in sanya city depending on the emission scenarios zhou et al 2014 along the coastal south china sea extreme precipitation has been increasing at a very high c c rate over 20 c mainly because the ocean has sufficient capacity to supply the water vapor yin et al 2018 dong et al 2019 to reduce the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes and the ensuing flash floods or at least to maintain the status quo emission reduction measures are urgently needed in addition in the recent decade the number of annual visitors to the nanshan scenic zone has been increasing at a rate of approximately 10 it is reasonable to predict that more tourism facilities will be built around the tourist attraction to accommodate these visitors to reduce flash flood risk it is prudent for local flood managers and stake holders to complete thorough assessments to identify areas highly susceptible to flash floods and ensure that future construction projects adhere to non stationary flood defense standards in these areas the results of this study can also provide insights regarding future flash flood hazards in other tourist attractions in neighboring regions on hainan island since the precipitation regimes in these regions are quite similar the hydrometeorological impacts of climate change vary in direction and magnitude in different regions of the world tourist attractions around the world that are prone to flash floods should also assess the impact of climate change on flash flood hazards plan short term emergency response strategies and adopt long term risk reduction measures 5 conclusion this study presents a framework to project precipitation driven changes in flash flood occurrence under climate change a stochastic downscaling weather generator is applied for simulating hourly precipitation and an empirical rainfall threshold is used to detect flash flood events the framework is applied to the nanshan scenic zone in china which has 6 million annual visitors and is vulnerable to flash floods the results based on an ensemble of 13 gcms under the rcp4 5 emission scenario project a significant increase in flash flood occurrence compared to 1991 2012 the annual flash flood occurrence in nanshan scenic zone is projected to increase by 72 and 78 during 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 respectively the uncertainty ranges from the different gcms for the near and far future periods are 22 111 and 39 117 respectively variation in extreme heavy precipitation 40 is much greater than variation in mean precipitation 10 in the nanshan scenic zone the increase in flash flood occurrence might be attributed to the increase in the total amount of extreme heavy precipitation peak tourist season in nanshan scenic zone largely coincides with the sharpest increase in total rainfall extreme heavy precipitation and flash flood occurrence in spring and autumn flood managers and stake holders in the nanshan scenic zone should invest more in adaptation and risk reduction measures such as building effective early warning systems and reduce tourist exposure to flash floods this framework can be used for impact assessment under climate change in other tourist attractions prone to flash floods given the large uncertainty range an ensemble of skillful climate models and a reliable rainfall threshold are highly recommended credit

4813,real time streamflow modeling is a challenging endeavor in regions where real time ground based hydro meteorological observations are scarce nevertheless with the emergence of satellite remote sensing some of the essential hydro meteorological datasets such as rainfall and soil moisture are available in near real time which can circumvent the problem in such scenario machine learning ml approaches can be used to model streamflow even with limited real time data in view of this the effectiveness of integrating satellite based near real time rainfall i e tropical rainfall measuring mission based 3b42rt v7 and advance scatterometer ascat based soil moisture observations through support vector machine svm for simulating streamflow in a poorly gauged catchment in india has been investigated results show that 3b42rt forced streamflow performed poorly compared to streamflow simulated using the observed gridded rainfall this inferior performance is mainly attributed to errors in 3b42rt rainfall product hence a recently developed svm based error reduction model using ascat soil moisture data is used to correct 3b42rt the obtained corrected satellite rainfall outperformed 3b42rt in streamflow simulations but still it is affected by notable errors to further improve the streamflow estimates ascat soil moisture is used as a predictor variable along with 3b42rt and the corrected satellite rainfall separately into svm based streamflow modelling results indicate that this integration considerably improves the streamflow estimates with respect to the use of 3b42rt and corrected satellite rainfall individually this is attributed to the crucial role of antecedent soil moisture for streamflow generation among all the tested scenarios streamflow derived by the integration of soil moisture and corrected satellite rainfall showed the highest performance hence it can be said that the proposed approach has considerable potential to model real time streamflow in the chosen poorly gauged catchment and possibly beyond however the approach needs detailed evaluation before applying in other such catchments keywords ascat machine learning support vector machine

one of the most common and deadly natural disasters causing thousands of casualties and destruction every year across the world ciabatta et al 2016 a reliable non structural measure to reduce the adverse impacts of floods is to develop efficient early warning systems camici et al 2018 real time rt streamflow monitoring is the cornerstone of a successful early warning system shah and mishra 2016 however the requisite observed streamflow data or the hydrometeorological data are typically inaccessible unavailable in rt particularly in developing nations nanda et al 2016 in recent years some critical hydrometeorological variables have become available through satellite based earth observations on a global scale in near rt nrt at high spatial and temporal resolutions thereby making rt streamflow modelling feasible in ungauged catchments among these space based variables satellite based rainfall estimates sres has been extensively used in streamflow modeling through different hydrological models belabid et al 2019 bitew et al 2012 su et al 2008 tang et al 2019 however the use of sres has shown poor results in streamflow simulations when compared to simulations carried out with ground based rainfall estimates camici et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 kneis et al 2014 this is mainly because of the presence of the errors in sres when compared to in situ rainfall observations errors in sres and their propagation to streamflow simulations have led various researchers to correct such estimates before using them for hydrological applications goshime et al 2019 2020 gumindoga et al 2020 harris et al 2007 shah and mishra 2016 shrestha et al 2011 several error correction methods are used to improve the sres such as the power transformation method distribution transformation method gumindoga et al 2019 mean correction factor method shah and mishra 2016 quantile mapping ringard et al 2017 and bayesian approach tian et al 2010 however these approaches are associated with various limitations details of the limitations are available in ajaaj et al 2016 ringard et al 2017 and gumindoga et al 2019 recently some studies have used satellite based soil moisture to correct satellite based nrt rainfall products and obtained more accurate rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 2011 brocca et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 pellarin et al 2020 these methods seem to be more promising than the traditional methods however their effectiveness in hydrological modelling needs elaborate testing for streamflow modeling various classes of models exist in the literature they span from simple empirical approaches to complex physics based hydrological models rajurkar et al 2004 each model is associated with certain advantages as well as limitations due to the complexity in physical models and large data requirements their application for operational purposes is limited on the other hand machine learning ml based models can perform well with limited datasets goyal et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 and thus can be suitable to model streamflow in data scarce catchments ml has been used extensively all across the globe for streamflow flood prediction aqil et al 2007 kumar et al 2005 2020 malik et al 2020b maheswaran and khosa 2013 sehgal et al 2014 tiwari et al 2013 tongal and booij 2018 yadav et al 2016 ml techniques performed well not only for streamflow forecasting but also in various non linear and complex applications such as solar radiation prediction prasad et al 2019 2020 wave height forecasting ali and prasad 2019 kaloop et al 2020 drought prediction forecasting ali et al 2019 dikshit et al 2020 khan et al 2020 malik et al 2020a rainfall forecasting abbot and marohasy 2014 ali et al 2018 2020a lin et al 2009 yu et al 2017 evapotranspiration evaporation estimation malik et al 2019b roy et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 which justifies the robustness of ml approach in various field also ml models are computationally fast and reliable which makes them very suitable for rt applications such as flood landslide forecasting akhtar et al 2009 as mentioned above several authors have carried out streamflow simulations using various ml techniques however most of the studies have considered ground gauge based rainfall streamflow data or both as the predictors input unfortunately these input datasets are typically unavailable in rt especially in developing countries hence operational systems cannot be established with these datasets recently some authors have used sres in streamflow simulations as inputs to ml approaches akhtar et al 2009 nanda et al 2016 in particular akhtar et al 2009 modeled the streamflow by considering a sres along with the observed streamflow and obtained reliable results over the ganges river basin nanda et al 2016 proposed a wavelet based ml approach to model real time streamflow using sres and found encouraging results however they estimated the antecedent moisture condition empirically by considering five days of accumulated rainfall they used it as an input along with sres to obtain rt streamflow they also pointed out that accumulated rainfall which is a proxy of antecedent moisture conditions is a key variable to model streamflow moreover it is well known that antecedent soil moisture conditions are fundamental for runoff generation tayfur et al 2014 tayfur and brocca 2015 recently global scale rt soil moisture datasets have become available with reasonable spatial and temporal resolution through remote sensing which can be used for rt streamflow modelling purposes conjunctively with sres to best of the authors knowledge to date no study has used satellite based nrt soil moisture and rainfall data for streamflow modeling within a ml framework this study aims to address the following research objectives 1 to assess the potential of sres to model streamflow through a ml approach as very limited studies are available where ml in conjunction with nrt sres have been used for this purpose 2 to assess the capability of soil moisture based error reduction method to correct the sres for streamflow modelling 3 to assess the effectiveness of integrating satellite based nrt soil moisture and rainfall for generating streamflow simulations through a ml technique the proposed objectives are addressed using tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 based nrt rainfall product 3b42rt and the advanced scatterometer ascat based soil moisture wagner et al 2013 within a ml framework i e support vector machine based regression model svm vapnik et al 1997 svm is used in the present study due to its improved generalization capability compared with other ml approaches wu et al 2008 yoon et al 2011 zakaria and shabri 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site the ashti catchment india a part of the godavari river basin is chosen as the test site for this study the catchment s geographical location is shown in fig 1 the spatial extent of the catchment lies between 78 0 to 81 0 east longitude and 19 30 to 22 50 north latitude covering an area of about 50 000 km2 the basin receives rainfall mostly during the monsoon season mid june to mid october and hence only the monsoon season is considered for the study average monsoonal rainfall and streamflow of the catchment are 1532 mm and 2350 m3 s respectively for the period 2012 2015 this catchment has no substantial flow control structures in contrast to most other highly regulated indian catchments the ashti catchment is part of india s tropical climate region and its land use is dominated by forest and agriculture das and nanduri 2018 the ashti catchment is a suitable test site for this study because of its complex terrain its significant spatially variable rainfall and its vulnerability to heavy flooding 2 2 datasets the datasets include rainfall soil moisture and streamflow data the monsoon months of 2012 to 2015 are chosen for this study the time period is constrained by the availability of i a consistent data record for the advanced scatterometer ascat based nrt soil moisture product starting in august 2011 and ii ground based rainfall and streamflow observations up to 2015 in the present study the monsoon of 2013 15 is considered for training and the monsoon of 2012 for testing as the statistical characteristics of streamflow during both the periods match closely details of the statistical properties are shown in table 1 2 2 1 rainfall the observed rainfall data is obtained from the gridded daily dataset provided by the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 which is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 and is suitable for large catchment studies this imd dataset is prepared by considering measurements of rainfall from reasonably well spread rain gauge stations over the indian land region followed by stringent quality control a number of researchers bharti and singh 2015 khan et al 2019 patil and ramsankaran 2017 prakash et al 2018 upadhyaya and ramsankaran 2016 2018 have used this gridded rainfall data to predict streamflow as well as for other hydro meteorological applications it is one of the most reliable and government certified products for hydrometeorological applications over the indian region the tmpa based nrt sre namely 3b42rt version 7 hereafter referred to as 3b42rt is used in this study it is available at 0 25 x 0 25 spatial resolution with 3 hour temporal resolution the availability of the 3b42rt in nrt within 6 9 h from the observation to the end users makes it suitable for real time streamflow modeling 3b42rt is a multi satellite rainfall product derived using geostationary infrared data and low earth orbiting microwave mw observations huffman et al 2007 from various satellites in this algorithm available passive mw and ir estimates are combined by calibrating ir measurements however mw estimates are taken preferentially and the remaining empty grids are filled with ir estimates upadhyaya and ramsankaran 2016 more details of the 3b42rt are available in huffman et al 2007 among the nrt satellite based rainfall products 3b42rt has been used extensively across the world in the current and past decades and is well evaluated across the world bitew and gebremichael 2011 chen et al 2013 moazami et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 furthermore 3b42rt has performed relatively better compared to other contemporary rt satellite based rainfall products mei et al 2014 pipunic et al 2015 it should be noted that imd provides only daily observed rainfall at 0300 utc hence daily rainfall of 3b42rt is estimated from its 3 h data accumulated at 0300 utc for the sake of consistency in the analysis 2 2 2 soil moisture ascat satellite based soil moisture products h101 metop a and h16 metop b is used in the present study ascat based products are available in nrt after 130 min of sensing which is an essential requirement for proposed rt streamflow modeling these satellite based soil moisture products are distributed by the eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf also this product is utilized in various regions across the globe and has provided reliable results wanders et al 2015 massari et al 2015 these estimates are obtained using a backscatter coefficient measured by metop a and metop b satellites through a change detection method this statistical method is developed at the remote sensing research group department for geodesy and geoinformation vienna university of technology saf 2016 this product is available at a native spatial sampling of 0 125 however it is resampled to 0 25 to match the spatial resolution of imd gridded rainfall for the sake of homogeneity it should be noted that the imd accumulates daily rainfall at 3 00 utc and hence the ascat s morning pass datasets are generally used for this study however some temporal discontinuities are available in morning pass ascat dataset which are filled primarily using the ascat s evening pass dataset on some days 15 per cent on average when ascat data was not available during both the passes values are filled with the nearest data available on the previous day as done by kumar et al 2019 2 2 3 streamflow daily streamflow data of ashti gauging site is downloaded from india s water resources information system iwris website iwris provides a single window solution for various water resources data and information in a standardized national geographic information system framework 2 3 design of experiments the overall framework of this study is shown in fig 2 there are two main components in this analysis the first component component a deals with the improvement of the 3b42rt product by integrating it with the ascat based soil moisture in an svm based ml technique the 3b42rt and the ascat based soil moisture are used as predictor variables while the observed gridded imd rainfall is taken as the predictand variable to the svm based error reduction model setup through the first component the corrected satellite rainfall csr is obtained details about the model setup of component a are available in kumar et al 2019 the second component component b deals with the different scenarios of streamflow simulations forced by various set of inputs to the svm based streamflow model as shown in fig 2 based on the different inputs used five scenarios of streamflow simulations are obtained viz i imd forced streamflow qimd ii 3b42rt forced streamflow qsr iii csr forced streamflow qcsr iv 3b42rt ascat forced streamflow qsr sm v csr ascat forced streamflow qcsr sm finally the simulated streamflows are compared with the observed data to select the best performing model it is to be noted that all the input datasets for streamflow simulation i e the imd the 3b42rt the csr and soil moisture are averaged across the catchment each day before streamflow simulations as the spatial heterogeneity of the inputs during simulation is assumed negligible in the present study lumped configuration a long time series is always required to obtain a better model prediction however to test the proposed approach shown in fig 2 data of four monsoon seasons have been used due to unavailability of consistent long term soil moisture and streamflow data in addition the spatial resolution of the satellite based inputs observed rainfall is coarse and hence the proposed approach may not be suitable at small catchment scale although the satellite based 3b42rt is available at 3 hourly temporal resolution the model development is carried out on a daily scale and not on sub daily scale as the imd rainfall and the observed streamflow data are available on a daily basis the subsequent sections present an overview of the svm model and describe the steps involved in constructing svm models to obtain streamflow estimates in this study followed by a description of the performance measures used to assess the results 2 4 svm model the svm model is one of the leading techniques for classification as well as regression problems widely applied in various fields in recent decades al shammari et al 2016 ch et al 2014 henrique et al 2018 olatomiwa et al 2015 in the present study the svm is considered due to its wide application in streamflow simulation with efficient performance behzad et al 2010 bozorg haddad et al 2018 one of the major reasons for its wider application is its capability to efficiently handle non linearity and non stationarity van et al 2020 moreover its generalization capability further adds to its importance svm models have been extensively used in hydrological problems ahmad et al 2010 karran et al 2014 yu et al 2006 the mathematical description of the svm is presented below the svm model provides a solution to a regression problem with the multiple inputs x i and a target output y i where i 1 2 3 n n represents the number of observations of inputs and an output the svm equation can be represented as 1 y estimated f x w ϕ x b where w and b are the parameter vectors of the function ϕ x denotes the nonlinear transformation function optimal values of the parameters are estimated by solving the following optimisation problem 2 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 such t h a t y i estimated y i ε ξ i y i y i estimated ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 n where c is a user defined penalty constant which represents the amount of trade off between dispersion of weights and the objective function ξ i and ξ i are positive slack variables that measure the training errors above and below an ε tube this problem is solved in dual space by using lagrange multipliers α i and α i finally the regression model becomes 1 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j b where k xi xj is a kernel function which describes the inner product in d dimensional feature space xi and xj ε x 2 5 steps involved in construction of the svm based streamflow model the construction of svm based streamflow models involves mainly five steps 1 input selection for the svm model 2 partition of dataset 3 scaling of the dataset 4 selection of a kernel function for the svm 5 estimation of optimum value of the hyperparameters associated with svm model description of each of these steps is given in the following sub sections 2 5 1 input selection for svm based streamflow simulation selection of appropriate input variables is an essential requirement for a successful ml based approach amaranto et al 2018 kumar et al 2005 determining the input variables in ml based streamflow model involves finding the rainfall s lag that has a significant influence on the predictand i e streamflow in this study the number of lag days of rainfall is identified by cross correlation analysis this method has been used extensively in ml based streamflow models nanda et al 2016 tiwari and chatterjee 2011 the cross correlation analysis reveals that rainfall imd 3b42rt and csr is well correlated with streamflow up to a delay of three days the lagged rainfall up to the third day is considered in the present study subsequently the fourth day s lagged soil moisture has been selected as the antecedent soil moisture condition for streamflow simulations there are five scenarios for streamflow estimation i e qimd qsr qcsr qsm sr qcsr sm the input and the obtained output variables associated with these scenarios are provided in table 2 moreover a statistical indicator i e variance influence factor vif craney and surles 2002 is obtained to identify the multicollinearity issues between the selected input variables the value of vif obtained between the selected input variables is close to one indicating no multicollinearity problem between the inputs lagged rainfall and soil moisture as the vif threshold for multicollinearity problem is greater than 5 hair et al 1998 yu et al 2015 2 5 2 partition of dataset the purpose of data partitioning is to test the svm model independently from training dataset the data of four monsoon seasons i e 492 samples 2012 to 2015 was available to setup the svm based streamflow model the total available data of rainfall soil moisture and streamflow are portioned into two sets i training dataset comprising 369 samples 2013 to 2015 and ii testing datasets comprising 123 samples 2012 the approach of partitioning the samples i e 75 for training and 25 for testing is consistent with malik et al 2019a a larger sample is considered during training stage mainly to capture most of the data characteristics at the time of partition it is kept in mind that the statistical measures such as mean standard deviation skewness coefficient coefficient of kurtosis in training and testing dataset should be similar to obtain a consistent performance in training and testing periods kumar et al 2020 during the model setup random sampling is not considered as time series by definition occurs in a temporal order sequence and this order sequence must be preserved in order to keep the structure of the series intact ali et al 2020b 2 5 3 scaling of dataset for streamflow simulations there are four input datasets predictors 1st 2nd and 3rd day s lagged rainfall products along with 4th day ascat soil moisture and one predictand variable observed streamflow all the datasets are scaled between 0 and 1 to prevent the model from being dominated by the variables with large values kumar et al 2019 prasad et al 2019 finally the model outputs are back transformed to their original scale and performance assessment is carried out 2 5 4 selection of a kernel function selection of suitable kernel function is crucial for reliable performance of the svm model a variety of kernel functions are available for svm such as the linear sigmoid polynomial and radial basis however various hydrometeorological studies show a favorable performance with the radial basis function rbf himanshu et al 2017 suryanarayana et al 2014 tikhamarine et al 2020 yadav and eliza 2017 in addition rbf can effectively handle the non linear relation between the inputs and the output therefore the rbf is used in this study the equation of the rbf is given by k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 where xi and xj are the inputs in the ith and jth dimensions respectively and γ is the kernel width parameter 2 5 5 estimation of optimum value of the hyperparameters for the svm the svm model s performance depends on the hyperparameters c ε and γ zhao et al 2015 the optimum values of these hyperparameters are therefore vital for the efficient performance of the svm model the optimum value of the parameters for their valid ranges is obtained using a grid search optimization technique bhagwat and maity 2013 goyal et al 2017 raje and mujumdar 2011 during the grid search optimization five fold cross validation is used to avoid or minimize the risk of over fitting baydaroğlu and koçak 2014 maity et al 2010 raje and mujumdar 2011 the least mse is chosen as the selection criterion to optimize c ε and γ the optimum values of the hyper parameters obtained for various streamflow simulations mentioned in section 2 3 are given in table s1 supplementary material 2 6 performance measures the performance of the rainfall estimates the uncorrected 3b42rt and the csr is evaluated by three statistical measures viz pearson correlation coefficient cc bias and root mean square error rmse with respect to the daily observed gridded rainfall data the details of these performance measures are given in table 3 the evaluation of the streamflow simulation forced by various inputs shown in component b of fig 2 is carried out using the rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse whose equations are provided in table 4 3 results and discussion the obtained results are discussed in two parts in the first part a statistical evaluation of the csr against the imd and the 3b42rt is presented component a in the second part streamflow derived from various inputs are presented and discussed in detail component b 3 1 statistical evaluation of the csr the time series of imd 3b42rt and csr averaged over the catchment are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly observed that the 3b42rt highly overestimates rainfall displaying a high rmse as well as bias with reference to the observed rainfall table 5 on the other hand the csr is nearer to the imd observed rainfall as compared to the 3b42rt resulting in a significantly lower rmse and bias table 5 to obtain a detailed understanding of the errors the statistical measures viz the cc bias and rmse are shown in fig 4 for various rainfall classes defined by kumar et al 2019 the range of the rainfall classes is shown in table s2 supplementary material in the no rainfall class the bias and rmse values did not improve but rather deteriorated after the correction this may be due to the model structure whose optimization function was mse emphasizing the reproduction of higher ranges of rainfall values at the expense of lower values on the other hand for light and moderate rainfall classes the corrected product showed an improvement in the performance i e a reduction increment in the bias and the rmse cc as compared to the 3b42rt rainfall there is nearly 60 reduction in the rmse within light and moderate rainfall classes for both training and testing which indicates a significant improvement fig 4 however the bias and the rmse deteriorated for the heavy rainfall class which may be due to the smaller sample size bhuiyan et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 overall through the approach proposed by kumar et al 2019 a significant reduction of error in the 3b42rt is obtained especially in the light and moderate rainfall classes 3 2 performance assessment of simulated streamflow in this section the streamflow estimates qimd qsr qcsr qsr sm and qcsr sm obtained by the corresponding inputs imd 3b42rt csr 3b42rt sm and csr sm are compared and discussed in detail 3 2 1 streamflow simulation with the imd observed gridded rainfall in order to evaluate the model s capability to reproduce the observed streamflow svm based streamflow modelling is carried out with the imd based observed gridded rainfall as predictor and the performance measures are presented in this section this result is used as a benchmark to highlight any improvement or deterioration in the model s accuracy when the different inputs the 3b42rt csr 3b42rt sm and csr sm are considered time series of the qimd along with observed streamflow are shown in fig 5 a in addition to the time series the performance measures the rmse and nse for various streamflow estimates including qimd are shown in table 6 for the training and testing periods it can be observed that the imd observed rainfall based svm model is able to reproduce the observed streamflow well displaying nse values of 0 51 0 48 during the training testing period however the error in the streamflow i e the rmse is non negligible in the training and the testing periods table 6 these errors in the qimd are mainly due to the overestimation underestimation of the qimd during low high flow this may be due to the model s difficulties in reproducing the low flows moreover the objective function minimization of mse used for model calibration mainly addressed the reproduction of high flows as well some of the streamflow peaks are not well captured by qimd which may be due to various causes such as the inaccuracy of input observations and the adopted modeling structure ciabatta et al 2016 for example in this study it may be due to lumped modelling that suppresses the potential effects of spatial variability in rainfall further a small number of samples of extreme streamflow peak values in the training period of svm model setup could be another reason for not to capture the streamflow peak as mentioned in malik et al 2020b 3 2 2 streamflow simulation with 3b42rt and csr the capability of the 3b42rt and the csr for streamflow simulation and their comparison is discussed in this section time series of the qsr and qcsr along with observed streamflow are shown in fig 5b the qsr does not match the observed streamflow well fig 5b as evident from the nse values of 0 26 0 14 during training testing period table 6 the qsr is highly overestimated for the lower ranges of observed streamflow and underestimated for the higher ranges of observed streamflow the performance measures for example the nse and the rmse obtained with qsr are significantly lower as compared with the qimd table 6 these results are consistent with past studies alnahit et al 2020 ciabatta et al 2016 the error with the qsr is much higher than that obtained with the qimd which may be due to the presence of a significant error in the 3b42rt rainfall relative to imd based observed rainfall table 5 on the other hand the qcsr matched the observed streamflow well fig 5b displaying improved nse values of 0 41 0 31 during training testing periods than that of the qsr table 6 the rmse values have also improved by nearly 10 in both the training and testing periods within the qcsr as compared with the qsr table 6 these improvements are mainly due to the correction of the 3b42rt rainfall although the performance of the qcsr has improved significantly in comparison with the qsr it is still not as good as qimd s performance table 6 this may be due to the limitation of the satellite rainfall correction approach adopted here which was unable to improve the entire range of rainfall values fig 4 3 2 3 streamflow simulation by integrating the antecedent soil moisture condition in this section the results of integration of the satellite based antecedent soil moisture conditions as a predictor variable along with the 3b42rt and csr separately into svm based streamflow modelling are discussed in detail the time series of qsr sm qcsr sm and observed streamflow are shown in fig 5c among them the time series of the qsr sm is closer to the observed streamflow producing good nse values during training and testing periods the nse value of 0 26 0 14 obtained during the training testing period for the qsr improved greatly to 0 62 0 52 for qsr sm table 6 in addition the rmse values also show a huge improvement in the qsr sm table 6 this demonstrates that the integration of satellite based soil moisture with rainfall has significant potential to improve streamflow estimates moreover the qsr sm is better than the qimd and the qcsr table 6 from the time series plot fig 5c it can be observed that the qcsr sm is much better than the qcsr which again justifies the use of soil moisture data to improve model performance this result is consistent with the study conducted by tayfur et al 2014 who coupled the observed soil moisture at various depths with observed rainfall for runoff prediction through a ml method across two smaller catchments of italy namely niccone area 137sqkm and colorso 13 sqkm they found a massive improvement in the streamflow estimates when soil moisture is applied with rainfall as a predictor variable compared to rainfall alone as the predictor it is noteworthy that the qcsr sm also outperforms qimd table 6 it can be clearly observed that qsr sm qcsr sm performed well all across the study period fig 5c nevertheless these streamflow estimates have some level of limitations to capture extreme peak streamflow which may be due to various causes described earlier in section 3 2 1 among all the streamflow simulations tested here the qcsr sm is associated with the highest performance in general however the performance of the qsr sm and the qcsr sm is almost the same during the testing period table 6 this result may be due to lesser samples in higher range of flow in this period to justify our argument time series plots of simulated events are presented separately for 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 for both cases including the performance measures with respect to the observed streamflow fig 6 it can be observed that when the number of high streamflow events is large as in the case of 2013 the qcsr sm is more accurate compared to the qsr sm in contrast when the number of high streamflow events is less the performance of qcsr sm is similar to that of qsr sm as in the cases of 2014 2015 and 2012 3 2 4 assessment of streamflow simulations based on various flow classes in this section the rmse values based on various flow classes are presented fig 7 to understand the behavior of errors across different flow segments note that the observed flow is divided into five flow segments as per pfannerstill et al 2014 very low flow low flow moderate flow high and very high flow in addition to the rmse values the individual events present in those different flow classes are also shown in fig s1 5 for very low low moderate high and very high respectively to complement the information illustrated in the segment wise rmse shown in fig 7 it can be clearly observed that the qsr is associated with more error as compared with the qimd fig 7 across the all flow classes except the moderate flow class this is also consistent with the event plots as a majority of them demonstrate similar findings figs s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 these higher errors in qsr are attributed to the large errors in 3b42rt compared to the imd based observed gridded rainfall table 5 on the other hand the qcsr shows a reduced rmse compared to the qsr in very low high and very high flow class however the quantity of improvement varies on various flow classes i e a greater improvement is obtained in very high flow class compared to very low and high flow classes fig 7 although the qcsr is improved as compared to the qsr in various flow classes still it is not as good as the qimd by incorporating soil moisture with the 3b42rt csr reduction in rmse is obtained in the qsr sm qcsr sm compared to the qsr qcsr with an exception in moderate flow class specifically a remarkable improvement is obtained with the very low high and very high flow classes this can also be seen in the event plot where the majority of the events exhibit this improvement here it should be noticed that a similar level of improvement is obtained during the training period of the low flow class during the testing period though a clear improvement is evident it is not as good as in the training period by analyzing the event plot fig s2 it is quite clear that a considerable improvement occurred in the qsr sm qcsr sm over the qsr qcsr in all events except two to three events during the training period however during the testing period four of the twelve events showed a deterioration while the other eight events showed similar improvement to what is observed during the training period since the total number of samples is low only twelve these events impacted the overall accuracy remarkably during the testing period and thus the improvement is not as good as during the training period one can also notice that the qcsr sm outperformed the qsr sm in very low high and very high flow classes such improvement in the performance is considerably large in the very high flow class which confirms the use of csr along with soil moisture for flooding situations it is interesting to highlight that the qcsr sm performs significantly better than the qimd in very low and very high flow classes 4 summary and conclusions in this study rt streamflow modeling is carried out in ashti catchment india using various satellite based hydro meteorological observations rainfall and soil moisture as inputs into an svm model initially the satellite based rainfall 3b42rt is considered as predictor variable forcing variable into the svm based streamflow model to obtain streamflow simulation however as expected the results are not impressive as it is well known that the sres are associated with significant errors compared to the observed rainfall the approach proposed by kumar et al 2019 is used to correct the sres i e 3b42rt wherein ascat based soil moisture observations are used following this the obtained csr is used as a predictor variable into the svm based streamflow model and a clear improvement is found over the previous case when compared with the streamflow derived from the imd observed gridded rainfall still the results warranted some improvements considering the further improvements required in streamflow simulations the satellite based soil moisture in this case the ascat based soil moisture which is readily available and has strong influence in runoff generation is integrated with the 3b42rt and the csr separately as another predictor variable in svm modelling finally all five cases the 3b42rt the csr imd 3b42rt sm and csr sm of the svm based streamflow simulations are compared analyzed and the following conclusions are obtained 1 though the qimd streamflow estimates are satisfactory however it failed to capture the extreme flows peak as well as very low refer to fig 5a 2 the qsr showed a limited performance in streamflow simulation it is because of overestimations in low flows and underestimations in high flows refer to fig 5b the performance of the qsr is significantly lower than that of the qimd refer to table 6 a considerable discrepancy between the qimd and the qsr occurred in various flow classes these can be attributed to the error associated with the 3b42rt rainfall as compared with the imd based observed gridded rainfall refer to table 5 3 the qcsr significantly improved as compared with the qsr particularly for very low high and very high flow classes refer to fig 7 moreover for very high flow this improvement is quite significant although the qcsr improved significantly than the qsr still it is not as good as the qimd refer to table 6 4 with the qsr and qsr sm the latter is better than the former refer to table 6 specifically a significant improvement is obtained in very low high and very high flow classes refer to fig 7 5 the qcsr sm largely improved as compared with the qcsr refer to table 6 moreover this scenario provided the best result among all the five tested scenarios and is found even better compared to the qimd refer to table 6 in comparing the qsr sm and qcsr sm the latter clearly showed a better result specifically in very low and very high flow cases refer to fig 7 the improvement was maximum for the very high flow segment refer to fig 7 hence adding soil moisture to csr is the best way to predict the streamflow peaks the mentioned conclusions indicate that the proposed integration of rainfall and soil moisture in a ml approach specifically svm to model rt streamflow is very effective for the ashti catchment the present study endorses the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating satellite based nrt rainfall and soil moisture in an svm based technique to model streamflow only nrt inputs are used in this study hence the presented approach would be helpful for flood monitoring along with reservoir planning purposes moreover the approach does not require extensive hydro metrological data or catchment drainage characteristics hence it has a significant potential for streamflow prediction over data scarce catchments however the robustness of the approach needs to be tested rigorously in catchments located in different climatic conditions and by using different satellite based rainfall and soil moisture products authors contribution a k and r r designed the study a k conducted the

4813,real time streamflow modeling is a challenging endeavor in regions where real time ground based hydro meteorological observations are scarce nevertheless with the emergence of satellite remote sensing some of the essential hydro meteorological datasets such as rainfall and soil moisture are available in near real time which can circumvent the problem in such scenario machine learning ml approaches can be used to model streamflow even with limited real time data in view of this the effectiveness of integrating satellite based near real time rainfall i e tropical rainfall measuring mission based 3b42rt v7 and advance scatterometer ascat based soil moisture observations through support vector machine svm for simulating streamflow in a poorly gauged catchment in india has been investigated results show that 3b42rt forced streamflow performed poorly compared to streamflow simulated using the observed gridded rainfall this inferior performance is mainly attributed to errors in 3b42rt rainfall product hence a recently developed svm based error reduction model using ascat soil moisture data is used to correct 3b42rt the obtained corrected satellite rainfall outperformed 3b42rt in streamflow simulations but still it is affected by notable errors to further improve the streamflow estimates ascat soil moisture is used as a predictor variable along with 3b42rt and the corrected satellite rainfall separately into svm based streamflow modelling results indicate that this integration considerably improves the streamflow estimates with respect to the use of 3b42rt and corrected satellite rainfall individually this is attributed to the crucial role of antecedent soil moisture for streamflow generation among all the tested scenarios streamflow derived by the integration of soil moisture and corrected satellite rainfall showed the highest performance hence it can be said that the proposed approach has considerable potential to model real time streamflow in the chosen poorly gauged catchment and possibly beyond however the approach needs detailed evaluation before applying in other such catchments keywords ascat machine learning support vector machine

one of the most common and deadly natural disasters causing thousands of casualties and destruction every year across the world ciabatta et al 2016 a reliable non structural measure to reduce the adverse impacts of floods is to develop efficient early warning systems camici et al 2018 real time rt streamflow monitoring is the cornerstone of a successful early warning system shah and mishra 2016 however the requisite observed streamflow data or the hydrometeorological data are typically inaccessible unavailable in rt particularly in developing nations nanda et al 2016 in recent years some critical hydrometeorological variables have become available through satellite based earth observations on a global scale in near rt nrt at high spatial and temporal resolutions thereby making rt streamflow modelling feasible in ungauged catchments among these space based variables satellite based rainfall estimates sres has been extensively used in streamflow modeling through different hydrological models belabid et al 2019 bitew et al 2012 su et al 2008 tang et al 2019 however the use of sres has shown poor results in streamflow simulations when compared to simulations carried out with ground based rainfall estimates camici et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 kneis et al 2014 this is mainly because of the presence of the errors in sres when compared to in situ rainfall observations errors in sres and their propagation to streamflow simulations have led various researchers to correct such estimates before using them for hydrological applications goshime et al 2019 2020 gumindoga et al 2020 harris et al 2007 shah and mishra 2016 shrestha et al 2011 several error correction methods are used to improve the sres such as the power transformation method distribution transformation method gumindoga et al 2019 mean correction factor method shah and mishra 2016 quantile mapping ringard et al 2017 and bayesian approach tian et al 2010 however these approaches are associated with various limitations details of the limitations are available in ajaaj et al 2016 ringard et al 2017 and gumindoga et al 2019 recently some studies have used satellite based soil moisture to correct satellite based nrt rainfall products and obtained more accurate rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 2011 brocca et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 pellarin et al 2020 these methods seem to be more promising than the traditional methods however their effectiveness in hydrological modelling needs elaborate testing for streamflow modeling various classes of models exist in the literature they span from simple empirical approaches to complex physics based hydrological models rajurkar et al 2004 each model is associated with certain advantages as well as limitations due to the complexity in physical models and large data requirements their application for operational purposes is limited on the other hand machine learning ml based models can perform well with limited datasets goyal et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 and thus can be suitable to model streamflow in data scarce catchments ml has been used extensively all across the globe for streamflow flood prediction aqil et al 2007 kumar et al 2005 2020 malik et al 2020b maheswaran and khosa 2013 sehgal et al 2014 tiwari et al 2013 tongal and booij 2018 yadav et al 2016 ml techniques performed well not only for streamflow forecasting but also in various non linear and complex applications such as solar radiation prediction prasad et al 2019 2020 wave height forecasting ali and prasad 2019 kaloop et al 2020 drought prediction forecasting ali et al 2019 dikshit et al 2020 khan et al 2020 malik et al 2020a rainfall forecasting abbot and marohasy 2014 ali et al 2018 2020a lin et al 2009 yu et al 2017 evapotranspiration evaporation estimation malik et al 2019b roy et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2020 which justifies the robustness of ml approach in various field also ml models are computationally fast and reliable which makes them very suitable for rt applications such as flood landslide forecasting akhtar et al 2009 as mentioned above several authors have carried out streamflow simulations using various ml techniques however most of the studies have considered ground gauge based rainfall streamflow data or both as the predictors input unfortunately these input datasets are typically unavailable in rt especially in developing countries hence operational systems cannot be established with these datasets recently some authors have used sres in streamflow simulations as inputs to ml approaches akhtar et al 2009 nanda et al 2016 in particular akhtar et al 2009 modeled the streamflow by considering a sres along with the observed streamflow and obtained reliable results over the ganges river basin nanda et al 2016 proposed a wavelet based ml approach to model real time streamflow using sres and found encouraging results however they estimated the antecedent moisture condition empirically by considering five days of accumulated rainfall they used it as an input along with sres to obtain rt streamflow they also pointed out that accumulated rainfall which is a proxy of antecedent moisture conditions is a key variable to model streamflow moreover it is well known that antecedent soil moisture conditions are fundamental for runoff generation tayfur et al 2014 tayfur and brocca 2015 recently global scale rt soil moisture datasets have become available with reasonable spatial and temporal resolution through remote sensing which can be used for rt streamflow modelling purposes conjunctively with sres to best of the authors knowledge to date no study has used satellite based nrt soil moisture and rainfall data for streamflow modeling within a ml framework this study aims to address the following research objectives 1 to assess the potential of sres to model streamflow through a ml approach as very limited studies are available where ml in conjunction with nrt sres have been used for this purpose 2 to assess the capability of soil moisture based error reduction method to correct the sres for streamflow modelling 3 to assess the effectiveness of integrating satellite based nrt soil moisture and rainfall for generating streamflow simulations through a ml technique the proposed objectives are addressed using tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 based nrt rainfall product 3b42rt and the advanced scatterometer ascat based soil moisture wagner et al 2013 within a ml framework i e support vector machine based regression model svm vapnik et al 1997 svm is used in the present study due to its improved generalization capability compared with other ml approaches wu et al 2008 yoon et al 2011 zakaria and shabri 2012 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site the ashti catchment india a part of the godavari river basin is chosen as the test site for this study the catchment s geographical location is shown in fig 1 the spatial extent of the catchment lies between 78 0 to 81 0 east longitude and 19 30 to 22 50 north latitude covering an area of about 50 000 km2 the basin receives rainfall mostly during the monsoon season mid june to mid october and hence only the monsoon season is considered for the study average monsoonal rainfall and streamflow of the catchment are 1532 mm and 2350 m3 s respectively for the period 2012 2015 this catchment has no substantial flow control structures in contrast to most other highly regulated indian catchments the ashti catchment is part of india s tropical climate region and its land use is dominated by forest and agriculture das and nanduri 2018 the ashti catchment is a suitable test site for this study because of its complex terrain its significant spatially variable rainfall and its vulnerability to heavy flooding 2 2 datasets the datasets include rainfall soil moisture and streamflow data the monsoon months of 2012 to 2015 are chosen for this study the time period is constrained by the availability of i a consistent data record for the advanced scatterometer ascat based nrt soil moisture product starting in august 2011 and ii ground based rainfall and streamflow observations up to 2015 in the present study the monsoon of 2013 15 is considered for training and the monsoon of 2012 for testing as the statistical characteristics of streamflow during both the periods match closely details of the statistical properties are shown in table 1 2 2 1 rainfall the observed rainfall data is obtained from the gridded daily dataset provided by the india meteorological department imd pai et al 2014 which is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 x 0 25 and is suitable for large catchment studies this imd dataset is prepared by considering measurements of rainfall from reasonably well spread rain gauge stations over the indian land region followed by stringent quality control a number of researchers bharti and singh 2015 khan et al 2019 patil and ramsankaran 2017 prakash et al 2018 upadhyaya and ramsankaran 2016 2018 have used this gridded rainfall data to predict streamflow as well as for other hydro meteorological applications it is one of the most reliable and government certified products for hydrometeorological applications over the indian region the tmpa based nrt sre namely 3b42rt version 7 hereafter referred to as 3b42rt is used in this study it is available at 0 25 x 0 25 spatial resolution with 3 hour temporal resolution the availability of the 3b42rt in nrt within 6 9 h from the observation to the end users makes it suitable for real time streamflow modeling 3b42rt is a multi satellite rainfall product derived using geostationary infrared data and low earth orbiting microwave mw observations huffman et al 2007 from various satellites in this algorithm available passive mw and ir estimates are combined by calibrating ir measurements however mw estimates are taken preferentially and the remaining empty grids are filled with ir estimates upadhyaya and ramsankaran 2016 more details of the 3b42rt are available in huffman et al 2007 among the nrt satellite based rainfall products 3b42rt has been used extensively across the world in the current and past decades and is well evaluated across the world bitew and gebremichael 2011 chen et al 2013 moazami et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 furthermore 3b42rt has performed relatively better compared to other contemporary rt satellite based rainfall products mei et al 2014 pipunic et al 2015 it should be noted that imd provides only daily observed rainfall at 0300 utc hence daily rainfall of 3b42rt is estimated from its 3 h data accumulated at 0300 utc for the sake of consistency in the analysis 2 2 2 soil moisture ascat satellite based soil moisture products h101 metop a and h16 metop b is used in the present study ascat based products are available in nrt after 130 min of sensing which is an essential requirement for proposed rt streamflow modeling these satellite based soil moisture products are distributed by the eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf also this product is utilized in various regions across the globe and has provided reliable results wanders et al 2015 massari et al 2015 these estimates are obtained using a backscatter coefficient measured by metop a and metop b satellites through a change detection method this statistical method is developed at the remote sensing research group department for geodesy and geoinformation vienna university of technology saf 2016 this product is available at a native spatial sampling of 0 125 however it is resampled to 0 25 to match the spatial resolution of imd gridded rainfall for the sake of homogeneity it should be noted that the imd accumulates daily rainfall at 3 00 utc and hence the ascat s morning pass datasets are generally used for this study however some temporal discontinuities are available in morning pass ascat dataset which are filled primarily using the ascat s evening pass dataset on some days 15 per cent on average when ascat data was not available during both the passes values are filled with the nearest data available on the previous day as done by kumar et al 2019 2 2 3 streamflow daily streamflow data of ashti gauging site is downloaded from india s water resources information system iwris website iwris provides a single window solution for various water resources data and information in a standardized national geographic information system framework 2 3 design of experiments the overall framework of this study is shown in fig 2 there are two main components in this analysis the first component component a deals with the improvement of the 3b42rt product by integrating it with the ascat based soil moisture in an svm based ml technique the 3b42rt and the ascat based soil moisture are used as predictor variables while the observed gridded imd rainfall is taken as the predictand variable to the svm based error reduction model setup through the first component the corrected satellite rainfall csr is obtained details about the model setup of component a are available in kumar et al 2019 the second component component b deals with the different scenarios of streamflow simulations forced by various set of inputs to the svm based streamflow model as shown in fig 2 based on the different inputs used five scenarios of streamflow simulations are obtained viz i imd forced streamflow qimd ii 3b42rt forced streamflow qsr iii csr forced streamflow qcsr iv 3b42rt ascat forced streamflow qsr sm v csr ascat forced streamflow qcsr sm finally the simulated streamflows are compared with the observed data to select the best performing model it is to be noted that all the input datasets for streamflow simulation i e the imd the 3b42rt the csr and soil moisture are averaged across the catchment each day before streamflow simulations as the spatial heterogeneity of the inputs during simulation is assumed negligible in the present study lumped configuration a long time series is always required to obtain a better model prediction however to test the proposed approach shown in fig 2 data of four monsoon seasons have been used due to unavailability of consistent long term soil moisture and streamflow data in addition the spatial resolution of the satellite based inputs observed rainfall is coarse and hence the proposed approach may not be suitable at small catchment scale although the satellite based 3b42rt is available at 3 hourly temporal resolution the model development is carried out on a daily scale and not on sub daily scale as the imd rainfall and the observed streamflow data are available on a daily basis the subsequent sections present an overview of the svm model and describe the steps involved in constructing svm models to obtain streamflow estimates in this study followed by a description of the performance measures used to assess the results 2 4 svm model the svm model is one of the leading techniques for classification as well as regression problems widely applied in various fields in recent decades al shammari et al 2016 ch et al 2014 henrique et al 2018 olatomiwa et al 2015 in the present study the svm is considered due to its wide application in streamflow simulation with efficient performance behzad et al 2010 bozorg haddad et al 2018 one of the major reasons for its wider application is its capability to efficiently handle non linearity and non stationarity van et al 2020 moreover its generalization capability further adds to its importance svm models have been extensively used in hydrological problems ahmad et al 2010 karran et al 2014 yu et al 2006 the mathematical description of the svm is presented below the svm model provides a solution to a regression problem with the multiple inputs x i and a target output y i where i 1 2 3 n n represents the number of observations of inputs and an output the svm equation can be represented as 1 y estimated f x w ϕ x b where w and b are the parameter vectors of the function ϕ x denotes the nonlinear transformation function optimal values of the parameters are estimated by solving the following optimisation problem 2 min 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 such t h a t y i estimated y i ε ξ i y i y i estimated ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 n where c is a user defined penalty constant which represents the amount of trade off between dispersion of weights and the objective function ξ i and ξ i are positive slack variables that measure the training errors above and below an ε tube this problem is solved in dual space by using lagrange multipliers α i and α i finally the regression model becomes 1 f x i 1 n α i α i k x i x j b where k xi xj is a kernel function which describes the inner product in d dimensional feature space xi and xj ε x 2 5 steps involved in construction of the svm based streamflow model the construction of svm based streamflow models involves mainly five steps 1 input selection for the svm model 2 partition of dataset 3 scaling of the dataset 4 selection of a kernel function for the svm 5 estimation of optimum value of the hyperparameters associated with svm model description of each of these steps is given in the following sub sections 2 5 1 input selection for svm based streamflow simulation selection of appropriate input variables is an essential requirement for a successful ml based approach amaranto et al 2018 kumar et al 2005 determining the input variables in ml based streamflow model involves finding the rainfall s lag that has a significant influence on the predictand i e streamflow in this study the number of lag days of rainfall is identified by cross correlation analysis this method has been used extensively in ml based streamflow models nanda et al 2016 tiwari and chatterjee 2011 the cross correlation analysis reveals that rainfall imd 3b42rt and csr is well correlated with streamflow up to a delay of three days the lagged rainfall up to the third day is considered in the present study subsequently the fourth day s lagged soil moisture has been selected as the antecedent soil moisture condition for streamflow simulations there are five scenarios for streamflow estimation i e qimd qsr qcsr qsm sr qcsr sm the input and the obtained output variables associated with these scenarios are provided in table 2 moreover a statistical indicator i e variance influence factor vif craney and surles 2002 is obtained to identify the multicollinearity issues between the selected input variables the value of vif obtained between the selected input variables is close to one indicating no multicollinearity problem between the inputs lagged rainfall and soil moisture as the vif threshold for multicollinearity problem is greater than 5 hair et al 1998 yu et al 2015 2 5 2 partition of dataset the purpose of data partitioning is to test the svm model independently from training dataset the data of four monsoon seasons i e 492 samples 2012 to 2015 was available to setup the svm based streamflow model the total available data of rainfall soil moisture and streamflow are portioned into two sets i training dataset comprising 369 samples 2013 to 2015 and ii testing datasets comprising 123 samples 2012 the approach of partitioning the samples i e 75 for training and 25 for testing is consistent with malik et al 2019a a larger sample is considered during training stage mainly to capture most of the data characteristics at the time of partition it is kept in mind that the statistical measures such as mean standard deviation skewness coefficient coefficient of kurtosis in training and testing dataset should be similar to obtain a consistent performance in training and testing periods kumar et al 2020 during the model setup random sampling is not considered as time series by definition occurs in a temporal order sequence and this order sequence must be preserved in order to keep the structure of the series intact ali et al 2020b 2 5 3 scaling of dataset for streamflow simulations there are four input datasets predictors 1st 2nd and 3rd day s lagged rainfall products along with 4th day ascat soil moisture and one predictand variable observed streamflow all the datasets are scaled between 0 and 1 to prevent the model from being dominated by the variables with large values kumar et al 2019 prasad et al 2019 finally the model outputs are back transformed to their original scale and performance assessment is carried out 2 5 4 selection of a kernel function selection of suitable kernel function is crucial for reliable performance of the svm model a variety of kernel functions are available for svm such as the linear sigmoid polynomial and radial basis however various hydrometeorological studies show a favorable performance with the radial basis function rbf himanshu et al 2017 suryanarayana et al 2014 tikhamarine et al 2020 yadav and eliza 2017 in addition rbf can effectively handle the non linear relation between the inputs and the output therefore the rbf is used in this study the equation of the rbf is given by k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 where xi and xj are the inputs in the ith and jth dimensions respectively and γ is the kernel width parameter 2 5 5 estimation of optimum value of the hyperparameters for the svm the svm model s performance depends on the hyperparameters c ε and γ zhao et al 2015 the optimum values of these hyperparameters are therefore vital for the efficient performance of the svm model the optimum value of the parameters for their valid ranges is obtained using a grid search optimization technique bhagwat and maity 2013 goyal et al 2017 raje and mujumdar 2011 during the grid search optimization five fold cross validation is used to avoid or minimize the risk of over fitting baydaroğlu and koçak 2014 maity et al 2010 raje and mujumdar 2011 the least mse is chosen as the selection criterion to optimize c ε and γ the optimum values of the hyper parameters obtained for various streamflow simulations mentioned in section 2 3 are given in table s1 supplementary material 2 6 performance measures the performance of the rainfall estimates the uncorrected 3b42rt and the csr is evaluated by three statistical measures viz pearson correlation coefficient cc bias and root mean square error rmse with respect to the daily observed gridded rainfall data the details of these performance measures are given in table 3 the evaluation of the streamflow simulation forced by various inputs shown in component b of fig 2 is carried out using the rmse and nash sutcliff efficiency nse whose equations are provided in table 4 3 results and discussion the obtained results are discussed in two parts in the first part a statistical evaluation of the csr against the imd and the 3b42rt is presented component a in the second part streamflow derived from various inputs are presented and discussed in detail component b 3 1 statistical evaluation of the csr the time series of imd 3b42rt and csr averaged over the catchment are shown in fig 3 it can be clearly observed that the 3b42rt highly overestimates rainfall displaying a high rmse as well as bias with reference to the observed rainfall table 5 on the other hand the csr is nearer to the imd observed rainfall as compared to the 3b42rt resulting in a significantly lower rmse and bias table 5 to obtain a detailed understanding of the errors the statistical measures viz the cc bias and rmse are shown in fig 4 for various rainfall classes defined by kumar et al 2019 the range of the rainfall classes is shown in table s2 supplementary material in the no rainfall class the bias and rmse values did not improve but rather deteriorated after the correction this may be due to the model structure whose optimization function was mse emphasizing the reproduction of higher ranges of rainfall values at the expense of lower values on the other hand for light and moderate rainfall classes the corrected product showed an improvement in the performance i e a reduction increment in the bias and the rmse cc as compared to the 3b42rt rainfall there is nearly 60 reduction in the rmse within light and moderate rainfall classes for both training and testing which indicates a significant improvement fig 4 however the bias and the rmse deteriorated for the heavy rainfall class which may be due to the smaller sample size bhuiyan et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 overall through the approach proposed by kumar et al 2019 a significant reduction of error in the 3b42rt is obtained especially in the light and moderate rainfall classes 3 2 performance assessment of simulated streamflow in this section the streamflow estimates qimd qsr qcsr qsr sm and qcsr sm obtained by the corresponding inputs imd 3b42rt csr 3b42rt sm and csr sm are compared and discussed in detail 3 2 1 streamflow simulation with the imd observed gridded rainfall in order to evaluate the model s capability to reproduce the observed streamflow svm based streamflow modelling is carried out with the imd based observed gridded rainfall as predictor and the performance measures are presented in this section this result is used as a benchmark to highlight any improvement or deterioration in the model s accuracy when the different inputs the 3b42rt csr 3b42rt sm and csr sm are considered time series of the qimd along with observed streamflow are shown in fig 5 a in addition to the time series the performance measures the rmse and nse for various streamflow estimates including qimd are shown in table 6 for the training and testing periods it can be observed that the imd observed rainfall based svm model is able to reproduce the observed streamflow well displaying nse values of 0 51 0 48 during the training testing period however the error in the streamflow i e the rmse is non negligible in the training and the testing periods table 6 these errors in the qimd are mainly due to the overestimation underestimation of the qimd during low high flow this may be due to the model s difficulties in reproducing the low flows moreover the objective function minimization of mse used for model calibration mainly addressed the reproduction of high flows as well some of the streamflow peaks are not well captured by qimd which may be due to various causes such as the inaccuracy of input observations and the adopted modeling structure ciabatta et al 2016 for example in this study it may be due to lumped modelling that suppresses the potential effects of spatial variability in rainfall further a small number of samples of extreme streamflow peak values in the training period of svm model setup could be another reason for not to capture the streamflow peak as mentioned in malik et al 2020b 3 2 2 streamflow simulation with 3b42rt and csr the capability of the 3b42rt and the csr for streamflow simulation and their comparison is discussed in this section time series of the qsr and qcsr along with observed streamflow are shown in fig 5b the qsr does not match the observed streamflow well fig 5b as evident from the nse values of 0 26 0 14 during training testing period table 6 the qsr is highly overestimated for the lower ranges of observed streamflow and underestimated for the higher ranges of observed streamflow the performance measures for example the nse and the rmse obtained with qsr are significantly lower as compared with the qimd table 6 these results are consistent with past studies alnahit et al 2020 ciabatta et al 2016 the error with the qsr is much higher than that obtained with the qimd which may be due to the presence of a significant error in the 3b42rt rainfall relative to imd based observed rainfall table 5 on the other hand the qcsr matched the observed streamflow well fig 5b displaying improved nse values of 0 41 0 31 during training testing periods than that of the qsr table 6 the rmse values have also improved by nearly 10 in both the training and testing periods within the qcsr as compared with the qsr table 6 these improvements are mainly due to the correction of the 3b42rt rainfall although the performance of the qcsr has improved significantly in comparison with the qsr it is still not as good as qimd s performance table 6 this may be due to the limitation of the satellite rainfall correction approach adopted here which was unable to improve the entire range of rainfall values fig 4 3 2 3 streamflow simulation by integrating the antecedent soil moisture condition in this section the results of integration of the satellite based antecedent soil moisture conditions as a predictor variable along with the 3b42rt and csr separately into svm based streamflow modelling are discussed in detail the time series of qsr sm qcsr sm and observed streamflow are shown in fig 5c among them the time series of the qsr sm is closer to the observed streamflow producing good nse values during training and testing periods the nse value of 0 26 0 14 obtained during the training testing period for the qsr improved greatly to 0 62 0 52 for qsr sm table 6 in addition the rmse values also show a huge improvement in the qsr sm table 6 this demonstrates that the integration of satellite based soil moisture with rainfall has significant potential to improve streamflow estimates moreover the qsr sm is better than the qimd and the qcsr table 6 from the time series plot fig 5c it can be observed that the qcsr sm is much better than the qcsr which again justifies the use of soil moisture data to improve model performance this result is consistent with the study conducted by tayfur et al 2014 who coupled the observed soil moisture at various depths with observed rainfall for runoff prediction through a ml method across two smaller catchments of italy namely niccone area 137sqkm and colorso 13 sqkm they found a massive improvement in the streamflow estimates when soil moisture is applied with rainfall as a predictor variable compared to rainfall alone as the predictor it is noteworthy that the qcsr sm also outperforms qimd table 6 it can be clearly observed that qsr sm qcsr sm performed well all across the study period fig 5c nevertheless these streamflow estimates have some level of limitations to capture extreme peak streamflow which may be due to various causes described earlier in section 3 2 1 among all the streamflow simulations tested here the qcsr sm is associated with the highest performance in general however the performance of the qsr sm and the qcsr sm is almost the same during the testing period table 6 this result may be due to lesser samples in higher range of flow in this period to justify our argument time series plots of simulated events are presented separately for 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 for both cases including the performance measures with respect to the observed streamflow fig 6 it can be observed that when the number of high streamflow events is large as in the case of 2013 the qcsr sm is more accurate compared to the qsr sm in contrast when the number of high streamflow events is less the performance of qcsr sm is similar to that of qsr sm as in the cases of 2014 2015 and 2012 3 2 4 assessment of streamflow simulations based on various flow classes in this section the rmse values based on various flow classes are presented fig 7 to understand the behavior of errors across different flow segments note that the observed flow is divided into five flow segments as per pfannerstill et al 2014 very low flow low flow moderate flow high and very high flow in addition to the rmse values the individual events present in those different flow classes are also shown in fig s1 5 for very low low moderate high and very high respectively to complement the information illustrated in the segment wise rmse shown in fig 7 it can be clearly observed that the qsr is associated with more error as compared with the qimd fig 7 across the all flow classes except the moderate flow class this is also consistent with the event plots as a majority of them demonstrate similar findings figs s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 these higher errors in qsr are attributed to the large errors in 3b42rt compared to the imd based observed gridded rainfall table 5 on the other hand the qcsr shows a reduced rmse compared to the qsr in very low high and very high flow class however the quantity of improvement varies on various flow classes i e a greater improvement is obtained in very high flow class compared to very low and high flow classes fig 7 although the qcsr is improved as compared to the qsr in various flow classes still it is not as good as the qimd by incorporating soil moisture with the 3b42rt csr reduction in rmse is obtained in the qsr sm qcsr sm compared to the qsr qcsr with an exception in moderate flow class specifically a remarkable improvement is obtained with the very low high and very high flow classes this can also be seen in the event plot where the majority of the events exhibit this improvement here it should be noticed that a similar level of improvement is obtained during the training period of the low flow class during the testing period though a clear improvement is evident it is not as good as in the training period by analyzing the event plot fig s2 it is quite clear that a considerable improvement occurred in the qsr sm qcsr sm over the qsr qcsr in all events except two to three events during the training period however during the testing period four of the twelve events showed a deterioration while the other eight events showed similar improvement to what is observed during the training period since the total number of samples is low only twelve these events impacted the overall accuracy remarkably during the testing period and thus the improvement is not as good as during the training period one can also notice that the qcsr sm outperformed the qsr sm in very low high and very high flow classes such improvement in the performance is considerably large in the very high flow class which confirms the use of csr along with soil moisture for flooding situations it is interesting to highlight that the qcsr sm performs significantly better than the qimd in very low and very high flow classes 4 summary and conclusions in this study rt streamflow modeling is carried out in ashti catchment india using various satellite based hydro meteorological observations rainfall and soil moisture as inputs into an svm model initially the satellite based rainfall 3b42rt is considered as predictor variable forcing variable into the svm based streamflow model to obtain streamflow simulation however as expected the results are not impressive as it is well known that the sres are associated with significant errors compared to the observed rainfall the approach proposed by kumar et al 2019 is used to correct the sres i e 3b42rt wherein ascat based soil moisture observations are used following this the obtained csr is used as a predictor variable into the svm based streamflow model and a clear improvement is found over the previous case when compared with the streamflow derived from the imd observed gridded rainfall still the results warranted some improvements considering the further improvements required in streamflow simulations the satellite based soil moisture in this case the ascat based soil moisture which is readily available and has strong influence in runoff generation is integrated with the 3b42rt and the csr separately as another predictor variable in svm modelling finally all five cases the 3b42rt the csr imd 3b42rt sm and csr sm of the svm based streamflow simulations are compared analyzed and the following conclusions are obtained 1 though the qimd streamflow estimates are satisfactory however it failed to capture the extreme flows peak as well as very low refer to fig 5a 2 the qsr showed a limited performance in streamflow simulation it is because of overestimations in low flows and underestimations in high flows refer to fig 5b the performance of the qsr is significantly lower than that of the qimd refer to table 6 a considerable discrepancy between the qimd and the qsr occurred in various flow classes these can be attributed to the error associated with the 3b42rt rainfall as compared with the imd based observed gridded rainfall refer to table 5 3 the qcsr significantly improved as compared with the qsr particularly for very low high and very high flow classes refer to fig 7 moreover for very high flow this improvement is quite significant although the qcsr improved significantly than the qsr still it is not as good as the qimd refer to table 6 4 with the qsr and qsr sm the latter is better than the former refer to table 6 specifically a significant improvement is obtained in very low high and very high flow classes refer to fig 7 5 the qcsr sm largely improved as compared with the qcsr refer to table 6 moreover this scenario provided the best result among all the five tested scenarios and is found even better compared to the qimd refer to table 6 in comparing the qsr sm and qcsr sm the latter clearly showed a better result specifically in very low and very high flow cases refer to fig 7 the improvement was maximum for the very high flow segment refer to fig 7 hence adding soil moisture to csr is the best way to predict the streamflow peaks the mentioned conclusions indicate that the proposed integration of rainfall and soil moisture in a ml approach specifically svm to model rt streamflow is very effective for the ashti catchment the present study endorses the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating satellite based nrt rainfall and soil moisture in an svm based technique to model streamflow only nrt inputs are used in this study hence the presented approach would be helpful for flood monitoring along with reservoir planning purposes moreover the approach does not require extensive hydro metrological data or catchment drainage characteristics hence it has a significant potential for streamflow prediction over data scarce catchments however the robustness of the approach needs to be tested rigorously in catchments located in different climatic conditions and by using different satellite based rainfall and soil moisture products authors contribution a k and r r designed the study a k conducted the

4814,non rainfall water deposition is an important water resource critical for the survival of dryland vegetation and soil biota and maintaining dryland water balance as a living skin biocrusts are attracting increasing attention due to their potentially positive impacts on non rainfall water deposition however the magnitude and underlying mechanisms of biocrust regulation of non rainfall water are still unclear in this study we investigated the non rainfall water deposition and distribution through continuous weighing micro lysimeters 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths with bare soil and three types of biocrusts cyanobacterial crusts cyanobacterial moss mixed crusts and moss crusts in a semiarid region of the chinese loess plateau our results showed that the biocrusts were associated with significantly greater non rainfall water deposition capacity 13 22 in contrast to the bare soil and biocrust type strongly influenced the daily non rainfall water amount in the order moss crusts mixed crusts cyanobacterial crusts bare soil biocrusts were also associated with faster rates of non rainfall water formation 42 f 2 87 p 0 04 which may be linked to faster nighttime cooling in comparison to the bare soil atmospheric vapor condensation was the primary water source for non rainfall water deposition at the 0 10 cm depth as opposed to soil vapor condensation biocrusts had higher condensation from both sources and had relatively more deposition from the atmosphere atmospheric vapor condensation was greater by 114 143 and soil vapor condensation was greater by 20 30 moreover 69 of the total non rainfall water amount occurred in the top 3 cm of soil the strong biocrust influence in the uppermost centimeters f 45 34 p 0 001 appears to primarily drive the contrasts in non rainfall water deposition in soils furthermore all of the apparent effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water deposition and distribution were reasonably attributed to the biocrust influences on soil physicochemical properties especially the contents of fine particles organic matter high soil roughness daily temperature difference and moss morphology in conclusion biocrusts are associated with much greater non rainfall water deposition capacity and change non rainfall water distribution along with soil depth implying that they play a critical role in surface soil water balance of dryland ecosystems keywords biological soil crust micro lysimeter water vapor condensation dew formation soil water balance chinese loess plateau 1 introduction drylands are widespread terrestrial ecosystems in which precipitation is counterbalanced by evaporation from surfaces and transpiration by plants often making them fragile huang et al 2015 reynolds et al 2007 in dryland ecosystems water availability is the most vital limiting factor in soil physical chemical biological and ecological processes zhang et al 2009 and any sources of water can have important impacts kidron 2010 xiao et al 2009 non rainfall water is a common and natural meteorological phenomenon which comprises fog dew and water vapor sorption and it plays a significant role in the water balance of dryland ecosystems florentin and agam 2017 uclés et al 2016 compared with rainfall and evaporation the daily non rainfall water amount is assumed to be very small i e usually a fraction of a millimeter but it is an indispensable water source for biocrusts insects small animals and certain plants during drought periods jacobs et al 1999 xiao et al 2009 consequently non rainfall water is a crucial water supplement and significantly contributes to the water cycle in near surface soil florentin and agam 2017 as a natural physical process non rainfall water has been investigated in some arid and semiarid regions humid tropical islands and even in cold alpine areas kidron 2010 xiao et al 2009 usually the deposition of non rainfall water may in turn modify surface reflective properties influence larger scale atmospheric moisture levels and consequently recharge soil moisture levels agam and berliner 2006 pan et al 2018 furthermore because of the lack of rainfall in arid and semiarid areas during dry spells the accumulation of non rainfall water e g monthly means and seasonal means may account for a large percentage of total water inputs kidron 2010 li et al 2018 for example studies in israel and south africa estimated that non rainfall water may comprise more than a third of or even exceed the annual rainfall kidron and tal 2012 maphangwa et al 2012 on account of the long stable vapor periods favoring condensation non rainfall water contributes greatly to the water budget and plays a vital role in the water balance of some vascular plants agam and berliner 2004 generally the free atmosphere and vapor emitted from the topsoil are the main water sources for non rainfall water deposition on the soil surface agam and berliner 2006 fischer et al 2012 however a major limitation in evaluating the ecological role of non rainfall water is difficulty of measurement especially for assessing its long term variability zhuang and zhao 2017 therefore various methods and instruments have been developed for the measurements of non rainfall water deposition in the past decade such as automated weighing lysimeters xiao et al 2009 2013 micro lysimeters pan et al 2010 the cloth plate method kidron and temina 2017 electrical impedance grids pedro and gillespie 1981 and leaf wetness sensors scherm and van bruggen 1993 the weight method using weighing micro lysimeters is the most common and convenient way to continuously obtain weight changes during dew formation process agam and berliner 2006 despite the availability of these technologies non rainfall water deposition in drylands remains undermeasured and thus underappreciated biocrusts are communities of cyanobacteria lichens mosses fungi and other organisms that are commonly distributed on surface soil in drylands belnap 2006 bowker et al 2013 although the thickness of biocrusts is usually very thin a few millimeters or centimeters xiao et al 2019c these organisms strongly impact surface soil characteristics including soil texture roughness structure aggregation micro and macro porosity as well as fertility belnap 2006 xiao et al 2019a more importantly as an important ecosystem engineer biocrusts significantly regulate soil hydrological ecological biological and chemical processes acting as pioneering species to accelerate the progress of vegetation restoration bowker et al 2008 li et al 2018 therefore it is well supported that biocrusts have an essential role in regulating local water balance and surface hydrology in arid and semiarid climate regions chamizo et al 2012b eldridge et al 2020 at present some studies have found that biocrusts have a significant impact on non rainfall water deposition in dryland ecosystems fischer et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 it has been reported that biocrusts improved non rainfall water deposition capacity by changing the soil properties chamizo et al 2012a and regulating the microtopography of surface soil fischer et al 2012 however few studies focus on biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition capacity and distribution along soil depth most research on this subject focuses on the difference in physical and chemical soil processes during non rainfall water formation fischer et al 2012 and some of the outcomes of non rainfall water pulses such as the response of carbon and nitrogen delgado baquerizo et al 2013 kidron et al 2014 however the biocrust effects on dryland water balance through facilitation of non rainfall water input have not been reported to date what is the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths do different types of biocrusts play different role in non rainfall water deposition these questions require further exploration and hence any additional knowledge about non rainfall water deposition modulation by biocrusts such as dew or vapor condensation may improve our understanding regarding the complex interrelations responsible for water balance in drylands in this study we hypothesized that the presence of biocrusts would significantly affect non rainfall water deposition and distribution in drylands based on this hypothesis we conducted non rainfall water deposition measurements for bare soil and different types of biocrusts cyanobacterial crusts cyanobacterial moss mixed crusts and moss crusts in a semiarid climate on the chinese loess plateau the specific objectives of this study were i to determine the effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water deposition and their relationships with microclimate factors ii to clarify the main water sources of non rainfall water induced by biocrusts and quantify the biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation processes iii to compare the variations of non rainfall water amounts along a soil depth gradient in biocrusts and bare soil and iv to explain the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition based upon their influences on surface soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

continental monsoonal climate the potential evaporation is 1337 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c which ranges from 9 7 c in winter to 23 7 c in summer xiao and veste 2017 the average annual precipitation in this area is 409 mm with 70 80 falling during the summer june to september water is the most limited resource in ecological restoration and agricultural production in this area jia et al 2019 xiao and veste 2017 the soil was highly susceptible to water and wind erosion before the implementation of grain for green project which imposed limits on grazing and tillage practices zhang

keng festuca ovina linn artemisia desertorum spreng cotoneaster horizontalis dcne and hippophae rhamnoides linn gao et al 2017 in this watershed biocrusts widely developed spontaneously on the stabilized soil surfaces and now cover 30 of the land and sometimes as much as 70 80 xiao et al 2019a the biocrust types are variable and comprised of both cyanobacterial and moss dominated types and intermediates with mosses being the dominant autotrophs 2 2 experimental design bare soil soil without any biocrusts and three representative types of biocrusts were investigated in this study which include cyanobacteria crusts cyano crusts cyanobacterial cover was 90 fig 1e cyanobacteria and moss mixed crusts mixed crusts both cyanobacterial and moss cover were 50 fig 1f and moss crusts moss cover was 90 fig 1g in this study the non rainfall water amount refers to the sum of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation the non rainfall water measurements included three experiments applied for the above four treatments focused on i daily non rainfall water amount and its formation processes ii partitioning and measuring the amount of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation and iii non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths we weighed cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters to obtain the accurate non rainfall water amount of different types of biocrusts and bare soil using established methods similar to those in previous studies liu et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 to test for possible artifacts caused by lysimeter induced changed in soil temperature we conducted a pilot study in which we simultaneously measured the soil temperature in micro lysimeters and natural nearby soils at 2 5 and 10 cm depths from 6 00 to 20 00 the results showed that the micro lysimeters did not induce changes soil temperature fig s1 furthermore different types of micro lysimeters were used in these experiments table 1 before sampling we investigated and chose an open and flat place 50 m 50 m without any vascular plant cover and all experiments and associated measurements were conducted in this common location fig 1b in order to reduce the non rainfall water loss through evaporation during the weighing process each micro lysimeter was taken out to weigh and put back immediately after the measurement within 10 s 2 3 measurements of non rainfall water amount 2 3 1 measurements of daily non rainfall water amount and its formation processes the experimental non rainfall water measurements were conducted from july to october 2019 the in situ daily non rainfall water amount was collected in type a cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters in 5 replicates table 1 all the micro lysimeters were pushed into the soil carefully to collect soil to a depth of 0 10 cm in an intact core for each treatment before installing micro lysimeters e g 10 cm long micro lysimeters we installed larger pvc cylinders 15 5 cm in inner diameter and 11 cm in height see fig s2 about 1 cm above the ground surface and removed the soil within micro lysimeters were installed within the pvc cylinders flush with the level of the soil outside of the cylinders finally the interspace between the inner and outer pvc cylinders of each micro lysimeter was filled with polystyrene foam the thickness is 2 cm see fig s2 to diminish thermal convection moreover the bottom and side face of micro lysimeter was fit tightly to the underlying soil and polystyrene respectively thus the soil in the micro lysimeter was only lit by direct sunlight striking the surface resulting in a similar thermal regime as a natural soil column the same general method was used to install the other types of lysimeter as well detailed below the daily non rainfall water amount mm for a micro lysimeter was calculated as the difference between the weights of the morning 7 00 and previous sunset 19 00 in addition all measurements were carried out only on clear days and were stopped if rainfall events occurred all of the micro lysimeters were manually weighed with an electronic balance 0 01 g equaling 0 001 mm of water overall the non rainfall water amount was calculated in mm of liquid water through eq 1 1 h 10 m ρ π r 2 where h is non rainfall water amount in mm m is the increased weight of micro lysimeter in g ρ is the density of water which is 1 0 g cm 3 r is the inner radius of micro lysimeter which is 5 25 cm furthermore all the micro lysimeters type a were weighed consecutively within 48 h in intervals of 2 h from 18 00 to accurate quantify the biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation and evaporation processes these experiments took place on several continuous clear days the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation were calculated as the change in mass per hour through eq 2 2 h r h i t where h r is rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation in mm h 1 h i is the changed weight during a period in mm t is the time interval which is 2 h in this study 2 3 2 measurements of vapor condensation from atmosphere and deep soil in order to analyze the biocrust effects on water sources in non rainfall water deposition at 0 10 cm depth two types of sealed micro lysimeters were designed types b and c both in 5 replicates table 1 to collect non rainfall water in the case of type b the top of the micro lysimeter was sealed by plastic film to prevent water vapor exchange with the surface soil atmosphere but a 300 mesh nylon net formed its bottom see fig s3 thus the soil vapor condensation i e vapor condensation of deep moist soil was the main water source of non rainfall water in micro lysimeter most importantly the top sealed micro lysimeter was covered by plastic film only at night and the plastic film was completely removed during daytime to make sure it received the same solar radiation as the other micro lysimeters in the case of type c the bottom of the micro lysimeter was sealed by a rubberized fabric to exclude the water vapor exchanging from deep moist soil see fig s3 which means that the atmospheric vapor condensation i e vapor condensation from the atmosphere is the main input water source the total non rainfall water amount at the 0 10 cm depth was calculated as the sum of separately measured atmospheric vapor condensation and vapor condensation from deep moist soil consequently the fraction of water source inputs was calculated through eq 3 3 p h n h t 100 where p is percentage of the total non rainfall water amount composed by either atmospheric or soil vapor condensation in h n is the daily non rainfall water amount of either atmospheric vapor condensation or soil vapor condensation depending on the type of lysimeter in mm h t is the total daily non rainfall water amount calculated as the sum of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation in this study in mm 2 3 3 measurements of non rainfall water distribution by soil depths in order to distinguish the effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths the type d micro lysimeter similar to that of pan et al 2018 was installed to measure the non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths respectively in 5 replicates table 1 and fig s4 in brief we assembled the type d micro lysimeters by stacking three small micro lysimeters 10 5 cm inner diameter and 3 or 4 cm in height bottom covered by 300 mesh nylon net all micro lysimeters were used to collect undisturbed soil samples carefully at a depth of 0 10 cm and they were stacked making sure the bottom of micro lysimeters were fit closely to the top of underlying soil surface see fig s4 during the experiments we weighed the soil samples from top to bottom at sunrise and sunset and repositioned them immediately to avoid the influences of rainfall we used a rainfall exclusion shelter 2 0 m in width 2 0 m in length and 1 0 m in height during rainfall events a transparent and colorless plastic film covered the top of shelter during rainfall events and was removed in between them the sides of the shelter were open with good ventilation the fraction of non rainfall water at the different depths was calculated in eq 3 and the non rainfall water amount at the 0 10 cm depth in this part was the sum of non rainfall water at the 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths 2 4 measurements of soil properties and meteorological factors before soil sampling 2 m 2 m of each treatment was demarcated and used to estimate the cover of biocrusts by processing digital photographs in the imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health the soil surface was photographed under daylight conditions beneath a whitish opaque foil light tent to diffuse the light and avoid direct radiation and we applied rigorous and repeatable methods of image processing to determine the biocrusts coverage through following procedures firstly a geometric correction of the photos was implemented by establishing a relationship between the location of pixels in the image and the corresponding coordinates on the soil surface secondly the color threshold between biocrusts and bare soil was adjusted by visual check and then the biocrusts cover area was separated from the bare soil lastly a binary picture was obtained and the biocrust cover was automatically calculated by imagej in 5 replicates in addition petri dishes 9 cm in diameter and 2 cm height were used to collect the biocrust layer and underlying soil to measure moss density and total biomass xiao et al 2019c the surface soil roughness was measured through the chain method jester and klik 2005 furthermore intact soil cores 5 cm height and 100 cm3 in volume were collected for each treatment in 6 replicates to measure soil bulk density and particle composition in the laboratory the thickness of the biocrust layer was measured using a digital vernier caliper and moss plants were separated from the soil with water through a 2 mm sieve and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass xiao et al 2019c the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and soil organic matter content was measured by the dichromate redox titration method during the measurements of the non rainfall water formation processes the surface temperature of the biocrust layer and bare soil 0 3 cm depth were measured using an infrared thermometer fluke mt4max with a measurement range of 30 400 c and an accuracy of 1 c the air temperature dew point and relative humidity at a height of 2 0 m were monitored by an automatic weather micro station throughout the whole experimental period see figs s5 s6 2 5 data analysis the experimental data were analyzed based on descriptive statistics and the differences among the four treatments all statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss statistics 22 0 after normality and equality of variance tests repeated measures anova was used to test the differences in the daily monthly minimum maximum and total non rainfall water amount between the bare soil and different types of biocrusts we did not have a temporal hypothesis to test but rather used this method to account for temporal auto correlation because these data were re measured many times we used one way anova with a least significant difference lsd post hoc test at the p 0 05 level of significance to test for differences among the soil physicochemical properties between the bare soil and different types of biocrusts we used pearson correlation analysis to determine the degree to which soil temperature and meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity and dew point associated with non rainfall water formation with each 2 h interval across a 48 h measurement period serving as a replicate 3 results 3 1 biocrust effects on surface soil physicochemical properties the biocrusts decreased soil bulk density but increased the surface roughness and the contents of clay and organic matter at 0 5 cm depth the bulk density of the biocrusts was 10 0 26 9 lower than that of bare soil table 2 this was especially true for the moss crusts the bulk density was decreased by 0 35 g cm 3 in comparison to the bare soil table 2 however the fine particles content clay and silt of biocrusts was 4 fold higher with the clay content being 1 3 fold higher in the biocrusts than that in the bare soil moreover the organic matter content of the biocrusts was up to 28 5 g kg 1 which was 2 5 fold higher than that of the bare soil table 2 furthermore the surface roughness of the biocrusts was 9 2 361 4 greater than bare soils and it was highest in the mixed crusts which was 4 4 fold rougher than the bare soil 3

and table 3 specifically the daily mean non rainfall water amount of the biocrusts averaged 13 0 21 7 higher than that of the bare soil at the 0 10 cm depth table 3 especially the daily mean non rainfall water amount of moss crusts and mixed crusts was higher f 4 82 p 0 003 table 3 than that of the bare soil in comparison to bare soil biocrusts significantly increased total non rainfall water amount by 10 1 24 4 at the 0 10 cm depth from july to october and the total non rainfall water amount of moss crusts averaged 1 2 times higher 21 18 vs 17 52 mm table 3 than that of the bare soil additionally the monthly non rainfall water amount reached a peak in august and then declined in october table 3 the daily non rainfall water amount of moss crusts was the highest in august 0 32 mm which was higher by 17 9 6 7 and 3 2 than that of the bare soil cyano crusts and mixed crusts respectively fig 3 and table 3 3 3 biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation and evaporation processes biocrusts significantly increased the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation at the 0 3 cm depth compared to bare soil f 2 867 p 0 039 figs 4 5 biocrusts increased non rainfall water formation by 41 7 0 017 vs 0 012 mm h 1 fig 5 on average and increased non rainfall water evaporation rate by 52 6 0 029 vs 0 019 mm h 1 fig 5 on average compared to the bare soil the non rainfall water accumulation amount of the biocrusts was higher by 0 04 0 09 mm with a maximum of 0 20 mm fig 4 compared to bare soil for the moss crusts the non rainfall water accumulation amount was higher by 93 3 122 2 in comparison to that of the bare soil fig 4 correspondingly the biocrusts enlarged the daily surface soil temperature differences between the crusted and uncrusted soils during the non rainfall water formation processes specifically they increased the surface soil temperature by 2 6 8 4 c during daytime in comparison to the bare soil however they cooled rapidly at night and did not differ from the bare soil from 18 00 6 00 fig s7 3 4 biocrust effects on water sources of non rainfall water the biocrusts had a significantly higher amount of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation as compared with the bare soil f 6 13 p 0 001 table 4 and fig s8 during the experimental period the biocrusts had a higher soil vapor condensation amount by 20 0 30 0 and a higher atmospheric vapor condensation amount by 114 3 142 9 than that of the bare soil at the 0 10 cm depth table 4 particularly the soil vapor condensation amount of the mixed crusts and moss crusts was significantly higher 0 13 vs 0 10 mm table 4 than that of the bare soil the biocrusts entrapped a greater proportion of water vapor from the atmosphere than surface soil fig s8 and the atmospheric vapor condensation of the bare soil was lower 0 07 vs 0 10 mm fig s9a than soil vapor condensation furthermore the atmospheric vapor condensation amount of the mixed crusts and moss crusts was more than double that of the bare soil 0 16 vs 0 07 mm table 4 for moss crusts the soil vapor condensation amount was higher by up to 149 9 0 17 vs 0 7 mm fig s9b compared to the bare soil 3 5 biocrust effects on non rainfall water distribution along soil depths the daily mean non rainfall water amount was highest at the 0 3 cm depth 0 22 mm and the biocrusts significantly increased the non rainfall water amount at that depth 69 4 in total fig 6 and table s1 during the experimental periods the daily non rainfall water amount at 0 3 cm followed the order of moss crusts mixed crusts cyano crusts bare soil f 45 34 p 0 001 table s1 the differences were slight in deeper soils f 4 35 p 0 08 table s1 and the non rainfall water amount at the 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths declined rapidly compared to the surface averaging 0 10 mm 25 8 in total fig 6 and table s1 as compared with the bare soil the biocrusts increased the daily mean non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 cm depth by 1 7 fold higher 0 17 vs 0 10 mm and the percentage in total of the biocrusts was up to 10 8 higher than that of bare soil on average 69 9 vs 59 1 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 biocrust effects on soil non rainfall water deposition and their underlying mechanisms in our study non rainfall water in biocrusts was substantially higher than in bare soil fig 3 and table 3 suggesting that biocrust colonization on the loess plateau of china has enhanced the capture of this water source this improvement of non rainfall water deposition capacity can be reasonably attributed to the biocrust effects on soil physicochemical properties gao et al 2017 kakeh et al 2018 i e the decreasing percentage of coarse particles and bulk density as well as the increasing percentage of fine particles organic matter content and roughness of the biocrusts in comparison to bare soil table 2 therefore biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition can be explained by the following three processes first the biocrusts strongly regulate surface soil properties in this study the biocrusts enriched fine particles clay and silt especially moss crusts elevated amounts of fine particles in biocrusts may come from the capture and fixation of mineral dust mobilized by off site wind erosion reynolds et al 2001 rozenstein et al 2014 or through superior protection of fines from erosion abed et al 2013 gao et al 2017 the biocrusts layer has a greater mineral specific surface area because of the higher fine particle contents and therefore provide more surface for non rainfall water deposition in comparison to bare soil grismer 1987 schneider and goss 2012 furthermore the organic matter content of biocrusts was markedly higher than that of bare soil due to the ability of biocrusts to fix atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis and deposit carbon in soil for example as extracellular polymeric substances kakeh et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 specifically extracellular polymeric substances eps and other forms of organic matter may have prolonged near surface water saturation enhancing the onset of the phase transition from vapor to liquid water adessi et al 2018 schneider and goss 2012 consequently the biocrusts likely changed multiple surface soil properties that favored greater capacity to capture and hold water second the macromorphological changes caused by e g freezing and thawing influence the development of soil roughness over time wang et al 2017 because the stability of biocrusts preserves this microtopography biocrusts have higher surface soil roughness compared to bare soil and can present a greater soil surface area for dew and fog precipitation kidron et al 2002 wang et al 2017 third moss morphology in particular plays a triggering role in non rainfall water deposition kidron et al 2002 pan et al 2016 in our study mixed crusts and moss crusts have much more non rainfall water deposition than either cyano crusts or bare soil fig 3 although the moss plants are only several millimeters above the surface mosses absorb water directly through stems leaves and awns from rain clouds fog and dew fig s10 nejidat et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 mosses can enhance all of the soil properties discussed above often more strongly than cyanobacterial crusts because they fix greater amounts of carbon and enhance roughness and surface area particularly well by protruding above the surface leading to better capture of fines furthermore the specific surface structures of moss stems leaves and awns are the sites of nucleation of non rainfall water which means that they may be important in terms of water collection and transport holder 2012 pan et al 2016 tao and zhang 2012 as reported by pan et al 2016 and tao and zhang 2012 the presence of awns alone e g in syntrichia caninervis has been experimentally demonstrated to boost non rainfall water collection by 20 additionally the mosses have papillae and lamellae on their costae as well as moss cushions and the rhizoids root like structures that anchor the plants to the ground which play an important part in water collection imbibition transportation and storage tao and zhang 2012 consequently the successional transition from cyanobacterial to moss biocrusts should be expected to strongly increase non rainfall water condensation capacity signaling a key functional shift 4 2 biocrust influences on the non rainfall water formation rate and soil temperature range in this study we were able to show that the biocrusts significantly increased the non rainfall water deposition capacity of the surface by the use of micro lysimeter figs 4 6 yet the non rainfall water deposition was mostly being temperature dependent and some studies pointed out that preferential nocturnal cooling through the walls of the micro lysimeter was shown to significantly increase the amount of vapor condensed kidron and kronenfeld 2017 however the effects of micro lysimeter on soil temperature at daytime are slight as compared to ambient conditions in this study fig s1 albeit the soil temperature maybe different at night and changed the non rainfall water formation rate however by using concomitantly biocrusted and uncrusted soil columns within the micro lysimeter the inherent drawback of the micro lysimeter i e their tendency to influence the actual values at the intact soil was avoided in addition to higher amounts of non rainfall water our results showed that biocrusts were also associated with higher non rainfall water formation rates particularly when mosses were co dominant or dominant fig 5 in general non rainfall water occurs when the surface temperature falls below the dew point and is primarily influenced by vapor pressure air temperature radiation exchange on the earth s surface the heat and vapor transport in the underlying soil among other factors agam and berliner 2006 kidron 2010 zhang et al 2009 in this study the non rainfall water amount was negatively correlated with soil temperature air temperature dew point and surface temperature while it was positively correlated with the relative humidity table 5 it is often reported that biocrusts increase soil temperature through decreasing surface albedo and increasing the absorption of solar radiation due to their higher biomass and dark color belnap 1995 xiao et al 2016 for example xiao and bowker 2020 recently documented a decrease in albedo of 43 in moss biocrusts compared to bare soil the biocrust effects on soil temperature is also mediated through modification of soil physical properties kidron 2010 xiao et al 2019b although the biocrust layer is usually several millimeters to centimeters thick at most bulk density water content macro aggregation fine particle content and organic matter content are all modified niu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 these modifications result in higher heat capacity thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity than bare soils under the same conditions xiao et al 2016 2019b because of the elevated heat gain of biocrusts during the day the heat loss at night is more precipitous than in bare soils more rapidly cooling surfaces can trigger a phase transition of water vapor into liquid zhang et al 2009 hence the biocrusts increase the rate of temperature rise and subsequent fall and this expands the diurnal range of temperature on the soil atmosphere interface as compared with bare soil kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2019b this result is consistent with the reports by liu et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 and jia et al 2014 who concluded that the biocrusts enlarge the diurnal range of surface temperature which is believed to be one of the key factors in enhancing non rainfall water amounts 4 3 biocrusts alter the sources of non rainfall water from atmosphere and deep soil in this study atmospheric vapor condensation was the primary moisture source for non rainfall water deposition as opposed to soil vapor condensation and biocrusts exhibited higher atmospheric vapor condensation amounts by up to 149 9 in contrast to bare soils table 4 this contrast became more pronounced as mosses became more prevalent figs s8 s9 under normal conditions the free atmospheric vapor and moisture from deep soil are two main water sources that contribute to non rainfall water formation fischer et al 2012 pan et al 2018 the soil water content is low in drylands and water transmission is primarily due to the slow process of vapor diffusion to the atmosphere bringing moisture to the surface on account of lower soil moisture content compared with atmospheric water vapor in arid and semiarid climate regions the water vapor amount from the deep soil migrating to the surface under the temperature gradients is generally small pan et al 2018 however biocrust induced changes in underlying soil properties can result in a higher water holding capacity and thus we would expect that more vapor from deep soil would be available for condensation adessi et al 2018 fischer et al 2012 xiao et al 2019b this expectation is not inconsistent with our data but the greater influence of biocrusts appears to be enhancement of non rainfall water from atmospheric sources generally the atmospheric water vapor includes water vapor within the air near the soil surface and from plant transpiration and respiration and soil water vapor is found within pores below the soil surface pan et al 2018 correspondingly because biocrusts significantly increased the atmospheric vapor condensation amount this important water sources is also the main supplemental water for biocrusts zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2018 especially the moss colonization stage biocrusts e g mixed crusts and moss crusts can directly absorb water through moss stems leaves awns cushions and rhizoids and so on pan et al 2016 tao and zhang 2012 therefore on account of the condensing atmospheric vapor moss biocrusts visibly become green in the morning conducting photosynthesis delgado baquerizo et al 2013 and possibly contributing to nitrogen and carbon cycling processes belnap 2002 belnap et al 2004 4 4 biocrusts alter non rainfall water distribution by depth concentrating it in the surface in our study the biocrusts changed the non rainfall water distribution by soil depth and significantly increased the non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 cm depth 69 4 as compared with bare soil fig 6 and table s1 which means biocrusts condensed more water vapor primarily in shallow soil the different non rainfall water amounts between surface and substratum was probably mostly attributable to temperature gradients saito et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 generally the liquid water and vapor fluxes are both affected by the soil temperature du et al 2018 and the movement of liquid water and water vapor in the subsurface is driven by both pressure head and temperature gradients saito et al 2006 because surface soils dramatically change temperature du et al 2018 saito et al 2006 whereas subsurface soils maintain more stable temperatures temperature gradients are established du et al 2018 zeng et al 2011 physical distance and moderate temperature shifts mean that substratum soil is unlikely to obtain much water vapor from the atmosphere directly rather the vapor condensed from moist deeper soil should be expected to be the main water source for non rainfall water formation below the surface fischer et al 2012 pan et al 2018 namely during the non rainfall water formation process the surface soil created a pivotal non rainfall water formation region as compared with substratum soil pan et al 2018 although biocrusts are only a surficial phenomenon they drastically affected the distribution of non rainfall water by depth in our study biocrusts greatly enlarged the differences in non rainfall water amount between the surface 0 3 cm and deeper soil 6 10 cm fig 6 and table s1 they likely did so by more than one mechanism as elaborated previously their enhancement of diurnal temperature fluctuation and nighttime cooling rate at the surface likely boosted non rainfall water from atmospheric sources and did so especially strongly in the surface 3 cm another mechanism is a mulching effect in which they stabilize temperatures at depth xiao et al 2016 2019a 2019b 2019c consequently even as the surface soil temperature changes more dramatically the subsoil temperature of biocrusts was dampened making it more difficult to reach the dew point to condense water vapor from deep soil these two contrary forces induced by biocrusts likely resulted in the strong contrast between surface and subsurface non rainfall water that we saw 4 5 implication of biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition in dryland water balance from our results we conclude that the biocrusts significantly increased non rainfall water deposition capacity in the semiarid portion of the loess plateau of china it was known that the biocrust influences on non rainfall water deposition strongly depend on meteorological factors soil texture biocrust types moss morphology and so on ouyang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 nonetheless it is still challenging to evaluate the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition and its role in the water balance in dryland ecosystems accordingly we reviewed the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition including dew formation and vapor condensation in different regions in table 6 the non rainfall water is an indispensable source of liquid water and even greater than ephemeral rainfall events in extreme drought regions e g the alexander bay of south africa the negev desert of israel and other chinese desert areas kidron 2010 maphangwa et al 2012 pan et al 2010 in an extreme case maphangwa et al 2012 the non rainfall water intercepted by bare gypsum soil was 10 times greater than the measured rainfall amount 510 0 vs 43 0 mm and that solely by lichens was up to 3 times greater than the rainfall amount 152 0 vs 43 0 mm consequently that biocrusts significantly increase the soil non rainfall water deposition capacity is broadly supported in the available literature in this study although we have not estimated the annual cumulative non rainfall water in the chinese loess plateau the 4 months cumulative non rainfall water amount of biocrusts was about 5 of annual rainfall in chinese loess plateau 21 2 vs 409 0 mm therefore there is no doubt that the non rainfall water makes a substantive contribution to the water budget through the long stable periods favoring vapor condensation agam and berliner 2004 pan et al 2018 although the non rainfall water amount was usually smaller in quantity ancillary water wets and dries the upper soil surface more frequently than rainfall in arid areas and strongly influences organisms that dwell on the soil surface jia et al 2014 pan et al 2018 according to the studies of kappen et al 1979 and pan et al 2018 the minimum non rainfall water amount of 0 03 mm is the threshold value for the non rainfall water to become available to microorganisms in our study the mean amount of daily non rainfall water in both biocrusts and bare soils was higher than 0 03 mm meaning that a typical deposition event in the region is likely to induce biological activity though the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water is significant and meaningful this important phenomenon is still undervalued in drylands the entire literature on biocrust effects on non rainfall water is only a few papers by a few research groups in a few locations a recent meta analysis by eldridge et al 2020 about the influence of biocrusts on water in the world s drylands did not account for non rainfall water at all likely because of the paucity of studies the meta analysis shows a pervasive influence of biocrusts on many properties and processes related to soil water and a better understanding of biocrust effects on non rainfall water would help us complete the puzzle we should seek to better understand how the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water may play a critical role in many ecosystem processes xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and how much of dryland ecosystem function can be directly attributed to non rainfall water pulses 5 conclusion in this study we analyzed the differences of non rainfall water deposition between bare soil and different types of biocrusts cyano crusts mixed crusts and moss crusts in a dryland ecosystems our results indicated that biocrusts greatly increased non rainfall water amount by about 70 due to the higher contents of fine particles and organic matter higher daily soil temperature differences and moss morphology moreover the presence of biocrusts significantly increased the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation and boosted the condensation of both soil sourced and especially atmospherically sourced vapor all of these effects showed that biocrusts are playing an important role in regulating surface soil water balance in dryland ecosystems we can conservatively estimate that in our study area the capture of non rainfall water by biocrusts increases ecosystem water inputs by about 5 and does so in periods of time when rainfall is scarce because most non rainfall water deposition events are typically sufficient to activate biocrusts and other soil microbiota it appears that this understudied water input may be important for biological activity and therefore ecosystem function in our study system and perhaps other water

4814,non rainfall water deposition is an important water resource critical for the survival of dryland vegetation and soil biota and maintaining dryland water balance as a living skin biocrusts are attracting increasing attention due to their potentially positive impacts on non rainfall water deposition however the magnitude and underlying mechanisms of biocrust regulation of non rainfall water are still unclear in this study we investigated the non rainfall water deposition and distribution through continuous weighing micro lysimeters 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths with bare soil and three types of biocrusts cyanobacterial crusts cyanobacterial moss mixed crusts and moss crusts in a semiarid region of the chinese loess plateau our results showed that the biocrusts were associated with significantly greater non rainfall water deposition capacity 13 22 in contrast to the bare soil and biocrust type strongly influenced the daily non rainfall water amount in the order moss crusts mixed crusts cyanobacterial crusts bare soil biocrusts were also associated with faster rates of non rainfall water formation 42 f 2 87 p 0 04 which may be linked to faster nighttime cooling in comparison to the bare soil atmospheric vapor condensation was the primary water source for non rainfall water deposition at the 0 10 cm depth as opposed to soil vapor condensation biocrusts had higher condensation from both sources and had relatively more deposition from the atmosphere atmospheric vapor condensation was greater by 114 143 and soil vapor condensation was greater by 20 30 moreover 69 of the total non rainfall water amount occurred in the top 3 cm of soil the strong biocrust influence in the uppermost centimeters f 45 34 p 0 001 appears to primarily drive the contrasts in non rainfall water deposition in soils furthermore all of the apparent effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water deposition and distribution were reasonably attributed to the biocrust influences on soil physicochemical properties especially the contents of fine particles organic matter high soil roughness daily temperature difference and moss morphology in conclusion biocrusts are associated with much greater non rainfall water deposition capacity and change non rainfall water distribution along with soil depth implying that they play a critical role in surface soil water balance of dryland ecosystems keywords biological soil crust micro lysimeter water vapor condensation dew formation soil water balance chinese loess plateau 1 introduction drylands are widespread terrestrial ecosystems in which precipitation is counterbalanced by evaporation from surfaces and transpiration by plants often making them fragile huang et al 2015 reynolds et al 2007 in dryland ecosystems water availability is the most vital limiting factor in soil physical chemical biological and ecological processes zhang et al 2009 and any sources of water can have important impacts kidron 2010 xiao et al 2009 non rainfall water is a common and natural meteorological phenomenon which comprises fog dew and water vapor sorption and it plays a significant role in the water balance of dryland ecosystems florentin and agam 2017 uclés et al 2016 compared with rainfall and evaporation the daily non rainfall water amount is assumed to be very small i e usually a fraction of a millimeter but it is an indispensable water source for biocrusts insects small animals and certain plants during drought periods jacobs et al 1999 xiao et al 2009 consequently non rainfall water is a crucial water supplement and significantly contributes to the water cycle in near surface soil florentin and agam 2017 as a natural physical process non rainfall water has been investigated in some arid and semiarid regions humid tropical islands and even in cold alpine areas kidron 2010 xiao et al 2009 usually the deposition of non rainfall water may in turn modify surface reflective properties influence larger scale atmospheric moisture levels and consequently recharge soil moisture levels agam and berliner 2006 pan et al 2018 furthermore because of the lack of rainfall in arid and semiarid areas during dry spells the accumulation of non rainfall water e g monthly means and seasonal means may account for a large percentage of total water inputs kidron 2010 li et al 2018 for example studies in israel and south africa estimated that non rainfall water may comprise more than a third of or even exceed the annual rainfall kidron and tal 2012 maphangwa et al 2012 on account of the long stable vapor periods favoring condensation non rainfall water contributes greatly to the water budget and plays a vital role in the water balance of some vascular plants agam and berliner 2004 generally the free atmosphere and vapor emitted from the topsoil are the main water sources for non rainfall water deposition on the soil surface agam and berliner 2006 fischer et al 2012 however a major limitation in evaluating the ecological role of non rainfall water is difficulty of measurement especially for assessing its long term variability zhuang and zhao 2017 therefore various methods and instruments have been developed for the measurements of non rainfall water deposition in the past decade such as automated weighing lysimeters xiao et al 2009 2013 micro lysimeters pan et al 2010 the cloth plate method kidron and temina 2017 electrical impedance grids pedro and gillespie 1981 and leaf wetness sensors scherm and van bruggen 1993 the weight method using weighing micro lysimeters is the most common and convenient way to continuously obtain weight changes during dew formation process agam and berliner 2006 despite the availability of these technologies non rainfall water deposition in drylands remains undermeasured and thus underappreciated biocrusts are communities of cyanobacteria lichens mosses fungi and other organisms that are commonly distributed on surface soil in drylands belnap 2006 bowker et al 2013 although the thickness of biocrusts is usually very thin a few millimeters or centimeters xiao et al 2019c these organisms strongly impact surface soil characteristics including soil texture roughness structure aggregation micro and macro porosity as well as fertility belnap 2006 xiao et al 2019a more importantly as an important ecosystem engineer biocrusts significantly regulate soil hydrological ecological biological and chemical processes acting as pioneering species to accelerate the progress of vegetation restoration bowker et al 2008 li et al 2018 therefore it is well supported that biocrusts have an essential role in regulating local water balance and surface hydrology in arid and semiarid climate regions chamizo et al 2012b eldridge et al 2020 at present some studies have found that biocrusts have a significant impact on non rainfall water deposition in dryland ecosystems fischer et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 it has been reported that biocrusts improved non rainfall water deposition capacity by changing the soil properties chamizo et al 2012a and regulating the microtopography of surface soil fischer et al 2012 however few studies focus on biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition capacity and distribution along soil depth most research on this subject focuses on the difference in physical and chemical soil processes during non rainfall water formation fischer et al 2012 and some of the outcomes of non rainfall water pulses such as the response of carbon and nitrogen delgado baquerizo et al 2013 kidron et al 2014 however the biocrust effects on dryland water balance through facilitation of non rainfall water input have not been reported to date what is the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths do different types of biocrusts play different role in non rainfall water deposition these questions require further exploration and hence any additional knowledge about non rainfall water deposition modulation by biocrusts such as dew or vapor condensation may improve our understanding regarding the complex interrelations responsible for water balance in drylands in this study we hypothesized that the presence of biocrusts would significantly affect non rainfall water deposition and distribution in drylands based on this hypothesis we conducted non rainfall water deposition measurements for bare soil and different types of biocrusts cyanobacterial crusts cyanobacterial moss mixed crusts and moss crusts in a semiarid climate on the chinese loess plateau the specific objectives of this study were i to determine the effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water deposition and their relationships with microclimate factors ii to clarify the main water sources of non rainfall water induced by biocrusts and quantify the biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation processes iii to compare the variations of non rainfall water amounts along a soil depth gradient in biocrusts and bare soil and iv to explain the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition based upon their influences on surface soil properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site we conducted our study at the liudaogou watershed 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n fig 1 a b in the shenmu county on the northern loess plateau china this area covers about 6 89 km2 and ranges in altitude from 1081 to 1274 m it is situated at the center of the wind water erosion crisscross region in which both wind and water erosion processes are prevalent and has a typical semiarid continental monsoonal climate the potential evaporation is 1337 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 4 c which ranges from 9 7 c in winter to 23 7 c in summer xiao and veste 2017 the average annual precipitation in this area is 409 mm with 70 80 falling during the summer june to september water is the most limited resource in ecological restoration and agricultural production in this area jia et al 2019 xiao and veste 2017 the soil was highly susceptible to water and wind erosion before the implementation of grain for green project which imposed limits on grazing and tillage practices zhang et al 2011 in the past decades extensive shrub planting has been undertaken to conserve soil and water xiao et al 2019b the common vegetation in this region is comprised of bothriochloa ischaemum linn keng festuca ovina linn artemisia desertorum spreng cotoneaster horizontalis dcne and hippophae rhamnoides linn gao et al 2017 in this watershed biocrusts widely developed spontaneously on the stabilized soil surfaces and now cover 30 of the land and sometimes as much as 70 80 xiao et al 2019a the biocrust types are variable and comprised of both cyanobacterial and moss dominated types and intermediates with mosses being the dominant autotrophs 2 2 experimental design bare soil soil without any biocrusts and three representative types of biocrusts were investigated in this study which include cyanobacteria crusts cyano crusts cyanobacterial cover was 90 fig 1e cyanobacteria and moss mixed crusts mixed crusts both cyanobacterial and moss cover were 50 fig 1f and moss crusts moss cover was 90 fig 1g in this study the non rainfall water amount refers to the sum of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation the non rainfall water measurements included three experiments applied for the above four treatments focused on i daily non rainfall water amount and its formation processes ii partitioning and measuring the amount of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation and iii non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths we weighed cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters to obtain the accurate non rainfall water amount of different types of biocrusts and bare soil using established methods similar to those in previous studies liu et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 to test for possible artifacts caused by lysimeter induced changed in soil temperature we conducted a pilot study in which we simultaneously measured the soil temperature in micro lysimeters and natural nearby soils at 2 5 and 10 cm depths from 6 00 to 20 00 the results showed that the micro lysimeters did not induce changes soil temperature fig s1 furthermore different types of micro lysimeters were used in these experiments table 1 before sampling we investigated and chose an open and flat place 50 m 50 m without any vascular plant cover and all experiments and associated measurements were conducted in this common location fig 1b in order to reduce the non rainfall water loss through evaporation during the weighing process each micro lysimeter was taken out to weigh and put back immediately after the measurement within 10 s 2 3 measurements of non rainfall water amount 2 3 1 measurements of daily non rainfall water amount and its formation processes the experimental non rainfall water measurements were conducted from july to october 2019 the in situ daily non rainfall water amount was collected in type a cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters in 5 replicates table 1 all the micro lysimeters were pushed into the soil carefully to collect soil to a depth of 0 10 cm in an intact core for each treatment before installing micro lysimeters e g 10 cm long micro lysimeters we installed larger pvc cylinders 15 5 cm in inner diameter and 11 cm in height see fig s2 about 1 cm above the ground surface and removed the soil within micro lysimeters were installed within the pvc cylinders flush with the level of the soil outside of the cylinders finally the interspace between the inner and outer pvc cylinders of each micro lysimeter was filled with polystyrene foam the thickness is 2 cm see fig s2 to diminish thermal convection moreover the bottom and side face of micro lysimeter was fit tightly to the underlying soil and polystyrene respectively thus the soil in the micro lysimeter was only lit by direct sunlight striking the surface resulting in a similar thermal regime as a natural soil column the same general method was used to install the other types of lysimeter as well detailed below the daily non rainfall water amount mm for a micro lysimeter was calculated as the difference between the weights of the morning 7 00 and previous sunset 19 00 in addition all measurements were carried out only on clear days and were stopped if rainfall events occurred all of the micro lysimeters were manually weighed with an electronic balance 0 01 g equaling 0 001 mm of water overall the non rainfall water amount was calculated in mm of liquid water through eq 1 1 h 10 m ρ π r 2 where h is non rainfall water amount in mm m is the increased weight of micro lysimeter in g ρ is the density of water which is 1 0 g cm 3 r is the inner radius of micro lysimeter which is 5 25 cm furthermore all the micro lysimeters type a were weighed consecutively within 48 h in intervals of 2 h from 18 00 to accurate quantify the biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation and evaporation processes these experiments took place on several continuous clear days the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation were calculated as the change in mass per hour through eq 2 2 h r h i t where h r is rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation in mm h 1 h i is the changed weight during a period in mm t is the time interval which is 2 h in this study 2 3 2 measurements of vapor condensation from atmosphere and deep soil in order to analyze the biocrust effects on water sources in non rainfall water deposition at 0 10 cm depth two types of sealed micro lysimeters were designed types b and c both in 5 replicates table 1 to collect non rainfall water in the case of type b the top of the micro lysimeter was sealed by plastic film to prevent water vapor exchange with the surface soil atmosphere but a 300 mesh nylon net formed its bottom see fig s3 thus the soil vapor condensation i e vapor condensation of deep moist soil was the main water source of non rainfall water in micro lysimeter most importantly the top sealed micro lysimeter was covered by plastic film only at night and the plastic film was completely removed during daytime to make sure it received the same solar radiation as the other micro lysimeters in the case of type c the bottom of the micro lysimeter was sealed by a rubberized fabric to exclude the water vapor exchanging from deep moist soil see fig s3 which means that the atmospheric vapor condensation i e vapor condensation from the atmosphere is the main input water source the total non rainfall water amount at the 0 10 cm depth was calculated as the sum of separately measured atmospheric vapor condensation and vapor condensation from deep moist soil consequently the fraction of water source inputs was calculated through eq 3 3 p h n h t 100 where p is percentage of the total non rainfall water amount composed by either atmospheric or soil vapor condensation in h n is the daily non rainfall water amount of either atmospheric vapor condensation or soil vapor condensation depending on the type of lysimeter in mm h t is the total daily non rainfall water amount calculated as the sum of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation in this study in mm 2 3 3 measurements of non rainfall water distribution by soil depths in order to distinguish the effects of biocrusts on non rainfall water distribution at different soil depths the type d micro lysimeter similar to that of pan et al 2018 was installed to measure the non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths respectively in 5 replicates table 1 and fig s4 in brief we assembled the type d micro lysimeters by stacking three small micro lysimeters 10 5 cm inner diameter and 3 or 4 cm in height bottom covered by 300 mesh nylon net all micro lysimeters were used to collect undisturbed soil samples carefully at a depth of 0 10 cm and they were stacked making sure the bottom of micro lysimeters were fit closely to the top of underlying soil surface see fig s4 during the experiments we weighed the soil samples from top to bottom at sunrise and sunset and repositioned them immediately to avoid the influences of rainfall we used a rainfall exclusion shelter 2 0 m in width 2 0 m in length and 1 0 m in height during rainfall events a transparent and colorless plastic film covered the top of shelter during rainfall events and was removed in between them the sides of the shelter were open with good ventilation the fraction of non rainfall water at the different depths was calculated in eq 3 and the non rainfall water amount at the 0 10 cm depth in this part was the sum of non rainfall water at the 0 3 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths 2 4 measurements of soil properties and meteorological factors before soil sampling 2 m 2 m of each treatment was demarcated and used to estimate the cover of biocrusts by processing digital photographs in the imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health the soil surface was photographed under daylight conditions beneath a whitish opaque foil light tent to diffuse the light and avoid direct radiation and we applied rigorous and repeatable methods of image processing to determine the biocrusts coverage through following procedures firstly a geometric correction of the photos was implemented by establishing a relationship between the location of pixels in the image and the corresponding coordinates on the soil surface secondly the color threshold between biocrusts and bare soil was adjusted by visual check and then the biocrusts cover area was separated from the bare soil lastly a binary picture was obtained and the biocrust cover was automatically calculated by imagej in 5 replicates in addition petri dishes 9 cm in diameter and 2 cm height were used to collect the biocrust layer and underlying soil to measure moss density and total biomass xiao et al 2019c the surface soil roughness was measured through the chain method jester and klik 2005 furthermore intact soil cores 5 cm height and 100 cm3 in volume were collected for each treatment in 6 replicates to measure soil bulk density and particle composition in the laboratory the thickness of the biocrust layer was measured using a digital vernier caliper and moss plants were separated from the soil with water through a 2 mm sieve and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass xiao et al 2019c the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 england and soil organic matter content was measured by the dichromate redox titration method during the measurements of the non rainfall water formation processes the surface temperature of the biocrust layer and bare soil 0 3 cm depth were measured using an infrared thermometer fluke mt4max with a measurement range of 30 400 c and an accuracy of 1 c the air temperature dew point and relative humidity at a height of 2 0 m were monitored by an automatic weather micro station throughout the whole experimental period see figs s5 s6 2 5 data analysis the experimental data were analyzed based on descriptive statistics and the differences among the four treatments all statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss statistics 22 0 after normality and equality of variance tests repeated measures anova was used to test the differences in the daily monthly minimum maximum and total non rainfall water amount between the bare soil and different types of biocrusts we did not have a temporal hypothesis to test but rather used this method to account for temporal auto correlation because these data were re measured many times we used one way anova with a least significant difference lsd post hoc test at the p 0 05 level of significance to test for differences among the soil physicochemical properties between the bare soil and different types of biocrusts we used pearson correlation analysis to determine the degree to which soil temperature and meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity and dew point associated with non rainfall water formation with each 2 h interval across a 48 h measurement period serving as a replicate 3 results 3 1 biocrust effects on surface soil physicochemical properties the biocrusts decreased soil bulk density but increased the surface roughness and the contents of clay and organic matter at 0 5 cm depth the bulk density of the biocrusts was 10 0 26 9 lower than that of bare soil table 2 this was especially true for the moss crusts the bulk density was decreased by 0 35 g cm 3 in comparison to the bare soil table 2 however the fine particles content clay and silt of biocrusts was 4 fold higher with the clay content being 1 3 fold higher in the biocrusts than that in the bare soil moreover the organic matter content of the biocrusts was up to 28 5 g kg 1 which was 2 5 fold higher than that of the bare soil table 2 furthermore the surface roughness of the biocrusts was 9 2 361 4 greater than bare soils and it was highest in the mixed crusts which was 4 4 fold rougher than the bare soil 3

and table 3 specifically the daily mean non rainfall water amount of the biocrusts averaged 13 0 21 7 higher than that of the bare soil at the 0 10 cm depth table 3 especially the daily mean non rainfall water amount of moss crusts and mixed crusts was higher f 4 82 p 0 003 table 3 than that of the bare soil in comparison to bare soil biocrusts significantly increased total non rainfall water amount by 10 1 24 4 at the 0 10 cm depth from july to october and the total non rainfall water amount of moss crusts averaged 1 2 times higher 21 18 vs 17 52 mm table 3 than that of the bare soil additionally the monthly non rainfall water amount reached a peak in august and then declined in october table 3 the daily non rainfall water amount of moss crusts was the highest in august 0 32 mm which was higher by 17 9 6 7 and 3 2 than that of the bare soil cyano crusts and mixed crusts respectively fig 3 and table 3 3 3 biocrust effects on non rainfall water formation and evaporation processes biocrusts significantly increased the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation at the 0 3 cm depth compared to bare soil f 2 867 p 0 039 figs 4 5 biocrusts increased non rainfall water formation by 41 7 0 017 vs 0 012 mm h 1 fig 5 on average and increased non rainfall water evaporation rate by 52 6 0 029 vs 0 019 mm h 1 fig 5 on average compared to the bare soil the non rainfall water accumulation amount of the biocrusts was higher by 0 04 0 09 mm with a maximum of 0 20 mm fig 4 compared to bare soil for the moss crusts the non rainfall water accumulation amount was higher by 93 3 122 2 in comparison to that of the bare soil fig 4 correspondingly the biocrusts enlarged the daily surface soil temperature differences between the crusted and uncrusted soils during the non rainfall water formation processes specifically they increased the surface soil temperature by 2 6 8 4 c during daytime in comparison to the bare soil however they cooled rapidly at night and did not differ from the bare soil from 18 00 6 00 fig s7 3 4 biocrust effects on water sources of non rainfall water the biocrusts had a significantly higher amount of atmospheric vapor condensation and soil vapor condensation as compared with the bare soil f 6 13 p 0 001 table 4 and fig s8 during the experimental period the biocrusts had a higher soil vapor condensation amount by 20 0 30 0 and a higher atmospheric vapor condensation amount by 114 3 142 9 than that of the bare soil at the 0 10 cm depth table 4 particularly the soil vapor condensation amount of the mixed crusts and moss crusts was significantly higher 0 13 vs 0 10 mm table 4 than that of the bare soil the biocrusts entrapped a greater proportion of water vapor from the atmosphere than surface soil fig s8 and the atmospheric vapor condensation of the bare soil was lower 0 07 vs 0 10 mm fig s9a than soil vapor condensation furthermore the atmospheric vapor condensation amount of the mixed crusts and moss crusts was more than double that of the bare soil 0 16 vs 0 07 mm table 4 for moss crusts the soil vapor condensation amount was higher by up to 149 9 0 17 vs 0 7 mm fig s9b compared to the bare soil 3 5 biocrust effects on non rainfall water distribution along soil depths the daily mean non rainfall water amount was highest at the 0 3 cm depth 0 22 mm and the biocrusts significantly increased the non rainfall water amount at that depth 69 4 in total fig 6 and table s1 during the experimental periods the daily non rainfall water amount at 0 3 cm followed the order of moss crusts mixed crusts cyano crusts bare soil f 45 34 p 0 001 table s1 the differences were slight in deeper soils f 4 35 p 0 08 table s1 and the non rainfall water amount at the 3 6 and 6 10 cm depths declined rapidly compared to the surface averaging 0 10 mm 25 8 in total fig 6 and table s1 as compared with the bare soil the biocrusts increased the daily mean non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 cm depth by 1 7 fold higher 0 17 vs 0 10 mm and the percentage in total of the biocrusts was up to 10 8 higher than that of bare soil on average 69 9 vs 59 1 table s1 4 discussion 4 1 biocrust effects on soil non rainfall water deposition and their underlying mechanisms in our study non rainfall water in biocrusts was substantially higher than in bare soil fig 3 and table 3 suggesting that biocrust colonization on the loess plateau of china has enhanced the capture of this water source this improvement of non rainfall water deposition capacity can be reasonably attributed to the biocrust effects on soil physicochemical properties gao et al 2017 kakeh et al 2018 i e the decreasing percentage of coarse particles and bulk density as well as the increasing percentage of fine particles organic matter content and roughness of the biocrusts in comparison to bare soil table 2 therefore biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition can be explained by the following three processes first the biocrusts strongly regulate surface soil properties in this study the biocrusts enriched fine particles clay and silt especially moss crusts elevated amounts of fine particles in biocrusts may come from the capture and fixation of mineral dust mobilized by off site wind erosion reynolds et al 2001 rozenstein et al 2014 or through superior protection of fines from erosion abed et al 2013 gao et al 2017 the biocrusts layer has a greater mineral specific surface area because of the higher fine particle contents and therefore provide more surface for non rainfall water deposition in comparison to bare soil grismer 1987 schneider and goss 2012 furthermore the organic matter content of biocrusts was markedly higher than that of bare soil due to the ability of biocrusts to fix atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis and deposit carbon in soil for example as extracellular polymeric substances kakeh et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 specifically extracellular polymeric substances eps and other forms of organic matter may have prolonged near surface water saturation enhancing the onset of the phase transition from vapor to liquid water adessi et al 2018 schneider and goss 2012 consequently the biocrusts likely changed multiple surface soil properties that favored greater capacity to capture and hold water second the macromorphological changes caused by e g freezing and thawing influence the development of soil roughness over time wang et al 2017 because the stability of biocrusts preserves this microtopography biocrusts have higher surface soil roughness compared to bare soil and can present a greater soil surface area for dew and fog precipitation kidron et al 2002 wang et al 2017 third moss morphology in particular plays a triggering role in non rainfall water deposition kidron et al 2002 pan et al 2016 in our study mixed crusts and moss crusts have much more non rainfall water deposition than either cyano crusts or bare soil fig 3 although the moss plants are only several millimeters above the surface mosses absorb water directly through stems leaves and awns from rain clouds fog and dew fig s10 nejidat et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 mosses can enhance all of the soil properties discussed above often more strongly than cyanobacterial crusts because they fix greater amounts of carbon and enhance roughness and surface area particularly well by protruding above the surface leading to better capture of fines furthermore the specific surface structures of moss stems leaves and awns are the sites of nucleation of non rainfall water which means that they may be important in terms of water collection and transport holder 2012 pan et al 2016 tao and zhang 2012 as reported by pan et al 2016 and tao and zhang 2012 the presence of awns alone e g in syntrichia caninervis has been experimentally demonstrated to boost non rainfall water collection by 20 additionally the mosses have papillae and lamellae on their costae as well as moss cushions and the rhizoids root like structures that anchor the plants to the ground which play an important part in water collection imbibition transportation and storage tao and zhang 2012 consequently the successional transition from cyanobacterial to moss biocrusts should be expected to strongly increase non rainfall water condensation capacity signaling a key functional shift 4 2 biocrust influences on the non rainfall water formation rate and soil temperature range in this study we were able to show that the biocrusts significantly increased the non rainfall water deposition capacity of the surface by the use of micro lysimeter figs 4 6 yet the non rainfall water deposition was mostly being temperature dependent and some studies pointed out that preferential nocturnal cooling through the walls of the micro lysimeter was shown to significantly increase the amount of vapor condensed kidron and kronenfeld 2017 however the effects of micro lysimeter on soil temperature at daytime are slight as compared to ambient conditions in this study fig s1 albeit the soil temperature maybe different at night and changed the non rainfall water formation rate however by using concomitantly biocrusted and uncrusted soil columns within the micro lysimeter the inherent drawback of the micro lysimeter i e their tendency to influence the actual values at the intact soil was avoided in addition to higher amounts of non rainfall water our results showed that biocrusts were also associated with higher non rainfall water formation rates particularly when mosses were co dominant or dominant fig 5 in general non rainfall water occurs when the surface temperature falls below the dew point and is primarily influenced by vapor pressure air temperature radiation exchange on the earth s surface the heat and vapor transport in the underlying soil among other factors agam and berliner 2006 kidron 2010 zhang et al 2009 in this study the non rainfall water amount was negatively correlated with soil temperature air temperature dew point and surface temperature while it was positively correlated with the relative humidity table 5 it is often reported that biocrusts increase soil temperature through decreasing surface albedo and increasing the absorption of solar radiation due to their higher biomass and dark color belnap 1995 xiao et al 2016 for example xiao and bowker 2020 recently documented a decrease in albedo of 43 in moss biocrusts compared to bare soil the biocrust effects on soil temperature is also mediated through modification of soil physical properties kidron 2010 xiao et al 2019b although the biocrust layer is usually several millimeters to centimeters thick at most bulk density water content macro aggregation fine particle content and organic matter content are all modified niu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 these modifications result in higher heat capacity thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity than bare soils under the same conditions xiao et al 2016 2019b because of the elevated heat gain of biocrusts during the day the heat loss at night is more precipitous than in bare soils more rapidly cooling surfaces can trigger a phase transition of water vapor into liquid zhang et al 2009 hence the biocrusts increase the rate of temperature rise and subsequent fall and this expands the diurnal range of temperature on the soil atmosphere interface as compared with bare soil kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2019b this result is consistent with the reports by liu et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 and jia et al 2014 who concluded that the biocrusts enlarge the diurnal range of surface temperature which is believed to be one of the key factors in enhancing non rainfall water amounts 4 3 biocrusts alter the sources of non rainfall water from atmosphere and deep soil in this study atmospheric vapor condensation was the primary moisture source for non rainfall water deposition as opposed to soil vapor condensation and biocrusts exhibited higher atmospheric vapor condensation amounts by up to 149 9 in contrast to bare soils table 4 this contrast became more pronounced as mosses became more prevalent figs s8 s9 under normal conditions the free atmospheric vapor and moisture from deep soil are two main water sources that contribute to non rainfall water formation fischer et al 2012 pan et al 2018 the soil water content is low in drylands and water transmission is primarily due to the slow process of vapor diffusion to the atmosphere bringing moisture to the surface on account of lower soil moisture content compared with atmospheric water vapor in arid and semiarid climate regions the water vapor amount from the deep soil migrating to the surface under the temperature gradients is generally small pan et al 2018 however biocrust induced changes in underlying soil properties can result in a higher water holding capacity and thus we would expect that more vapor from deep soil would be available for condensation adessi et al 2018 fischer et al 2012 xiao et al 2019b this expectation is not inconsistent with our data but the greater influence of biocrusts appears to be enhancement of non rainfall water from atmospheric sources generally the atmospheric water vapor includes water vapor within the air near the soil surface and from plant transpiration and respiration and soil water vapor is found within pores below the soil surface pan et al 2018 correspondingly because biocrusts significantly increased the atmospheric vapor condensation amount this important water sources is also the main supplemental water for biocrusts zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2018 especially the moss colonization stage biocrusts e g mixed crusts and moss crusts can directly absorb water through moss stems leaves awns cushions and rhizoids and so on pan et al 2016 tao and zhang 2012 therefore on account of the condensing atmospheric vapor moss biocrusts visibly become green in the morning conducting photosynthesis delgado baquerizo et al 2013 and possibly contributing to nitrogen and carbon cycling processes belnap 2002 belnap et al 2004 4 4 biocrusts alter non rainfall water distribution by depth concentrating it in the surface in our study the biocrusts changed the non rainfall water distribution by soil depth and significantly increased the non rainfall water amount at the 0 3 cm depth 69 4 as compared with bare soil fig 6 and table s1 which means biocrusts condensed more water vapor primarily in shallow soil the different non rainfall water amounts between surface and substratum was probably mostly attributable to temperature gradients saito et al 2006 xiao et al 2016 generally the liquid water and vapor fluxes are both affected by the soil temperature du et al 2018 and the movement of liquid water and water vapor in the subsurface is driven by both pressure head and temperature gradients saito et al 2006 because surface soils dramatically change temperature du et al 2018 saito et al 2006 whereas subsurface soils maintain more stable temperatures temperature gradients are established du et al 2018 zeng et al 2011 physical distance and moderate temperature shifts mean that substratum soil is unlikely to obtain much water vapor from the atmosphere directly rather the vapor condensed from moist deeper soil should be expected to be the main water source for non rainfall water formation below the surface fischer et al 2012 pan et al 2018 namely during the non rainfall water formation process the surface soil created a pivotal non rainfall water formation region as compared with substratum soil pan et al 2018 although biocrusts are only a surficial phenomenon they drastically affected the distribution of non rainfall water by depth in our study biocrusts greatly enlarged the differences in non rainfall water amount between the surface 0 3 cm and deeper soil 6 10 cm fig 6 and table s1 they likely did so by more than one mechanism as elaborated previously their enhancement of diurnal temperature fluctuation and nighttime cooling rate at the surface likely boosted non rainfall water from atmospheric sources and did so especially strongly in the surface 3 cm another mechanism is a mulching effect in which they stabilize temperatures at depth xiao et al 2016 2019a 2019b 2019c consequently even as the surface soil temperature changes more dramatically the subsoil temperature of biocrusts was dampened making it more difficult to reach the dew point to condense water vapor from deep soil these two contrary forces induced by biocrusts likely resulted in the strong contrast between surface and subsurface non rainfall water that we saw 4 5 implication of biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition in dryland water balance from our results we conclude that the biocrusts significantly increased non rainfall water deposition capacity in the semiarid portion of the loess plateau of china it was known that the biocrust influences on non rainfall water deposition strongly depend on meteorological factors soil texture biocrust types moss morphology and so on ouyang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 nonetheless it is still challenging to evaluate the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition and its role in the water balance in dryland ecosystems accordingly we reviewed the biocrust effects on non rainfall water deposition including dew formation and vapor condensation in different regions in table 6 the non rainfall water is an indispensable source of liquid water and even greater than ephemeral rainfall events in extreme drought regions e g the alexander bay of south africa the negev desert of israel and other chinese desert areas kidron 2010 maphangwa et al 2012 pan et al 2010 in an extreme case maphangwa et al 2012 the non rainfall water intercepted by bare gypsum soil was 10 times greater than the measured rainfall amount 510 0 vs 43 0 mm and that solely by lichens was up to 3 times greater than the rainfall amount 152 0 vs 43 0 mm consequently that biocrusts significantly increase the soil non rainfall water deposition capacity is broadly supported in the available literature in this study although we have not estimated the annual cumulative non rainfall water in the chinese loess plateau the 4 months cumulative non rainfall water amount of biocrusts was about 5 of annual rainfall in chinese loess plateau 21 2 vs 409 0 mm therefore there is no doubt that the non rainfall water makes a substantive contribution to the water budget through the long stable periods favoring vapor condensation agam and berliner 2004 pan et al 2018 although the non rainfall water amount was usually smaller in quantity ancillary water wets and dries the upper soil surface more frequently than rainfall in arid areas and strongly influences organisms that dwell on the soil surface jia et al 2014 pan et al 2018 according to the studies of kappen et al 1979 and pan et al 2018 the minimum non rainfall water amount of 0 03 mm is the threshold value for the non rainfall water to become available to microorganisms in our study the mean amount of daily non rainfall water in both biocrusts and bare soils was higher than 0 03 mm meaning that a typical deposition event in the region is likely to induce biological activity though the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water is significant and meaningful this important phenomenon is still undervalued in drylands the entire literature on biocrust effects on non rainfall water is only a few papers by a few research groups in a few locations a recent meta analysis by eldridge et al 2020 about the influence of biocrusts on water in the world s drylands did not account for non rainfall water at all likely because of the paucity of studies the meta analysis shows a pervasive influence of biocrusts on many properties and processes related to soil water and a better understanding of biocrust effects on non rainfall water would help us complete the puzzle we should seek to better understand how the effect of biocrusts on non rainfall water may play a critical role in many ecosystem processes xiao et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and how much of dryland ecosystem function can be directly attributed to non rainfall water pulses 5 conclusion in this study we analyzed the differences of non rainfall water deposition between bare soil and different types of biocrusts cyano crusts mixed crusts and moss crusts in a dryland ecosystems our results indicated that biocrusts greatly increased non rainfall water amount by about 70 due to the higher contents of fine particles and organic matter higher daily soil temperature differences and moss morphology moreover the presence of biocrusts significantly increased the rates of non rainfall water formation and evaporation and boosted the condensation of both soil sourced and especially atmospherically sourced vapor all of these effects showed that biocrusts are playing an important role in regulating surface soil water balance in dryland ecosystems we can conservatively estimate that in our study area the capture of non rainfall water by biocrusts increases ecosystem water inputs by about 5 and does so in periods of time when rainfall is scarce because most non rainfall water deposition events are typically sufficient to activate biocrusts and other soil microbiota it appears that this understudied water input may be important for biological activity and therefore ecosystem function in our study system and perhaps other water
