17110,the three gorges reservoir tgr underwent staged impoundment during 2003 2010 periodic water impoundment included drainage march to early june low water level june to august impoundment september to october and high water level november to february periods however the impacts of the three gorges dam tgd and impoundment on water quality of tgr tributaries remain poorly understood especially in the long term and across the entire tgr drainage basin herein water quality and hydrological indices of 27 tributaries eutrophication of 38 tributaries and pollution load of the tgr were determined during 2000 2015 to explore spatiotemporal variations in water quality the results revealed slower flow velocity in tributaries and an extended residence time with the water level rising and the water quality of tributaries was mainly affected by the mainstream backwater movement water quality was good in more than 60 of tested sites had the best condition in the impoundment period and it increased over time spatially water quality in tributary upstream was better than in the backwater area and worst in the tributary estuary among water quality indices total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were the key pollution indices with median range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l respectively additionally water quality indices of tgr tributaries displayed temporal and spatial heterogeneity due to different hydrodynamic and pollution load conditions a total of 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication the frequency of blooms concentrated in spring and increased from the upper tributaries to the downstream area these results expanded the theory of hydrodynamic variation and the associated evolution of the water environment after impoundment could provide theoretical references for water quality management in river type reservoir graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords three gorges reservoir tributary water quality hydrology pollution load spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd the largest hydropower project in the world is 2309 5 m long and 185 m high located in sandouping yichang hubei province and took 17 years to build and become fully operational wang et al 2013a fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr is 663 km long covering a total area of 1084 km2 and includes 22 districts and counties in chongqing and 4 in hubei province he et al 2011 the population of the tgr region in 2016 was 14 79 million the urbanisation rate was 56 52 and the gross domestic product gdp of the industry was 388 1 billion yuan accounting for 50 of total gdp mep 2002 2017 the tgr is a natural riverine ecosystem with a water level no higher than 80 m before the tgd was built but the area was turned into a reservoir ecosystem following tgd construction and impoundment cnemc 1998 2016 impoundment caused the water level to rise to 135 m in 2003 first impoundment stage 156 m in 2006 second impoundment stage and finally 175 m in 2010 third impoundment stage tang et al 2014 since 2010 after full impoundment stage the tgr has been fully operational and has a water level fluctuation zone vertical height of 30 m bao et al 2015 the water level fluctuates periodically between 145 and 175 m each year bao et al 2015 and periodic impoundment is consisted of four distinct phases xu et al 2011a zhang and lou 2011 drainage period 175 to 145 m during which the water level is reduced to free up storage capacity for flood control low water level period 145 m during which the water and sediment is discharged outside of the tgr impoundment period 145 to 175 m during which the water level is raised due to store water and high water level period 175 m during which the water and sediment is retained in the tgr zheng et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 the tgd and periodic water impoundment have made great contributions to shipping hydropower generation flood manipulation and irrigation in china zhang and lou 2011 zhao et al 2013 however this has been accompanied by a suite of environmental problems especially soil erosion xu et al 2011b ma et al 2016 water quality deterioration stone 2011 xia et al 2018 eutrophication and algal blooms liu et al 2012 yang and zhang 2014 and hydrological alterations including increased water level a slower flow velocity extended water retention time trapped sediments and large water temperature fluctuations zhang and lou 2011 ma et al 2015 all of which have attracted wide attention at present the tgr water ecosystem is in evolution period changes in the water environment are of great significance to grasp the succession process of the new large scale reservoir ecosystem and guide the protection of it studies on the mainstream water quality calculated a mean total nitrogen tn concentration of approximately 1 3 mg l and mean total phosphorus tp of 0 05 0 61 mg l hence they are key pollution indices gao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 other research investigated tributary bays close to the tgd and found that eutrophication and algal blooms occurred frequently after impoundment zhang 2012a tang et al 2015 possibly due to changes in pollution load ren et al 2015 ran et al 2017 land use patterns huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and hydrology and hydrodynamics zhang and lou 2011 yang et al 2010 however research on water quality eutrophication and algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr is lacking especially long term effects over the entire tgr drainage basin the river system in the tgr is well developed table 1 including 36 tributaries with a drainage area over 1000 km2 in chongqing alone wang et al 2013b before impoundment the water level is 145 m which is the flood control water level the mainstream and tributaries are natural rivers cwrc 1992 after impoundment from 145 to 175 m the backwater can reach and impact the upstream tributaries of the tgr located in jiangjin chongqing bing et al 2016 in addition mainstream backwater flowing back into the tributaries led to the formation of the backwater area which affected the water quality and hydrology of the tributaries yu and wang 2011 in fact water quality deterioration eutrophication and algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr are reported every year http www mee gov cn however the relationship between tgr impoundment mode and tributaries water quality remains unclear based on work carried out over more than 10 consecutive years nutrients biochemical indices eutrophication blooms hydrology and pollution load were measured during 2000 2016 the present study aimed to 1 probe the spatiotemporal variation in water quality indices and identify the key pollution indicators in the tributaries of the tgr 2 assess the water quality of tgr tributaries using an appropriate water quality index 3 investigate the spatiotemporal variation of eutrophication and blooms in the tgr tributaries and 4 investigate variation in pollution load and hydrology and discuss their impact on water quality in the tributaries of the tgr this study could be helpful for expanding the theory of hydrodynamic variation and the associated evolution of the water environment after impoundment and providing a reference for water environment protection and scientific water regulation in river type reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area due to tgd construction and impoundment a group of backwater zones constituting the tgr was formed upstream of the yangtze river stretching from jiangjin county chongqing city to yichang city hubei province the regional geomorphology of the tgr is dominated by mountains hills and canyons with large longitude and vertical differences tang et al 2014 bao et al 2015 a subtropical monsoon humid climate predominates featuring mean annual precipitation ranges from 650 mm to 2100 mm http data cma cn site index html an annual average temperature varies in the range of 17 19 c and 30 40 foggy days per year tong et al 2006 wang et al 2011 based on the tgr impoundment characteristics a typical year can be divided into four distinct phases drainage march to early june low water level june to august impoundment september to october and high water level november to february periods zheng et al 2016 the present study investigated 66 water quality sampling sites s1 s66 of 27 tributaries in the tgr table 1 fig 1 these sites were divided into three groups based on the intensity of impact by mainstream backwater including 25 in tributary upstream areas were unaffected 21 in backwater areas were moderately affected and 20 in tributary estuary areas were strongly affected in addition 38 eutrophication sampling sites in the backwater area of 38 tributaries were measured fig 1 2 2 sampling and data sources water was collected from tributaries left middle and right basins in 500 ml plastic bottles during 2003 2012 and 2014 and taken to the lab to measure water quality and eutrophication indicators the average annual concentrations of tn tp ph dissolved oxygen do potassium permanganate index codmn and five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 in 2000 2002 2013 and 2015 were calculated from previous research data the overall dataset included 484 samples from 11 tgr tributaries in 2000 465 samples from 10 tributaries in 2001 luo 2004 420 samples from 21 tributaries in 2002 luo 2004 peng 2005 255 samples from 31 rivers in 2013 xia 2014 and 94 samples in 2015 zhang et al 2019 additionally data were collected for pollution load during 2001 2016 mep 2002 2017 the inflow pollution load of the tgr was expressed as the product of the concentration of pollutants and the flow at zhutuo hydrological station and flow data of zhutuo and wx were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the changjiang water resources commission 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality and eutrophication indicator measurements methods employed for the determination of water quality eutrophication indicators and water temperature wt are given in table s1 river transparency was measured on site by the secchi disc sd method secchi 1864 combined with historical data and remote sensing technology the volume of tributaries at different water levels and some other basic river characteristic parameters in table 1 are measured residence time tr can be derived from the equations tr v q where q is the annual average flow m3 s and v is the average capacity m3 when the water level is 145 m and 175 m in addition the average monthly flow rate v was calculated according to the equation v m s monthly average flow average area of the tributary section where the average area of the tributary section m2 v river length furthermore the runoff volume w of wx during different impoundment periods was calculated from the equations w m3 q δt where q is the monthly average flow m3 s and δt is the time of each impoundment period 2 3 2 chlorophyll a and trophic level index measurements chlorophyll a chl a was extracted with 90 acetone and measured spectrophotometrically according to the methods of nusch 1980 trophic level index tli was assessed from chl a tp tn codmn and sd zhang 2012a 2 3 3 mann kendall mk test the mk test is commonly used for detecting changes in hydrological and climate time series this test is a non parametric trend test and does not require the sequence under testing to follow a certain presumed distribution hamed and rao 1998 additionally it can effectively judge the fluctuation trend of natural processes for this reason the mk test is widely applied in water quality rainfall and runoff sequences chang 2008 mustapha 2013 bayazit 2015 in this study the mk test was used to analyse the temporal variation tendency of water quality parameters in the tgr tributaries using the trend package in r software v3 6 1 r core development team 2019 2 3 4 canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi the ccme wqi has been widely used and recognised in different countries hülya 2010 el jabi et al 2014 because it can be applied flexibly with slight modification based on specific local conditions and issues ccme 2001 khan et al 2003 hurley et al 2012 it can easily assess whether the overall water quality meets the specified water quality goals and indicate the water status category to explore the water quality of the tgr tributaries the ccme wqi and china s environmental quality standard for surface water gb class iii mep 2002 were both used the class iii standards are listed in table s1 and the detailed calculation procedure was described in previous studies dede et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the index value can vary in the range of 0 100 corresponding to five categories poor 0 44 marginal 45 64 fair 65 79 good 80 94 and excellent 95 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 high nutrient levels in tributaries are mainly derived from impoundment and pollution loads in the tgr following building of the tgd and periodic impoundment nutrients can vary and this requires close attention previous research has explored nutrient levels in the tgr mainstream and tn and tp always exceed gb class iii standards mep 2002 confirming them as key pollution indices zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 showed that tn and tp were more than 1 5 and 0 1 mg l during 2008 2014 while li et al 2019 demonstrated that the tn and tp were higher than 1 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l from 1992 to 2016 however research on nutrient levels in the tgr tributaries is lacking in the present study tn and tp were measured for 27 tributaries in the tgr and all far exceeded gb class iii standards mep 2002 fig 2 a both were identified as key pollution parameters fig 2a with median values of 1 581 and 0 074 mg l during 2003 2012 respectively fig 2b there are several reasons for the high nutrient levels in the tgr tributaries firstly the water level of 145 m is the flood control water level in the tgr with the flood control capacity 22 15 billion m3 the water level of 175 m is the normal impoundment level with the capacity 39 3 billion m3 cwrc 1992 however the sum volume of the 21 tributaries is 6 48 billion m3 during the high water level period which was 41 35 of mainstream volume based on flood control capacity fig 3 a the average volume ratio of wx station to daning river during 2001 2016 was 28 39 23 52 58 79 in impoundment high water level and drainage period fig 3b respectively therefore according to the water balance mainstream volume was higher than tributaries and mainstream backwater volume was higher than tributary upstream areas with the water level rising thus after tgr impoundment a plenty of mainstream backwater was input into tributaries ran et al 2010 showed that the mainstream contributed about 76 and 73 of water in the xiangxi and daning rivers respectively in present study tn and tp in mainstream and tributary estuary area backwater area tributary upstream area fig 2 c d tn of mainstream and tributary estuary area and tp of the four areas showed an increasing trend after low water level period and tp before impoundment was lower than that after fig 2 c d it means that mainstream backwater probably caused nutrients increase in tributaries after impoundment moreover the flow velocity has slowed down due to tgd construction and impoundment which provided a convenient condition for the mainstream backwater to import into tributaries in the mainstream before and after impoundment values were reduced from 2 12 to 1 33 m s in the upstream from 1 87 to 0 58 m s in the midstream and from 2 15 to 0 29 m s in the downstream area of the tgr li et al 2019 in tributaries the proportion of the monthly flow velocity less than 0 01 m s accounted for 40 100 in the mid downstream of tgr tributaries when the water level was 139 m fig 3c secondly mainstream and tributary in the tgr had minimal volume in the low water level period fig 3a was a natural river tn of the four areas all reached its maximum value during this period then it showed a decreasing trend in backwater area and tributary upstream area over time fig 2c tp of the four areas were higher than gb class iii standards mep 2002 fig 2d the average flow in this period was 172 84 of the annual average flow at wx station during 2001 2016 fig 3b these results show that abundant rainfall promoted the migration of non point source pollutants into the tgr during the low water level period xie et al 2017 which possibly contributed a large amount of nutrients to tributaries in addition non point source pollutants were dominant in all pollution loads of the tgr ren et al 2015 ran et al 2017 and inflow from upstream of the yangtze river was higher than that from the tgr fig 4 the average tn and tp load of inflow from the upper yangtze river into the tgr was 28 91 104 t a and 3 17 104 t a during 2003 2012 respectively fig 4a in the tgr farmland is the main land use type huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and the crop area was in the range of 0 39 0 70 million hectares during the period covered in the present study fig 4e nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser application in the tgr ranged from 5 85 104 to 11 1 104 and from 1 96 104 to 4 60 104 t a respectively fig 4e while organic nitrogen and phosphorus pesticide application was in the range of 40 289 6 and 190 8 593 2 t a respectively during 2001 2016 fig 4f therefore a large amount of non point source pollutants promoted high tn and tp levels in the tgr finally mobile and point source pollution also contributed to high tn and tp values fig 4 c d from 2001 to 2016 the average number of ships sailing in the tgr was 7226 and the domestic wastewater generated by ships was 3 367 million t a including tn pollution of 230 76 t a and tp pollution of 35 39 t a fig 4c the tn content in domestic wastewater during 2001 2003 was 1 25 104 t a and the tp content between 2001 and 2007 was 0 15 104 t a mep 2002 2017 3 2 hydrodynamic and load regional heterogeneity cause spatial variation in water quality indicators water quality indicators are related to urbanisation industrial and agricultural production land use type and environmental protection infrastructure in each tributary drainage basin zhang and lou 2011 zhang et al 2012b huang et al 2016 the chongqing urban and wanzhou districts are the most densely populated areas in the tgr where annual average industrial and domestic wastewater accounted for more than 50 of the total volume of the tgr during 2003 2012 mep 2002 2017 in the present study tn tp codmn bod5 ammonia nitrogen content index nh3 n and escherichia coli e coli in rivers in this area were higher than in the downstream reaches of the tgr and all indices had high values in yipin huaxi taohua and zhuxi rivers fig 5 tn values in these four rivers were 3 163 3 462 3 184 and 3 085 mg l tp values were 0 116 0 219 0 182 and 0 301 mg l nh3 n codmn bod5 and e coli values varied in the range of 0 765 1 702 3 725 5 336 2 737 4 956 mg l and 3 301 104 2 412 105 a l pollutants in tributaries has five major input channels input from upstream of tributaries recharge of the mainstream the release of internal sources pollution from point and non point sources and the release of soil in the fluctuating zone zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2013 non point source loads were dominant in all pollution loads of the tgr fig 4 and large amounts of rainfall and runoff will increase the pollutants content in tributaries during the low water level period therefore tn tp nh3 n and e coli of the 27 tributaries increased from tributary upstream areas to mainstream during this period fig 2 6 however as the water level rose these four indices in the mainstream and tributary estuary kept the same growth trend and were higher than that in other two areas fig 2 6 mainstream backwater volume was larger than tributary upstream areas fig 3 a b suggesting that impoundment increased these four indices levels in tributaries therefore strengthening loads control to reduce pollutants expanding plant coverage to increase tributaries upstream flow and properly scheduling the timing and magnitude of water release out of reservoir may be helpful to decrease their contents tranmer et al 2020 by contrast codmn and bod5 in tributaries decreased with water level rising while both indices and do in mainstream increased fig 6 in addition all three parameters were higher in tributary than mainstream fig 6 illustrating that the abundant backwater diluted pollutant concentrations yang et al 2013 fig 3 a b mk test results fig 7 showed that tn tp nh3 n codmn bod5 and e coli levels for all sites decreased over time but do increased suggesting that the water quality of the tributaries will gradually improve over time 3 3 staged and periodic impoundment affects temporal variation in water quality indicators as shown in fig 8 the annual average values for tn and tp during 2000 2015 were in the range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l respectively the mean tn concentration of the first second and third impoundment stage was lower than that of the other two impoundment stages the mean tp codmn and bod5 values before impoundment were 0 172 3 919 and 2 207 mg l respectively which were lower than in the first impoundment stage but all three indices decreased over time thereafter the annual average nh3 n petroleum hydrocarbon ph and e coli values varied in the range of 0 328 0 976 0 022 0 057 mg l and 7 974 103 7 015 104 a l respectively and all decreased over time however do after impoundment was lower than that before but do and ph increased from the first impoundment to the full impoundment stage over time non point loads were the main sources of tn especially agricultural activity ren et al 2015 fig 4 however due to the resettlement project for tgd construction the crop area and nitrogen fertiliser application were reduced fig 4 hence tn during the construction period 2003 2010 was lower than that before impoundment 2000 2002 an increasing trend was observed after full impoundment 2010 2015 possibly due to the recovery of agricultural activities fig 4 in addition ph rose over time fig 8n might due to the increasing trend of eutrophication and algal bloom liu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 the slowing of the flow velocity rising water level and extended residence time caused large amounts of pollutants from submerged soil and plants to be released into the tgr during the impoundment stage liu et al 2004 dai et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 therefore tp codmn and bod5 were increased from before impoundment 2000 2003 to the first impoundment stage in 2003 fig 8 h i k however tp codmn bod5 nh3 n ph and e coli then decreased over time 2004 2014 fig 8 possibly because the self purification capacity increased wei et al 2011 additionally the pollutant concentrations in mainstream backwater tended to decrease over time fig 4 a b furthermore environmental management and governance efficiency improved since municipal wastewater treatment plants increased from 56 in 2008 to 220 in 2016 fig 4d and the domestic sewage treatment efficiency improved from 12 49 in 2003 to 99 87 in 2016 mep 2002 2017 the tn codmn bod5 and e coli peaked in the low water level period fig 9 the median of 27 rivers were 1 792 2 795 1 901 mg l and 7 846 103 a l moreover the number of rivers with the highest concentration of these four indices were largest in this period fig s1a these results indicate that stronger precipitation and runoff fig 3b with large amount of non point source loads fig 4 greatly promoted the concentration of these four indices xie et al 2017 however the nh3 n 0 313 mg l and tp 0 086 mg l reach their maximum value in the drainage period fig 9 and both indices in this period had the largest number of rivers with the highest concentration fig s1a this might be due to the mixing of the mainstream flow and the upstream flow from the tributaries caused the deposited nutrients to enter the water body yang et al 2013 and the increasing rainfall fig 3b could also bring some pollutants from the tributary upstream basin after tgr impoundment a plenty of mainstream backwater was input into tributaries ran et al 2010 fig 3 a b thereby diluting the pollutant concentrations in tributaries yang et al 2013 therefore all parameters except do were minimal in the impoundment nh3 n and tp and high water level tn codmn bod5 and e coli period fig 9 and these indices with the lowest concentration had the largest number of rivers during the two periods fig s1b in addition do was maximal in the high water level period fig 9 and s1a 3 4 stress effects of hydrodynamic changes on tributary eutrophication eutrophication is the most widespread global water environmental problem sinha et al 2017 and eutrophication has become more serious since the first impoundment in the tgr in 2003 yang et al 2010 zhang 2012a xiao et al 2016 herein all 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication and the eutrophication ratio was higher than 50 in 11 rivers fig 10 a furthermore the comprehensive trophic level index tli of 38 tgr tributaries was higher than 50 during 2004 2012 except for 2007 fig 10d therefore tributary eutrophication in the tgr was prominent and the reason probably was the high nutrient levels fig 2 caused by impoundment and non point source loads fig 3 4 the eutrophication percentage of p1 p19 was higher than that of p20 p38 from 2004 to 2012 fig 10a which might be due to the nutrient spatial variation fig 5 a b according to the reservoir water quality management strskraba and tundisi 1999 the river type is complete mixing when retention time tr 20 days the transitional type is moderate intensity stratification when tr is between 20 and 300 days and the lake type is stable layered when tr 300 days in the present study 65 of 20 tributaries had a tr more than 20 days 40 exceed 50 days tongzhuang river reached 488 days and tr increased from upper to lower tributaries of the tgr fig 3d of the 30 rivers within a distance of 560 km from the tgd 21 belong to the transitional type 1 falls into the lake type and 8 are the river type fig 3d therefore as the residence time increased many tributaries changed from river type before impoundment to lake type thereafter indicating the mixing intensity of tributaries decreased while the possibility of water stratification and algal blooms increased yang et al 2010 xu et al 2011a in fact the frequency of blooms increased after impoundment it was 8 in 2004 34 in 2006 and 197 in 2004 2012 fig 10f and it increased from upstream tributaries to downstream tributaries fig 10c in addition 18 tributaries displayed exceptionally high chl a eutrophication values 10 mg m3 during 2004 2012 fig 10b during the high water level period large flows of mainstream backwater were input into tributaries ran et al 2010 fig 3 a b diluting the pollutant concentrations yang et al 2013 fig 9 and s1 thus tgr tributaries showed serious eutrophication and high chl a levels during march september fig 10 g h however the highest frequency of blooms occurred from march to june fig 10i and were dominated by diatom and dinoflagellate bloom xu et al 2011c it was mainly due to the slowing flow velocity fig 3c extending tr fig 3d and increasing water temperature fig 3e promoted water column stability during the drainage period henson 2007 xu et al 2011b c in addition high concentration nutrient from mainstream backwater was another cause luo et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 fig 6 herein the median tn and tp values were 1 581 and 0 074 mg l between 2003 and 2012 respectively fig 2 which are sufficient to support algae growth and proliferation xu et al 2011a however the mainstream characterised by high nutrients fig 2 but never be reported stratification and algal blooms mep 2002 2017 suggesting that nutrients might not be the primary factors limiting spring bloom in tributaries while hydrodynamic conditions were 3 5 tgr operation drives variation in tributary water quality water quality changes across space and time in tgr tributaries are illustrated in fig 11 water quality was mainly ranked between fair and good and at least 60 of sampling sites were categorised as good the ccme wqi values were ordered tributary estuary backwater area tributary upstream with mean values of 75 141 78 023 and 82 017 respectively fig 11a this might because high nutrients in tributary estuaries fig 2 and 6 presumably due to high pollution loads and backwater movement from the mainstream yang et al 2010 liu et al 2012 fig 3 4 the median ccme wqi values for yipin s05 huaxi s06 and s07 and zhuxi s35 and s36 rivers were 53 410 50 409 and 56 735 respectively fig 11a indicating poor water quality this was mainly due to the dense human population and extensive production activities mep 2002 2017 in addition the ccme wqi value increased over time and was ranked first impoundment stage 2003 second impoundment stage 2004 2006 third impoundment stage 2007 2010 after full impoundment 2011 2012 with mean values of 70 469 75 159 79 662 and 80 242 respectively fig 11a firstly the improved water quality of tgr tributaries was consistent with water quality indices decreasing over time with successive impoundments zheng et al 2011 tang et al 2014 fig 8 secondly this may be attributed to government protection and restoration measures sewage treatment plants increased from 56 in 2008 to 220 in 2016 the amount of treated domestic wastewater increased from 0 05 billion tons in 2003 to 0 79 billion tons in 2013 and the sewage treatment rate increased from 12 50 in 2003 to 99 87 in 2013 fig 4d finally fertiliser application decreased after full impoundment fig 4e furthermore there was no obvious change in the ccme wqi value during high water level drainage and low water level period while all three periods were significantly lower than that in the impoundment period p 0 01 anova fig 11 b c the rapid rise in water level from 145 to 175 m during the impoundment period promoted large mainstream flows to input into tributaries fig 3 a b and diluted pollutants yang et al 2013 fig 9 hence this period displayed the highest water quality the impact of the tgd and impoundment on the water environment is a complex issue and the succession and stability of large scale reservoir ecosystem is a long term process the loads are the sources of pollutants and water flow control the transportation and migration of pollutants xiang et al 2021 they were the main cause of the spatiotemporal differences in water quality high nutrients and serious blooms of the tgr tributaries in this study therefore based on the reservoir operations and climatic conditions proper flow regulation inflow from tributaries upstream areas or outflow from dam control of pollution sources and improvement of biodiversity may greatly improve the management of river type reservoirs tranmer et al 2020 4 conclusions non point loads and impoundment were the main cause of high nutrient levels in tributaries the mean tn and tp values varied in the range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l during 2000 2015 respectively hence both were key pollution parameters water quality indices of the upper tributaries in the tgr had higher values due to the dense human population and extensive production activities the difference in water volume and pollutant content between the mainstream and tributaries resulted in the spatial change of water quality indicators tn before impoundment was higher than that after while tp codmn and bod5 showed the opposite trend the water quality indices of tributaries were minimal in the impoundment and high water level periods because they were diluted by a large amount of mainstream flow input following the impoundment the raised water level slower flow velocity proper temperature extended water retention time caused frequent eutrophication and blooms in the tributary backwater area all 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication and the frequency of blooms was concentrated in spring and increased from the upper tributaries to downstream the

17110,the three gorges reservoir tgr underwent staged impoundment during 2003 2010 periodic water impoundment included drainage march to early june low water level june to august impoundment september to october and high water level november to february periods however the impacts of the three gorges dam tgd and impoundment on water quality of tgr tributaries remain poorly understood especially in the long term and across the entire tgr drainage basin herein water quality and hydrological indices of 27 tributaries eutrophication of 38 tributaries and pollution load of the tgr were determined during 2000 2015 to explore spatiotemporal variations in water quality the results revealed slower flow velocity in tributaries and an extended residence time with the water level rising and the water quality of tributaries was mainly affected by the mainstream backwater movement water quality was good in more than 60 of tested sites had the best condition in the impoundment period and it increased over time spatially water quality in tributary upstream was better than in the backwater area and worst in the tributary estuary among water quality indices total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were the key pollution indices with median range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l respectively additionally water quality indices of tgr tributaries displayed temporal and spatial heterogeneity due to different hydrodynamic and pollution load conditions a total of 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication the frequency of blooms concentrated in spring and increased from the upper tributaries to the downstream area these results expanded the theory of hydrodynamic variation and the associated evolution of the water environment after impoundment could provide theoretical references for water quality management in river type reservoir graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords three gorges reservoir tributary water quality hydrology pollution load spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd the largest hydropower project in the world is 2309 5 m long and 185 m high located in sandouping yichang hubei province and took 17 years to build and become fully operational wang et al 2013a fu et al 2010 the three gorges reservoir tgr is 663 km long covering a total area of 1084 km2 and includes 22 districts and counties in chongqing and 4 in hubei province he et al 2011 the population of the tgr region in 2016 was 14 79 million the urbanisation rate was 56 52 and the gross domestic product gdp of the industry was 388 1 billion yuan accounting for 50 of total gdp mep 2002 2017 the tgr is a natural riverine ecosystem with a water level no higher than 80 m before the tgd was built but the area was turned into a reservoir ecosystem following tgd construction and impoundment cnemc 1998 2016 impoundment caused the water level to rise to 135 m in 2003 first impoundment stage 156 m in 2006 second impoundment stage and finally 175 m in 2010 third impoundment stage tang et al 2014 since 2010 after full impoundment stage the tgr has been fully operational and has a water level fluctuation zone vertical height of 30 m bao et al 2015 the water level fluctuates periodically between 145 and 175 m each year bao et al 2015 and periodic impoundment is consisted of four distinct phases xu et al 2011a zhang and lou 2011 drainage period 175 to 145 m during which the water level is reduced to free up storage capacity for flood control low water level period 145 m during which the water and sediment is discharged outside of the tgr impoundment period 145 to 175 m during which the water level is raised due to store water and high water level period 175 m during which the water and sediment is retained in the tgr zheng et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 the tgd and periodic water impoundment have made great contributions to shipping hydropower generation flood manipulation and irrigation in china zhang and lou 2011 zhao et al 2013 however this has been accompanied by a suite of environmental problems especially soil erosion xu et al 2011b ma et al 2016 water quality deterioration stone 2011 xia et al 2018 eutrophication and algal blooms liu et al 2012 yang and zhang 2014 and hydrological alterations including increased water level a slower flow velocity extended water retention time trapped sediments and large water temperature fluctuations zhang and lou 2011 ma et al 2015 all of which have attracted wide attention at present the tgr water ecosystem is in evolution period changes in the water environment are of great significance to grasp the succession process of the new large scale reservoir ecosystem and guide the protection of it studies on the mainstream water quality calculated a mean total nitrogen tn concentration of approximately 1 3 mg l and mean total phosphorus tp of 0 05 0 61 mg l hence they are key pollution indices gao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 other research investigated tributary bays close to the tgd and found that eutrophication and algal blooms occurred frequently after impoundment zhang 2012a tang et al 2015 possibly due to changes in pollution load ren et al 2015 ran et al 2017 land use patterns huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and hydrology and hydrodynamics zhang and lou 2011 yang et al 2010 however research on water quality eutrophication and algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr is lacking especially long term effects over the entire tgr drainage basin the river system in the tgr is well developed table 1 including 36 tributaries with a drainage area over 1000 km2 in chongqing alone wang et al 2013b before impoundment the water level is 145 m which is the flood control water level the mainstream and tributaries are natural rivers cwrc 1992 after impoundment from 145 to 175 m the backwater can reach and impact the upstream tributaries of the tgr located in jiangjin chongqing bing et al 2016 in addition mainstream backwater flowing back into the tributaries led to the formation of the backwater area which affected the water quality and hydrology of the tributaries yu and wang 2011 in fact water quality deterioration eutrophication and algal blooms in the tributaries of the tgr are reported every year http www mee gov cn however the relationship between tgr impoundment mode and tributaries water quality remains unclear based on work carried out over more than 10 consecutive years nutrients biochemical indices eutrophication blooms hydrology and pollution load were measured during 2000 2016 the present study aimed to 1 probe the spatiotemporal variation in water quality indices and identify the key pollution indicators in the tributaries of the tgr 2 assess the water quality of tgr tributaries using an appropriate water quality index 3 investigate the spatiotemporal variation of eutrophication and blooms in the tgr tributaries and 4 investigate variation in pollution load and hydrology and discuss their impact on water quality in the tributaries of the tgr this study could be helpful for expanding the theory of hydrodynamic variation and the associated evolution of the water environment after impoundment and providing a reference for water environment protection and scientific water regulation in river type reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area due to tgd construction and impoundment a group of backwater zones constituting the tgr was formed upstream of the yangtze river stretching from jiangjin county chongqing city to yichang city hubei province the regional geomorphology of the tgr is dominated by mountains hills and canyons with large longitude and vertical differences tang et al 2014 bao et al 2015 a subtropical monsoon humid climate predominates featuring mean annual precipitation ranges from 650 mm to 2100 mm http data cma cn site index html an annual average temperature varies in the range of 17 19 c and 30 40 foggy days per year tong et al 2006 wang et al 2011 based on the tgr impoundment characteristics a typical year can be divided into four distinct phases drainage march to early june low water level june to august impoundment september to october and high water level november to february periods zheng et al 2016 the present study investigated 66 water quality sampling sites s1 s66 of 27 tributaries in the tgr table 1 fig 1 these sites were divided into three groups based on the intensity of impact by mainstream backwater including 25 in tributary upstream areas were unaffected 21 in backwater areas were moderately affected and 20 in tributary estuary areas were strongly affected in addition 38 eutrophication sampling sites in the backwater area of 38 tributaries were measured fig 1 2 2 sampling and data sources water was collected from tributaries left middle and right basins in 500 ml plastic bottles during 2003 2012 and 2014 and taken to the lab to measure water quality and eutrophication indicators the average annual concentrations of tn tp ph dissolved oxygen do potassium permanganate index codmn and five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 in 2000 2002 2013 and 2015 were calculated from previous research data the overall dataset included 484 samples from 11 tgr tributaries in 2000 465 samples from 10 tributaries in 2001 luo 2004 420 samples from 21 tributaries in 2002 luo 2004 peng 2005 255 samples from 31 rivers in 2013 xia 2014 and 94 samples in 2015 zhang et al 2019 additionally data were collected for pollution load during 2001 2016 mep 2002 2017 the inflow pollution load of the tgr was expressed as the product of the concentration of pollutants and the flow at zhutuo hydrological station and flow data of zhutuo and wx were obtained from the hydrology bureau of the changjiang water resources commission 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality and eutrophication indicator measurements methods employed for the determination of water quality eutrophication indicators and water temperature wt are given in table s1 river transparency was measured on site by the secchi disc sd method secchi 1864 combined with historical data and remote sensing technology the volume of tributaries at different water levels and some other basic river characteristic parameters in table 1 are measured residence time tr can be derived from the equations tr v q where q is the annual average flow m3 s and v is the average capacity m3 when the water level is 145 m and 175 m in addition the average monthly flow rate v was calculated according to the equation v m s monthly average flow average area of the tributary section where the average area of the tributary section m2 v river length furthermore the runoff volume w of wx during different impoundment periods was calculated from the equations w m3 q δt where q is the monthly average flow m3 s and δt is the time of each impoundment period 2 3 2 chlorophyll a and trophic level index measurements chlorophyll a chl a was extracted with 90 acetone and measured spectrophotometrically according to the methods of nusch 1980 trophic level index tli was assessed from chl a tp tn codmn and sd zhang 2012a 2 3 3 mann kendall mk test the mk test is commonly used for detecting changes in hydrological and climate time series this test is a non parametric trend test and does not require the sequence under testing to follow a certain presumed distribution hamed and rao 1998 additionally it can effectively judge the fluctuation trend of natural processes for this reason the mk test is widely applied in water quality rainfall and runoff sequences chang 2008 mustapha 2013 bayazit 2015 in this study the mk test was used to analyse the temporal variation tendency of water quality parameters in the tgr tributaries using the trend package in r software v3 6 1 r core development team 2019 2 3 4 canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi the ccme wqi has been widely used and recognised in different countries hülya 2010 el jabi et al 2014 because it can be applied flexibly with slight modification based on specific local conditions and issues ccme 2001 khan et al 2003 hurley et al 2012 it can easily assess whether the overall water quality meets the specified water quality goals and indicate the water status category to explore the water quality of the tgr tributaries the ccme wqi and china s environmental quality standard for surface water gb class iii mep 2002 were both used the class iii standards are listed in table s1 and the detailed calculation procedure was described in previous studies dede et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 the index value can vary in the range of 0 100 corresponding to five categories poor 0 44 marginal 45 64 fair 65 79 good 80 94 and excellent 95 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 high nutrient levels in tributaries are mainly derived from impoundment and pollution loads in the tgr following building of the tgd and periodic impoundment nutrients can vary and this requires close attention previous research has explored nutrient levels in the tgr mainstream and tn and tp always exceed gb class iii standards mep 2002 confirming them as key pollution indices zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2016 xia et al 2018 showed that tn and tp were more than 1 5 and 0 1 mg l during 2008 2014 while li et al 2019 demonstrated that the tn and tp were higher than 1 5 mg l and 0 05 mg l from 1992 to 2016 however research on nutrient levels in the tgr tributaries is lacking in the present study tn and tp were measured for 27 tributaries in the tgr and all far exceeded gb class iii standards mep 2002 fig 2 a both were identified as key pollution parameters fig 2a with median values of 1 581 and 0 074 mg l during 2003 2012 respectively fig 2b there are several reasons for the high nutrient levels in the tgr tributaries firstly the water level of 145 m is the flood control water level in the tgr with the flood control capacity 22 15 billion m3 the water level of 175 m is the normal impoundment level with the capacity 39 3 billion m3 cwrc 1992 however the sum volume of the 21 tributaries is 6 48 billion m3 during the high water level period which was 41 35 of mainstream volume based on flood control capacity fig 3 a the average volume ratio of wx station to daning river during 2001 2016 was 28 39 23 52 58 79 in impoundment high water level and drainage period fig 3b respectively therefore according to the water balance mainstream volume was higher than tributaries and mainstream backwater volume was higher than tributary upstream areas with the water level rising thus after tgr impoundment a plenty of mainstream backwater was input into tributaries ran et al 2010 showed that the mainstream contributed about 76 and 73 of water in the xiangxi and daning rivers respectively in present study tn and tp in mainstream and tributary estuary area backwater area tributary upstream area fig 2 c d tn of mainstream and tributary estuary area and tp of the four areas showed an increasing trend after low water level period and tp before impoundment was lower than that after fig 2 c d it means that mainstream backwater probably caused nutrients increase in tributaries after impoundment moreover the flow velocity has slowed down due to tgd construction and impoundment which provided a convenient condition for the mainstream backwater to import into tributaries in the mainstream before and after impoundment values were reduced from 2 12 to 1 33 m s in the upstream from 1 87 to 0 58 m s in the midstream and from 2 15 to 0 29 m s in the downstream area of the tgr li et al 2019 in tributaries the proportion of the monthly flow velocity less than 0 01 m s accounted for 40 100 in the mid downstream of tgr tributaries when the water level was 139 m fig 3c secondly mainstream and tributary in the tgr had minimal volume in the low water level period fig 3a was a natural river tn of the four areas all reached its maximum value during this period then it showed a decreasing trend in backwater area and tributary upstream area over time fig 2c tp of the four areas were higher than gb class iii standards mep 2002 fig 2d the average flow in this period was 172 84 of the annual average flow at wx station during 2001 2016 fig 3b these results show that abundant rainfall promoted the migration of non point source pollutants into the tgr during the low water level period xie et al 2017 which possibly contributed a large amount of nutrients to tributaries in addition non point source pollutants were dominant in all pollution loads of the tgr ren et al 2015 ran et al 2017 and inflow from upstream of the yangtze river was higher than that from the tgr fig 4 the average tn and tp load of inflow from the upper yangtze river into the tgr was 28 91 104 t a and 3 17 104 t a during 2003 2012 respectively fig 4a in the tgr farmland is the main land use type huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 and the crop area was in the range of 0 39 0 70 million hectares during the period covered in the present study fig 4e nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser application in the tgr ranged from 5 85 104 to 11 1 104 and from 1 96 104 to 4 60 104 t a respectively fig 4e while organic nitrogen and phosphorus pesticide application was in the range of 40 289 6 and 190 8 593 2 t a respectively during 2001 2016 fig 4f therefore a large amount of non point source pollutants promoted high tn and tp levels in the tgr finally mobile and point source pollution also contributed to high tn and tp values fig 4 c d from 2001 to 2016 the average number of ships sailing in the tgr was 7226 and the domestic wastewater generated by ships was 3 367 million t a including tn pollution of 230 76 t a and tp pollution of 35 39 t a fig 4c the tn content in domestic wastewater during 2001 2003 was 1 25 104 t a and the tp content between 2001 and 2007 was 0 15 104 t a mep 2002 2017 3 2 hydrodynamic and load regional heterogeneity cause spatial variation in water quality indicators water quality indicators are related to urbanisation industrial and agricultural production land use type and environmental protection infrastructure in each tributary drainage basin zhang and lou 2011 zhang et al 2012b huang et al 2016 the chongqing urban and wanzhou districts are the most densely populated areas in the tgr where annual average industrial and domestic wastewater accounted for more than 50 of the total volume of the tgr during 2003 2012 mep 2002 2017 in the present study tn tp codmn bod5 ammonia nitrogen content index nh3 n and escherichia coli e coli in rivers in this area were higher than in the downstream reaches of the tgr and all indices had high values in yipin huaxi taohua and zhuxi rivers fig 5 tn values in these four rivers were 3 163 3 462 3 184 and 3 085 mg l tp values were 0 116 0 219 0 182 and 0 301 mg l nh3 n codmn bod5 and e coli values varied in the range of 0 765 1 702 3 725 5 336 2 737 4 956 mg l and 3 301 104 2 412 105 a l pollutants in tributaries has five major input channels input from upstream of tributaries recharge of the mainstream the release of internal sources pollution from point and non point sources and the release of soil in the fluctuating zone zhao et al 2015 yang et al 2013 non point source loads were dominant in all pollution loads of the tgr fig 4 and large amounts of rainfall and runoff will increase the pollutants content in tributaries during the low water level period therefore tn tp nh3 n and e coli of the 27 tributaries increased from tributary upstream areas to mainstream during this period fig 2 6 however as the water level rose these four indices in the mainstream and tributary estuary kept the same growth trend and were higher than that in other two areas fig 2 6 mainstream backwater volume was larger than tributary upstream areas fig 3 a b suggesting that impoundment increased these four indices levels in tributaries therefore strengthening loads control to reduce pollutants expanding plant coverage to increase tributaries upstream flow and properly scheduling the timing and magnitude of water release out of reservoir may be helpful to decrease their contents tranmer et al 2020 by contrast codmn and bod5 in tributaries decreased with water level rising while both indices and do in mainstream increased fig 6 in addition all three parameters were higher in tributary than mainstream fig 6 illustrating that the abundant backwater diluted pollutant concentrations yang et al 2013 fig 3 a b mk test results fig 7 showed that tn tp nh3 n codmn bod5 and e coli levels for all sites decreased over time but do increased suggesting that the water quality of the tributaries will gradually improve over time 3 3 staged and periodic impoundment affects temporal variation in water quality indicators as shown in fig 8 the annual average values for tn and tp during 2000 2015 were in the range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l respectively the mean tn concentration of the first second and third impoundment stage was lower than that of the other two impoundment stages the mean tp codmn and bod5 values before impoundment were 0 172 3 919 and 2 207 mg l respectively which were lower than in the first impoundment stage but all three indices decreased over time thereafter the annual average nh3 n petroleum hydrocarbon ph and e coli values varied in the range of 0 328 0 976 0 022 0 057 mg l and 7 974 103 7 015 104 a l respectively and all decreased over time however do after impoundment was lower than that before but do and ph increased from the first impoundment to the full impoundment stage over time non point loads were the main sources of tn especially agricultural activity ren et al 2015 fig 4 however due to the resettlement project for tgd construction the crop area and nitrogen fertiliser application were reduced fig 4 hence tn during the construction period 2003 2010 was lower than that before impoundment 2000 2002 an increasing trend was observed after full impoundment 2010 2015 possibly due to the recovery of agricultural activities fig 4 in addition ph rose over time fig 8n might due to the increasing trend of eutrophication and algal bloom liu et al 2012 xu et al 2013 the slowing of the flow velocity rising water level and extended residence time caused large amounts of pollutants from submerged soil and plants to be released into the tgr during the impoundment stage liu et al 2004 dai et al 2010 xiao et al 2017 therefore tp codmn and bod5 were increased from before impoundment 2000 2003 to the first impoundment stage in 2003 fig 8 h i k however tp codmn bod5 nh3 n ph and e coli then decreased over time 2004 2014 fig 8 possibly because the self purification capacity increased wei et al 2011 additionally the pollutant concentrations in mainstream backwater tended to decrease over time fig 4 a b furthermore environmental management and governance efficiency improved since municipal wastewater treatment plants increased from 56 in 2008 to 220 in 2016 fig 4d and the domestic sewage treatment efficiency improved from 12 49 in 2003 to 99 87 in 2016 mep 2002 2017 the tn codmn bod5 and e coli peaked in the low water level period fig 9 the median of 27 rivers were 1 792 2 795 1 901 mg l and 7 846 103 a l moreover the number of rivers with the highest concentration of these four indices were largest in this period fig s1a these results indicate that stronger precipitation and runoff fig 3b with large amount of non point source loads fig 4 greatly promoted the concentration of these four indices xie et al 2017 however the nh3 n 0 313 mg l and tp 0 086 mg l reach their maximum value in the drainage period fig 9 and both indices in this period had the largest number of rivers with the highest concentration fig s1a this might be due to the mixing of the mainstream flow and the upstream flow from the tributaries caused the deposited nutrients to enter the water body yang et al 2013 and the increasing rainfall fig 3b could also bring some pollutants from the tributary upstream basin after tgr impoundment a plenty of mainstream backwater was input into tributaries ran et al 2010 fig 3 a b thereby diluting the pollutant concentrations in tributaries yang et al 2013 therefore all parameters except do were minimal in the impoundment nh3 n and tp and high water level tn codmn bod5 and e coli period fig 9 and these indices with the lowest concentration had the largest number of rivers during the two periods fig s1b in addition do was maximal in the high water level period fig 9 and s1a 3 4 stress effects of hydrodynamic changes on tributary eutrophication eutrophication is the most widespread global water environmental problem sinha et al 2017 and eutrophication has become more serious since the first impoundment in the tgr in 2003 yang et al 2010 zhang 2012a xiao et al 2016 herein all 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication and the eutrophication ratio was higher than 50 in 11 rivers fig 10 a furthermore the comprehensive trophic level index tli of 38 tgr tributaries was higher than 50 during 2004 2012 except for 2007 fig 10d therefore tributary eutrophication in the tgr was prominent and the reason probably was the high nutrient levels fig 2 caused by impoundment and non point source loads fig 3 4 the eutrophication percentage of p1 p19 was higher than that of p20 p38 from 2004 to 2012 fig 10a which might be due to the nutrient spatial variation fig 5 a b according to the reservoir water quality management strskraba and tundisi 1999 the river type is complete mixing when retention time tr 20 days the transitional type is moderate intensity stratification when tr is between 20 and 300 days and the lake type is stable layered when tr 300 days in the present study 65 of 20 tributaries had a tr more than 20 days 40 exceed 50 days tongzhuang river reached 488 days and tr increased from upper to lower tributaries of the tgr fig 3d of the 30 rivers within a distance of 560 km from the tgd 21 belong to the transitional type 1 falls into the lake type and 8 are the river type fig 3d therefore as the residence time increased many tributaries changed from river type before impoundment to lake type thereafter indicating the mixing intensity of tributaries decreased while the possibility of water stratification and algal blooms increased yang et al 2010 xu et al 2011a in fact the frequency of blooms increased after impoundment it was 8 in 2004 34 in 2006 and 197 in 2004 2012 fig 10f and it increased from upstream tributaries to downstream tributaries fig 10c in addition 18 tributaries displayed exceptionally high chl a eutrophication values 10 mg m3 during 2004 2012 fig 10b during the high water level period large flows of mainstream backwater were input into tributaries ran et al 2010 fig 3 a b diluting the pollutant concentrations yang et al 2013 fig 9 and s1 thus tgr tributaries showed serious eutrophication and high chl a levels during march september fig 10 g h however the highest frequency of blooms occurred from march to june fig 10i and were dominated by diatom and dinoflagellate bloom xu et al 2011c it was mainly due to the slowing flow velocity fig 3c extending tr fig 3d and increasing water temperature fig 3e promoted water column stability during the drainage period henson 2007 xu et al 2011b c in addition high concentration nutrient from mainstream backwater was another cause luo et al 2011 sinha et al 2017 fig 6 herein the median tn and tp values were 1 581 and 0 074 mg l between 2003 and 2012 respectively fig 2 which are sufficient to support algae growth and proliferation xu et al 2011a however the mainstream characterised by high nutrients fig 2 but never be reported stratification and algal blooms mep 2002 2017 suggesting that nutrients might not be the primary factors limiting spring bloom in tributaries while hydrodynamic conditions were 3 5 tgr operation drives variation in tributary water quality water quality changes across space and time in tgr tributaries are illustrated in fig 11 water quality was mainly ranked between fair and good and at least 60 of sampling sites were categorised as good the ccme wqi values were ordered tributary estuary backwater area tributary upstream with mean values of 75 141 78 023 and 82 017 respectively fig 11a this might because high nutrients in tributary estuaries fig 2 and 6 presumably due to high pollution loads and backwater movement from the mainstream yang et al 2010 liu et al 2012 fig 3 4 the median ccme wqi values for yipin s05 huaxi s06 and s07 and zhuxi s35 and s36 rivers were 53 410 50 409 and 56 735 respectively fig 11a indicating poor water quality this was mainly due to the dense human population and extensive production activities mep 2002 2017 in addition the ccme wqi value increased over time and was ranked first impoundment stage 2003 second impoundment stage 2004 2006 third impoundment stage 2007 2010 after full impoundment 2011 2012 with mean values of 70 469 75 159 79 662 and 80 242 respectively fig 11a firstly the improved water quality of tgr tributaries was consistent with water quality indices decreasing over time with successive impoundments zheng et al 2011 tang et al 2014 fig 8 secondly this may be attributed to government protection and restoration measures sewage treatment plants increased from 56 in 2008 to 220 in 2016 the amount of treated domestic wastewater increased from 0 05 billion tons in 2003 to 0 79 billion tons in 2013 and the sewage treatment rate increased from 12 50 in 2003 to 99 87 in 2013 fig 4d finally fertiliser application decreased after full impoundment fig 4e furthermore there was no obvious change in the ccme wqi value during high water level drainage and low water level period while all three periods were significantly lower than that in the impoundment period p 0 01 anova fig 11 b c the rapid rise in water level from 145 to 175 m during the impoundment period promoted large mainstream flows to input into tributaries fig 3 a b and diluted pollutants yang et al 2013 fig 9 hence this period displayed the highest water quality the impact of the tgd and impoundment on the water environment is a complex issue and the succession and stability of large scale reservoir ecosystem is a long term process the loads are the sources of pollutants and water flow control the transportation and migration of pollutants xiang et al 2021 they were the main cause of the spatiotemporal differences in water quality high nutrients and serious blooms of the tgr tributaries in this study therefore based on the reservoir operations and climatic conditions proper flow regulation inflow from tributaries upstream areas or outflow from dam control of pollution sources and improvement of biodiversity may greatly improve the management of river type reservoirs tranmer et al 2020 4 conclusions non point loads and impoundment were the main cause of high nutrient levels in tributaries the mean tn and tp values varied in the range of 1 619 2 739 and 0 088 0 277 mg l during 2000 2015 respectively hence both were key pollution parameters water quality indices of the upper tributaries in the tgr had higher values due to the dense human population and extensive production activities the difference in water volume and pollutant content between the mainstream and tributaries resulted in the spatial change of water quality indicators tn before impoundment was higher than that after while tp codmn and bod5 showed the opposite trend the water quality indices of tributaries were minimal in the impoundment and high water level periods because they were diluted by a large amount of mainstream flow input following the impoundment the raised water level slower flow velocity proper temperature extended water retention time caused frequent eutrophication and blooms in the tributary backwater area all 38 tributaries displayed eutrophication and the frequency of blooms was concentrated in spring and increased from the upper tributaries to downstream the ccme wqi value of the tgr tributary was categorised as good at more than 60 of sites decreased from tributaries upstream to tributaries estuary and was maximal in impoundment period moreover the ccme wqi value and mk test results show that the water quality improved over time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17111,membrane fouling is a prominent problem that hinders the stable and efficient operation of the reverse osmosis ro system for wastewater reclamation previous studies showed that chlorine disinfection which was commonly used in industrial ro systems as pretreatment could lead to significant change in microbial community structure and resulted in serious biofouling in order to prevent biofouling during wastewater reclamation the effect of ultraviolet uv disinfection on ro membrane fouling was investigated and the mechanism was also revealed in this study with the disinfection pretreatment by uv of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 the bacteria in the feed water were inactivated significantly with a log reduction of 1 11 2 55 and 3 61 log respectively however ro membrane fouling aggravated with higher uv dosage especially in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the normalized ro membrane flux decreased by 15 compared with the control group after 19 day operation the morphology of the fouled ro membranes indicated serious biofouling in all groups the analysis on the microbial amount of the foulants showed that the heterotrophic plate counts hpc and atp content on the fouled ro membranes with and without uv disinfection were at the same level however the total organic carbon content of the foulants with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 was significantly higher than the control group with higher content of proteins and polysaccharides as indicated by eem and ftir spectrum microbial community structure analysis showed that some typical uv resistant bacteria were selected and remained on the ro membrane after disinfection with high uv dosage including these residual bacteria after disinfection with high uv dosage showed higher extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion compared with those without uv disinfection and thus aggravated ro membrane fouling thicker eps could decrease the transmission of uv rays and thus bacteria with higher eps secretion might be selected after uv disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis membrane fouling biofouling uv disinfection extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction reclaimed water is becoming one of the most important water resources for the production of high quality pure water for industrial use such as low pressure boiler make up water recirculating cooling water industrial water for semiconductor factories and so on navarro 2018 zhu et al 2017 reverse osmosis ro process is an inevitable unit in the production of pure water this process is relatively stable and mature for seawater desalination and surface water or groundwater purification however the concentration of organic pollutants in reclaimed water is much higher than that in seawater and conventional water sources therefore the ro system for wastewater reclamation is confronted with more serious membrane fouling compared with seawater desalination and conventional water source purification membrane fouling could increase the operational energy and chemical consumption and deteriorate the permeate quality of the ro system jiang et al 2017 madaeni and samieirad 2010 wen et al 2018 among the complex and various kinds of ro membrane fouling mechanism biofouling is the most complicated changeable and difficult to control matin et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2018 ro membrane biofouling was mainly induced by microorganisms and the surrounding extracellular polymeric substances eps yu et al 2017 2018 eps could increase the hydraulic resistance and thus cause the decline of the permeate flux herzberg et al 2009 to prevent and alleviate biofouling disinfection was used as the pretreatment prior to the ro unit it is considered that the reduction of microbial amount in the feed water meant the decrease of biofouling potential in the industrial scale ro systems free chlorine was the most commonly used reagent for disinfection pretreatment bai et al 2020 kim et al 2009 wang et al 2019b however disinfection using free chlorine was reported to potentially aggravate ro membrane fouling as it could promote eps production via changing the microbial community structure khan et al 2015 wang et al 2019b 2019c chlorine as a typical oxidizing disinfectant could select microorganisms with higher eps production from microbial community and thus promoted the eps secretion of the residual bacteria therefore in order to prevent biofouling it is necessary to investigate the effect of non oxidizing disinfection process on ro membrane biofouling ultraviolet uv disinfection is also a commonly used process to inactivate microorganisms in wastewater by damaging the dna of microorganisms wolfe 1990 because of the non oxidizing disinfection mechanism uv might not increase the eps production of the residual bacteria after disinfection and thus show positive effect on the control of biofouling however the effect of uv disinfection on the biofouling of ro membranes has rarely been studied therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of uv disinfection on the fouling of ro membranes for municipal wastewater reclamation and reveal the mechanism the changes of permeate flux with and without uv disinfection as pretreatment during 20 day operation were recorded and compared after the operation the fouled membranes and the foulants were analyzed and compared systematically in terms of morphology microbial and organic matter amount organic matter composition and microbial community structure furthermore the amount and properties of the eps secreted by the residual bacteria after uv disinfection were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water quality and ultraviolet disinfection membrane bioreactor mbr effluent was taken every two d from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china and kept at 4 c the water quality parameters of the mbr effluent are shown in table 1 the mbr effluent was used as feed water because mbr effluent had good water quantity with much less suspended solids compared with traditional secondary effluent meanwhile the applicant of mbr effluent as feed water could pose remarkable economic viability moreover the mbr effluent has been repeatedly reported to have great potential to directly serve as feed water to the ro system abyar and nowrouzi 2020 tay et al 2020 a bench scale collimated beam apparatus was used for the uv irradiation of samples as previously reported li et al 2017 this apparatus contains a low pressure mercury uv lamp housed in a tube for collimating the uv beam onto the sample every 24 h newly collected mbr effluent was treated by uv irradiation and then kept in darkness and used as feed water to the ro system the water sample without uv disinfection namely 0 mj cm2 was used as the control group during uv irradiation the effluent was stirred at 200 rpm the uv dosages used for disinfection were 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 after uv disinfection 100 µl water sample was serially diluted to determine the disinfection efficiency it should be noticed that after uv irradiation and before the water went into the ro cell the bacteria could regrow for 0 24 h in darkness in ro process used in wwtps the bacteria could also stay and regrow for certain period in the feed tank and ro membrane system 2 2 reverse osmosis system a bench scale cross flow ro system was used to simulate the ro membrane biofouling process as described in detail in the previous study wang et al 2019b fig 1 aromatic polyamide ro membrane proc10 hydranautics usa was cut into round coupon d 32 mm used for examining biofouling the ro membrane from hydranautics did not have any exclusive feature compared with ro membranes from other manufactures the ro membrane fouling potential of mbr effluent before and after uv disinfection was investigated by running four the same lab scale membrane units respectively for 20 d the operational pressure was fixed at 1 2 mpa batch feed of wastewater to ro were applied but the feed water was renewed every 24 h the weight of feed water and permeate water was recorded by electronic balance connected to computer and the water was not recirculated the normalized flux decline curves were obtained and fitted by using a modified intermediate blocking model tong et al 2020b as shown in eq 1 the software of origin 2021 originlab corporation usa was used in the fitting 1 j j 0 j pss exp k j pss t j pss exp k j pss t 1 where j j 0 is the normalized flux at time t j pss is the final normalized flux in the equilibrium phase during which the flux would not decline and k is the membrane surface blocked per unit of total volume permeated through the membrane which could represent the fouling potential of the water sample m 1 2 3 characterization of the fouled membranes 2 3 1 morphology of the fouled ro membranes photos of the fouled ro membranes were firstly taken with a camera the morphology of the ro membranes was then examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem carl zeiss merlin gmbh germany equipped with an in lens secondary electron detector at accelerating voltage of 4 kv and probe current of 120 pa pictures were taken with amplification of 10 000 and 30 000 times moreover the morphology of ro membranes was also investigated with atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker united states the scan area was 500 μm 500 μm 2 3 2 microbial amount in the foulants microbial amount was determined using both the culture plate coating method and the atp content method triplicated experiments were conducted a piece of 40 mm2 fouled membrane was cut and sucked in 0 5 ml normal saline the bacteria on the membrane were suspended on a vortex for 3 min a volume of 100 μl bacterial suspension was used for culture plate coating and colony forming unit cfu counting another volume of 100 μl bacterial suspension was transit to 96 wall plates and 100 μl celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay promega usa was added after incubation at 25 c in dark for 20 min the atp contents of bacterial cells was determined by using a spectramax m5 multimode microplate reader molecular devices usa 2 3 3 organic matter amount and composition in the foulants a piece of fouled membrane with area of 40 mm2 was cut and immersed in 5 ml naoh solution ph 12 the naoh concentration could help dissolve organic matter in the foulants but would not degrade the ro membrane after shaken at 100 rpm for 2 h the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 and the solution was diluted to 15 ml with water then the solution was filtered by a membrane with pore size of 0 45 μm the total organic carbon in solution was measured with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu corporation japan the analysis was triplicated the composition of organic matter in the foulants was analyzed by using excitation emission matrix eem spectrum and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the eem spectra of soluble matter in the foulants were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with excitation wavelength of 220 to 450 nm and emission wavelength of 240 to 600 nm each eem spectrum was cut to have size region as in previous study wang and zhang 2010 among these regions region i is related to the tyrosine tryptophan amino acids region ii is related to tyrosine tryptophan proteins region iii is related to polysaccharides region iv is related to fulvic acid region v and region vi are related to polycarboxylate type humic acid after freeze drying the soluble matter in the foulants was used in the ftir sepectroscopic analysis by using a ftir analyzer with an attenuated total reflection atr accessory nexus model thermo nicolet corporation usa data was collected between wave number of 500 to 4000 cm 1 spectra were baseline corrected and normalized to calculate the peak area in the spectrum the software of origin 2021 was used 2 3 4 microbial community structure in the foulants a piece of 100 mm2 of fouled membrane was taken and cut into three parallel samples the microbial community was analyzed as previously reported yu et al 2017 including a series of steps of dna extraction pcr amplification of 16s rrna genes sequencing clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units otus otus classification all determined sequences were submitted to the ncbi sra database with accession number of prjna679675 2 4 culture of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection and eps characterization to investigate the eps secretion property of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection the mbr effluent with and without uv disinfection were inoculated in 1 10 r2a medium and cultivated under 25 c these cultures were triplicated after 2 5 d solids including eps and the bacteria in the medium were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g then eps was extracted as follows water bath at 45 c with shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min and filtration by using a 0 45 µm membrane the incubation at 45 c could promote the dissolution of eps components the specific extraction method was used because it was previously determined to be the best in respect to its effects on promoting eps dissolution meanwhile preventing lysis of microbial cell sun et al 2017 after extraction the eps content was measured with a toc analyzer and analyzed by using ftir spectroscopy 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of the ro membrane flux with different dosages of uv as disinfection pretreatment the feed water of the ro system was disinfected with different dosages of uv and the disinfection performance was shown in fig 2 a the initial bacterial concentration in the feed water was 2 43 1 24 105 cfu ml and the residual bacteria concentration was 1 86 0 13 104 6 9 1 2 102 and 6 1 101 cfu ml after disinfection with the uv dosage of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 respectively uv disinfection significantly inactivated the bacteria in the feed water with a log reduction of 1 11 2 55 and 3 61 log with the uv dosage of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 respectively the water samples without and with uv disinfection were then used as the feed water of the ro system and the change of the ro membrane flux was shown in fig 2b during the operation of the ro system the salt rejection rates of the four groups were all higher than 98 suggesting the intactness of the ro membranes and the system the flux decline curves fluctuated and the difference in flux increased over time thus it was considered that these 19 replicates of uv disinfection have the similar effects on ro fouling although the bacteria in the feed water was reduced significantly by higher uv dosage the ro membrane fouling was aggravated with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 the final normalized flux of the experimental groups with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 dropped to 0 79 and 0 70 after 19 day operation in terms of the flux decline rates they were 0 15 017 0 21 and 0 30 corresponding to groups with uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 the 0 15 vs 0 17 flux decline rate between 0 and 20 mj cm2 was not noteworthy and it is believed that the effect of uv at 20 mj cm2 on ro fouling is not significant in group with uv irradiation of 40 and 80 mj cm2 the flux decline rate were 140 and 200 of that without uv irradiation respectively these variations in flux decline rate were noteworthy with high uv dosage the biofouling aggravated significantly modified intermediate blocking model tong et al 2020b was used to fit the flux data in fig 2b and the fitting results were shown in fig s1 supplementary material and table 2 these results showed that the flux data could be described properly by the modified intermediate blocking model as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 over 0 85 in each group the fouling potential parameter k of water samples after disinfection with the uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 were 0 016 0 003 0 016 0 001 0 023 0 007 and 0 064 0 012 m 1 respectively table 2 by using t test it was shown the increase from 0 016 0 001 to 0 023 0 007 was not significant p 0 05 but the increase from 0 023 0 007 to 0 064 0 012 was technically significant p 0 05 these results indicated that with the increase of uv dosage the ro membrane fouling potential of the water samples increased significantly however it still needs to be noticed that all these k values were calculated from the results of one test with four ro units running together to investigate the effects of uv dosage on ro membrane fouling lakretz et al lakretz et al 2018 also investigated the effect of uv irradiation as pretreatment of ro influent in their study the feed water was brackish water and the uv dosage was set at 137 mj cm 2 after the ro system running for around 310 h the permeate flux in group with uv pretreatment dropped to 0 45 compared with 0 60 in group without pretreatment this result agrees with that in the current study the phenomenon was observed in their work but the cause was not revealed similar phenomenon of flux drop was also observed in the investigation of the effects of chlorine disinfection on ro membrane fouling wang et al 2019b 2019c the aggravation of membrane fouling after chlorine disinfection was closely related to the chlorine resistant bacteria crb the change of microbial community structure after disinfection was considered as the key factor aggravating the membrane fouling which might also be an important factor in the change of membrane fouling potential after uv disinfection 3 2 characterization of the foulants on the ro membranes with different dosages of uv as disinfection pretreatment in order to reveal the mechanism of the aggravation of membrane fouling after uv disinfection the fouled membranes were analyzed in several aspects the morphology of the fouled ro membranes optical sem and afm under different uv dosages was shown in fig 3 with the increase of uv dosage the color of the foulants on the ro membranes became darker the sem images showed that all the fouled ro membranes were covered by bacterial film indicating serious biofouling although the bacteria concentration in the feed water was reduced significantly after uv disinfection fig 2a the bacterial number on the fouled ro membranes with higher uv dosages seemed to be no less than that without uv disinfection afm images showed that with the increase of uv dosage the roughness of the surface of the fouled ro membranes increased significantly the morphology of the fouled ro membrane with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 was quite different with the control group these results indicated significant change of the amount and composition of the foulants on ro membranes after uv disinfection the microbial and organic matter amount on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 4 despite of the significant inactivation of the bacteria in the feed water by uv disinfection the hpc on the fouled ro membranes with different uv dosages were at the same level the hpc with the uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 was 1 42 0 31 105 0 88 0 13 105 2 02 1 06 105 and 4 12 2 67 105 cfu ml respectively no significance was found in the hpc among the four groups independent sample t test the amount of atp on the fouled ro membranes with different uv dosages was in the range of 3 23 4 17 ng cm2 with no significant difference among the four groups independent sample t test the results of hpc on the fouled ro membranes were in accordance with the atp amount however the organic matter amount in terms of toc on the fouled ro membrane with the uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 and 80 mj cm2 were found to be significantly higher p 0 05 than the control group fig 4c the toc content of foulants with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 were 0 33 0 02 and 0 41 0 03 mg cm2 which were 19 and 40 higher than that of the control group higher toc content indicated more amount of organic foulants on the ro membranes with higher uv dosage thus leading to higher filtration resistance the eem of the organic matter on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 5 with the increase of the uv dosage the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter in the foulants increased especially in the sample with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 as for the different regions of the eem the fluorescence intensity in the region ⅰ and ⅱ increased obviously compared with other regions indicating significant increase in the amount of protein like matter in the foulants wang and zhang 2010 the eem spectrum can be normalized by toc from these normalized eem spectra fig s2 it could be observed that with the increase of uv dosage there is quite some change in each region from different eem spectrum the difference in eem spectrum between groups with no uv irradiation and uv dosage of 80 mj cm 2 is most noticeable it could be deduced that the structure of these eps components of proteins and polysaccharides and humic acids underwent significant change with the irradiation pretreatment in ro influent the ftir spectra of the organic matter on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 6 the characteristic peak at 1020 cm 1 indicated the amount of glycosidic bonds in the foulants wang et al 2018 warren et al 2016 and the characteristic peak at 1530 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 indicated the amount of amide bonds in the foulants yang et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of the uv dosage the characteristic peak area of glycosidic bonds and amide bonds showed significant increase especially in the experimental group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the peak area of glycosidic bonds and amide bonds increased by 42 and 12 compared with the control group these results indicated that the amount of polysaccharides glycosidic bonds and proteins amide bonds increased in the foulants with high uv dosages the results of the change of protein content were also in accordance with the eem fig 5 polysaccharides and proteins are important components of the eps wang et al 2009 it was implied that after uv disinfection the residual bacteria might secrete more amount of eps and thus led to more serious ro membrane fouling similar phenomenon was observed in other studies song et al 2016 as well as in the investigation of chlorine disinfection wang et al 2019b 2019c eps as a kind of outer protection of bacterial cells could decrease the transmission of uv rays and also react with free chlorine to consume the disinfectant therefore after both uv disinfection and chlorine disinfection residual bacteria with higher eps section might be selected in order to verify this hypothesis it is necessary to analyze the microbial community structure on the fouled ro membranes 3 3 change of the microbial community structure in the foulants on the ro membranes the microbial community structure in the foulants with different uv dosage was analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and the results were shown in fig 7 at the phylum level fig 7a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all the groups with a relative abundance ranging from 35 4 to 56 2 besides bacteroidetes planctomycetes and actinobacteria were also the main phylum in four groups with a relative abundance of 6 4 33 2 11 0 22 4 and 10 7 12 9 these phyla were also common on the fouled ro membranes in the industrial scale ro systems tong et al 2020a yu et al 2017 especially the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased significantly after disinfection with high dosage of uv in the control group and the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the abundance of bacteroidetes was 9 7 and 33 2 significant difference with p 0 05 at the class level fig 7b in all groups the dominant classes were gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetacia with the relative abundance of 19 4 30 2 6 4 33 2 12 7 24 0 10 6 12 8 and 3 5 8 7 respectively compared with the control group the relative abundance of bacteroidia and planctomycetacia increased significantly p 0 05 from 9 5 to 33 2 and 3 5 to 6 6 after disinfection with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 at the genus level fig 7c in all groups the dominant genera were mycobacterium olb12 dokdonella ralstonia and hydrogenophaga with the relative abundance of 9 7 11 4 2 2 24 4 1 7 10 4 0 9 5 6 and 1 4 4 1 notably in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the relative abundance of olb12 ralstonia and planctopirus showed significant increase p 0 05 compared with that in the control group these results indicated that uv disinfection changed the microbial community structure in the foulants on the ro membrane the significant differences at the genus level among all groups were also analyzed with heat map as shown in fig 8 significantly distinctive genus in each sample was highlighted and red color indicated that the relative abundance of this genus in this sample was much higher than that in other samples among the most significantly distinctive genera in the sample with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 some typical bacterial genera were reported to be resistant to uv or to secrete more eps under environmental stress ralstonia were found to be resistant to uv disinfection pullerits et al 2020 when irradiated by uv with dosage around 400 mj cm2 its taxa abundance increased by more than 2 times in drinking water sample pullerits et al 2020 furthermore ralstonia often presents with high abundance in the foulants on ro membranes ivnitsky et al 2007 khan et al 2015 zodrow et al 2014 it was reported that the eps productivity of ralstonia could be as high as 120 mg l wang and yu 2007 and it was also reported that the eps yield of ralstonia culture was around 70 of biomass watcharamusika et al 2008 sphingobium was also featured with high eps productivity around 30 mg l in nutrient broth zhang et al 2011 and found in the foulants on ro membranes belgini et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 besides a typical chlorine resistant bacterial genus mycobacterium lee et al 2010 luo et al 2021 taylor et al 2000 wang et al 2019a was also found to be the significantly distinctive genus in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 these results indicated that uv disinfection did show selective effect on the residual bacteria to some extent especially in the group with high uv dosage 80 mj cm2 typical uv resistant bacteria bacteria with high eps production and even chlorine resistant bacteria were identified as the significantly distinctive genera apart from the selective effect on the residual bacteria it is believed that uv disinfection could still affect eps productivity and properties by altering eps metabolism of the eps component bacteria and causing chemical or physical reaction on eps lakretz et al 2018 song et al 2016 3 4 eps secretion by the residual bacteria after uv disinfection in order to investigate the eps secretion properties of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection the water samples disinfected with different dosages of uv were used as inoculum into 1 10 r2a medium after 3 day cultivation eps of the residual bacteria were extracted and analyzed and the results were shown in fig 9 in terms of the eps amount high uv dosage especially 80 mj cm2 showed significant stimulating effect on eps secretion compared with the control group the eps amount increased significantly p 0 05 from 15 5 3 5 mg l of the control group to 24 9 3 2 mg l of the experimental group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the ftir spectrum of the eps with different uv dosages was shown in fig 9b the position of the characteristic peaks of eps was almost the same as the foulants on the ro membranes fig 6 namely 1020 cm 1 glycosidic bonds 1530 cm 1 amide ⅱ bonds and 1630 cm 1 amide i bonds these results suggested that the main components of the organic foulants on the ro membranes were eps in deed as for the effect of uv dosage on the composition of eps the peak area in the ftir spectrum for glycosidic bonds increased by 28 in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 while the change of the peak area for amide bonds was not obvious these results were consistent with the characterization of the organic matter in the foulants similar to the previous study on the effect of chlorine disinfection as the pretreatment of the ro system uv disinfection also selected some residual bacteria with higher eps secretion and thus aggravated ro membrane fouling wang et al 2019b thicker eps outside bacterial cells might decrease the transmission of uv rays as the colloidal proteins and polysaccharides were the main components of eps these organic components could also react with chlorine to protect bacterial cells from chlorine this might be the main reason for similar negative effects of uv disinfection and chlorine disinfection on biofouling control however the selective effect of low uv dosage was not that obvious as indicated by the eps production fig 9 and organic matter amount on the fouled ro membranes fig 4c with the uv dosage of 20 mj cm2 the normalized flux was even higher than the control group during the operation though the final normalized flux of the two groups were almost the same these results indicated that in order to control biofouling excessive disinfection in the pretreatment process might be undesirable excessive disinfection could show significant selective effect on the bacteria with higher eps production although the number of these bacteria might be reduced during disinfection with high dosage it was very difficult to eliminate all these bacteria in the feed water thus during long term operation these residual bacteria became the dominant strains on the membrane surface because of the selective effect of excessive disinfection and then more serious fouling was induced this mechanism was demonstrated both in the studies on chlorine disinfection and uv disinfection as the pretreatment of the ro system chlorine and uv are two of the most commonly used disinfection technologies in water treatment yet they all showed negative effect on the control of ro membrane biofouling therefore it is necessary to explore the effects of other disinfection methods on biofouling of ro membranes in order to optimize the ro process for wastewater reclamation 4 conclusions this study showed that disinfection pretreatment with high dosage uv could aggravate membrane fouling even though uv disinfection significantly inactivated the bacteria in the feed water of the ro system at the end of operation the hpc and atp content in the foulants on ro membranes showed no significant difference in control group and uv disinfection groups however the toc in membrane foulants was significantly enhanced after uv disinfection especial with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 this phenomenon could be attributed to the enhanced abundance of typical biofouling causing bacteria on ro membranes such as ralstonia and sphigobium which were reported to have high eps productivity by cultivating the residual bacteria after uv disinfection it was verified that eps produced by these residual bacteria were the main components in the foulants on ro membranes furthermore residual bacteria after disinfection with high dosage of uv could produce more eps than those without uv disinfection and thus caused more serious membrane fouling notes the authors declare no competing financial interest

17111,membrane fouling is a prominent problem that hinders the stable and efficient operation of the reverse osmosis ro system for wastewater reclamation previous studies showed that chlorine disinfection which was commonly used in industrial ro systems as pretreatment could lead to significant change in microbial community structure and resulted in serious biofouling in order to prevent biofouling during wastewater reclamation the effect of ultraviolet uv disinfection on ro membrane fouling was investigated and the mechanism was also revealed in this study with the disinfection pretreatment by uv of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 the bacteria in the feed water were inactivated significantly with a log reduction of 1 11 2 55 and 3 61 log respectively however ro membrane fouling aggravated with higher uv dosage especially in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the normalized ro membrane flux decreased by 15 compared with the control group after 19 day operation the morphology of the fouled ro membranes indicated serious biofouling in all groups the analysis on the microbial amount of the foulants showed that the heterotrophic plate counts hpc and atp content on the fouled ro membranes with and without uv disinfection were at the same level however the total organic carbon content of the foulants with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 was significantly higher than the control group with higher content of proteins and polysaccharides as indicated by eem and ftir spectrum microbial community structure analysis showed that some typical uv resistant bacteria were selected and remained on the ro membrane after disinfection with high uv dosage including these residual bacteria after disinfection with high uv dosage showed higher extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion compared with those without uv disinfection and thus aggravated ro membrane fouling thicker eps could decrease the transmission of uv rays and thus bacteria with higher eps secretion might be selected after uv disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reverse osmosis membrane fouling biofouling uv disinfection extracellular polymeric substances 1

process is relatively stable and mature for seawater desalination and surface water or groundwater purification however the concentration of organic pollutants in reclaimed water is much higher than that in seawater and conventional water sources therefore the ro system for wastewater reclamation is confronted with more serious membrane fouling compared with seawater desalination and conventional water source purification membrane fouling could increase the operational energy and chemical consumption and deteriorate the permeate quality of the ro system jiang et al 2017 madaeni and samieirad 2010 wen et al 2018 among the complex and various kinds of ro membrane fouling mechanism biofouling is the most complicated changeable and difficult to control matin et al 2011 nagaraj et al 2018 ro membrane biofouling was mainly induced by microorganisms and the surrounding extracellular polymeric substances eps yu et al 2017 2018 eps could increase the hydraulic resistance and thus cause the decline of the permeate flux herzberg et al 2009 to prevent and alleviate biofouling disinfection was used as the pretreatment prior to the ro unit it is considered that the reduction of microbial amount in the feed water meant the decrease of biofouling potential in the industrial scale ro systems free chlorine was the most commonly used reagent for disinfection pretreatment bai et al 2020 kim et al 2009 wang et al 2019b however disinfection using free chlorine was reported to potentially aggravate ro membrane fouling as it could promote eps production via changing the microbial community structure khan et al 2015 wang et al 2019b 2019c chlorine as a typical oxidizing disinfectant could select microorganisms with higher eps production from microbial community and thus promoted the eps secretion of the residual bacteria therefore in order to prevent biofouling it is necessary to investigate the effect of non oxidizing disinfection process on ro membrane biofouling ultraviolet uv disinfection is also a commonly used process to inactivate microorganisms in wastewater by damaging the dna of microorganisms wolfe 1990 because of the non oxidizing disinfection mechanism uv might not increase the eps production of the residual bacteria after disinfection and thus show positive effect on the control of biofouling however the effect of uv disinfection on the biofouling of ro membranes has rarely been studied therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of uv disinfection on the fouling of ro membranes for municipal wastewater reclamation and reveal the mechanism the changes of permeate flux with and without uv disinfection as pretreatment during 20 day operation were recorded and compared after the operation the fouled membranes and the foulants were analyzed and compared systematically in terms of morphology microbial and organic matter amount organic matter composition and microbial community structure furthermore the amount and properties of the eps secreted by the residual bacteria after uv disinfection were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water quality and ultraviolet disinfection membrane bioreactor mbr effluent was taken every two d from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china and kept at 4 c the water quality parameters of the mbr effluent are shown in table 1 the mbr effluent was used as feed water because mbr effluent had good water quantity with much less suspended solids compared with traditional secondary effluent meanwhile the applicant of mbr effluent as feed water could pose remarkable economic viability moreover the mbr effluent has been repeatedly reported to have great potential to directly serve as feed water to the ro system abyar and nowrouzi 2020 tay et al 2020 a bench scale collimated beam apparatus was used for the uv irradiation of samples as previously reported li et al 2017 this apparatus contains a low pressure mercury uv lamp housed in a tube for collimating the uv beam onto the sample every 24 h newly collected mbr effluent was treated by uv irradiation and then kept in darkness and used as feed water to the ro system the water sample without uv disinfection namely 0 mj cm2 was used as the control group during uv irradiation the effluent was stirred at 200 rpm the uv dosages used for disinfection were 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 after uv disinfection 100 µl water sample was serially diluted to determine the disinfection efficiency it should be noticed that after uv irradiation and before the water went into the ro cell the bacteria could regrow for 0 24 h in darkness in ro process used in wwtps the bacteria could also stay and regrow for certain period in the feed tank and ro membrane system 2 2 reverse osmosis system a bench scale cross flow ro system was used to simulate the ro membrane biofouling process as described in detail in the previous study wang et al 2019b fig 1 aromatic polyamide ro membrane proc10 hydranautics usa was cut into round coupon d 32 mm used for examining biofouling the ro membrane from hydranautics did not have any exclusive feature compared with ro membranes from other manufactures the ro membrane fouling potential of mbr effluent before and after uv disinfection was investigated by running four the same lab scale membrane units respectively for 20 d the operational pressure was fixed at 1 2 mpa batch feed of wastewater to ro were applied but the feed water was renewed every 24 h the weight of feed water and permeate water was recorded by electronic balance connected to computer and the water was not recirculated the normalized flux decline curves were obtained and fitted by using a modified intermediate blocking model tong et al 2020b as shown in eq 1 the software of origin 2021 originlab corporation usa was used in the fitting 1 j j 0 j pss exp k j pss t j pss exp k j pss t 1 where j j 0 is the normalized flux at time t j pss is the final normalized flux in the equilibrium phase during which the flux would not decline and k is the membrane surface blocked per unit of total volume permeated through the membrane which could represent the fouling potential of the water sample m 1 2 3 characterization of the fouled membranes 2 3 1 morphology of the fouled ro membranes photos of the fouled ro membranes were firstly taken with a camera the morphology of the ro membranes was then examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem carl zeiss merlin gmbh germany equipped with an in lens secondary electron detector at accelerating voltage of 4 kv and probe current of 120 pa pictures were taken with amplification of 10 000 and 30 000 times moreover the morphology of ro membranes was also investigated with atomic force microscopy afm dimension icon bruker united states the scan area was 500 μm 500 μm 2 3 2 microbial amount in the foulants microbial amount was determined using both the culture plate coating method and the atp content method triplicated experiments were conducted a piece of 40 mm2 fouled membrane was cut and sucked in 0 5 ml normal saline the bacteria on the membrane were suspended on a vortex for 3 min a volume of 100 μl bacterial suspension was used for culture plate coating and colony forming unit cfu counting another volume of 100 μl bacterial suspension was transit to 96 wall plates and 100 μl celltiter glo luminescent cell viability assay promega usa was added after incubation at 25 c in dark for 20 min the atp contents of bacterial cells was determined by using a spectramax m5 multimode microplate reader molecular devices usa 2 3 3 organic matter amount and composition in the foulants a piece of fouled membrane with area of 40 mm2 was cut and immersed in 5 ml naoh solution ph 12 the naoh concentration could help dissolve organic matter in the foulants but would not degrade the ro membrane after shaken at 100 rpm for 2 h the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 and the solution was diluted to 15 ml with water then the solution was filtered by a membrane with pore size of 0 45 μm the total organic carbon in solution was measured with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu corporation japan the analysis was triplicated the composition of organic matter in the foulants was analyzed by using excitation emission matrix eem spectrum and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the eem spectra of soluble matter in the foulants were measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan with excitation wavelength of 220 to 450 nm and emission wavelength of 240 to 600 nm each eem spectrum was cut to have size region as in previous study wang and zhang 2010 among these regions region i is related to the tyrosine tryptophan amino acids region ii is related to tyrosine tryptophan proteins region iii is related to polysaccharides region iv is related to fulvic acid region v and region vi are related to polycarboxylate type humic acid after freeze drying the soluble matter in the foulants was used in the ftir sepectroscopic analysis by using a ftir analyzer with an attenuated total reflection atr accessory nexus model thermo nicolet corporation usa data was collected between wave number of 500 to 4000 cm 1 spectra were baseline corrected and normalized to calculate the peak area in the spectrum the software of origin 2021 was used 2 3 4 microbial community structure in the foulants a piece of 100 mm2 of fouled membrane was taken and cut into three parallel samples the microbial community was analyzed as previously reported yu et al 2017 including a series of steps of dna extraction pcr amplification of 16s rrna genes sequencing clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units otus otus classification all determined sequences were submitted to the ncbi sra database with accession number of prjna679675 2 4 culture of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection and eps characterization to investigate the eps secretion property of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection the mbr effluent with and without uv disinfection were inoculated in 1 10 r2a medium and cultivated under 25 c these cultures were triplicated after 2 5 d solids including eps and the bacteria in the medium were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g then eps was extracted as follows water bath at 45 c with shaking at 100 rpm for 1 h centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min and filtration by using a 0 45 µm membrane the incubation at 45 c could promote the dissolution of eps components the specific extraction method was used because it was previously determined to be the best in respect to its effects on promoting eps dissolution meanwhile preventing lysis of microbial cell sun et al 2017 after extraction the eps content was measured with a toc analyzer and analyzed by using ftir spectroscopy 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of the ro membrane flux with different dosages of uv as disinfection pretreatment the feed water of the ro system was disinfected with different dosages of uv and the disinfection performance was shown in fig 2 a the initial bacterial concentration in the feed water was 2 43 1 24 105 cfu ml and the residual bacteria concentration was 1 86 0 13 104 6 9 1 2 102 and 6 1 101 cfu ml after disinfection with the uv dosage of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 respectively uv disinfection significantly inactivated the bacteria in the feed water with a log reduction of 1 11 2 55 and 3 61 log with the uv dosage of 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 respectively the water samples without and with uv disinfection were then used as the feed water of the ro system and the change of the ro membrane flux was shown in fig 2b during the operation of the ro system the salt rejection rates of the four groups were all higher than 98 suggesting the intactness of the ro membranes and the system the flux decline curves fluctuated and the difference in flux increased over time thus it was considered that these 19 replicates of uv disinfection have the similar effects on ro fouling although the bacteria in the feed water was reduced significantly by higher uv dosage the ro membrane fouling was aggravated with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 the final normalized flux of the experimental groups with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 dropped to 0 79 and 0 70 after 19 day operation in terms of the flux decline rates they were 0 15 017 0 21 and 0 30 corresponding to groups with uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 the 0 15 vs 0 17 flux decline rate between 0 and 20 mj cm2 was not noteworthy and it is believed that the effect of uv at 20 mj cm2 on ro fouling is not significant in group with uv irradiation of 40 and 80 mj cm2 the flux decline rate were 140 and 200 of that without uv irradiation respectively these variations in flux decline rate were noteworthy with high uv dosage the biofouling aggravated significantly modified intermediate blocking model tong et al 2020b was used to fit the flux data in fig 2b and the fitting results were shown in fig s1 supplementary material and table 2 these results showed that the flux data could be described properly by the modified intermediate blocking model as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 over 0 85 in each group the fouling potential parameter k of water samples after disinfection with the uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 were 0 016 0 003 0 016 0 001 0 023 0 007 and 0 064 0 012 m 1 respectively table 2 by using t test it was shown the increase from 0 016 0 001 to 0 023 0 007 was not significant p 0 05 but the increase from 0 023 0 007 to 0 064 0 012 was technically significant p 0 05 these results indicated that with the increase of uv dosage the ro membrane fouling potential of the water samples increased significantly however it still needs to be noticed that all these k values were calculated from the results of one test with four ro units running together to investigate the effects of uv dosage on ro membrane fouling lakretz et al lakretz et al 2018 also investigated the effect of uv irradiation as pretreatment of ro influent in their study the feed water was brackish water and the uv dosage was set at 137 mj cm 2 after the ro system running for around 310 h the permeate flux in group with uv pretreatment dropped to 0 45 compared with 0 60 in group without pretreatment this result agrees with that in the current study the phenomenon was observed in their work but the cause was not revealed similar phenomenon of flux drop was also observed in the investigation of the effects of chlorine disinfection on ro membrane fouling wang et al 2019b 2019c the aggravation of membrane fouling after chlorine disinfection was closely related to the chlorine resistant bacteria crb the change of microbial community structure after disinfection was considered as the key factor aggravating the membrane fouling which might also be an important factor in the change of membrane fouling potential after uv disinfection 3 2 characterization of the foulants on the ro membranes with different dosages of uv as disinfection pretreatment in order to reveal the mechanism of the aggravation of membrane fouling after uv disinfection the fouled membranes were analyzed in several aspects the morphology of the fouled ro membranes optical sem and afm under different uv dosages was shown in fig 3 with the increase of uv dosage the color of the foulants on the ro membranes became darker the sem images showed that all the fouled ro membranes were covered by bacterial film indicating serious biofouling although the bacteria concentration in the feed water was reduced significantly after uv disinfection fig 2a the bacterial number on the fouled ro membranes with higher uv dosages seemed to be no less than that without uv disinfection afm images showed that with the increase of uv dosage the roughness of the surface of the fouled ro membranes increased significantly the morphology of the fouled ro membrane with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 was quite different with the control group these results indicated significant change of the amount and composition of the foulants on ro membranes after uv disinfection the microbial and organic matter amount on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 4 despite of the significant inactivation of the bacteria in the feed water by uv disinfection the hpc on the fouled ro membranes with different uv dosages were at the same level the hpc with the uv dosage of 0 20 40 and 80 mj cm2 was 1 42 0 31 105 0 88 0 13 105 2 02 1 06 105 and 4 12 2 67 105 cfu ml respectively no significance was found in the hpc among the four groups independent sample t test the amount of atp on the fouled ro membranes with different uv dosages was in the range of 3 23 4 17 ng cm2 with no significant difference among the four groups independent sample t test the results of hpc on the fouled ro membranes were in accordance with the atp amount however the organic matter amount in terms of toc on the fouled ro membrane with the uv dosage of 40 mj cm2 and 80 mj cm2 were found to be significantly higher p 0 05 than the control group fig 4c the toc content of foulants with the uv dosage of 40 and 80 mj cm2 were 0 33 0 02 and 0 41 0 03 mg cm2 which were 19 and 40 higher than that of the control group higher toc content indicated more amount of organic foulants on the ro membranes with higher uv dosage thus leading to higher filtration resistance the eem of the organic matter on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 5 with the increase of the uv dosage the fluorescence intensity of the organic matter in the foulants increased especially in the sample with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 as for the different regions of the eem the fluorescence intensity in the region ⅰ and ⅱ increased obviously compared with other regions indicating significant increase in the amount of protein like matter in the foulants wang and zhang 2010 the eem spectrum can be normalized by toc from these normalized eem spectra fig s2 it could be observed that with the increase of uv dosage there is quite some change in each region from different eem spectrum the difference in eem spectrum between groups with no uv irradiation and uv dosage of 80 mj cm 2 is most noticeable it could be deduced that the structure of these eps components of proteins and polysaccharides and humic acids underwent significant change with the irradiation pretreatment in ro influent the ftir spectra of the organic matter on the fouled ro membranes under different uv dosages were shown in fig 6 the characteristic peak at 1020 cm 1 indicated the amount of glycosidic bonds in the foulants wang et al 2018 warren et al 2016 and the characteristic peak at 1530 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 indicated the amount of amide bonds in the foulants yang et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of the uv dosage the characteristic peak area of glycosidic bonds and amide bonds showed significant increase especially in the experimental group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the peak area of glycosidic bonds and amide bonds increased by 42 and 12 compared with the control group these results indicated that the amount of polysaccharides glycosidic bonds and proteins amide bonds increased in the foulants with high uv dosages the results of the change of protein content were also in accordance with the eem fig 5 polysaccharides and proteins are important components of the eps wang et al 2009 it was implied that after uv disinfection the residual bacteria might secrete more amount of eps and thus led to more serious ro membrane fouling similar phenomenon was observed in other studies song et al 2016 as well as in the investigation of chlorine disinfection wang et al 2019b 2019c eps as a kind of outer protection of bacterial cells could decrease the transmission of uv rays and also react with free chlorine to consume the disinfectant therefore after both uv disinfection and chlorine disinfection residual bacteria with higher eps section might be selected in order to verify this hypothesis it is necessary to analyze the microbial community structure on the fouled ro membranes 3 3 change of the microbial community structure in the foulants on the ro membranes the microbial community structure in the foulants with different uv dosage was analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and the results were shown in fig 7 at the phylum level fig 7a proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all the groups with a relative abundance ranging from 35 4 to 56 2 besides bacteroidetes planctomycetes and actinobacteria were also the main phylum in four groups with a relative abundance of 6 4 33 2 11 0 22 4 and 10 7 12 9 these phyla were also common on the fouled ro membranes in the industrial scale ro systems tong et al 2020a yu et al 2017 especially the relative abundance of bacteroidetes increased significantly after disinfection with high dosage of uv in the control group and the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the abundance of bacteroidetes was 9 7 and 33 2 significant difference with p 0 05 at the class level fig 7b in all groups the dominant classes were gammaproteobacteria bacteroidia alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetacia with the relative abundance of 19 4 30 2 6 4 33 2 12 7 24 0 10 6 12 8 and 3 5 8 7 respectively compared with the control group the relative abundance of bacteroidia and planctomycetacia increased significantly p 0 05 from 9 5 to 33 2 and 3 5 to 6 6 after disinfection with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 at the genus level fig 7c in all groups the dominant genera were mycobacterium olb12 dokdonella ralstonia and hydrogenophaga with the relative abundance of 9 7 11 4 2 2 24 4 1 7 10 4 0 9 5 6 and 1 4 4 1 notably in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the relative abundance of olb12 ralstonia and planctopirus showed significant increase p 0 05 compared with that in the control group these results indicated that uv disinfection changed the microbial community structure in the foulants on the ro membrane the significant differences at the genus level among all groups were also analyzed with heat map as shown in fig 8 significantly distinctive genus in each sample was highlighted and red color indicated that the relative abundance of this genus in this sample was much higher than that in other samples among the most significantly distinctive genera in the sample with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 some typical bacterial genera were reported to be resistant to uv or to secrete more eps under environmental stress ralstonia were found to be resistant to uv disinfection pullerits et al 2020 when irradiated by uv with dosage around 400 mj cm2 its taxa abundance increased by more than 2 times in drinking water sample pullerits et al 2020 furthermore ralstonia often presents with high abundance in the foulants on ro membranes ivnitsky et al 2007 khan et al 2015 zodrow et al 2014 it was reported that the eps productivity of ralstonia could be as high as 120 mg l wang and yu 2007 and it was also reported that the eps yield of ralstonia culture was around 70 of biomass watcharamusika et al 2008 sphingobium was also featured with high eps productivity around 30 mg l in nutrient broth zhang et al 2011 and found in the foulants on ro membranes belgini et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 besides a typical chlorine resistant bacterial genus mycobacterium lee et al 2010 luo et al 2021 taylor et al 2000 wang et al 2019a was also found to be the significantly distinctive genus in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 these results indicated that uv disinfection did show selective effect on the residual bacteria to some extent especially in the group with high uv dosage 80 mj cm2 typical uv resistant bacteria bacteria with high eps production and even chlorine resistant bacteria were identified as the significantly distinctive genera apart from the selective effect on the residual bacteria it is believed that uv disinfection could still affect eps productivity and properties by altering eps metabolism of the eps component bacteria and causing chemical or physical reaction on eps lakretz et al 2018 song et al 2016 3 4 eps secretion by the residual bacteria after uv disinfection in order to investigate the eps secretion properties of the residual bacteria after uv disinfection the water samples disinfected with different dosages of uv were used as inoculum into 1 10 r2a medium after 3 day cultivation eps of the residual bacteria were extracted and analyzed and the results were shown in fig 9 in terms of the eps amount high uv dosage especially 80 mj cm2 showed significant stimulating effect on eps secretion compared with the control group the eps amount increased significantly p 0 05 from 15 5 3 5 mg l of the control group to 24 9 3 2 mg l of the experimental group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 the ftir spectrum of the eps with different uv dosages was shown in fig 9b the position of the characteristic peaks of eps was almost the same as the foulants on the ro membranes fig 6 namely 1020 cm 1 glycosidic bonds 1530 cm 1 amide ⅱ bonds and 1630 cm 1 amide i bonds these results suggested that the main components of the organic foulants on the ro membranes were eps in deed as for the effect of uv dosage on the composition of eps the peak area in the ftir spectrum for glycosidic bonds increased by 28 in the group with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 while the change of the peak area for amide bonds was not obvious these results were consistent with the characterization of the organic matter in the foulants similar to the previous study on the effect of chlorine disinfection as the pretreatment of the ro system uv disinfection also selected some residual bacteria with higher eps secretion and thus aggravated ro membrane fouling wang et al 2019b thicker eps outside bacterial cells might decrease the transmission of uv rays as the colloidal proteins and polysaccharides were the main components of eps these organic components could also react with chlorine to protect bacterial cells from chlorine this might be the main reason for similar negative effects of uv disinfection and chlorine disinfection on biofouling control however the selective effect of low uv dosage was not that obvious as indicated by the eps production fig 9 and organic matter amount on the fouled ro membranes fig 4c with the uv dosage of 20 mj cm2 the normalized flux was even higher than the control group during the operation though the final normalized flux of the two groups were almost the same these results indicated that in order to control biofouling excessive disinfection in the pretreatment process might be undesirable excessive disinfection could show significant selective effect on the bacteria with higher eps production although the number of these bacteria might be reduced during disinfection with high dosage it was very difficult to eliminate all these bacteria in the feed water thus during long term operation these residual bacteria became the dominant strains on the membrane surface because of the selective effect of excessive disinfection and then more serious fouling was induced this mechanism was demonstrated both in the studies on chlorine disinfection and uv disinfection as the pretreatment of the ro system chlorine and uv are two of the most commonly used disinfection technologies in water treatment yet they all showed negative effect on the control of ro membrane biofouling therefore it is necessary to explore the effects of other disinfection methods on biofouling of ro membranes in order to optimize the ro process for wastewater reclamation 4 conclusions this study showed that disinfection pretreatment with high dosage uv could aggravate membrane fouling even though uv disinfection significantly inactivated the bacteria in the feed water of the ro system at the end of operation the hpc and atp content in the foulants on ro membranes showed no significant difference in control group and uv disinfection groups however the toc in membrane foulants was significantly enhanced after uv disinfection especial with the uv dosage of 80 mj cm2 this phenomenon could be attributed to the enhanced abundance of typical biofouling causing bacteria on ro membranes such as ralstonia and sphigobium which were reported to have high eps productivity by cultivating the residual bacteria after uv disinfection it was verified that eps produced by these residual bacteria were the main components in the foulants on ro membranes furthermore residual bacteria after disinfection with high dosage of uv could produce more eps than those without uv disinfection and thus caused more serious membrane fouling notes the authors declare no competing financial interest

17112,to investigate the role of granular activated carbon gac on nitrogen removal performance of elemental sulfur based constructed wetlands s0 based cws three systems were constructed according to the different configurations in the functional layer namely s cw s0 added in the functional layer csc cw gac s0 and gac placed in layers in the functional layer and sc cw s0 and gac mixed evenly in the functional layer in csc cw and sc cw the volumetric ratio of s0 gac was 9 1 three cws were operated under four different hydraulic retention times hrts ranged from 48 h to 6 h over the experiment total inorganic nitrogen tin removal rates of the three cws were 3 1 23 6 g m 2 d 1 3 5 24 1 g m 2 d 1 and 3 4 11 5 g m 2 d 1 respectively csc cw remained high tin removal efficiency from 74 7 20 2 to 93 4 1 9 while sc cw had significant lower values when hrt 6 h 29 8 30 1 mass balance and high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that mixotrophic denitrification at the sulfur layer and simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd at the rhizosphere played the major role in n removal from csc cw 95 gac addition facilitated the growth of iris pseudacorus with the final fresh weight increased from 33 9 gfw ind 1 to 82 3 gfw ind 1 in csc cw and 82 7 gfw ind 1 in sc cw this study optimizes the practical application of s0 based cws amended with gac for n removal from carbon limited wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword s0 based cws granular activated carbon mixing mode nitrogen mass balance microbial community 1 introduction nitrogen n removal from carbon limited wastewater such as slightly polluted river water drainages of the wastewater treatment plant and aquaculture tailwater is still a challenging research topic in the world saeed and sun 2012 wu et al 2013a in these types of wastewater n is normally presented in the form of no3 n if discharged without treatment it may deteriorate the adjacent aquatic environment and even cause eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 constructed wetland cw is an environmentally friendly engineered system that has been widely used for n removal from wastewater wu et al 2015 the key n removal processes in cws were microbial nitrification and the followed denitrification saeed and sun 2012 where sufficient electrons are essential to enable complete denitrification especially for carbon limited wastewater treatment the microbial denitrification process can be heterotrophic or autotrophic denitrification depending on whether organic carbon serves as the electron donor or not in most cases n removal from carbon limited wastewater would be enhanced through accelerated heterotrophic denitrification hd by adding organic carbon as electron donors e g methanol acetic acid biopolymers and plant agricultural waste jia et al 2019 saeed and sun 2017 however this would incur supplementary costs and has difficulty in keeping carbon supplementation consistent with the fluctuation of influent n which raises the risk of secondary organic pollution wang et al 2009 promoting the autotrophic denitrification ad process is also a promising way to enhance n removal in ad autotrophic denitrifiers utilize sulfur reduced compounds ferrous iron or h2 as electron donors and inorganic carbon e g hco3 co2 as carbon sources to reduce the no3 n to n2 di capua et al 2015 elemental sulfur s0 serving as electron donor delivers high nitrate removal efficiency and is highly cost effective features but produces sulfate h2 thermodynamically is one of the most effective electron donors for denitrification and is easily removed through air stripping considering its low solubility in water 0 182 vh2 vh2o at 20 c and 1 atm which negatively affects the denitrification rate at the same time ferrous iron could also act as electron donor through chemical and biological processes where lower denitrification rates than other inorganic electron donors have been found and the ammonium would be produced that needs post treatment di capua et al 2019 therefore s0 would be a good choice for the treatment of slightly polluted water wang et al 2009 what s more the solid s0 has low solubility in water i e 1 9 0 6 10 8 mole s kg 1 25 c 1 atm which makes it possible to provide proper amounts of electrons for denitrification and easier to remove from treated water compared with dissolved sulfur compounds excess soluble sulfur compounds need to be oxidized to sulfate which leads to more energy consumption and meaningless sulfate production autotrophic denitrification driven by s0 occurs

extremely low water solubility 5 mg l 1 at 25 o c which greatly restrains the attachment of denitrifying bacteria on s0 leading to a limited bioavailability and mass transfer efficiency park and yoo

which increased effluent nh4 n concentration and limited the overall tin removal efficiency li et al 2020a to enhance n removal from carbon limited wastewater s0 based cws amended with granular activated carbon gac were employed in this study for the first time where mixed s0 and gac served together as substrates to fill the sulfur layer the high specific surface area of gac enables the surface enrichment of microbes as a conductive material gac is expected to facilitate the sad process by bridging electron donors i e s0 and electron accepting bacteria and improving the bio availability of s for microorganisms hrt is a primary operating parameter related to tin removal generally longer hrt elevates tin removal efficiency but shorter hrt would allow a high removal rate and save capital cost christianson et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b to date the practical effects of gac addition into s0 based cws remained unclear specifically the effects of gac mixing modes and hrt which play critical roles in n removal performance need a detailed evaluation and the underlying mechanisms of gac on n removal should be clarified the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the role of gac mixed in two modes on n removal of s0 based cws operating under different hrts 2 to compare the effects of gac addition and its mixing modes on wetland plant by determining plant growth and nutrient distribution 3 to clarify comprehensively the enhancing mechanisms of gac on n removal of s0 based cws through determining the characteristics of substrate microbes 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental system configuration three bench scale cw systems were constructed at tsinghua university beijing china 40 00 00 n 116 19 35 e and operated for 205 d from march 28 2019 to october 17 2019 fig 1 the chemical solid elemental sulfur was chemically synthesized and purchased from beijing further tide technology co ltd synthetic river water prepared in a barrel 50 l was introduced into the cws using peristaltic pumps chemical reagents in analytical grade and tap water were used for synthetic river water preparation main compositions were nh4 n 4 2 0 6 mg l 1 no3 n 22 7 3 4 mg l 1 tin 26 9 3 7 mg l 1 so4 2 s 37 5 3 4 mg l 1 do 4 5 1 4 mg l 1 ph 7 57 0 01 the s0 based cws were studied in bench scale while it is expected to be applied in field scale for treating a real typical river in beijing namely beiyun river river water needs to be pumped into the cws for further treatment which is an oxygen enrichment process in actual processing do was monitored at the inlet of the wetland and the values ranged from 4 0 to 10 1 mg l 1 thus a relative high do of artificial river water was used in this study three vertical up flow s0 based cws were made of cylindrical acrylic material 300 mm in diameter 600 mm in depth from bottom to top each cw was consisted of volcanic rocks 200 mm depth φ 5 10 mm elemental sulfur 200 mm depth φ 3 8 mm another layer of volcanic rocks 120 mm depth φ 5 10 mm and sand 80 mm φ 1 2 mm all substrates were purchased from beijing further tide technology co ltd these three cws were defined as s cw csc cw and sc cw respectively according to the different substrates in the sulfur layer s cw served as the control that only used s0 φ 5 8 mm in the sulfur layer while in the other cws s0 was mixed with gac φ 3 5 mm with the volumetric ratio of 9 1 considering the fact that s0 served as the electron donor for nitrogen removal while the more expensive gac used as a functional supplementary substrate to assist the operation of s0 based cws in csc cw s0 and gac were placed in layers i e gac s0 gac while in sc cw s0 was mixed evenly with gac the sulfur layer was placed in the middle layer of each wetland bed operating in up flow regime to minimize the effects of do on the sad process each s0 based cw was divided into three parts for n mass balance analysis namely part a part b rhizosphere and part c plant uptake 2 2 cws inoculation and operation before the formal experiment all cws were inoculated with activated sludge for more than three months i e 2 l activated sludge per 100 l synthetic river water the activated sludge for inoculation was collected from daoxianghu water reclamation plants beijing enterprises water group ltd during the inoculation period cws were operated continuously with the hrt of 72 h the formal experiment was conducted for 95 days from july 16 2019 to october 17 2019 five individuals of iris pseudacorus were planted in each cw iris pseudacorus which is able to tolerate submersion and low ph and anoxic soils has been commonly planted in the constructed wetland chang et al 2010 huang et al 2018 yousefi and mohseni bandpei 2010 iris also has a strong resistance to anoxia by increasing root production and anaerobic respiration making it a suitable pioneer species in vegetation restoration projects wu et al 2013b the initial fresh weight of iris used in the present study is 6 0 1 5 g ind 1 with all the shoots trimmed to 5 cm above substrates as shown in table 1 cws were operated in four phases to test the effect of hrts i e 48 h 24 h 12 h and 6 h on n removal 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water quality determination over the experiment the influent and effluent of three s0 based cws were collected for water quality analysis during phase i and ii water was sampled every two or three days while from phase iii to phase iv it was collected daily or every second day by the end of each phase samples were collected at different heights of three cws ion chromatography metrohm 930 switzerland was used to determine the concentration of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 s nh4 n determination was performed using the spectrophotometric method a uv vis spectrophotometer lian hua tech co ltd beijing as described by rice et al 2012 tin was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n a portable multi parameter analyzer sevengo duo pro switzerland was employed to monitor ph and do values all water samples were measured in triplicate removal efficiency re and removal rate rr g m 2 d 1 of nitrogen compounds were calculated as 2 r e c i c o c i 100 3 r r q c i c o a where c i and c o are the influent and effluent concentrations mg l 1 respectively q is the rate of inflow m3 d 1 a is the surface area of each cw m2 2 3 2 iris growth and elements content iris pseudacorus in three cws were sampled at the beginning and by the end of the experiment all plant samples were washed using mill q water and absorbed for the surface water after weighing the fresh weight fw all samples were dried in the oven to a consistent weight and balanced for the dry weight dw it is also important to analyze the growth by measuring plant dry weight which can be the organic matter or energy content beadle 1985 dried shoots and roots were ground into powders to determine c n and s contents using thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analyzer usa nitrogen uptake by iris was assessed by measuring its weight both fresh and dry weight and nitrogen content at the beginning and the end of the experiments and calculating the difference within this period 2 3 3 microbial sampling and analysis microbial characteristics on substrates of rhizosphere and sulfur layer were investigated to explore the n removal mechanisms in s0 based cws amended with gac substrates for each sample were collected from five different places and mixed as one for further analysis rhizosphere by the end of the experiment 10 g substrates in triplicate were taken from the rhizosphere of three s0 based cws approximately 5 15 cm for dna extraction and the further high throughput sequencing on the illumina miseq platform sulfur layer for s cw and csc cw substrates 10 g in triplicate were also sampled at different depth of the sulfur layer namely the upper u 0 5 cm middle m 5 15 cm and bottom b 15 20 cm areas samples were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate atp and high throughput sequencing the protocols for dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were the same as described in our previous study li et al 2020a atp was measured using an atp assay kit based on the luciferin luciferase reaction as described by ailijiang et al 2016 2 4 statistical analysis spss 21 0 was used to perform the one way anova and the difference of the student newman keuls s n k test was considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 n removal profiles role of gac influent and effluent concentrations of nitrogenous compounds are shown in fig 2 over the experiment tin removal rates of the s cw csc cw and sc cw were between 3 1 23 6 g m 2 d 1 3 5 24 1 g m 2 d 1 and 3 4 11 5 g m 2 d 1 respectively table s1 showing that s cw and csc cw delivered better overall n removal rates than sc cw however it is noticeable that all three tested s0 based cws in this study were advantageous in n removal over previous researches that reported 9 3 g m 2 d 1 highest tin removal rate park et al 2015 this would be attributed to the shorter hrt in our study 6 48 h than in works of literature up to 240 h the n removal performance of s0 based cws operating under four hrt treatments suggests csc cw performed better than sc cw fig 3 table s1 over the experiment s cw and csc cw remained high tin removal efficiency compared with sc cw under four hrts tin removal efficiency of s cw and csc cw were from 73 0 16 2 to 84 3 6 4 and from 74 7 20 2 to 93 4 1 9 respectively high tin removal efficiency should be mainly attributed to the effective denitrification process effluent no3 n concentrations of s cw and csc cw were 0 2 2 3 5 mg l 1 and 0 6 5 5 1 mg l 1 respectively moreover csc cw enhanced nh4 n removal performance of s0 based cws in s cw effluent nh4 n ranged from 2 7 0 9 mg l 1 to 5 7 2 4 mg l 1 while those were between 0 8 0 6 mg l 1 and 2 1 1 1 mg l 1 in csc cw particularly under hrt of 6h though s cw effluent had lower no3 n concentration 1 5 3 3 mg l 1 than csc cw 6 5 5 1 mg l 1 no2 n accumulated to 3 7 4 5 mg l 1 no2 n accumulated in our systems even when no3 n concentration was low this is a common phenomenon in sad based reactors operating under short hrt during the sad process the reduced electron mediators preferred the nitrate reductases instead of the nitrite reductases kohl et al 1976 therefore the limited electrons were first consumed by no3 n at short hrt due to the electron competition only when almost all no3 n removed no2 n started to reduce the more effective nitrification in csc cw under short hrt may result in the relative higher effluent no3 n concentration the added gac changed the microbial community and very likely the micro environment within the wetland bed that was more favourable to nitrification process which would be convinced later by the characteristics of rhizosphere microbial composition in sc cw however tin removal efficiency dropped strikingly to 29 8 30 1 p 0 01 when hrt 6 h while effluent no3 n and no2 n were up to 14 2 2 4 mg l 1 and 5 6 2 1 mg l 1 respectively suggesting the restricted denitrification in sc cw fig 3 at short hrt 6 h in the present study gac mixed evenly with s0 led to the low utilization efficiency of s0 which was evidenced by the finding that sc cw delivered much lower no3 n removal efficiency compared to s cw 43 4 32 3 vs 93 5 14 6 but had a lower concentration of so4 2 s in effluents 59 6 mg l 1 vs 84 8 mg l 1 the ratio of so4 2 s produced to tin removed after the water flew through the sulfur layer of s cw and sc cw were then calculated and compared with the theoretical value 2 51 under hrt of 6 h the ratio for s cw was 2 53 quite similar to 2 51 li et al 2020b while that for sc cw was much higher up to 14 32 fig 4 one possible reason may be that the oxygen originating from root secretion and the influent inhibited the denitrification process of the sulfur layer and led to meaningless s consumption compared with s cw that only had s0 in the sulfur layer gac mixed evenly with s0 in sc cw might enrich microbes and accelerate this meaningless consumption high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob dominated on substrates of the sulfur layer in both sc cw and s cw i e 81 84 and 75 87 respectively described later it is believed that gac in sc cw lowered the bio availability of s0 to sob that could drive autotrophic denitrification the high specific surface area of gac makes it easier for sob to attach to therefore in sc cw with gac addition more sob attaching to gac rather than s0 limited the direct contact between sob and s0 which meanwhile reduced the amounts of sob growing on the s0 surface further study would provide experimental evidence for this speculation through for example comparing the chemical conditions in the microenvironment of sulfur layer between s cw and sc cw and analyzing the microbial composition on the surface of gac in sc cw and that on elemental sulfur at the same position of s cw therefore both s cw and csc cw delivered better overall tin removal rates than sc cw considering the high nitrogen removal efficiencies more than 90 almost all influent nitrogen was removed in both these two s0 based cws this suggests that gac in csc cw could ensure maintain the high nitrogen removal performance of s0 based cws then the nitrogen species transformations of these wetlands were further investigated 3 2 n mass balance n mass balance of three s0 based cws further revealed the benefits of csc cw on n removal table 2 first of all csc cw maintained the high n removal performance of s0 based cws over the experiment input n was 1302 9 g m 2 and the removed n by s cw and csc cw were 987 2 g m 2 and 1073 1 g m 2 respectively much higher than that of sc cw 694 9 g m 2 the difference was mainly due to the effective denitrification in part a no3 n removed by part a were 1039 2 g m 2 and 1014 8 g m 2 for s cw and csc cw respectively while that was only 683 3 g m 2 for sc cw moreover gac in csc cw improved the utilization efficiency of s0 figure 4 shows the ratio of so4 2 s produced over tin removed by part a of three s0 based cws under four hrts so4 2 s tin ratios of csc cw ranged from 1 47 to 3 15 while that in s cw and sc cw were between 2 53 5 53 and 1 60 14 32 respectively the gac in csc cw may serve as the barriers which prevented do in influent or iris roots secretion from diffusing into the s0 layer through changing the microbial community within wetland bed in contrast the so4 2 s tin ratio soared up to 14 32 in sc cw when hrt 6 h suggesting again the limited contribution of part a on n removal fig s1 this has been discussed in last paragraph theoretically the ratio of so4 2 s no3 n was 2 51 during the sad process li et al 2020b the highest so4 2 s tin ratio in sc cw under short hrt suggests the high proportion of senseless s consumption in addition compared with s cw nh4 n removal was enhanced in csc cw over the experiment nh4 n removed in part a of s cw was 18 1 g m 2 which went up to 143 1 g m 2 in csc cw similarly the value of part b c increased from 3 3 g m 2 to 32 3 g m 2 obviously the nitrification process was promoted by nitrifying bacteria enriched on gac which consumed do in influent and iris roots secretion wießner et al 2002 specifically regarding the nh4 n removal in the rhizosphere the added gac in csc cw kept iris in a good growth situation which in turn providing a better physicochemical and biological environment for n removal related microbes through releasing oxygen and organic compounds this will be discussed later 3 3 characteristics of microbes in s0 based cws given that more than 95 of removed nitrogen were attributed to the rhizosphere and sulfur layer of s0 based cws the microbial community structures were analyzed to clarify the effects of gac addition on microbial n transformation pathways particularly considering the relatively higher n removal loads s cw and csc cw were selected to compare the microbial characteristics in different depth of the sulfur layer 3 3 1 rhizospheric microbial community gac addition changed the rhizosphere microbial community of s0 based cws principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on operational taxonomic units otus reflected the distinguishing microbial community structures in the rhizosphere of s cw csc cw and sc cw fig 5 as shown in table 3 gac addition lowered the observed otus in the rhizosphere p 0 05 however there s no significant difference for chao 1 indexes indicating the similar rhizospheric microbial richness within these three cws higher shannon index but lower values of simpson index in csc cw and sc cw p 0 01 revealed that gac addition increased the microbial diversity in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws three cws presented similar rhizospheric microbial compositions at the phylum level fig 6 a top three dominant phyla in all cws were proteobacteria 60 4 66 3 bacteroidetes 17 7 25 4 and chloroflexi 3 6 6 8 these phyla have been reported as typical ones performing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes adrados et al 2014 cui et al 2019 li et al 2020c at the genus level microbial community visualized by heatmap revealed that gac addition changed rhizosphere microbes of s0 based cws fig 6b in s cw a higher relative abundance of sob was observed such as chlorobaculum 10 8 sulfurimonas 2 8 sulfuricurvum 1 4 and thiobacillus 1 3 chen et al 2016 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 dominant bacteria performing hd were simplicispira 2 4 and flavobacterium 1 2 wan et al 2019 while in the rhizosphere of cws with gac addition genera responsible for hd became more dominant in csc cw dominant heterotrophic denitrification bacteria hdb were denitratisoma 3 2 anaerolinea 1 1 pseudomonas 1 7 and dechloromonas 1 6 and sc cw rhizosphere presented the similar microbes distributions with the corresponding relative abundance of 5 7 2 7 1 6 and 1 5 respectively iannacone et al 2020 roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020b better iris growth situation in csc cw and sc cw facilitated the releasing of root exudates which could serve as carbon sources for hd wu et al 2017b it is worth noting that gac addition resulted in a higher relative abundance of nitrification bacteria in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws nitrospira piscinibacter and nitrosomona have been reported as nitrification microbes roots et al 2019 the corresponding relative abundance were 1 5 0 5 and 0 6 respectively in rhizosphere of csc cw and 1 7 0 7 and 0 8 respectively in sc cw table s3 iris pseudacorus could release oxygen into the rhizosphere from seedings to cuttings with the highest rate of 0 34 mg o2 h 1 ind 1 wießner et al 2002 iris grew better in csc cw and sc cw and was expected to release more oxygen resulting in a relatively higher nitrifying abundance this agrees with former results that gac addition enhanced the nitrification process in s0 based cws the increased relative abundance of nitrification microbes would in turn consume the do from iris roots secretion prevent the do from diffusing into the s0 layer and reduce the meaningless consumption of s0 therefore in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws gac addition changed sad dominant denitrification into hd dominated process and enhanced the role of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd on n removal besides in the rhizosphere of s cw ferritrophicum 6 4 and chlorobium 1 1 presented higher relative abundance than csc cw and sc cw ferritrophicum is found able to use sulfide as electron donors for no3 n reduction and chlorobium has been used for biological removal of sulfide ball et al 2007 li et al 2020c this suggests that more sulfide might occur in the rhizosphere of s cw which led to higher s content in iris tissues and the poor plant growth situation discuss later 3 3 2 microbial characteristics in the sulfur layer fig 7 shows the atp content of substrate biofilms at different depth of the sulfur layer atp content which served as a bio indicator to evaluate the microbial metabolic activity has been reported to be linearly correlated with the mass of microbes oades and jenkinson 1979 in s cw atp contents of area b and m were 11 4 10 15 mol g 1 and 10 5 10 15 mol g 1 respectively which were higher than that of area u 7 6 10 15 mol g 1 p 0 05 while in the sulfur layer of csc cw the bottom layer b had much higher atp contents i e 11 1 10 15 mol g 1 p 0 01 suggesting the highest biological activity at the bottom ailijiang et al 2016 more microbes may be enriched at the bottom sulfur layer of csc cw and encountered with more nutrients at the phylum level the sulfur layer of csc cw had the same dominant phyla as that of scw i e epsilonbacteraeota and proteobacteria which accounted for 90 7 96 7 fig 8 a both these two phyla have been reported dominant in s0 based denitrification system qiu et al 2020 as a new phylum proposed in 2017 epsilonbacteraeota includes a common class epsilonproteobacteria which is able to carry out sad in different plants for biological n removal waite et al 2017 while proteobacteria is a well known phylum performing heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes adrados et al 2014 li et al 2020c qiu et al 2020 these two phyla remained stable at different depth of sulfur layer relative abundance of epsilonbacteraeota was 54 9 61 2 and 50 8 57 0 for s cw and csc cw respectively and that of proteobacteria ranged from 31 1 to 38 7 and from 38 3 to 45 9 respectively genus level analysis on spatial variations and the function of microbial communities in the sulfur layer was also carried out to further clarify the advantages of csc cw over s cw top 23 genera relative abundance 0 1 were presented in table s5 regardless of depth genera responsible for sad and hd dominated in the sulfur layer of both cws i e 74 8 87 0 and 4 6 11 9 respectively seven genera have been reported as the sob including sulfurimonas thiobacillus ferritrophicum thiomona sulfuritalea limnohabitans and sulfurovum blazquez et al 2019 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2016 li et al 2020c zhang et al 2020a and seven genera that have the ability to perform hd were thermomonas simplicispira denitratisoma rheinheimera flavobacterium pseudomonas and dongia iannacone et al 2020 roots et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2020a obviously the mixotrophic denitrification occurred in the sulfur layer of both s cw and csc cw and the sad process was more dominant considering the slightly higher ph values at 400 mm depth right after the water flew through the sulfur layer of csc cw than that of s cw the added gac might enhance the heterotrophic denitrification process which consumes h and increases the ph the hierarchically clustered heatmap revealed that sob in the sulfur layer had similar distributions in s cw and csc cw fig 8b sulfurimonas 51 3 62 0 thiobacillus 8 9 24 0 and ferritrophicum 4 0 11 8 are three main genera dominating in all sampling points genera of sulfurimonas and ferritrophicum playing crucial roles in the oxidation of s0 had a higher relative abundance in the sulfur layer of both cws campbell et al 2006 yang et al 2018 and thiobacillus a well known sob utilizing s0 as the electron donor was more dominant in the middle and bottom sulfur layer of csc cw 21 1 and 24 0 respectively beller et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 considering hdb however the distributions changed in the sulfur layer of csc cw compared with that of s cw in s cw hd mainly occurred in the upper sulfur layer thermomonas and simplicispira were more abundant in s cw u 7 9 and 2 0 respectively as for csc cw pseudomonas 0 7 1 4 denitratisoma 1 4 2 1 and dongia 0 5 0 7 became more dominant in sulfur layer 3 4 response of iris to gac addition gac addition is beneficial to iris growth in s0 based cws regardless of the mixing modes table 4 with an identical initial average fresh weight fw of iris 6 0 1 5 gfw ind 1 it grew to 33 9 gfw ind 1 82 7 gfw ind 1 and 82 3 gfw ind 1 in s cw csc cw and sc cw respectively the correspondingly final dry weight dw was 10 5 gdw ind 1 23 6 gdw ind 1 and 26 6 gdw ind 1 respectively in cws with gac addition both fw and dw of iris were more than two times the value in s cw the good growth situation of wetland plants in gac amended cws not only increased the n retention by iris i e from 9 5 gn m 2 to 21 3 31 9 gn m 2 but also promoted n removal in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws table 4 in cws with gac addition better growth status of iris may allow the roots to release more oxygen that resulted in a higher relative abundance of nitrification bacteria nitrospira piscinibacter and nitrosomona and to secrete more low molecular organic compounds e g organic acids amino acids sugars which were found to enhance denitrification process in wetlands through providing electrons directly to denitrifiers affecting denitrifier gene abundances and the rhizospheric microbial communities walker et al 2003 wu et al 2017a wu et al 2017b better iris growth may be attributed to the promoted nutrient uptake or the improved physicochemical e g ph values table s2 and biological e g characteristics of microbial composition environment in wetland beds elements n c s distribution in iris shoots and roots at the beginning and at the end of the experiment are shown in fig 9 final n contents in the shoots were between 19 2 mg gdw 1 and 24 0 mg gdw 1 more than that in the roots 9 0 17 3 mg gdw 1 this is in line with a previous study that reported more n retained in the shoots of wetland plants keizer vlek et al 2014 c contents remained stable in iris shoots of all three s0 based cws 401 5 418 2 mg gdw 1 while c contents in the roots of s cw and csc cw were less than half the initial values as it decreased from the initial 405 7 mg gdw 1 to 171 4 mg gdw 1 and 169 2 mg gdw 1 respectively as for s contents obviously gac addition into s0 based cws made it more stable in iris shoots and roots in the beginning s contents in the shoots and roots were 2 1 mg gdw 1 and 1 2 mg gdw 1 which eventually went up to 7 7 mg gdw 1 and 3 8 mg gdw 1 respectively in s cw in comparison the values were 2 4 3 1 mg gdw 1 and 1 0 1 6 mg gdw 1 respectively in gac amended s0 based cws as mentioned before ferritrophicum and chlorobium which have been used for biological sulfide removal presented higher relative abundance in rhizosphere s cw than csc cw and sc cw suggesting that more sulfide might exist in the s cw rhizosphere without gac addition high concentration of exogenous sulfide has been found to show exhibit toxic effect on plant growth and development though it could serve as a signaling molecule to regulate hormones in plants however the effects of exogenous sulfide on sulfur assimilation and their relations to plant hormones still remained unclear and seemed difficult to be clarified he et al 2019 hasanuzzaman et al 2018 it is speculated that gac addition alleviated the negative impact of the s0 layer on wetland plant more sulfide existed in the rhizosphere of s cw affecting the sulfur assimilation by iris leading to the higher sulfur contents in iris that affected the phytohormones such as cytokinins ck ethylene et or gibberellins ga which were reported to be associated with plant growth and photosynthetic rates capaldi et al 2015 detailed mechanisms warrant a further study 4 conclusion in this study gac was innovatively mixed with elemental sulfur as substrates to build three s0 based cws s cw csc cw and sc cw csc cw which displayed the highest tin removal rate 24 1 g m 2 d 1 performed better compared with s cw and sc cw the added gac in csc cw facilitated nitrification of the inlet area 143 1 gnh4 n m 2 and the rhizosphere 32 3 gnh4 n m 2 maintained effective sad in sulfur layer 1014 8 gno3 n m 2 promoted the s0 utilization efficiency and reduced the adverse effects of s0 on iris through increasing iris growth from 33 9 g ind 1 to 82 7 g ind 1 nitrogen uptake from 9 5 g m 2 to 21 3 g m 2 and promoting nitrogen removal in the rhizosphere from 224 2 g m 2 to 242 4 g m 2 in the rhizosphere simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd was the main process for n removal and in the sulfur layer mixotrophic denitrification occurred which took the sad as the main process our pilot scale experiment gave a proof of concept on promoting the practical application of s0 based cws other scale up experiments which may validate our results should be conducted indeed at the field scale factors such as temperature variations loading fluctuations and characteristics of influent will affect the microbial communities and activities impact the s0 based cws functioning

17112,to investigate the role of granular activated carbon gac on nitrogen removal performance of elemental sulfur based constructed wetlands s0 based cws three systems were constructed according to the different configurations in the functional layer namely s cw s0 added in the functional layer csc cw gac s0 and gac placed in layers in the functional layer and sc cw s0 and gac mixed evenly in the functional layer in csc cw and sc cw the volumetric ratio of s0 gac was 9 1 three cws were operated under four different hydraulic retention times hrts ranged from 48 h to 6 h over the experiment total inorganic nitrogen tin removal rates of the three cws were 3 1 23 6 g m 2 d 1 3 5 24 1 g m 2 d 1 and 3 4 11 5 g m 2 d 1 respectively csc cw remained high tin removal efficiency from 74 7 20 2 to 93 4 1 9 while sc cw had significant lower values when hrt 6 h 29 8 30 1 mass balance and high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that mixotrophic denitrification at the sulfur layer and simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd at the rhizosphere played the major role in n removal from csc cw 95 gac addition facilitated the growth of iris pseudacorus with the final fresh weight increased from 33 9 gfw ind 1 to 82 3 gfw ind 1 in csc cw and 82 7 gfw ind 1 in sc cw this study optimizes the practical application of s0 based cws amended with gac for n removal from carbon limited

2012 wu et al 2013a in these types of wastewater n is normally presented in the form of no3 n if discharged without treatment it may deteriorate the adjacent aquatic environment and even cause eutrophication smith and schindler 2009 constructed wetland cw is an environmentally friendly engineered system that has been widely used for n removal from wastewater wu et al 2015 the key n removal processes in cws were microbial nitrification and the followed denitrification saeed and sun 2012 where sufficient electrons are essential to enable complete denitrification especially for carbon limited wastewater treatment the microbial denitrification process can be heterotrophic or autotrophic denitrification depending on whether organic carbon serves as the electron donor or not in most cases n removal from carbon limited wastewater would be enhanced through accelerated heterotrophic denitrification hd by adding organic carbon as electron donors e g methanol acetic acid biopolymers and plant agricultural waste jia et al 2019 saeed and sun 2017 however this would incur supplementary costs and has difficulty in keeping carbon supplementation consistent with the fluctuation of influent n which raises the risk of secondary organic pollution wang et al 2009 promoting the autotrophic denitrification ad process is also a promising way to enhance n removal in ad autotrophic denitrifiers utilize sulfur reduced compounds ferrous iron or h2 as electron donors and inorganic carbon e g hco3 co2 as carbon sources to reduce the no3 n to n2 di capua et al 2015 elemental sulfur s0 serving as electron donor delivers high nitrate removal efficiency and is highly cost effective features but produces sulfate h2 thermodynamically is one of the most effective electron donors for denitrification and is easily removed through air stripping considering its low solubility in water 0 182 vh2 vh2o at 20 c and 1 atm which negatively affects the denitrification rate at the same time ferrous iron could also act as electron donor through chemical and biological processes where lower denitrification rates than other inorganic electron donors have been found and the ammonium would be produced that needs post treatment di capua et al 2019 therefore s0 would be a good choice for the treatment of slightly polluted water wang et al 2009 what s more the solid s0 has low solubility in water i e 1 9 0 6 10 8 mole s kg 1 25 c 1 atm which makes it possible to provide proper amounts of electrons for denitrification and easier to remove from treated water compared with dissolved sulfur compounds excess soluble sulfur compounds need to be oxidized to sulfate which leads to more energy consumption and meaningless sulfate production autotrophic denitrification driven by s0 occurs according to the following stoichiometric equation sahinkaya et al 2012 1 s 0 0 91 n o 3 0 69 h 2 o 0 07 n h 4 0 36 c o 2 0 07 c 5 h 7 o 2 n s o 4 2 0 45 n 2 1 16 h only two studies employed s0 based cws to enhance n removal previously in a study of bezbaruah and tian 2003 s0 served as substrates in a lab scale cw treating municipal wastewater and the system removed 81 90 of influent total inorganic nitrogen tin with the hydraulic retention time hrt up to 10 d in the other research park et al 2015 treated no3 n dominant hydroponic wastewater using s cw with a shorter hrt 76 8 h and tin removal efficiency obtained was only 65 3 9 3 these two studies both reported considerably low tin removal rates between 0 8 and 9 3 g m 2 d 1 one major challenge of employing s0 in sad is the extremely low water solubility 5 mg l 1 at 25 o c which greatly restrains the attachment of denitrifying bacteria on s0 leading to a limited bioavailability and mass transfer efficiency park and yoo 2009 our previous study on s0 based cw achieved an improved tin removal rate of 19 0 g m 2 d 1 however sulfur driven dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium s dnra occurred in the sulfur layer which increased effluent nh4 n concentration and limited the overall tin removal efficiency li et al 2020a to enhance n removal from carbon limited wastewater s0 based cws amended with granular activated carbon gac were employed in this study for the first time where mixed s0 and gac served together as substrates to fill the sulfur layer the high specific surface area of gac enables the surface enrichment of microbes as a conductive material gac is expected to facilitate the sad process by bridging electron donors i e s0 and electron accepting bacteria and improving the bio availability of s for microorganisms hrt is a primary operating parameter related to tin removal generally longer hrt elevates tin removal efficiency but shorter hrt would allow a high removal rate and save capital cost christianson et al 2015 zhang et al 2020b to date the practical effects of gac addition into s0 based cws remained unclear specifically the effects of gac mixing modes and hrt which play critical roles in n removal performance need a detailed evaluation and the underlying mechanisms of gac on n removal should be clarified the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the role of gac mixed in two modes on n removal of s0 based cws operating under different hrts 2 to compare the effects of gac addition and its mixing modes on wetland plant by determining plant growth and nutrient distribution 3 to clarify comprehensively the enhancing mechanisms of gac on n removal of s0 based cws through determining the characteristics of substrate microbes 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental system configuration three bench scale cw systems were constructed at tsinghua university beijing china 40 00 00 n 116 19 35 e and operated for 205 d from march 28 2019 to october 17 2019 fig 1 the chemical solid elemental sulfur was chemically synthesized and purchased from beijing further tide technology co ltd synthetic river water prepared in a barrel 50 l was introduced into the cws using peristaltic pumps chemical reagents in analytical grade and tap water were used for synthetic river water preparation main compositions were nh4 n 4 2 0 6 mg l 1 no3 n 22 7 3 4 mg l 1 tin 26 9 3 7 mg l 1 so4 2 s 37 5 3 4 mg l 1 do 4 5 1 4 mg l 1 ph 7 57 0 01 the s0 based cws were studied in bench scale while it is expected to be applied in field scale for treating a real typical river in beijing namely beiyun river river water needs to be pumped into the cws for further treatment which is an oxygen enrichment process in actual processing do was monitored at the inlet of the wetland and the values ranged from 4 0 to 10 1 mg l 1 thus a relative high do of artificial river water was used in this study three vertical up flow s0 based cws were made of cylindrical acrylic material 300 mm in diameter 600 mm in depth from bottom to top each cw was consisted of volcanic rocks 200 mm depth φ 5 10 mm elemental sulfur 200 mm depth φ 3 8 mm another layer of volcanic rocks 120 mm depth φ 5 10 mm and sand 80 mm φ 1 2 mm all substrates were purchased from beijing further tide technology co ltd these three cws were defined as s cw csc cw and sc cw respectively according to the different substrates in the sulfur layer s cw served as the control that only used s0 φ 5 8 mm in the sulfur layer while in the other cws s0 was mixed with gac φ 3 5 mm with the volumetric ratio of 9 1 considering the fact that s0 served as the electron donor for nitrogen removal while the more expensive gac used as a functional supplementary substrate to assist the operation of s0 based cws in csc cw s0 and gac were placed in layers i e gac s0 gac while in sc cw s0 was mixed evenly with gac the sulfur layer was placed in the middle layer of each wetland bed operating in up flow regime to minimize the effects of do on the sad process each s0 based cw was divided into three parts for n mass balance analysis namely part a part b rhizosphere and part c plant uptake 2 2 cws inoculation and operation before the formal experiment all cws were inoculated with activated sludge for more than three months i e 2 l activated sludge per 100 l synthetic river water the activated sludge for inoculation was collected from daoxianghu water reclamation plants beijing enterprises water group ltd during the inoculation period cws were operated continuously with the hrt of 72 h the formal experiment was conducted for 95 days from july 16 2019 to october 17 2019 five individuals of iris pseudacorus were planted in each cw iris pseudacorus which is able to tolerate submersion and low ph and anoxic soils has been commonly planted in the constructed wetland chang et al 2010 huang et al 2018 yousefi and mohseni bandpei 2010 iris also has a strong resistance to anoxia by increasing root production and anaerobic respiration making it a suitable pioneer species in vegetation restoration projects wu et al 2013b the initial fresh weight of iris used in the present study is 6 0 1 5 g ind 1 with all the shoots trimmed to 5 cm above substrates as shown in table 1 cws were operated in four phases to test the effect of hrts i e 48 h 24 h 12 h and 6 h on n removal 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water quality determination over the experiment the influent and effluent of three s0 based cws were collected for water quality analysis during phase i and ii water was sampled every two or three days while from phase iii to phase iv it was collected daily or every second day by the end of each phase samples were collected at different heights of three cws ion chromatography metrohm 930 switzerland was used to determine the concentration of no3 n no2 n and so4 2 s nh4 n determination was performed using the spectrophotometric method a uv vis spectrophotometer lian hua tech co ltd beijing as described by rice et al 2012 tin was calculated as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n a portable multi parameter analyzer sevengo duo pro switzerland was employed to monitor ph and do values all water samples were measured in triplicate removal efficiency re and removal rate rr g m 2 d 1 of nitrogen compounds were calculated as 2 r e c i c o c i

elements content iris pseudacorus in three cws were sampled at the beginning and by the end of the experiment all plant samples were washed using mill q water and absorbed for the surface water after weighing the fresh weight fw all samples were dried in the oven to a consistent weight and balanced for the dry weight dw it is also important to analyze the growth by measuring plant dry weight which can be the organic matter or energy content beadle 1985 dried shoots and roots were ground into powders to determine c n and s contents using thermo scientific flashsmart elemental analyzer usa nitrogen uptake by iris was assessed by measuring its weight both fresh and dry weight and nitrogen content at the beginning and the end of the experiments and calculating the difference within this period 2 3 3 microbial sampling and analysis microbial characteristics on substrates of rhizosphere and sulfur layer were investigated to explore the n removal mechanisms in s0 based cws amended with gac substrates for each sample were collected from five different places and mixed as one for further analysis rhizosphere by the end of the experiment 10 g substrates in triplicate were taken from the rhizosphere of three s0 based cws approximately 5 15 cm for dna extraction and the further high throughput sequencing on the illumina miseq platform sulfur layer for s cw and csc cw substrates 10 g in triplicate were also sampled at different depth of the sulfur layer namely the upper u 0 5 cm middle m 5 15 cm and bottom b 15 20 cm areas samples were analyzed for adenosine triphosphate atp and high throughput sequencing the protocols for dna extraction and high throughput sequencing were the same as described in our previous study li et al 2020a atp was measured using an atp assay kit based on the luciferin luciferase reaction as described by ailijiang et al 2016 2 4 statistical analysis spss 21 0 was used to perform the one way anova and the difference of the student newman keuls s n k test was considered significant when p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 n removal profiles role of gac influent and effluent concentrations of nitrogenous compounds are shown in fig 2 over the experiment tin removal rates of the s cw csc cw and sc cw were between 3 1 23 6 g m 2 d 1 3 5 24 1 g m 2 d 1 and 3 4 11 5 g m 2 d 1 respectively table s1 showing that s cw and csc cw delivered better overall n removal rates than sc cw however it is noticeable that all three tested s0 based cws in this study were advantageous in n removal over previous researches that reported 9 3 g m 2 d 1 highest tin removal rate park et al 2015 this would be attributed to the shorter hrt in our study 6 48 h than in works of literature up to 240 h the n removal performance of s0 based cws operating under four hrt treatments suggests csc cw performed better than sc cw fig 3 table s1 over the experiment s cw and csc cw remained high tin removal efficiency compared with sc cw under four hrts tin removal efficiency of s cw and csc cw were from 73 0 16 2 to 84 3 6 4 and from 74 7 20 2 to 93 4 1 9 respectively high tin removal efficiency should be mainly attributed to the effective denitrification process effluent no3 n concentrations of s cw and csc cw were 0 2 2 3 5 mg l 1 and 0 6 5 5 1 mg l 1 respectively moreover csc cw enhanced nh4 n removal performance of s0 based cws in s cw effluent nh4 n ranged from 2 7 0 9 mg l 1 to 5 7 2 4 mg l 1 while those were between 0 8 0 6 mg l 1 and 2 1 1 1 mg l 1 in csc cw particularly under hrt of 6h though s cw effluent had lower no3 n concentration 1 5 3 3 mg l 1 than csc cw 6 5 5 1 mg l 1 no2 n accumulated to 3 7 4 5 mg l 1 no2 n accumulated in our systems even when no3 n concentration was low this is a common phenomenon in sad based reactors operating under short hrt during the sad process the reduced electron mediators preferred the nitrate reductases instead of the nitrite reductases kohl et al 1976 therefore the limited electrons were first consumed by no3 n at short hrt due to the electron competition only when almost all no3 n removed no2 n started to reduce the more effective nitrification in csc cw under short hrt may result in the relative higher effluent no3 n concentration the added gac changed the microbial community and very likely the micro environment within the wetland bed that was more favourable to nitrification process which would be convinced later by the characteristics of rhizosphere microbial composition in sc cw however tin removal efficiency dropped strikingly to 29 8 30 1 p 0 01 when hrt 6 h while effluent no3 n and no2 n were up to 14 2 2 4 mg l 1 and 5 6 2 1 mg l 1 respectively suggesting the restricted denitrification in sc cw fig 3 at short hrt 6 h in the present study gac mixed evenly with s0 led to the low utilization efficiency of s0 which was evidenced by the finding that sc cw delivered much lower no3 n removal efficiency compared to s cw 43 4 32 3 vs 93 5 14 6 but had a lower concentration of so4 2 s in effluents 59 6 mg l 1 vs 84 8 mg l 1 the ratio of so4 2 s produced to tin removed after the water flew through the sulfur layer of s cw and sc cw were then calculated and compared with the theoretical value 2 51 under hrt of 6 h the ratio for s cw was 2 53 quite similar to 2 51 li et al 2020b while that for sc cw was much higher up to 14 32 fig 4 one possible reason may be that the oxygen originating from root secretion and the influent inhibited the denitrification process of the sulfur layer and led to meaningless s consumption compared with s cw that only had s0 in the sulfur layer gac mixed evenly with s0 in sc cw might enrich microbes and accelerate this meaningless consumption high throughput sequencing analysis revealed that sulfur oxidizing bacteria sob dominated on substrates of the sulfur layer in both sc cw and s cw i e 81 84 and 75 87 respectively described later it is believed that gac in sc cw lowered the bio availability of s0 to sob that could drive autotrophic denitrification the high specific surface area of gac makes it easier for sob to attach to therefore in sc cw with gac addition more sob attaching to gac rather than s0 limited the direct contact between sob and s0 which meanwhile reduced the amounts of sob growing on the s0 surface further study would provide experimental evidence for this speculation through for example comparing the chemical conditions in the microenvironment of sulfur layer between s cw and sc cw and analyzing the microbial composition on the surface of gac in sc cw and that on elemental sulfur at the same position of s cw therefore both s cw and csc cw delivered better overall tin removal rates than sc cw considering the high nitrogen removal efficiencies more than 90 almost all influent nitrogen was removed in both these two s0 based cws this suggests that gac in csc cw could ensure maintain the high nitrogen removal performance of s0 based cws then the nitrogen species transformations of these wetlands were further investigated 3 2 n mass balance n mass balance of three s0 based cws further revealed the benefits of csc cw on n removal table 2 first of all csc cw maintained the high n removal performance of s0 based cws over the experiment input n was 1302 9 g m 2 and the removed n by s cw and csc cw were 987 2 g m 2 and 1073 1 g m 2 respectively much higher than that of sc cw 694 9 g m 2 the difference was mainly due to the effective denitrification in part a no3 n removed by part a were 1039 2 g m 2 and 1014 8 g m 2 for s cw and csc cw respectively while that was only 683 3 g m 2 for sc cw moreover gac in csc cw improved the utilization efficiency of s0 figure 4 shows the ratio of so4 2 s produced over tin removed by part a of three s0 based cws under four hrts so4 2 s tin ratios of csc cw ranged from 1 47 to 3 15 while that in s cw and sc cw were between 2 53 5 53 and 1 60 14 32 respectively the gac in csc cw may serve as the barriers which prevented do in influent or iris roots secretion from diffusing into the s0 layer through changing the microbial community within wetland bed in contrast the so4 2 s tin ratio soared up to 14 32 in sc cw when hrt 6 h suggesting again the limited contribution of part a on n removal fig s1 this has been discussed in last paragraph theoretically the ratio of so4 2 s no3 n was 2 51 during the sad process li et al 2020b the highest so4 2 s tin ratio in sc cw under short hrt suggests the high proportion of senseless s consumption in addition compared with s cw nh4 n removal was enhanced in csc cw over the experiment nh4 n removed in part a of s cw was 18 1 g m 2 which went up to 143 1 g m 2 in csc cw similarly the value of part b c increased from 3 3 g m 2 to 32 3 g m 2 obviously the nitrification process was promoted by nitrifying bacteria enriched on gac which consumed do in influent and iris roots secretion wießner et al 2002 specifically regarding the nh4 n removal in the rhizosphere the added gac in csc cw kept iris in a good growth situation which in turn providing a better physicochemical and biological environment for n removal related microbes through releasing oxygen and organic compounds this will be discussed later 3 3 characteristics of microbes in s0 based cws given that more than 95 of removed nitrogen were attributed to the rhizosphere and sulfur layer of s0 based cws the microbial community structures were analyzed to clarify the effects of gac addition on microbial n transformation pathways particularly considering the relatively higher n removal loads s cw and csc cw were selected to compare the microbial characteristics in different depth of the sulfur layer 3 3 1 rhizospheric microbial community gac addition changed the rhizosphere microbial community of s0 based cws principal co ordinates analysis pcoa based on operational taxonomic units otus reflected the distinguishing microbial community structures in the rhizosphere of s cw csc cw and sc cw fig 5 as shown in table 3 gac addition lowered the observed otus in the rhizosphere p 0 05 however there s no significant difference for chao 1 indexes indicating the similar rhizospheric microbial richness within these three cws higher shannon index but lower values of simpson index in csc cw and sc cw p 0 01 revealed that gac addition increased the microbial diversity in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws three cws presented similar rhizospheric microbial compositions at the phylum level fig 6 a top three dominant phyla in all cws were proteobacteria 60 4 66 3 bacteroidetes 17 7 25 4 and chloroflexi 3 6 6 8 these phyla have been reported as typical ones performing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes adrados et al 2014 cui et al 2019 li et al 2020c at the genus level microbial community visualized by heatmap revealed that gac addition changed rhizosphere microbes of s0 based cws fig 6b in s cw a higher relative abundance of sob was observed such as chlorobaculum 10 8 sulfurimonas 2 8 sulfuricurvum 1 4 and thiobacillus 1 3 chen et al 2016 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 dominant bacteria performing hd were simplicispira 2 4 and flavobacterium 1 2 wan et al 2019 while in the rhizosphere of cws with gac addition genera responsible for hd became more dominant in csc cw dominant heterotrophic denitrification bacteria hdb were denitratisoma 3 2 anaerolinea 1 1 pseudomonas 1 7 and dechloromonas 1 6 and sc cw rhizosphere presented the similar microbes distributions with the corresponding relative abundance of 5 7 2 7 1 6 and 1 5 respectively iannacone et al 2020 roots et al 2019 wang et al 2020b better iris growth situation in csc cw and sc cw facilitated the releasing of root exudates which could serve as carbon sources for hd wu et al 2017b it is worth noting that gac addition resulted in a higher relative abundance of nitrification bacteria in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws nitrospira piscinibacter and nitrosomona have been reported as nitrification microbes roots et al 2019 the corresponding relative abundance were 1 5 0 5 and 0 6 respectively in rhizosphere of csc cw and 1 7 0 7 and 0 8 respectively in sc cw table s3 iris pseudacorus could release oxygen into the rhizosphere from seedings to cuttings with the highest rate of 0 34 mg o2 h 1 ind 1 wießner et al 2002 iris grew better in csc cw and sc cw and was expected to release more oxygen resulting in a relatively higher nitrifying abundance this agrees with former results that gac addition enhanced the nitrification process in s0 based cws the increased relative abundance of nitrification microbes would in turn consume the do from iris roots secretion prevent the do from diffusing into the s0 layer and reduce the meaningless consumption of s0 therefore in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws gac addition changed sad dominant denitrification into hd dominated process and enhanced the role of simultaneous nitrification denitrification snd on n removal besides in the rhizosphere of s cw ferritrophicum 6 4 and chlorobium 1 1 presented higher relative abundance than csc cw and sc cw ferritrophicum is found able to use sulfide as electron donors for no3 n reduction and chlorobium has been used for biological removal of sulfide ball et al 2007 li et al 2020c this suggests that more sulfide might occur in the rhizosphere of s cw which led to higher s content in iris tissues and the poor plant growth situation discuss later 3 3 2 microbial characteristics in the sulfur layer fig 7 shows the atp content of substrate biofilms at different depth of the sulfur layer atp content which served as a bio indicator to evaluate the microbial metabolic activity has been reported to be linearly correlated with the mass of microbes oades and jenkinson 1979 in s cw atp contents of area b and m were 11 4 10 15 mol g 1 and 10 5 10 15 mol g 1 respectively which were higher than that of area u 7 6 10 15 mol g 1 p 0 05 while in the sulfur layer of csc cw the bottom layer b had much higher atp contents i e 11 1 10 15 mol g 1 p 0 01 suggesting the highest biological activity at the bottom ailijiang et al 2016 more microbes may be enriched at the bottom sulfur layer of csc cw and encountered with more nutrients at the phylum level the sulfur layer of csc cw had the same dominant phyla as that of scw i e epsilonbacteraeota and proteobacteria which accounted for 90 7 96 7 fig 8 a both these two phyla have been reported dominant in s0 based denitrification system qiu et al 2020 as a new phylum proposed in 2017 epsilonbacteraeota includes a common class epsilonproteobacteria which is able to carry out sad in different plants for biological n removal waite et al 2017 while proteobacteria is a well known phylum performing heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes adrados et al 2014 li et al 2020c qiu et al 2020 these two phyla remained stable at different depth of sulfur layer relative abundance of epsilonbacteraeota was 54 9 61 2 and 50 8 57 0 for s cw and csc cw respectively and that of proteobacteria ranged from 31 1 to 38 7 and from 38 3 to 45 9 respectively genus level analysis on spatial variations and the function of microbial communities in the sulfur layer was also carried out to further clarify the advantages of csc cw over s cw top 23 genera relative abundance 0 1 were presented in table s5 regardless of depth genera responsible for sad and hd dominated in the sulfur layer of both cws i e 74 8 87 0 and 4 6 11 9 respectively seven genera have been reported as the sob including sulfurimonas thiobacillus ferritrophicum thiomona sulfuritalea limnohabitans and sulfurovum blazquez et al 2019 chen et al 2020 chen et al 2016 li et al 2020c zhang et al 2020a and seven genera that have the ability to perform hd were thermomonas simplicispira denitratisoma rheinheimera flavobacterium pseudomonas and dongia iannacone et al 2020 roots et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2020a obviously the mixotrophic denitrification occurred in the sulfur layer of both s cw and csc cw and the sad process was more dominant considering the slightly higher ph values at 400 mm depth right after the water flew through the sulfur layer of csc cw than that of s cw the added gac might enhance the heterotrophic denitrification process which consumes h and increases the ph the hierarchically clustered heatmap revealed that sob in the sulfur layer had similar distributions in s cw and csc cw fig 8b sulfurimonas 51 3 62 0 thiobacillus 8 9 24 0 and ferritrophicum 4 0 11 8 are three main genera dominating in all sampling points genera of sulfurimonas and ferritrophicum playing crucial roles in the oxidation of s0 had a higher relative abundance in the sulfur layer of both cws campbell et al 2006 yang et al 2018 and thiobacillus a well known sob utilizing s0 as the electron donor was more dominant in the middle and bottom sulfur layer of csc cw 21 1 and 24 0 respectively beller et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 considering hdb however the distributions changed in the sulfur layer of csc cw compared with that of s cw in s cw hd mainly occurred in the upper sulfur layer thermomonas and simplicispira were more abundant in s cw u 7 9 and 2 0 respectively as for csc cw pseudomonas 0 7 1 4 denitratisoma 1 4 2 1 and dongia 0 5 0 7 became more dominant in sulfur layer 3 4 response of iris to gac addition gac addition is beneficial to iris growth in s0 based cws regardless of the mixing modes table 4 with an identical initial average fresh weight fw of iris 6 0 1 5 gfw ind 1 it grew to 33 9 gfw ind 1 82 7 gfw ind 1 and 82 3 gfw ind 1 in s cw csc cw and sc cw respectively the correspondingly final dry weight dw was 10 5 gdw ind 1 23 6 gdw ind 1 and 26 6 gdw ind 1 respectively in cws with gac addition both fw and dw of iris were more than two times the value in s cw the good growth situation of wetland plants in gac amended cws not only increased the n retention by iris i e from 9 5 gn m 2 to 21 3 31 9 gn m 2 but also promoted n removal in the rhizosphere of s0 based cws table 4 in cws with gac addition better growth status of iris may allow the roots to release more oxygen that resulted in a higher relative abundance of nitrification bacteria nitrospira piscinibacter and nitrosomona and to secrete more low molecular organic compounds e g organic acids amino acids sugars which were found to enhance denitrification process in wetlands through providing electrons directly to denitrifiers affecting denitrifier gene abundances and the rhizospheric microbial communities walker et al 2003 wu et al 2017a wu et al 2017b better iris growth may be attributed to the promoted nutrient uptake or the improved physicochemical e g ph values table s2 and biological e g characteristics of microbial composition environment in wetland beds elements n c s distribution in iris shoots and roots at the beginning and at the end of the experiment are shown in fig 9 final n contents in the shoots were between 19 2 mg gdw 1 and 24 0 mg gdw 1 more than that in the roots 9 0 17 3 mg gdw 1 this is in line with a previous study that reported more n retained in the shoots of wetland plants keizer vlek et al 2014 c contents remained stable in iris shoots of all three s0 based cws 401 5 418 2 mg gdw 1 while c contents in the roots of s cw and csc cw were less than half the initial values as it decreased from the initial 405 7 mg gdw 1 to 171 4 mg gdw 1 and 169 2 mg gdw 1 respectively as for s contents obviously gac addition into s0 based cws made it more stable in iris shoots and roots in the beginning s contents in the shoots and roots were 2 1 mg gdw 1 and 1 2 mg gdw 1 which eventually went up to 7 7 mg gdw 1 and 3 8 mg gdw 1 respectively in s cw in comparison the values were 2 4 3 1 mg gdw 1 and 1 0 1 6 mg gdw 1 respectively in gac amended s0 based cws as mentioned before ferritrophicum and chlorobium which have been used for biological sulfide removal presented higher relative abundance in rhizosphere s cw than csc cw and sc cw suggesting that more sulfide might exist in the s cw rhizosphere without gac addition high concentration of exogenous sulfide has been found to show exhibit toxic effect on plant growth and development though it could serve as a signaling molecule to regulate hormones in plants however the effects of exogenous sulfide on sulfur assimilation and their relations to plant hormones still remained unclear and seemed difficult to be clarified he et al 2019 hasanuzzaman et al 2018 it is speculated that gac addition alleviated the negative impact of the s0 layer on wetland plant more sulfide existed in the rhizosphere of s cw affecting the sulfur assimilation by iris leading to the higher sulfur contents in iris that affected the phytohormones such as cytokinins ck ethylene et or gibberellins ga which were reported to be associated with plant growth and photosynthetic rates capaldi et al 2015 detailed mechanisms warrant a further study 4 conclusion in this study gac was innovatively mixed with elemental sulfur as substrates to build three s0 based cws s cw csc cw and sc cw csc cw which displayed the highest tin removal rate 24 1 g m 2 d 1 performed better compared with s cw and sc cw the added gac in csc cw facilitated nitrification of

s0 on iris through increasing iris growth from 33 9 g ind 1 to 82 7 g ind 1 nitrogen uptake from 9 5 g m 2 to 21 3 g m 2 and promoting nitrogen removal in the rhizosphere from 224 2 g m 2 to 242 4 g m

17113,elemental sulfur s0 reduction process has been demonstrated as an attractive and cost efficient approach for metal laden wastewater treatment in lab scale studies however the system performance and stability have not been evaluated in pilot or large scale wastewater treatment especially the sulfide production rate and microbial community structure may significantly vary from lab scale system to pilot or large scale systems using real domestic sewage as carbon source which brings questions to this novel technology in this study therefore a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system was newly developed and applied for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewaters using domestic sewage as carbon source during the 175 d operation 99 9 of cu2 i e 5580 and 1187 mg cu l for two types of electroplating wastewaters was efficiently removed by the biogenic hydrogen sulfide that produced through s0 reduction relatively high level of sulfide production 200 mg s l can be achieved by utilizing organics in raw domestic sewage which was easily affected by the organic content and ph value of the domestic sewage the long term feeding of domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community in sulfur reducing bioreactors compared to the reported lab scale bioreactors higher microbial community diversity was found in our pilot scale bioreactors the presence of hydrolytic fermentative and sulfur reducing bacteria was the critical factor for system stability accordingly a two step ecological interaction among fermentative and sulfur reducing bacteria was newly proposed for sulfide production biodegradable particulate organic carbon bpoc was firstly degraded to dissolved organic carbon doc by the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria then sulfur reducing bacteria utilized the total doc both doc degraded from bpoc and the original doc present in domestic sewage as electron donor and reduced the s0 to sulfide afterwards the sulfide precipitated cu2 in the post sedimentation tank compared with other reported technologies the sulfur based treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for the same level of cu2 removal therefore this pilot scale study demonstrated that s0 reduction process can be a sustainable technology to generate sulfide for the co treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater and domestic sewage achieving higher cu2 removal and higher cost effectiveness than the conventional technologies graphical asbtract image graphical abstract keywords sulfur reduction sulfur reducing bacteria cu laden electroplating wastewater pilot scale system microbial community structure 1 introduction heavy metal laden wastewater from industrial processes such as electroplating etching metal finishing and mining could pose severe environmental pollution kiran et al 2017 copper is one of the commonly used heavy metals in many industrial applications toxicological studies have shown that copper ions cu2 are developmentally toxic to aquatic organisms ochoa herrera et al 2011 and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that health problems e g liver damage and insomnia were positively correlated with cu2 kurniawan et al 2006 accordingly the discharged cu2 concentration in industrial wastewater has been regulated by united states environmental protection agency with a maximum level at 1 3 mg l al saydeh et al 2017 due to the highly toxic effect of cu2 and the high concentration of cu2 in electroplating wastewater cu2 is considered as the most valuable recycled metal in electroplating industry costa et al 2020 however the concentration of cu2 in electroplating wastewater could vary from dozens of mg l to hundreds of g l martín lara et al 2014 for instance the concentration of cu2 in rinsing solution of electroplating wastewater was generally at sub g l level which causes the high investment of recycling and the low cost efficiency chen et al 2020 after electroplating process different types of electroplating wastewaters should be collected and transported to a specialized hazardous waste treatment plant for harmless treatment nowadays numerous physicochemical treatment methods e g alkali addition adsorption membrane filtration and cementation have been developed for the treatment of cu2 from industrial wastewater but high chemical cost high energy consumption and or low cu2 removal efficiency hinder their broader applications bilal et al 2013 kurniawan et al 2006 van hille et al 2005 besides the present studies for removing cu laden wastewater mainly focused on the laboratory scale and the cu2 concentration was generally lower than 200 mg l villa gomez et al 2015 2011 kieu et al 2011 bratkova et al 2013 the above mentioned factors indicate the present physicochemical treatment methods might not be suitable for the treatment of electroplating wastewater with high concentration of cu2 more importantly the treatment of cu2 at several g l is still a bottleneck technology for electroplating wastewater since cu2 cannot be recycled or removed well bio sulfidogenic treatment method has been considered to be a promising technology to remove toxic metal ions from industrial wastewater because its economy of operation and energy efficiency sun et al 2020a johnson and hallberg 2005 the bio sulfidogenic treatment can be classified as sulfate based and sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment zhang et al 2018a in the sulfate based sulfidogenic treatment process sulfate is continually added into the bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducing bacteria and then sulfate reducing bacteria utilize organics as electron donor and produce sulfide and then cu2 reacts with sulfide to form copper sulfide precipitates eqs 1 and 2 chen et al 2016 due to the high cost of sulfate addition and the potential impact of residual sulfate in effluent sulfated based treatment process was generally used for the treatment of acid mine drainage with high strength sulfate sun et al 2020a kiran et al 2017 muyzer and stams 2008 compared to sulfate based sulfidogenic treatment process only a fourth of the organics and less than a fourth of electron acceptor i e element sulfur s0 are needed eqs 1 and 3 and the production of sulfide is driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb in the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment process our recent studies found that this sulfur based process was an attractive alternative to sulfate based process for the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater due to the cost saving the substantial saving in electron donors remarkably high rate of sulfide production and high removal efficiency of metal ions sun et al 2020a guo et al 2019 2018 to our best knowledge the present sulfur based studies are still at the laboratory stage and the performance and stability have not been evaluated in the pilot or large scale wastewater treatment thus the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment process for the treatment of cu2 in electroplating wastewater remains unclear to date and merits further study 1 2corg so4 2 h 2co2 hs 2 cu2 hs cus h 3 corg 2s0 2h2o co2 2hs 2h in the previous studies the s0rb geobacter deslfuromonas desulfurella clostridium and sulfurospirillum were commonly present in the sulfur reducing bioreactors with the feeding of chemical organic carbon e g acetate lactate and glucose wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 compared to the addition of expensive external chemical organics the utilization of organics in real domestic sewage should be more environmentally friendly and cost effective in practical application it has been reported that the feeding organics poses a significant effect on shaping the microbial community in a sulfidogenic bioreactor zhang et al 2015 ferraz et al 2021 thus various organic substrates that exist in real domestic sewage might limit the growth of s0rb and significantly change the microbial community structure which will further affect the sulfide production efficiency the production of sulfide is a critical parameter that directly affects the follow up removal efficiency of cu2 in electroplating wastewater thus the feeding of real domestic sewage as carbon source poses challenges to the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system in terms of sustainability and operation stability on sulfide production efficiency and cu2 removal efficiency therefore the effects of real domestic sewage on the sulfidogenic and microbial activities in the sulfur reducing bioreactor should be considered and evaluated the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system for the co treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater and real domestic sewage 2 to evaluate the long term effects of real domestic sewage and the operational parameters on the sulfidogenic activities and microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactors 3 to uncover the ecological interactions among members in the microbial community for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with real domestic sewage as electron donor 4 to evaluate the feasibility of the newly developed treatment system for treating cu laden electroplating wastewater during the long term operation i e 175 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operational concerns a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system for treating cu laden electroplating wastewater was newly developed in a hazardous waste treatment plant specialized in the treatment of various cu laden electroplating wastewaters the developed system consisted of two sulfur reducing bioreactors a mixed sedimentation tank and an aeration tank fig 1 and fig s1 of supporting information si the detailed descriptions of dimensioning for each unit are listed in table 1 before carrying out the pilot scale study sewage sludge was collected from a local sewage treatment plant mixed with acclimated sludge at a mixing ratio of 19 1 v v and pre cultivated with 110 mg c l synthetic domestic sewage for 30 days to enrich the sulfur reducer the acclimated sludge was taken from a sulfur reducing bioreactor that had been continuously operated for 1 year in our lab qiu et al 2017 the synthetic domestic sewage was widely used in sulfur reducing bioreactor in previous studies sun et al 2018 2020a then each bioreactor was equipped with commercial s0 particles 99 yinsong chemical co ltd that accounted for 50 of the bioreactor 100 kg in each bioreactor and inoculated with the pre cultivated sludge the treatment system was operated for 175 days from february 12th to august 5th 2019 during the long term operation 400 840 l d of the raw domestic sewage and 45 260 l d of the cu laden electroplating wastewater were co treated in our pilot scale system briefly the bioreactors were continuously fed with raw domestic sewage with the feeding rates of 400 650 and 840 l d for days 1 14 days 15 59 and days 60 175 respectively accordingly the hydraulic retention times hrts of the feeding domestic sewage were calculated to be 21 13 and 10 h respectively the raw domestic sewage without any pretreatment was directly collected from the washrooms and kitchen in the electroplating wastewater treatment plant the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the raw domestic sewage ranged from 16 3 to 113 2 mg c l with a geometric mean of 49 3 19 9 mg c l table s1 other characteristics of the domestic sewage are also listed in table s1 after ensuring the continuous production of sulfide in the bioreactors the sulfide rich effluent from two bioreactors were pumped into the sedimentation tank and mixed with cu laden electroplating wastewater days 60 175 since different types of electroplating wastewater were treated by the hazardous waste treatment plant two types of real electroplating wastewaters were collected and fed into the sedimentation tank to evaluate the flexibility of our pilot scale treatment system the operation of cu2 treatment was divided into two stages with different mixing ratios of bioreactors effluent to cu laden electroplating wastewaters based on the level of produced sulfide and cu2 in stage i days 60 93 a high concentration electroplating wastewater hcew 5600 mg cu l ph 2 8 3 2 was fed with a flow rate of 45 l d i e the mixing ratio of bioreactors effluent to hcew was 18 7 1 0 in stage ii days 94 175 a low concentration electroplating wastewater lcew 1200 mg cu l ph 3 2 4 2 was fed with a flow rate of 260 l d i e the mixing ratio of bioreactors effluent to lcew was 3 2 1 0 accordingly the calculated necessary sulfides were 150 and 190 mg s l for stages i and ii respectively after the precipitation of cu2 by the produced sulfide the effluent of the sedimentation tank was flowed into an aeration tank that equipped with air pumps to minimize the sulfide odor problem 2 2 monitoring of operational parameters to analyze the performance of the newly developed treatment system water samples were collected from each sampling point fig 1 at least four times per week the ph value was measured with a ph meter hq40d hach after filtering the sample through 0 45 µm membranes the concentration of sulfide as the summation of h2s hs and s2 was measured per the methylene blue method apha et al 2012 besides the concentrations of doc and metal ions were quantified with an organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu and a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 beijing puxi instrument factory respectively the total chemical oxygen demand i e codcarbon was determined per the potassium dichromate digestion method with an adjustment to eliminate the influence of sulfide apha et al 2012 daigger et al 2015 then the total cod was further divided into dissolved cod the fraction could pass through 0 45 µm membranes and particulate cod the fraction could be retained by 0 45 µm membranes 2 3 microbiology analysis the 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene was used to analyze the microbial community composition in the bioreactor sludge samples the sludge samples were collected from the parallel bioreactors on days 94 139 and 175 i e the first day the middle day and the last day of stage ii the dna extraction pcr amplification high throughput sequencing and data processing were carried out followed the procedure used in our previous publications sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis based on the kyoto encylopedia of genes and genome database was conducted to generate a functional profile from 16s rrna gene data sun et al 2020b zhao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance of the pilot scale treatment system 3 1 1 long term performance of the sulfur reducing bioreactors the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system aims to precipitate cu2 in the electroplating wastewater by the biogenic sulfide that generating in the sulfur reducing bioreactors using raw domestic sewage as carbon sources thus the sulfide production is the main indicator of the performance of the bioreactors as shown in fig 2 a after the start up period for 14 days 200 101 mg s l sulfide was generated in the sulfur reducing bioreactors indicating that s0rb could effectively utilize organics in domestic sewage as electron donor for sulfide production however the sulfide production rate spr in our pilot scale bioreactors 19 1 9 2 mg s l h was obvious lower than those in the reported lab scale sulfur reducing bioreactors 32 53 mg s l h sun et al 2020a 2020b 2018 qiu et al 2017 the slower spr in our pilot scale bioreactors could be caused by the lower doc concentration and a considerable amount of particle organic content in the raw domestic sewage it has been reported that the hydrolysis rate of biodegradable particulate organic carbon bpoc is much slower than that of doc and the hydrolysis of slowly bpoc is a limiting step in biological treatment alvarado et al 2021 thus it is reasonable that the spr in our pilot scale bioreactors fed with raw domestic sewage was lower than the rates reported in the previous lab scale bioreactors during the long term operation the production of sulfide in sulfur reducing bioreactors was significantly fluctuate which might significantly affect the follow up cu2 removal process therefore the relationship between sulfide production and the characteristics of feeding domestic sewage was studied fig 2a 2d the results indicated that the sulfide production was significantly affected by the doc concentration and ph of the feeding domestic sewage as illustrated in fig 2a and 2b the trend of sulfide production was similar to the trend of doc concentration in influent two remarkable increases in doc concentration were found on days 21 30 and 115 119 which might result in the increase of sulfide production on days 21 and 116 respectively a previous study reported that higher sulfide production can be achieved by increasing the concentration of feeding organics qiu et al 2017 therefore the production of sulfide was influenced by the amount of organic carbon content in raw domestic sewage besides the significant increase of sulfide production on days 115 125 might also due to the increase of ph of the feeding domestic sewage as shown in fig 1c the average ph of the domestic sewage was 7 5 0 2 whereas a sharp increase up to ph 8 7 was observed on days 115 121 our previous study found that the spr was significantly accelerated with increasing ph from 4 0 to 7 5 and the high rate of sulfide production maintained under alkaline conditions i e 7 9 to 8 2 in the sulfur reducing bioreactor sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2018b therefore we proposed that the domestic sewage with a higher ph e g 8 7 could further accelerate the spr of the bio sulfidogenic process and produce a greater amount of sulfide besides longer hrts could slightly enhance the spr in the sulfur reducing bioreactors as the sprs were 21 3 8 5 and 18 6 9 2 mg s l h during days 15 59 and 60 175 respectively fig 2a in contrast the sulfide production did not affect by the variation of temperature from 16 0 to 31 2 c fig 2d notably the organics in domestic sewage cannot fully be utilized by s0rb in the bioreactors and a considerable amount of dissolved and particulate organics remained in the effluent of bioreactors those residual organics could be treated by the follow up treatment process after our treatment system as shown in fig 2b the concentration of doc in bioreactors only reduced by 17 8 0 3 since the results of doc variation cannot reflect the presence of particulate organic carbon in raw domestic sewage the codcarbon concentrations of influent and effluent of the bioreactors were further determined in terms of total cod dissolved cod and particulate cod as shown in fig 3 the total cod concentration reduced from 169 2 to 106 4 mg l of which particulate cod and dissolved cod decreased by 54 0 from 77 7 to 35 8 mg l and 22 9 from 91 5 to 70 6 mg l respectively one tailed t statistical significant test was conducted per a previous study li et al 2017 and significant difference p 0 05 was found in the cod variation detailed in text s1 and table s2 as mentioned the raw domestic sewage was freshly collected from the washrooms and kitchen and directly fed into the sulfur reducing bioreactors the particulate organics in raw domestic sewage have not been completely mineralized and hydrolyzed in the septic tank before the feeding of domestic sewage which resulted in the relatively low cod removal efficiency in sulfidogenic bioreactors however our results indicated that bpoc can be efficiently hydrolyzed to doc e g volatile fatty acids vfas gao et al 2021 eryildiz and taherzadeh 2020 pang et al 2020 and then utilized by s0rb to produce sulfide in the sulfur reducing bioreactors sun et al 2018 qiu et al 2017 thus the utilization of bpoc in raw domestic sewage by microorganism should contribute a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study 3 1 2 long term performance on cu2 removal the effluent from two bioreactors was flowed to the sedimentation tank and mixed with the hcew mixing ratio of effluent to hcew 18 7 1 0 in stage i and lcew mixing ratio 3 2 1 0 in stage ii then the cu2 in hcew 5580 250 mg cu l or lcew 1187 323 mg cu l was precipitated by the sulfide as shown in fig 4 the concentration of cu2 significantly decreased to 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 1 7 mg cu l with the extremely high removal efficiencies of 99 94 and 99 82 in stages i and ii respectively a mass balance calculation based on the measured sulfide concentration before and after the sedimentation tank was conducted to verify the high efficiencies of cu2 removal and sulfide utilization for instance the consumption of sulfide in sedimentation tank was 170 68 mg s l during stage ii i e the sulfide utilization efficiency was calculated to be 83 which was comparable to the required sulfide of 185 50 mg s l the results demonstrated that the cu2 in various real electroplating wastewaters can be effectively treated by our pilot scale sulfur based treatment system and the cu2 removal efficiencies did not affect by the ph of the initial electroplating wastewater from 2 83 to 4 23 many techniques have been developed for the treatment of cu laden wastewater but certain disadvantages limited their application for instance the commonly used adsorption methods were limited by the low sorption capacity of adsorbent up to 250 mg g and the membrane filters were easily blocked by suspended solid in raw wastewater al saydeh et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 thus the removal efficiencies of cu2 by adsorption and filtration technologies ranged from 81 99 and 47 99 respectively al saydeh et al 2017 üzüm et al 2009 gupta et al 2006 recently a pilot scale sulfate based sulfidogenic system was developed for treating cu2 in acid mine drainage compared to our sulfur based system the cu2 concentration present in acid mine drainage was much lower 100 120 mg l but a lower cu2 removal efficiency 61 was found in the reported study liu et al 2013 therefore our developed sulfur based system herein achieved a higher cu2 removal than the previously reported physicochemical or sulfate based treatment systems an additional semi quantitative analysis was also conducted for evaluating the treatment performance in terms of other toxic metal ions present in the electroplating wastewater as shown in table s3 the concentrations of aluminum iron manganese zinc chromium and nickel significantly reduced by an order of magnitude and the concentrations of mercury arsenic vanadium and antimony were even under the detection limit of 0 01 mg l accordingly the removal efficiencies of other toxic ions in electroplating wastewater were also considerable via our sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system 3 2 microbial community evolution as aforementioned the utilization of bpoc by microorganism should contribute a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study and the adoption of domestic sewage should result in different community composition from the previous lab scale studies with the addition of chemical organics thus the microbial community composition in the pilot scale bioreactor was compared to those in four reported lab scale sulfur reducing bioreactors to reveal the long term effect of domestic sewage on microbial community evolution wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 alpha diversity indices both shannon index and simpson index were calculated and the results indicated that higher microbial community diversity was found in the pilot scale bioreactors than that in the lab scale bioreactors table s4 for the seeding sludge samples collected from the same local sewage treatment plant their rarefaction curves were further compared based on the operational taxonomic units otus of sludge samples and depicted in fig s2 as shown the numbers of otus at the plateau stage were 483 554 for the pilot scale sludge samples which were 2 7 3 0 times higher than that for the lab scale sludge sample of lab 4 i e 182 the results confirmed that the significant effect of the feeding domestic sewage on microbial community evolution and the higher microbial community diversity in the pilot scale bioreactors fig s3a c illustrated that the microbial community structure was similar in two parallel bioreactors and it did not significantly change with operational days remarkably the feeding of raw domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community in the pilot scale sulfur reducing bioreactors as 129 genera i e 104 13 12 129 were unique in our pilot scale bioreactors and only 12 genera were shared among all six samples fig s3d to visualize the differences of microbial community at genera level the classified genera at 1 of average relative abundance in at least one of the pilot scale or lab scale samples were summarized in fig 5 in our pilot scale bioreactors blvii28 was the most abundant genus on day 94 with a relative abundance of 15 8 5 2 but its abundance was significantly dropped to 4 2 0 4 on day 175 the second most abundant genus blvii28 were also found in the reported lab scale bioreactors with the relative abundance of 0 1 8 7 wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 it has been reported that blvii28 were fermentative bacteria and dominated in anaerobic systems which tend to degrade the complicated substrates to vfas lin et al 2019 while some simple organic compounds such acetate ethyl alcohol and formic acid were not exploited by blvii28 su et al 2014 other dominant genera in two pilot scale bioreactors were geobacter 7 1 1 2 tolumonas 5 9 0 8 macellibacteroides 5 2 1 2 thiomonas 4 7 0 4 and caldisericum 3 3 1 3 on day 94 and caldisericum 13 7 1 1 sulfuricurvum 4 1 0 1 smithella 3 9 0 6 macellibacteroides 2 4 0 5 syntrophus 1 7 0 1 and proteiniclasticum 1 7 0 1 on day 175 among them the anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria caldisericum macellibacteroides sulfuricurvum and tolumonas and the fermentative bacteria syntrophus smithella and proteiniclasticum were absent or present at a relatively low level 0 5 in the lab scale bioreactors fig 5 it has been reported that degradable solids could be transformed into smaller soluble molecules via an anaerobic fermentation process cao et al 2019 benneouala et al 2017 li et al 2011 eastman and ferguson 1981 besides previous studies demonstrated that the insoluble lignocellulose is a major organic component for hydrolytic bacteria and both hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria play an important role in degrading high molecular compounds to low molecular compounds e g vfas lo et al 2009 cirne et al 2007 for instance caldisericum possess strong abilities in degrading heterocyclic organic pollutants and promoting the hydrolysis of recalcitrant organic compounds e g petroleum organics chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2014 macellibacteroides are identified as vfa producers which are capable of utilizing and hydrolyzing cellulose and hemicellulose acids to vfas she et al 2020 chen and chang 2017 tolumonas could utilize lignin as carbon source and degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants e g anthraquinone dyes under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2019 2011 sulfuricurvum could degrade persistent organic pollutant e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated biphenyl ethers in the sediments with e waste contaminant liu et al 2018 and smithella are known for metabolizing fatty acids to a more reduced form i e acetate leng et al 2018 thus the presence of the mentioned hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in the pilot scale bioreactors makes it possible to convert complicated bpoc to vfas acetate or other dissoluble substrates the picrust analysis was conducted to evaluate the metagenomic functional compositions of microbial community in the bioreactors on different operational days as presented in fig s4 the gene sequences in the collected samples mostly involved in metabolism 48 7 49 5 followed by genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes particularly carbohydrate amino acid and energy were the main pathways in the metabolism and the total relative abundance of them accounted for more than 26 throughout the whole operation fig 6 carbohydrate metabolism plays a vital role in degrading complex organic molecules into easily degradable substances zhao et al 2019 the highest abundance of carbohydrate metabolism 8 8 9 7 further confirmed the possibility of bpoc that degrading to dissolvable organic substrates amino acid and energy metabolism could provide the requirement of carbon sources and energy for microorganism lópez gonzález et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 the fermentative bacteria geobacter were present in both pilot scale and lab scale bioreactors wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 geobacter can biologically reduce s0 to sulfide using a wide range of organic substrate and are also identified as s0rb hedderich et al 1998 four s0rb namely desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium pseudomonas and sulfurospirillum were also detected in the collected sludge samples similar to geobacter the relative abundance of each s0rb reduced from 1 1 1 7 day 94 to 0 4 1 5 day 175 which might due to the increase of the total number of microorganism in the bioreactors those s0rb were also present in lab scale bioreactors fed with synthetic domestic sewage at the same abundance level wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 according to the picrust analysis the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism in energy metabolism category was at a stable level of 0 29 0 31 fig 6 which was the same as that reported in a lab scale study sun et al 2020b therefore the community composition and the relative abundance of s0rb as well as the relative abundance of functional gene associated with sulfur metabolism in pilot scale bioreactors would not affected by the feeding of domestic sewage as carbon source 3 3 ecological interactions among members in the microbial community and system stability as illustrated in section 3 1 1 the fed raw domestic sewage was the mixture of black water and kitchen sewage that without any pre hydrolyzing which resulted in the low cod removal efficiency the particulate organics especially the bpoc present in raw domestic sewage need to be fully hydrolyzed to dissolved organics thus to make the possibility of utilization by s0rb to generate sulfide accordingly ecological interactions among hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb were required and the pathway of the ecological interactions was proposed for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with domestic sewage as carbon source this pathway consists of two steps the fermentation degradation and the biological sulfide production during the step of fermentation degradation the bpoc in raw domestic sewage can be degraded to doc by the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria as shown in the fig 3 66 7 of the cod reduction was contributed from the reduction of particulate organics while 33 3 was contributed from the reduction of dissolved organics in raw domestic sewage it implies that the microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactor efficiently hydrolyzed bpoc from the raw domestic sewage into dissolved organic matters e g vfas then s0rb can biologically reduce s0 to sulfide with the utilization of dissolved organic matters as electron donor during the step of biological sulfide production as illustrated hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria and s0rb are the critical microorganisms in our proposed pathway in terms of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria their relative abundance continually increased with the operational time with the feeding of domestic sewage in the bioreactors fig 5 thus the fermentation degradation can continuously proceed which was also indicated by the stable abundances of genes involved in carbohydrate amino acid and energy metabolism fig 6 although the relative abundance of s0rb decreased with the operational time the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism kept at a stable level fig 6 herein a relatively high level of sulfide production was found in this study fig 2a similar results were also reported in previous studies i e high rate sulfur reduction can be achieved with the presence of s0rb even at a relative low abundance in the bioreactors qiu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a therefore the sulfur reducing bioreactors can maintain continuously in a good working condition for sulfide production with the presence of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb moreover the microbial community diversity in the pilot scale bioreactors was found to be increased with the operational time of the sulfur based treatment system fig s2 higher microbial community diversity can strengthen the resistance resilience and functional redundancy of a microbial system which are desirable to ensure a functional stability of microbial communities in a bioreactor when suffering from disturbance wittebolle et al 2009 calusinska et al 2018 lee et al 2017 thus a relatively high level of sulfide production can be achieved under various operational parameters e g the non uniform domestic sewage and different hrt ph and temperature during the 175 days of operation fig 2 accordingly our sulfur reducing bioreactors could be well maintained under various environmental conditions 3 4 economic applicability to further demonstrate the feasibility of our developed sulfur based sulfidogenic system for treating the cu laden electroplating wastewater monthly economic evaluation was conducted based on the same level of cu2 removal i e one representative electroplating wastewater used in this study 1200 mg cu l 260 l d 30 d m 9 36 kg cu m according to eq 2 the consumption of sulfur particle was 4 68 kg per month the equipped sulfur particles 200 kg in two bioreactors can be theoretically used for a long time note that the bioreactor should be replenished with sulfur particle regularly to maintain the high sulfide production as mentioned the present studies for the treatment of cu laden wastewater mainly focused on the laboratory scale the monthly chemical cost of our pilot scale sulfur based treatment system was roughly compared to the lab scale sulfur based treatment system as well as the lab scale physicochemical treatment systems as shown in table 2 the sulfur based treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 from 12 0 515 to 1 5 2 0 usd per month and our treatment system fed with domestic sewage further decreased the total chemical cost of sulfur based treatment system by 25 0 from 2 0 to 1 5 usd per month therefore our developed sulfur based sulfidogenic system by using domestic sewage as carbon source is a cost effective system and it is an attractive alternative system for the treatment of electroplating wastewater even with extremely high cu2 concentration 4 conclusions in this study a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system fed with raw domestic sewage as electron donor was developed for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater during 175 days of operation the long term performance microbial community evolution and chemical cost of the pilot scale treatment system were evaluated to our best knowledge this is the first pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic study and the main findings of this study were more than 99 9 of the extremely high cu2 concentration i e 5580 250 and 1187 323 mg cu l in stages i and ii respectively in two types of electroplating wastewaters was removed in the pilot scale sulfur based treatment system s0rb can utilize the organics present in raw domestic sewage as electron donor and reduce the s0 to produce sulfide 200 101 mg s l most of the utilized organic carbon 66 7 for sulfide production was sourced from the bpoc via fermentation degradation and the rest were sourced from the original doc in the raw domestic sewage in practical application the production of sulfide in the pilot scale sulfur reducing bioreactors was vulnerable to the variations of ph and organic carbon content of the feeding domestic sewage in contrast the effect of temperature could be ignored the feeding of domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community and higher microbial community diversity was found in the pilot scale bioreactors than that in the lab scale bioreactors various hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were identified in the pilot scale bioreactors fed with domestic sewage and they were absent in the lab scale bioreactors fed with synthesis domestic sewage accordingly the ecological interactions among hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb were newly proposed for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with domestic sewage as electron donor then the system stability was evaluated which confirming that the sulfur reducing bioreactors can maintain continuously in a good working condition for sulfide production with the presence of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb compared to previous reported treatment systems with other technologies our developed pilot scale treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for the same level of cu2 removal to summarize the sulfur based sulfidogenic process was firstly applied for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater at pilot scale system this newly developed pilot scale sulfur based system for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater achieved higher cu2 removal and higher cost effectiveness than the conventional technologies therefore it could serve as a promising and attractive treatment system for treating metal laden wastewater notably this newly developed sulfur based treatment system could be further optimized in the future study for instance a backwashing process could be added to avoid the clogged issue in bioreactors during the full scale operation the aeration process after the sedimentation tank could be retrofitted to a reflux process from the outlet to the inlet of sedimentation tank to enhance the utilization efficiency of sulfide the

17113,elemental sulfur s0 reduction process has been demonstrated as an attractive and cost efficient approach for metal laden wastewater treatment in lab scale studies however the system performance and stability have not been evaluated in pilot or large scale wastewater treatment especially the sulfide production rate and microbial community structure may significantly vary from lab scale system to pilot or large scale systems using real domestic sewage as carbon source which brings questions to this novel technology in this study therefore a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system was newly developed and applied for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewaters using domestic sewage as carbon source during the 175 d operation 99 9 of cu2 i e 5580 and 1187 mg cu l for two types of electroplating wastewaters was efficiently removed by the biogenic hydrogen sulfide that produced through s0 reduction relatively high level of sulfide production 200 mg s l can be achieved by utilizing organics in raw domestic sewage which was easily affected by the organic content and ph value of the domestic sewage the long term feeding of domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community in sulfur reducing bioreactors compared to the reported lab scale bioreactors higher microbial community diversity was found in our pilot scale bioreactors the presence of hydrolytic fermentative and sulfur reducing bacteria was the critical factor for system stability accordingly a two step ecological interaction among fermentative and sulfur reducing bacteria was newly proposed for sulfide production biodegradable particulate organic carbon bpoc was firstly degraded to dissolved organic carbon doc by the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria then sulfur reducing bacteria utilized the total doc both doc degraded from bpoc and the original doc present in domestic sewage as electron donor and reduced the s0 to sulfide afterwards the sulfide precipitated cu2 in the post sedimentation tank compared with other reported technologies the sulfur based treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for the same level of cu2 removal therefore this pilot scale study demonstrated that s0 reduction process can be a sustainable technology to generate sulfide for the co treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater and domestic sewage achieving higher cu2 removal and higher cost effectiveness than the conventional technologies graphical asbtract image graphical abstract keywords sulfur reduction sulfur reducing bacteria cu laden electroplating wastewater pilot scale system microbial community structure 1 introduction heavy metal laden wastewater from industrial processes such as electroplating etching metal finishing and mining could pose severe environmental pollution kiran et al 2017 copper is one of the commonly used heavy metals in many industrial applications toxicological studies have shown that copper ions cu2 are developmentally toxic to aquatic organisms ochoa herrera et al 2011 and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that health problems e g liver damage and insomnia were positively correlated with cu2 kurniawan et al 2006 accordingly the discharged cu2 concentration in industrial wastewater has been regulated by united states environmental protection agency with a maximum level at 1 3 mg l al saydeh et al 2017 due to the highly toxic effect of cu2 and the high concentration of cu2 in electroplating wastewater cu2 is considered as the most valuable recycled metal in electroplating industry costa et al 2020 however the concentration of cu2 in electroplating wastewater could vary from dozens of mg l to hundreds of g l martín lara et al 2014 for instance the concentration of cu2 in rinsing solution of electroplating wastewater was generally at sub g l level which causes the high investment of recycling and the low cost efficiency chen et al 2020 after electroplating process different types of electroplating wastewaters should be collected and transported to a specialized hazardous waste treatment plant for harmless treatment nowadays numerous physicochemical treatment methods e g alkali addition adsorption membrane filtration and cementation have been developed for the treatment of cu2 from industrial wastewater but high chemical cost high energy consumption and or low cu2 removal efficiency hinder their broader applications bilal et al 2013 kurniawan et al 2006 van hille et al 2005 besides the present studies for removing cu laden wastewater mainly focused on the laboratory scale and the cu2 concentration was generally lower than 200 mg l villa gomez et al 2015 2011 kieu et al 2011 bratkova et al 2013 the above mentioned factors indicate the present physicochemical treatment methods might not be suitable for the treatment of electroplating wastewater with high concentration of cu2 more importantly the treatment of cu2 at several g l is still a bottleneck technology for electroplating wastewater since cu2 cannot be recycled or removed well bio sulfidogenic treatment method has been considered to be a promising technology to remove toxic metal ions from industrial wastewater because its economy of operation and energy efficiency sun et al 2020a johnson and hallberg 2005 the bio sulfidogenic treatment can be classified as sulfate based and sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment zhang et al 2018a in the sulfate based sulfidogenic treatment process sulfate is continually added into the bioreactor to enrich the sulfate reducing bacteria and then sulfate reducing bacteria utilize organics as electron donor and produce sulfide and then cu2 reacts with sulfide to form copper sulfide precipitates eqs 1 and 2 chen et al 2016 due to the high cost of sulfate addition and the potential impact of residual sulfate in effluent sulfated based treatment process was generally used for the treatment of acid mine drainage with high strength sulfate sun et al 2020a kiran et al 2017 muyzer and stams 2008 compared to sulfate based sulfidogenic treatment process only a fourth of the organics and less than a fourth of electron acceptor i e element sulfur s0 are needed eqs 1 and 3 and the production of sulfide is driven by sulfur reducing bacteria s0rb in the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment process our recent studies found that this sulfur based process was an attractive alternative to sulfate based process for the treatment of organics deficient metal laden wastewater due to the cost saving the substantial saving in electron donors remarkably high rate of sulfide production and high removal efficiency of metal ions sun et al 2020a guo et al 2019 2018 to our best knowledge the present sulfur based studies are still at the laboratory stage and the performance and stability have not been evaluated in the pilot or large scale wastewater treatment thus the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment process for the treatment of cu2 in electroplating wastewater remains unclear to date and merits further study 1 2corg so4 2 h 2co2 hs 2 cu2 hs cus h 3 corg 2s0 2h2o co2 2hs 2h in the previous studies the s0rb geobacter deslfuromonas desulfurella clostridium and sulfurospirillum were commonly present in the sulfur reducing bioreactors with the feeding of chemical organic carbon e g acetate lactate and glucose wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 compared to the addition of expensive external chemical organics the utilization of organics in real domestic sewage should be more environmentally friendly and cost effective in practical application it has been reported that the feeding organics poses a significant effect on shaping the microbial community in a sulfidogenic bioreactor zhang et al 2015 ferraz et al 2021 thus various organic substrates that exist in real domestic sewage might limit the growth of s0rb and significantly change the microbial community structure which will further affect the sulfide production efficiency the production of sulfide is a critical parameter that directly affects the follow up removal efficiency of cu2 in electroplating wastewater thus the feeding of real domestic sewage as carbon source poses challenges to the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system in terms of sustainability and operation stability on sulfide production efficiency and cu2 removal efficiency therefore the effects of real domestic sewage on the sulfidogenic and microbial activities in the sulfur reducing bioreactor should be considered and evaluated the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system for the co treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater and real domestic sewage 2 to evaluate the long term effects of real domestic sewage and the operational parameters on the sulfidogenic activities and microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactors 3 to uncover the ecological interactions among members in the microbial community for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with real domestic sewage as electron donor 4 to evaluate the feasibility of the newly developed treatment system for treating cu laden electroplating wastewater during the long term operation i e 175 days 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operational concerns a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system for treating cu laden electroplating wastewater was newly developed in a hazardous waste treatment plant specialized in the treatment of various cu laden electroplating wastewaters the developed system consisted of two sulfur reducing bioreactors a mixed sedimentation tank and an aeration tank fig 1 and fig s1 of supporting information si the detailed descriptions of dimensioning for each unit are listed in table 1 before carrying out the pilot scale study sewage sludge was collected from a local sewage treatment plant mixed with acclimated sludge at a mixing ratio of 19 1 v v and pre cultivated with 110 mg c l synthetic domestic sewage for 30 days to enrich the sulfur reducer the acclimated sludge was taken from a sulfur reducing bioreactor that had been continuously operated for 1 year in our lab qiu et al 2017 the synthetic domestic sewage was widely used in sulfur reducing bioreactor in previous studies sun et al 2018 2020a then each bioreactor was equipped with commercial s0 particles 99 yinsong chemical co ltd that accounted for 50 of the bioreactor 100 kg in each bioreactor and inoculated with the pre cultivated sludge the treatment system was operated for 175 days from february 12th to august 5th 2019 during the long term operation 400 840 l d of the raw domestic sewage and 45 260 l d of the cu laden electroplating wastewater were co treated in our pilot scale system briefly the bioreactors were continuously fed with raw domestic sewage with the feeding rates of 400 650 and 840 l d for days 1 14 days 15 59 and days 60 175 respectively accordingly the hydraulic retention times hrts of the feeding domestic sewage were calculated to be 21 13 and 10 h respectively the raw domestic sewage without any pretreatment was directly collected from the washrooms and kitchen in the electroplating wastewater treatment plant the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of the raw domestic sewage ranged from 16 3 to 113 2 mg c l with a geometric mean of 49 3 19 9 mg c l table s1 other characteristics of the domestic sewage are also listed in table s1 after ensuring the continuous production of sulfide in the bioreactors the sulfide rich effluent from two bioreactors were pumped into the sedimentation tank and mixed with cu laden electroplating wastewater days 60 175 since different types of electroplating wastewater were treated by the hazardous waste treatment plant two types of real electroplating wastewaters were collected and fed into the sedimentation tank to evaluate the flexibility of our pilot scale treatment system the operation of cu2 treatment was divided into two stages with different mixing ratios of bioreactors effluent to cu laden electroplating wastewaters based on the level of produced sulfide and cu2 in stage i days 60 93 a high concentration electroplating wastewater hcew 5600 mg cu l ph 2 8 3 2 was fed with a flow rate of 45 l d i e the mixing ratio of bioreactors effluent to hcew was 18 7 1 0 in stage ii days 94 175 a low concentration electroplating wastewater lcew 1200 mg cu l ph 3 2 4 2 was fed with a flow rate of 260 l d i e the mixing ratio of bioreactors effluent to lcew was 3 2 1 0 accordingly the calculated necessary sulfides were 150 and 190 mg s l for stages i and ii respectively after the precipitation of cu2 by the produced sulfide the effluent of the sedimentation tank was flowed into an aeration tank that equipped with air pumps to minimize the sulfide odor problem 2 2 monitoring of operational parameters to analyze the performance of the newly developed treatment system water samples were collected from each sampling point fig 1 at least four times per week the ph value was measured with a ph meter hq40d hach after filtering the sample through 0 45 µm membranes the concentration of sulfide as the summation of h2s hs and s2 was measured per the methylene blue method apha et al 2012 besides the concentrations of doc and metal ions were quantified with an organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu and a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer tas 990 beijing puxi instrument factory respectively the total chemical oxygen demand i e codcarbon was determined per the potassium dichromate digestion method with an adjustment to eliminate the influence of sulfide apha et al 2012 daigger et al 2015 then the total cod was further divided into dissolved cod the fraction could pass through 0 45 µm membranes and particulate cod the fraction could be retained by 0 45 µm membranes 2 3 microbiology analysis the 454 pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene was used to analyze the microbial community composition in the bioreactor sludge samples the sludge samples were collected from the parallel bioreactors on days 94 139 and 175 i e the first day the middle day and the last day of stage ii the dna extraction pcr amplification high throughput sequencing and data processing were carried out followed the procedure used in our previous publications sun et al 2019 wang et al 2018 phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust analysis based on the kyoto encylopedia of genes and genome database was conducted to generate a functional profile from 16s rrna gene data sun et al 2020b zhao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 system performance of the pilot scale treatment system 3 1 1 long term performance of the sulfur reducing bioreactors the sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system aims to precipitate cu2 in the electroplating wastewater by the biogenic sulfide that generating in the sulfur reducing bioreactors using raw domestic sewage as carbon sources thus the sulfide production is the main indicator of the performance of the bioreactors as shown in fig 2 a after the start up period for 14 days 200 101 mg s l sulfide was generated in the sulfur reducing bioreactors indicating that s0rb could effectively utilize organics in domestic sewage as electron donor for sulfide production however the sulfide production rate spr in our pilot scale bioreactors 19 1 9 2 mg s l h was obvious lower than those in the reported lab scale sulfur reducing bioreactors 32 53 mg s l h sun et al 2020a 2020b 2018 qiu et al 2017 the slower spr in our pilot scale bioreactors could be caused by the lower doc concentration and a considerable amount of particle organic content in the raw domestic sewage it has been reported that the hydrolysis rate of biodegradable particulate organic carbon bpoc is much slower than that of doc and the hydrolysis of slowly bpoc is a limiting step in biological treatment alvarado et al 2021 thus it is reasonable that the spr in our pilot scale bioreactors fed with raw domestic sewage was lower than the rates reported in the previous lab scale bioreactors during the long term operation the production of sulfide in sulfur reducing bioreactors was significantly fluctuate which might significantly affect the follow up cu2 removal process therefore the relationship between sulfide production and the characteristics of feeding domestic sewage was studied fig 2a 2d the results indicated that the sulfide production was significantly affected by the doc concentration and ph of the feeding domestic sewage as illustrated in fig 2a and 2b the trend of sulfide production was similar to the trend of doc concentration in influent two remarkable increases in doc concentration were found on days 21 30 and 115 119 which might result in the increase of sulfide production on days 21 and 116 respectively a previous study reported that higher sulfide production can be achieved by increasing the concentration of feeding organics qiu et al 2017 therefore the production of sulfide was influenced by the amount of organic carbon content in raw domestic sewage besides the significant increase of sulfide production on days 115 125 might also due to the increase of ph of the feeding domestic sewage as shown in fig 1c the average ph of the domestic sewage was 7 5 0 2 whereas a sharp increase up to ph 8 7 was observed on days 115 121 our previous study found that the spr was significantly accelerated with increasing ph from 4 0 to 7 5 and the high rate of sulfide production maintained under alkaline conditions i e 7 9 to 8 2 in the sulfur reducing bioreactor sun et al 2020a zhang et al 2018b therefore we proposed that the domestic sewage with a higher ph e g 8 7 could further accelerate the spr of the bio sulfidogenic process and produce a greater amount of sulfide besides longer hrts could slightly enhance the spr in the sulfur reducing bioreactors as the sprs were 21 3 8 5 and 18 6 9 2 mg s l h during days 15 59 and 60 175 respectively fig 2a in contrast the sulfide production did not affect by the variation of temperature from 16 0 to 31 2 c fig 2d notably the organics in domestic sewage cannot fully be utilized by s0rb in the bioreactors and a considerable amount of dissolved and particulate organics remained in the effluent of bioreactors those residual organics could be treated by the follow up treatment process after our treatment system as shown in fig 2b the concentration of doc in bioreactors only reduced by 17 8 0 3 since the results of doc variation cannot reflect the presence of particulate organic carbon in raw domestic sewage the codcarbon concentrations of influent and effluent of the bioreactors were further determined in terms of total cod dissolved cod and particulate cod as shown in fig 3 the total cod concentration reduced from 169 2 to 106 4 mg l of which particulate cod and dissolved cod decreased by 54 0 from 77 7 to 35 8 mg l and 22 9 from 91 5 to 70 6 mg l respectively one tailed t statistical significant test was conducted per a previous study li et al 2017 and significant difference p 0 05 was found in the cod variation detailed in text s1 and table s2 as mentioned the raw domestic sewage was freshly collected from the washrooms and kitchen and directly fed into the sulfur reducing bioreactors the particulate organics in raw domestic sewage have not been completely mineralized and hydrolyzed in the septic tank before the feeding of domestic sewage which resulted in the relatively low cod removal efficiency in sulfidogenic bioreactors however our results indicated that bpoc can be efficiently hydrolyzed to doc e g volatile fatty acids vfas gao et al 2021 eryildiz and taherzadeh 2020 pang et al 2020 and then utilized by s0rb to produce sulfide in the sulfur reducing bioreactors sun et al 2018 qiu et al 2017 thus the utilization of bpoc in raw domestic sewage by microorganism should contribute a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study 3 1 2 long term performance on cu2 removal the effluent from two bioreactors was flowed to the sedimentation tank and mixed with the hcew mixing ratio of effluent to hcew 18 7 1 0 in stage i and lcew mixing ratio 3 2 1 0 in stage ii then the cu2 in hcew 5580 250 mg cu l or lcew 1187 323 mg cu l was precipitated by the sulfide as shown in fig 4 the concentration of cu2 significantly decreased to 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 1 7 mg cu l with the extremely high removal efficiencies of 99 94 and 99 82 in stages i and ii respectively a mass balance calculation based on the measured sulfide concentration before and after the sedimentation tank was conducted to verify the high efficiencies of cu2 removal and sulfide utilization for instance the consumption of sulfide in sedimentation tank was 170 68 mg s l during stage ii i e the sulfide utilization efficiency was calculated to be 83 which was comparable to the required sulfide of 185 50 mg s l the results demonstrated that the cu2 in various real electroplating wastewaters can be effectively treated by our pilot scale sulfur based treatment system and the cu2 removal efficiencies did not affect by the ph of the initial electroplating wastewater from 2 83 to 4 23 many techniques have been developed for the treatment of cu laden wastewater but certain disadvantages limited their application for instance the commonly used adsorption methods were limited by the low sorption capacity of adsorbent up to 250 mg g and the membrane filters were easily blocked by suspended solid in raw wastewater al saydeh et al 2017 taghavijeloudar et al 2019 thus the removal efficiencies of cu2 by adsorption and filtration technologies ranged from 81 99 and 47 99 respectively al saydeh et al 2017 üzüm et al 2009 gupta et al 2006 recently a pilot scale sulfate based sulfidogenic system was developed for treating cu2 in acid mine drainage compared to our sulfur based system the cu2 concentration present in acid mine drainage was much lower 100 120 mg l but a lower cu2 removal efficiency 61 was found in the reported study liu et al 2013 therefore our developed sulfur based system herein achieved a higher cu2 removal than the previously reported physicochemical or sulfate based treatment systems an additional semi quantitative analysis was also conducted for evaluating the treatment performance in terms of other toxic metal ions present in the electroplating wastewater as shown in table s3 the concentrations of aluminum iron manganese zinc chromium and nickel significantly reduced by an order of magnitude and the concentrations of mercury arsenic vanadium and antimony were even under the detection limit of 0 01 mg l accordingly the removal efficiencies of other toxic ions in electroplating wastewater were also considerable via our sulfur based sulfidogenic treatment system 3 2 microbial community evolution as aforementioned the utilization of bpoc by microorganism should contribute a considerable amount of sulfide production in this study and the adoption of domestic sewage should result in different community composition from the previous lab scale studies with the addition of chemical organics thus the microbial community composition in the pilot scale bioreactor was compared to those in four reported lab scale sulfur reducing bioreactors to reveal the long term effect of domestic sewage on microbial community evolution wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 alpha diversity indices both shannon index and simpson index were calculated and the results indicated that higher microbial community diversity was found in the pilot scale bioreactors than that in the lab scale bioreactors table s4 for the seeding sludge samples collected from the same local sewage treatment plant their rarefaction curves were further compared based on the operational taxonomic units otus of sludge samples and depicted in fig s2 as shown the numbers of otus at the plateau stage were 483 554 for the pilot scale sludge samples which were 2 7 3 0 times higher than that for the lab scale sludge sample of lab 4 i e 182 the results confirmed that the significant effect of the feeding domestic sewage on microbial community evolution and the higher microbial community diversity in the pilot scale bioreactors fig s3a c illustrated that the microbial community structure was similar in two parallel bioreactors and it did not significantly change with operational days remarkably the feeding of raw domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community in the pilot scale sulfur reducing bioreactors as 129 genera i e 104 13 12 129 were unique in our pilot scale bioreactors and only 12 genera were shared among all six samples fig s3d to visualize the differences of microbial community at genera level the classified genera at 1 of average relative abundance in at least one of the pilot scale or lab scale samples were summarized in fig 5 in our pilot scale bioreactors blvii28 was the most abundant genus on day 94 with a relative abundance of 15 8 5 2 but its abundance was significantly dropped to 4 2 0 4 on day 175 the second most abundant genus blvii28 were also found in the reported lab scale bioreactors with the relative abundance of 0 1 8 7 wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 it has been reported that blvii28 were fermentative bacteria and dominated in anaerobic systems which tend to degrade the complicated substrates to vfas lin et al 2019 while some simple organic compounds such acetate ethyl alcohol and formic acid were not exploited by blvii28 su et al 2014 other dominant genera in two pilot scale bioreactors were geobacter 7 1 1 2 tolumonas 5 9 0 8 macellibacteroides 5 2 1 2 thiomonas 4 7 0 4 and caldisericum 3 3 1 3 on day 94 and caldisericum 13 7 1 1 sulfuricurvum 4 1 0 1 smithella 3 9 0 6 macellibacteroides 2 4 0 5 syntrophus 1 7 0 1 and proteiniclasticum 1 7 0 1 on day 175 among them the anaerobic hydrolytic bacteria caldisericum macellibacteroides sulfuricurvum and tolumonas and the fermentative bacteria syntrophus smithella and proteiniclasticum were absent or present at a relatively low level 0 5 in the lab scale bioreactors fig 5 it has been reported that degradable solids could be transformed into smaller soluble molecules via an anaerobic fermentation process cao et al 2019 benneouala et al 2017 li et al 2011 eastman and ferguson 1981 besides previous studies demonstrated that the insoluble lignocellulose is a major organic component for hydrolytic bacteria and both hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria play an important role in degrading high molecular compounds to low molecular compounds e g vfas lo et al 2009 cirne et al 2007 for instance caldisericum possess strong abilities in degrading heterocyclic organic pollutants and promoting the hydrolysis of recalcitrant organic compounds e g petroleum organics chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2014 macellibacteroides are identified as vfa producers which are capable of utilizing and hydrolyzing cellulose and hemicellulose acids to vfas she et al 2020 chen and chang 2017 tolumonas could utilize lignin as carbon source and degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants e g anthraquinone dyes under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2019 2011 sulfuricurvum could degrade persistent organic pollutant e g polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated biphenyl ethers in the sediments with e waste contaminant liu et al 2018 and smithella are known for metabolizing fatty acids to a more reduced form i e acetate leng et al 2018 thus the presence of the mentioned hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria in the pilot scale bioreactors makes it possible to convert complicated bpoc to vfas acetate or other dissoluble substrates the picrust analysis was conducted to evaluate the metagenomic functional compositions of microbial community in the bioreactors on different operational days as presented in fig s4 the gene sequences in the collected samples mostly involved in metabolism 48 7 49 5 followed by genetic information processing environmental information processing and cellular processes particularly carbohydrate amino acid and energy were the main pathways in the metabolism and the total relative abundance of them accounted for more than 26 throughout the whole operation fig 6 carbohydrate metabolism plays a vital role in degrading complex organic molecules into easily degradable substances zhao et al 2019 the highest abundance of carbohydrate metabolism 8 8 9 7 further confirmed the possibility of bpoc that degrading to dissolvable organic substrates amino acid and energy metabolism could provide the requirement of carbon sources and energy for microorganism lópez gonzález et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 the fermentative bacteria geobacter were present in both pilot scale and lab scale bioreactors wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 geobacter can biologically reduce s0 to sulfide using a wide range of organic substrate and are also identified as s0rb hedderich et al 1998 four s0rb namely desulfovibrio desulfomicrobium pseudomonas and sulfurospirillum were also detected in the collected sludge samples similar to geobacter the relative abundance of each s0rb reduced from 1 1 1 7 day 94 to 0 4 1 5 day 175 which might due to the increase of the total number of microorganism in the bioreactors those s0rb were also present in lab scale bioreactors fed with synthetic domestic sewage at the same abundance level wang et al 2019 qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2018 2020 according to the picrust analysis the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism in energy metabolism category was at a stable level of 0 29 0 31 fig 6 which was the same as that reported in a lab scale study sun et al 2020b therefore the community composition and the relative abundance of s0rb as well as the relative abundance of functional gene associated with sulfur metabolism in pilot scale bioreactors would not affected by the feeding of domestic sewage as carbon source 3 3 ecological interactions among members in the microbial community and system stability as illustrated in section 3 1 1 the fed raw domestic sewage was the mixture of black water and kitchen sewage that without any pre hydrolyzing which resulted in the low cod removal efficiency the particulate organics especially the bpoc present in raw domestic sewage need to be fully hydrolyzed to dissolved organics thus to make the possibility of utilization by s0rb to generate sulfide accordingly ecological interactions among hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb were required and the pathway of the ecological interactions was proposed for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with domestic sewage as carbon source this pathway consists of two steps the fermentation degradation and the biological sulfide production during the step of fermentation degradation the bpoc in raw domestic sewage can be degraded to doc by the hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria as shown in the fig 3 66 7 of the cod reduction was contributed from the reduction of particulate organics while 33 3 was contributed from the reduction of dissolved organics in raw domestic sewage it implies that the microbial community in the sulfur reducing bioreactor efficiently hydrolyzed bpoc from the raw domestic sewage into dissolved organic matters e g vfas then s0rb can biologically reduce s0 to sulfide with the utilization of dissolved organic matters as electron donor during the step of biological sulfide production as illustrated hydrolytic bacteria fermentative bacteria and s0rb are the critical microorganisms in our proposed pathway in terms of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria their relative abundance continually increased with the operational time with the feeding of domestic sewage in the bioreactors fig 5 thus the fermentation degradation can continuously proceed which was also indicated by the stable abundances of genes involved in carbohydrate amino acid and energy metabolism fig 6 although the relative abundance of s0rb decreased with the operational time the relative abundance of functional genes associated with sulfur metabolism kept at a stable level fig 6 herein a relatively high level of sulfide production was found in this study fig 2a similar results were also reported in previous studies i e high rate sulfur reduction can be achieved with the presence of s0rb even at a relative low abundance in the bioreactors qiu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a therefore the sulfur reducing bioreactors can maintain continuously in a good working condition for sulfide production with the presence of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb moreover the microbial community diversity in the pilot scale bioreactors was found to be increased with the operational time of the sulfur based treatment system fig s2 higher microbial community diversity can strengthen the resistance resilience and functional redundancy of a microbial system which are desirable to ensure a functional stability of microbial communities in a bioreactor when suffering from disturbance wittebolle et al 2009 calusinska et al 2018 lee et al 2017 thus a relatively high level of sulfide production can be achieved under various operational parameters e g the non uniform domestic sewage and different hrt ph and temperature during the 175 days of operation fig 2 accordingly our sulfur reducing bioreactors could be well maintained under various environmental conditions 3 4 economic applicability to further demonstrate the feasibility of our developed sulfur based sulfidogenic system for treating the cu laden electroplating wastewater monthly economic evaluation was conducted based on the same level of cu2 removal i e one representative electroplating wastewater used in this study 1200 mg cu l 260 l d 30 d m 9 36 kg cu m according to eq 2 the consumption of sulfur particle was 4 68 kg per month the equipped sulfur particles 200 kg in two bioreactors can be theoretically used for a long time note that the bioreactor should be replenished with sulfur particle regularly to maintain the high sulfide production as mentioned the present studies for the treatment of cu laden wastewater mainly focused on the laboratory scale the monthly chemical cost of our pilot scale sulfur based treatment system was roughly compared to the lab scale sulfur based treatment system as well as the lab scale physicochemical treatment systems as shown in table 2 the sulfur based treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 from 12 0 515 to 1 5 2 0 usd per month and our treatment system fed with domestic sewage further decreased the total chemical cost of sulfur based treatment system by 25 0 from 2 0 to 1 5 usd per month therefore our developed sulfur based sulfidogenic system by using domestic sewage as carbon source is a cost effective system and it is an attractive alternative system for the treatment of electroplating wastewater even with extremely high cu2 concentration 4 conclusions in this study a pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic system fed with raw domestic sewage as electron donor was developed for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater during 175 days of operation the long term performance microbial community evolution and chemical cost of the pilot scale treatment system were evaluated to our best knowledge this is the first pilot scale sulfur based sulfidogenic study and the main findings of this study were more than 99 9 of the extremely high cu2 concentration i e 5580 250 and 1187 323 mg cu l in stages i and ii respectively in two types of electroplating wastewaters was removed in the pilot scale sulfur based treatment system s0rb can utilize the organics present in raw domestic sewage as electron donor and reduce the s0 to produce sulfide 200 101 mg s l most of the utilized organic carbon 66 7 for sulfide production was sourced from the bpoc via fermentation degradation and the rest were sourced from the original doc in the raw domestic sewage in practical application the production of sulfide in the pilot scale sulfur reducing bioreactors was vulnerable to the variations of ph and organic carbon content of the feeding domestic sewage in contrast the effect of temperature could be ignored the feeding of domestic sewage significantly re shaped the microbial community and higher microbial community diversity was found in the pilot scale bioreactors than that in the lab scale bioreactors various hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria were identified in the pilot scale bioreactors fed with domestic sewage and they were absent in the lab scale bioreactors fed with synthesis domestic sewage accordingly the ecological interactions among hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb were newly proposed for sulfide production in the sulfur reducing bioreactors fed with domestic sewage as electron donor then the system stability was evaluated which confirming that the sulfur reducing bioreactors can maintain continuously in a good working condition for sulfide production with the presence of hydrolytic fermentative bacteria and s0rb compared to previous reported treatment systems with other technologies our developed pilot scale treatment system remarkable reduced the total chemical cost by 87 5 99 6 for the same level of cu2 removal to summarize the sulfur based sulfidogenic process was firstly applied for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater at pilot scale system this newly developed pilot scale sulfur based system for the treatment of cu laden electroplating wastewater achieved higher cu2 removal and higher cost effectiveness than the conventional technologies therefore it could serve as a promising and attractive treatment system for treating metal laden wastewater notably this newly developed sulfur based treatment system could be further optimized in the future study for instance a backwashing process could be added to avoid the clogged issue in bioreactors during the full scale operation the aeration process after the sedimentation tank could be retrofitted to a reflux process from the outlet to the inlet of sedimentation tank to enhance the utilization efficiency of sulfide the hydrodynamics limitations should be considered in a full scale treatment system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17114,mature landfill leachate contains a substantial fraction of recalcitrant dissolved organic matters dom that is a challenging for conventional wastewater treatment that is typically focused on the removal of biodegradable organic matter biological treatment membrane treatment has been widely employed to treat complex leachate however the performance of each unit based on both conventional bulk indicators and molecular information has not been well understood therefore the fate of dom chemodiversity along the full scale treatment process across ten sampling points over three different seasons were analyzed to determine the efficiency of every unit process with the assistance of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry results showed that the process performance visualized through the molecular signals were relatively stable in the temporal dimension the process removed 83 2 92 2 of dom molecules in terms of richness where lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram likes with relatively high saturation was preferentially removed while newly generated bio derived n containing compounds n cwa 0 15 0 17 became resistant the relationship between conventional bulk physicochemical indicators and molecular indexes suggested that soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and dissolved organic carbon doc were contributed by the refractory dom with high weighted average double bond equivalents dbewa which was distributed in the region of o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 1 2 1 8 this refractory dom required ultrafiltration and nanofiltration for removal dom molecules were positively correlated with five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and revealed that approximately 96 9 98 4 of the dom could be removed or transformed in the primary anoxic zone in addition the bio derived aliphatic proteins lipids and lignin cram likes o c 0 2 with condensed aromatization were the sources of dissolved organic nitrogen don and still remained in the final effluent the present study suggests that the design and operation of the combination process with biological and membrane treatment could be specifically optimized based on the

1 introduction landfilling is a predominate method for the management of municipal solid waste one of the primary issues for landfill operation is the generation of highly concentrated and complex leachate qiu et al 2020b zhan et al 2017 the properties of landfill leachate changes over time usually indicated by a gradual decrease in biodegradability and increase in ammonia nitrogen concentration as leachate transitions from young to mature kurniawan and lo 2009 renou et al 2008 the characteristics of mature leachate i e low biodegradability and high concentration of ammonia nitrogen adds to the difficulty in treating this leachate dissolved organic matter dom is the dominant contributor to total organic carbon of landfill leachate liu et al 2015 lü et al 2009 in addition the composition and characteristics of dom change when undergoing diverse treatment factors affecting effluent quality and subsequently the selection of advanced treatment technologies komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 meanwhile more and more sophisticated combinations of different treatment technologies can be applied raising the question of whether or not such combinations are redundant and too complicated and if the process can be simplified to some extent and still maintain the proper effluent quality hence meeting a more stringent wastewater discharge requirements at a more cost effective level is needed and it is important to trace the behavior of dom in mature leachate during various treatment processes in order to uncover the characteristics of leachate dom significant efforts have focused on exploring analytical techniques to characterize these complex compounds lü et al 2009 qiu et al 2020b yuan et al 2017 to date high resolution mass spectrometry hrms is recognized as the most promising analytical method to decipher the complex structure of dom particularly at the molecular level which has been universally employed in the environmental domain rathgeb et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the combination of ultra performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry ultrahigh resolution uplc hrms can provide additional information necessary to dissect dom by accurate separation time and precise m z lu et al 2018 petras et al 2017 this technique has successfully confirmed the fingerprint characteristics of leachate dom collected from different landfill sites qiu et al 2020b and the transformation of fresh leachate dom during simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis qiu et al 2020a therefore it is a proven powerful tool for tracing the transformation of mature leachate dom during treatment processes in the field recently the endeavor of using molecular tools to uncover the characteristics of wastewater dom and to improve the dom removal efficiency gradually shifted from lab scale or pilot scale to field scale processes biological treatment combined with membrane treatment is primary methods utilized for leachate treatment fudala ksiazek et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for example an anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor with nanofiltration process for fresh leachate was examined by wang et al 2020 and membrane bioreactor with reverse osmosis mbr ro process for mature leachate by chen et al 2020 however these previous studies only evaluated the influent and effluent samples of the biological step and the influent and effluent samples of the membrane step therefore this methodology of sampling only the influent and effluent neglects the individual contribution of each unit in the complex biological steps e g anaerobic unit anoxic unit oxic unit mbr unit sludge recycling unit and in the complex membrane step e g nf the tandem of nf and ro typically only direct data mining strategies have been applied which only illustrate the molecular profile of either the influent or effluent dom e g the relative richness and abundance of dom compounds this limited information only provides the quantitative contribution of dom removal via each unit furthermore the molecular changes in dom at the microscopic scale is rarely connected with the macroscopic performance indicated by traditionally bulk indicators like cod which impairs the initial motivation of optimizing process performance through molecular tools therefore by using uplc hrms to investigate the transformation of dom on molecular level along a complex field scale leachate treatment process this study has the following goals 1 to provide a comprehensive report on the fate of dom at the molecular level in each treatment unit 2 to quantify the contribution of each treatment unit in treating dom by applying our previously proposed mathematical method based on the absence presence of dom compounds qiu et al 2020a 3 to monitor the temporal changes of dom in each treatment unit and 4 to determine the performance efficiency of each unit by correlating the bulk indicators with the molecular dom characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation samples marked as t1 t2 and t3 respectively were collected in november 2018 january 2019 and march 2019 from a municipal solid waste landfill leachate treatment facility located in shanghai china the landfill has been in operation for 11 years with a treatment capacity of 2 103 3 103 t d the physical composition of municipal solid waste is listed in table s1 of supplementary information si the workflow of the leachate treatment facility is shown in fig 1 mature landfill leachate from the regulating reservoir rr was subsequently fed to the following reactors primary anoxic zone 1anx primary aerobic zone a 1aer a primary aerobic zone b 1aer b secondary anoxic zone 2anx secondary aerobic zone 2aer ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf the processes also included two backflow settings a primary aerobic zone b recirculation and ultrafiltration recirculation ufr a subscript e was added to the above abbreviations representing the effluent from each reactor e g nfe samples were collected at the process points s1 s10 shown in fig 1 all samples were centrifuged 1000 g 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter whatman uk prior to analysis subsamples of the filtrate used for physiochemical analysis was stored at 4 c the filtrate for dom characterization was stored at 40 c

biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and other ionic compounds cl na k ca2 mg2 were tested according to standard methods apha 2005 suv254 was used as a proxy for dom aromaticity and was defined as the uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm collected a spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan and then normalized by doc besides dissolved organic nitrogen don was defined as dn minus inorganic nitrogen in this study all the indicators were tested in triplicates the results are listed in tables s2 and s3 2 3 mass feature analysis of dom dom was extracted and concentrated in triplicates by solid phase extraction referred to the previous study by dittmar et al 2008 dom extraction recovery rates were calculated according the method outlined in qiu et al 2020b the recovery rates were 68 8 87 8 except for the effluent from nf whose recovery rate was only 29 5 in this study uplc coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry uplc orbitrap ms was fundamental to resolve dom at the molecular level the uplc ultimate 3000 thermo usa equipped with a hypersil gold c18 column 3 μm 100 2 0 mm was combined with an orbitrap mass analyzer q exactive plus thermo usa detailed options of the instrument and methodologies for the uplc and orbitrap mass analyzer are described in qiu et al 2020b 2 4 mining mass spectra data molecular ion peaks acquired from the raw data of mass spectrometry was identified and then annotated using an established software package compound discoverer 3 0 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the methodology for the annotation of the dom molecular formulae followed previous studies qiu et al 2020a qiu et al 2020b after which the dom molecules of samples were filtered with the criteria recommended by qiu et al 2020b and veenaas et al 2018 dom were divided into three fractions resistant dom removal dom and bio derived dom for each treatment unit molecular indexes i e molecular weight mw h c o c modified aromaticity index aimod double bond equivalence dbe nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were expressed as weighted averages of the peak area values and the calculation formula were described in the si with additional details according to the h c and o c values the dom were classified into seven compounds lipids aliphatic proteins lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram likes carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic structure organics and tannin smith et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 details of cutoff restrictions are summarized in the si besides dom molecules also were classified by element composition i e cho chon chos chons the significance of the correlations between the molecular information and bulk indicators were calculated using the pearson and spearman coefficients respectively principle coordinate analysis pcoa and principal component analysis pca was carried out by using molecular abundance and molecular indexes of each sample respectively where the similarities were determined by the bray curtis distance the analysis of divergence on the physiochemical parameters between different samples were carried out using a one way analysis of variance anova the aforementioned statistical analysis was conducted by using the software of r 3 6 1 and matlab r2018a 2 5 calculation of the removal rate of scod and dn among treatment stages the removal rates of scod or dn r scod or r dn were calculated according to the flux of the nitrification recirculation and ultrafiltration recirculation under the actual operating conditions during sampling the calculations were determined using the following equation 1 r scod or r dn q i c i q e c e q i c i q e c e 100 where qi and qe are the influent and effluent flows for each unit m³ d ci and ce are the concentration of scod or dn of the influent and effluent of each treatment unit mg l σ represents the sum of the difference between scod or dn of the influent and effluent of each unit 3 result 3 1 treatment performance of mbr nf for mature leachate in five months as shown in table s2 scod concentrations of the raw landfill leachate varied from 2 261 2 788 mg l while the ratios of bod5 scod were merely 0 07 0 12 indicating its low biodegradability and confirming the stability of the studied leachate the concentration range of nh4 n was 1 176 1 858 mg l and it accounted for more than 80 of dn the removal rates of scod and dn reached 93 0 94 4 and 97 8 98 7 respectively uf played a crucial role in the organic matter removal with its contribution of up to 88 3 94 9 this performance is attributed to the removal by the filtration membrane sludge layer in addition the removal rate of dn by 1anx and 1aer a was 46 8 67 8 and 11 6 23 1 respectively therefore nh4 n was primarily removed by 1anx unit compared with rre suv254 increased from 1 40 1 92 l mg m to 2 59 2 69 l mg m fig 2 b after uf treating and increased by 22 1 45 1 for nfe implying that smaller molecular weight dom had a higher ratio of aromatic organics after treatment in general the values of the bulk indicators tested for the three sampling events over the 5 months were quite similar anova p 0 133 suggesting that the full scale process was operated efficiently 3 2 transformation of dom in each treatment unit mwwa o cwa h cwa dbewa aimodwa and noscwa of rre were all in the range of 236 270 da 0 20 0 37 1 32 1 58 4 46 5 19 0 23 0 29 and 1 43 0 27 respectively tables s4 and s5 as shown in fig 3 from the perspective of molecular abundance based on pcoa analysis dom of the rre were significantly different from the other treated samples permanova r 0 710 p 0 0001 hence both biological and membrane treatment had noticeable impacts on the variance of dom molecules there were no significant differences between the dom from the different biological treatment units i e 1anx 1aer a 1aer b 2anx and 2aer permanova r 0 066 p 0 283 and the biological transformations primarily occurred in 1anx the influent of 1anx included the effluents from rr 1aer b and ufr however 1anxe significantly differed with rre and ufre in term of dom molecular abundance permanova r 0 250 p 0 001 compared with rre and ufre the abundance of lignin cram likes increased by 2 9 14 4 in 1anxe while the abundance of lipids and aliphatic proteins in 1anxe were decreased by 1 1 6 7 and 1 3 8 1 respectively furthermore the dom under the esi mode had a lower h cwa 1 19 1 38 and higher dbewa 5 44 5 91 in 1anxe than rre and ufre indicating dom became more unsaturated and had higher aromatic after microbial degradation lu et al 2018 in contrast dom dramatically changed when going through uf and nf units permanova r 0 463 p 0 001 r 0 540 p 0 001 respectively compared with biological treatment effluents ufe dom had higher o cwa 0 22 0 38 dbewa 5 39 7 36 and lower h cwa 1 26 1 47 taking ufre dom into consideration the distribution of dom subcategories according to formula fig 4 and the van krevelen diagram fig 5 revealed that both the relative abundances of chons type compounds and lignin cram likes in ufe were significantly higher than those of ufre anova p 0 021 anova p 0 037 therefore suggesting that chons type compounds with high aromaticity were enriched via uf when compared to ufe the wmwa of nfe decreased to 222 1 281 6 da o cwa and the h cwa decreased to 0 17 0 33 and 1 19 1 47 respectively while the aimodwa increased to 0 30 0 36 and the relative abundance of aromatics increased anova p 0 045 these trends reflect that the nfe dom had a higher degree of humidification and aligns with the suggestion that nfe dom is typically dominated by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with small molecular weights koch and dittmar 2006 meanwhile the relative abundance of unsaturated hydrocarbons increased significantly anova p 0 002 supporting that nfe dom might be further treated by biological treatment as result of the biodegradable potential of unsaturated hydrocarbons wang et al 2020 3 3 contribution of each treatment unit to dom removal at molecular level in order to elaborate on the contribution of each treatment unit on dom at the molecular level molecular dom were divided into three parts removal resistant and bio derived according to the venn diagram qiu et al 2020a that is removal are the ones who exist in the former unit but disappear in the next unit resistant are the ones who are commonly remaining in the effluent of each treatment unit bio derived are the ones who appear after biological treatment unit as shown in fig 6 a majority of the dom richness was removed by the 1anx unit 55 1 70 0 and nf unit 22 2 26 7 either for the esi or esi mode in the 1anx unit aliphatic and proteins with high h cwa 1 50 1 65 and low o cwa 0 22 0 33 were primarily removed the 1anx unit also removed the high saturated s containing compounds h c 1 5 in contrast the nf unit was also able to remove the low saturated dbewa 6 07 7 75 high wm wmwa 278 4 315 4 da and high n c n cwa 0 11 0 15 dom the overall dom richness was reduced by the remaining biological units i e 1aer a 1aer b 2anx and 2aer and varied from 0 6 to 5 0 the uf unit lowered the dom richness by less than 6 0 but the removal rate of doc reached 89 5 96 7 in the uf unit fig s1 hence it was determined that the dom removed by the uf unit was the key fraction for treatment efficiency which was characterized as high h c 1 53 1 63 and low o c 0 21 0 25 with low aromatic degree although the biological treatment assisted in the removal of dom it also generated new dom specifically bio derived dom the bio derived dom of 1anx unit were the richest accounting for 44 0 54 7 fig 7 a 7 c of the biological treatment stage in terms of number along the biological treatment units the richness of bio derived dom decreased gradually from 1anx unit to 2aer unit approximately 44 4 86 3 of the bio derived dom were composed of cho type and chon type compounds fig 7 b 7 d under the esi mode the relative abundance of heteroatom compounds such as s containing halogenated and phosphorus compounds was up to 24 6 55 6 and can be attributed to landfill leachate and the presence of bioavailable xenobiotic dom from landfilled wastes eggen et al 2010 qiu et al 2020a in addition the lignin cram likes reached over 45 which conforms that the effect of biological degradation is more likely to condense the carbon skeleton and cause the dom to be refractory qiu et al 2020a the whole mbr nf process removed 83 2 92 2 of the dom molecular richness from the mature landfill leachate however there was still plenty of molecular dom in the nfe and approximately 74 1 76 1 of the contribution was from bio derived dom due to microbial metabolism hence the removed resistant and bio derived dom in the nfe was further discussed as fig 8 manifested the number of mw and c atoms of the removed dom were mainly distributed in 284 305 da in 14 15 respectively these values were both greater than those of resistant dom and bio derived dom suggesting that nf mainly removed macromolecular compounds the removed dom also had a higher o c and h c 0 24 0 30 and 1 37 1 49 respectively than the resistant and derived dom o c 0 19 0 28 0 20 0 29 h c 1 33 1 39 1 23 1 35 therefore the removed dom belonged to the lignin cram likes with a relatively high saturation in terms of the nitrogen compounds the n c value of the bio derived dom 0 14 0 17 was higher than the resistant and removed dom 0 07 0 13 0 10 0 13 some literature shows that the dom in the biological treatment effluent mainly include amino acids nucleic acids and other substances hu et al 2019 therefore nf would be unsuccessful at removing organic nitrogen compounds produced by microbial metabolism probably due to the smaller mw as fig 8a shown 4 discussion 4 1 relation of bulk indicators and molecular indexes as a whole the relationship between the bulk indicators and molecular indexes were examined by the pearson correlation fig 9 the result showed that the dbewa and nwa were positively correlated with scod doc and don r 0 041 p 0 831 while being negatively correlated with bod5 r 0 238 p 0 205 it could be assumed that organic matters in the mature landfill leachate were comprised of recalcitrant compounds with high condensation and don was occupied by high nwa compounds with a high degree of unsaturation besides under esi mode suv254 which characterizes the degree of aromatization weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2019 was positively associated with nwa r 0 418 p 0 021 and swa r 0 0 371 p 0 043 this positive association suggests that the aromatics were mainly characterized by n containing and s containing compounds specifically under the esi mode there were significant negative correlations between noscwa an index for redox potential of a given formula qiu et al 2020 with scod doc and don r 0 415 p 0 022 which further confirms that aromatic compounds were present in significant quantities in the organic matters patriarca et al 2018 in addition bod5 had significantly positive correlation with o cwa and s cwa r 0 525 p 0 003 while a negative correlation with mwwa cwa and hwa r 0 574 p 0 0009 these trends imply that the large molecules with a poor hydrogen bond could be utilized by microorganisms but they accounted for less than 15 of the organic matters in the light of bod5 scod 0 12 0 13 the molecular indexes brought more precise and comprehensive information to discriminate between which bulk indicators were responsible for the observed molecular signal 4 2 performance efficiency of each unit by combing quantitative information of both molecular dom and bulk indicators in order to reveal the performance of each unit along the whole process at the molecular level the spearman correlation analysis was further conducted between the dom molecules and quantitative bulk indicators of each unit effluent the quantity of molecules positively relating with scod and doc r 0 p 0 05 was less than the negatively relating ones r 0 p 0 05 fig s2 suggesting that only some compounds contributed to scod and doc as shown in the van krevelen diagrams fig 10 fig 11 this part of dom r 0 p 0 05 which is located in the region of o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 1 2 1 8 were categorized as lipids aliphatic proteins and lignin cram likes the sum of these three categories reaches 79 2 100 in each unit figs s3 and s4 in terms of the process performance scod and doc removal rates of the uf unit were up to 93 0 94 4 and 89 5 96 7 figs 2 a s1 with lignin cram likes and lipids accounting over 45 and 25 respectively figs 12 and 13 for the nf unit the scod and doc removal efficiency were 70 3 78 1 and 92 4 96 6 respectively table s2 where lignin cram likes accounted for 53 3 60 0 figs 12 and 13 in the biological treatment units 1anx unit removed 96 9 98 4 of the molecules positively correlated with bod5 r 0 p 0 05 where lipids aliphatic proteins and lignin cram likes accounted for 19 4 28 4 14 4 19 0 and 43 7 48 5 respectively in addition 92 0 93 5 of the unsaturated hydrocarbons positively correlated with bod5 and their relative abundances were reduced by 5 3 7 7 when treated by the 1anx unit indicating that the unsaturated hydrocarbons could be biodegradable when landfill leachate entered the 1anx unit the don increased from 19 42 mg l to 63 68 mg l and the richness of the dom molecules positively correlated with don increased by 129 7 256 2 the increased don was mainly attributed to the dom transformed by microbial metabolism on the one hand due to the n containing compounds signals being acquired easily under the esi mode cortés francisco and caixach 2013 d andrilli et al 2010 it was determined that the dom was positively correlated with don in the region of o c 0 2 and h c 1 0 1 7 under esi mode taking the don removal efficiency into consideration the uf unit was superior to the others where don decreased from 60 65 mg l to 27 37 mg l don was removed by the uf layer sludge yu 2020 mainly consisting of lipids 23 1 26 4 aliphatic proteins 11 0 20 3 and lignin cram likes 44 2 47 6 the removal efficiency of the nf unit was 57 2 67 1 in the aspect of dom molecular richness r 0 p 0 05 where the relative abundance of lignin cram likes increased by 53 0 54 6 with the don decreasing from 27 37 mg l to 11 16 mg l additionally the dom was negatively correlated with don with mainly low o c 0 2 or high h c 1 7 i e lipids lignin cram likes and unsaturated hydrocarbons they originated from mature landfill leachate primarily more than 95 of which were transformed by microbes but the rest ended in being persevered by nf on the other hand under the esi mode fig 13 lipids were positively correlated with don being transformed into lignin cram likes while the bio derived aliphatic proteins were negatively correlated with don concentrated in the nfe further suggests that it is challenging to remove the aforementioned dom 5 conclusions along the whole biological and membrane treatment train for the treatment of mature landfill leachate dom varied significantly in richness and composition approximately 83 2 92 2 of the dom were removed in terms of richness where the primary anoxic zone accounted for 55 1 70 0 followed by nanofiltration however it is difficult to remove the bio derived n containing compounds generated from the primary anoxic zone lignin cram likes dom with a relatively high saturation were preferentially removed by uf and highly unsaturated and phenolic compound with relatively small mw persisted in the final effluent from nf the relationships between the bulk indicators and molecular indexes along the full scale processes indicated that the refractory dom with a high dbewa were the major contributors to scod and doc in addition it was found that the high aromatic dom with high nwa especially bio derived lignin cram likes seem to be predominant source of don therefore these results suggest that the wastewater treatment processes could be optimized from the following points for example if a wastewater is dominated by highly unsaturated dom a primary anoxic unit plays a vital role to decontaminate whereas for a wastewater rich in lignin cram likes organics uf and nf are necessary to treat such pollutants furthermore when biological treatment units are applied the newly derived

17114,mature landfill leachate contains a substantial fraction of recalcitrant dissolved organic matters dom that is a challenging for conventional wastewater treatment that is typically focused on the removal of biodegradable organic matter biological treatment membrane treatment has been widely employed to treat complex leachate however the performance of each unit based on both conventional bulk indicators and molecular information has not been well understood therefore the fate of dom chemodiversity along the full scale treatment process across ten sampling points over three different seasons were analyzed to determine the efficiency of every unit process with the assistance of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry results showed that the process performance visualized through the molecular signals were relatively stable in the temporal dimension the process removed 83 2 92 2 of dom molecules in terms of richness where lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram likes with relatively high saturation was preferentially removed while newly generated bio derived n containing compounds n cwa 0 15 0 17 became resistant the relationship between conventional bulk physicochemical indicators and molecular indexes suggested that soluble chemical oxygen demand scod and dissolved organic carbon doc were contributed by the refractory dom with high weighted average double bond equivalents dbewa which was distributed in the region of o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 1 2 1 8 this refractory dom required ultrafiltration and nanofiltration for removal dom molecules were positively correlated with five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and revealed that approximately 96 9 98 4 of the dom could be removed or transformed in the primary anoxic zone in addition the bio derived aliphatic proteins lipids and lignin cram likes o c 0 2 with condensed aromatization were the sources of dissolved organic nitrogen don and still remained in the final effluent the present study suggests that the design and operation of the combination process with biological and membrane treatment could be specifically optimized based on the

1 introduction landfilling is a predominate method for the management of municipal solid waste one of the primary issues for landfill operation is the generation of highly concentrated and complex leachate qiu et al 2020b zhan et al 2017 the properties of landfill leachate changes over time usually indicated by a gradual decrease in biodegradability and increase in ammonia nitrogen concentration as leachate transitions from young to mature kurniawan and lo 2009 renou et al 2008 the characteristics of mature leachate i e low biodegradability and high concentration of ammonia nitrogen adds to the difficulty in treating this leachate dissolved organic matter dom is the dominant contributor to total organic carbon of landfill leachate liu et al 2015 lü et al 2009 in addition the composition and characteristics of dom change when undergoing diverse treatment factors affecting effluent quality and subsequently the selection of advanced treatment technologies komatsu et al 2020 tang et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 meanwhile more and more sophisticated combinations of different treatment technologies can be applied raising the question of whether or not such combinations are redundant and too complicated and if the process can be simplified to some extent and still maintain the proper effluent quality hence meeting a more stringent wastewater discharge requirements at a more cost effective level is needed and it is important to trace the behavior of dom in mature leachate during various treatment processes in order to uncover the characteristics of leachate dom significant efforts have focused on exploring analytical techniques to characterize these complex compounds lü et al 2009 qiu et al 2020b yuan et al 2017 to date high resolution mass spectrometry hrms is recognized as the most promising analytical method to decipher the complex structure of dom particularly at the molecular level which has been universally employed in the environmental domain rathgeb et al 2017 wagner et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the combination of ultra performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry ultrahigh resolution uplc hrms can provide additional information necessary to dissect dom by accurate separation time and precise m z lu et al 2018 petras et al 2017 this technique has successfully confirmed the fingerprint characteristics of leachate dom collected from different landfill sites qiu et al 2020b and the transformation of fresh leachate dom during simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis qiu et al 2020a therefore it is a proven powerful tool for tracing the transformation of mature leachate dom during treatment processes in the field recently the endeavor of using molecular tools to uncover the characteristics of wastewater dom and to improve the dom removal efficiency gradually shifted from lab scale or pilot scale to field scale processes biological treatment combined with membrane treatment is primary methods utilized for leachate treatment fudala ksiazek et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for example an anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor with nanofiltration process for fresh leachate was examined by wang et al 2020 and membrane bioreactor with reverse osmosis mbr ro process for mature leachate by chen et al 2020 however these previous studies only evaluated the influent and effluent samples of the biological step and the influent and effluent samples of the membrane step therefore this methodology of sampling only the influent and effluent neglects the individual contribution of each unit in the complex biological steps e g anaerobic unit anoxic unit oxic unit mbr unit sludge recycling unit and in the complex membrane step e g nf the tandem of nf and ro typically only direct data mining strategies have been applied which only illustrate the molecular profile of either the influent or effluent dom e g the relative richness and abundance of dom compounds this limited information only provides the quantitative contribution of dom removal via each unit furthermore the molecular changes in dom at the microscopic scale is rarely connected with the macroscopic performance indicated by traditionally bulk indicators like cod which impairs the initial motivation of optimizing process performance through molecular tools therefore by using uplc hrms to investigate the transformation of dom on molecular level along a complex field scale leachate treatment process this study has the following goals 1 to provide a comprehensive report on the fate of dom at the molecular level in each treatment unit 2 to quantify the contribution of each treatment unit in treating dom by applying our previously proposed mathematical method based on the absence presence of dom compounds qiu et al 2020a 3 to monitor the temporal changes of dom in each treatment unit and 4 to determine the performance efficiency of each unit by correlating the bulk indicators with the molecular dom characteristics 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation samples marked as t1 t2 and t3 respectively were collected in november 2018 january 2019 and march 2019 from a municipal solid waste landfill leachate treatment facility located in shanghai china the landfill has been in operation for 11 years with a treatment capacity of 2 103 3 103 t d the physical composition of municipal solid waste is listed in table s1 of supplementary information si the workflow of the leachate treatment facility is shown in fig 1 mature landfill leachate from the regulating reservoir rr was subsequently fed to the following reactors primary anoxic zone 1anx primary aerobic zone a 1aer a primary aerobic zone b 1aer b secondary anoxic zone 2anx secondary aerobic zone 2aer ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf the processes also included two backflow settings a primary aerobic zone b recirculation and ultrafiltration recirculation ufr a subscript e was added to the above abbreviations representing the effluent from each reactor e g nfe samples were collected at the process points s1 s10 shown in fig 1 all samples were centrifuged 1000 g 10 min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter whatman uk prior to analysis subsamples of the filtrate used for physiochemical analysis was stored at 4 c the filtrate for dom characterization was stored at 40 c prior to analysis 2 2 analysis of bulk physiochemical indicators the analyses of ph electrical conductivity soluble chemical oxygen demand scod dissolved nitrogen dn dissolved organic carbon doc biochemical oxygen demand after 5 days bod5 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and other ionic compounds cl na k ca2 mg2 were tested according to standard methods apha 2005 suv254 was used as a proxy for dom aromaticity and was defined as the uv absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm collected a spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan and then normalized by doc besides dissolved organic nitrogen don was defined as dn minus inorganic nitrogen in this study all the indicators were tested in triplicates the results are listed in tables s2 and s3 2 3 mass feature analysis of dom dom was extracted and concentrated in triplicates by solid phase extraction referred to the previous study by dittmar et al 2008 dom extraction recovery rates were calculated according the method outlined in qiu et al 2020b the recovery rates were 68 8 87 8 except for the effluent from nf whose recovery rate was only 29 5 in this study uplc coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry uplc orbitrap ms was fundamental to resolve dom at the molecular level the uplc ultimate 3000 thermo usa equipped with a hypersil gold c18 column 3 μm 100 2 0 mm was combined with an orbitrap mass analyzer q exactive plus thermo usa detailed options of the instrument and methodologies for the uplc and orbitrap mass analyzer are described in qiu et al 2020b 2 4 mining mass spectra data molecular ion peaks acquired from the raw data of mass spectrometry was identified and then annotated using an established software package compound discoverer 3 0 thermo fisher scientific inc usa the methodology for the annotation of the dom molecular formulae followed previous studies qiu et al 2020a qiu et al 2020b after which the dom molecules of samples were filtered with the criteria recommended by qiu et al 2020b and veenaas et al 2018 dom were divided into three fractions resistant dom removal dom and bio derived dom for each treatment unit molecular indexes i e molecular weight mw h c o c modified aromaticity index aimod double bond equivalence dbe nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc were expressed as weighted averages of the peak area values and the calculation formula were described in the si with additional details according to the h c and o c values the dom were classified into seven compounds lipids aliphatic proteins lignin carboxyl rich alicyclic compounds cram likes carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons aromatic structure organics and tannin smith et al 2013 yuan et al 2017 details of cutoff restrictions are summarized in the si besides dom molecules also were classified by element composition i e cho chon chos chons the significance of the correlations between the molecular information and bulk indicators were calculated using the pearson and spearman coefficients respectively principle coordinate analysis pcoa and principal component analysis pca was carried out by using molecular abundance and molecular indexes of each sample respectively where the similarities were determined by the bray curtis distance the analysis of divergence on the physiochemical parameters between different samples were carried out using a one way analysis of variance anova the aforementioned statistical analysis was conducted by using the software of r 3 6 1 and matlab r2018a 2 5 calculation of the removal rate of scod and dn among treatment stages the removal rates of scod or dn r scod or r dn were calculated according to the flux of the nitrification recirculation and ultrafiltration recirculation under the actual operating conditions during sampling the calculations were determined using the following equation 1 r scod or r dn q i c i q e c e q i c i q e c e 100 where qi and qe are the influent and effluent flows for each unit m³ d ci and ce are the concentration of scod or dn of the influent and effluent of each treatment unit mg l σ represents the sum of the difference between scod or dn of the influent and effluent of each unit 3 result 3 1 treatment performance of mbr nf for mature leachate in five months as shown in table s2 scod concentrations of the raw landfill leachate varied from 2 261 2 788 mg l while the ratios of bod5 scod were merely 0 07 0 12 indicating its low biodegradability and confirming the stability of the studied leachate the concentration range of nh4 n was 1 176 1 858 mg l and it accounted for more than 80 of dn the removal rates of scod and dn reached 93 0 94 4 and 97 8 98 7 respectively uf played a crucial role in the organic matter removal with its contribution of up to 88 3 94 9 this performance is attributed to the removal by the filtration membrane sludge layer in addition the removal rate of dn by 1anx and 1aer a was 46 8 67 8 and 11 6 23 1 respectively therefore nh4 n was primarily removed by 1anx unit compared with rre suv254 increased from 1 40 1 92 l mg m to 2 59 2 69 l mg m fig 2 b after uf treating and increased by 22 1 45 1 for nfe implying that smaller molecular weight dom had a higher ratio of aromatic organics after treatment in general the values of the bulk indicators tested for the three sampling events over the 5 months were quite similar anova p 0 133 suggesting that the full scale process was operated efficiently 3 2 transformation of dom in each treatment unit mwwa o cwa h cwa dbewa aimodwa and noscwa of rre were all in the range of 236 270 da 0 20 0 37 1 32 1 58 4 46 5 19 0 23 0 29 and 1 43 0 27 respectively tables s4 and s5 as shown in fig 3 from the perspective of molecular abundance based on pcoa analysis dom of the rre were significantly different from the other treated samples permanova r 0 710 p 0 0001 hence both biological and membrane treatment had noticeable impacts on the variance of dom molecules there were no significant differences between the dom from the different biological treatment units i e 1anx 1aer a 1aer b 2anx and 2aer permanova r 0 066 p 0 283 and the biological transformations primarily occurred in 1anx the influent of 1anx included the effluents from rr 1aer b and ufr however 1anxe significantly differed with rre and ufre in term of dom molecular abundance permanova r 0 250 p 0 001 compared with rre and ufre the abundance of lignin cram likes increased by 2 9 14 4 in 1anxe while the abundance of lipids and aliphatic proteins in 1anxe were decreased by 1 1 6 7 and 1 3 8 1 respectively furthermore the dom under the esi mode had a lower h cwa 1 19 1 38 and higher dbewa 5 44 5 91 in 1anxe than rre and ufre indicating dom became more unsaturated and had higher aromatic after microbial degradation lu et al 2018 in contrast dom dramatically changed when going through uf and nf units permanova r 0 463 p 0 001 r 0 540 p 0 001 respectively compared with biological treatment effluents ufe dom had higher o cwa 0 22 0 38 dbewa 5 39 7 36 and lower h cwa 1 26 1 47 taking ufre dom into consideration the distribution of dom subcategories according to formula fig 4 and the van krevelen diagram fig 5 revealed that both the relative abundances of chons type compounds and lignin cram likes in ufe were significantly higher than those of ufre anova p 0 021 anova p 0 037 therefore suggesting that chons type compounds with high aromaticity were enriched via uf when compared to ufe the wmwa of nfe decreased to 222 1 281 6 da o cwa and the h cwa decreased to 0 17 0 33 and 1 19 1 47 respectively while the aimodwa increased to 0 30 0 36 and the relative abundance of aromatics increased anova p 0 045 these trends reflect that the nfe dom had a higher degree of humidification and aligns with the suggestion that nfe dom is typically dominated by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds with small molecular weights koch and dittmar 2006 meanwhile the relative abundance of unsaturated hydrocarbons increased significantly anova p 0 002 supporting that nfe dom might be further treated by biological treatment as result of the biodegradable potential of unsaturated hydrocarbons wang et al 2020 3 3 contribution of each treatment unit to dom removal at molecular level in order to elaborate on the contribution of each treatment unit on dom at the molecular level molecular dom were divided into three parts removal resistant and bio derived according to the venn diagram qiu et al 2020a that is removal are the ones who exist in the former unit but disappear in the next unit resistant are the ones who are commonly remaining in the effluent of each treatment unit bio derived are the ones who appear after biological treatment unit as shown in fig 6 a majority of the dom richness was removed by the 1anx unit 55 1 70 0 and nf unit 22 2 26 7 either for the esi or esi mode in the 1anx unit aliphatic and proteins with high h cwa 1 50 1 65 and low o cwa 0 22 0 33 were primarily removed the 1anx unit also removed the high saturated s containing compounds h c 1 5 in contrast the nf unit was also able to remove the low saturated dbewa 6 07 7 75 high wm wmwa 278 4 315 4 da and high n c n cwa 0 11 0 15 dom the overall dom richness was reduced by the remaining biological units i e 1aer a 1aer b 2anx and 2aer and varied from 0 6 to 5 0 the uf unit lowered the dom richness by less than 6 0 but the removal rate of doc reached 89 5 96 7 in the uf unit fig s1 hence it was determined that the dom removed by the uf unit was the key fraction for treatment efficiency which was characterized as high h c 1 53 1 63 and low o c 0 21 0 25 with low aromatic degree although the biological treatment assisted in the removal of dom it also generated new dom specifically bio derived dom the bio derived dom of 1anx unit were the richest accounting for 44 0 54 7 fig 7 a 7 c of the biological treatment stage in terms of number along the biological treatment units the richness of bio derived dom decreased gradually from 1anx unit to 2aer unit approximately 44 4 86 3 of the bio derived dom were composed of cho type and chon type compounds fig 7 b 7 d under the esi mode the relative abundance of heteroatom compounds such as s containing halogenated and phosphorus compounds was up to 24 6 55 6 and can be attributed to landfill leachate and the presence of bioavailable xenobiotic dom from landfilled wastes eggen et al 2010 qiu et al 2020a in addition the lignin cram likes reached over 45 which conforms that the effect of biological degradation is more likely to condense the carbon skeleton and cause the dom to be refractory qiu et al 2020a the whole mbr nf process removed 83 2 92 2 of the dom molecular richness from the mature landfill leachate however there was still plenty of molecular dom in the nfe and approximately 74 1 76 1 of the contribution was from bio derived dom due to microbial metabolism hence the removed resistant and bio derived dom in the nfe was further discussed as fig 8 manifested the number of mw and c atoms of the removed dom were mainly distributed in 284 305 da in 14 15 respectively these values were both greater than those of resistant dom and bio derived dom suggesting that nf mainly removed macromolecular compounds the removed dom also had a higher o c and h c 0 24 0 30 and 1 37 1 49 respectively than the resistant and derived dom o c 0 19 0 28 0 20 0 29 h c 1 33 1 39 1 23 1 35 therefore the removed dom belonged to the lignin cram likes with a relatively high saturation in terms of the nitrogen compounds the n c value of the bio derived dom 0 14 0 17 was higher than the resistant and removed dom 0 07 0 13 0 10 0 13 some literature shows that the dom in the biological treatment effluent mainly include amino acids nucleic acids and other substances hu et al 2019 therefore nf would be unsuccessful at removing organic nitrogen compounds produced by microbial metabolism probably due to the smaller mw as fig 8a shown 4 discussion 4 1 relation of bulk indicators and molecular indexes as a whole the relationship between the bulk indicators and molecular indexes were examined by the pearson correlation fig 9 the result showed that the dbewa and nwa were positively correlated with scod doc and don r 0 041 p 0 831 while being negatively correlated with bod5 r 0 238 p 0 205 it could be assumed that organic matters in the mature landfill leachate were comprised of recalcitrant compounds with high condensation and don was occupied by high nwa compounds with a high degree of unsaturation besides under esi mode suv254 which characterizes the degree of aromatization weishaar et al 2003 zhang et al 2019 was positively associated with nwa r 0 418 p 0 021 and swa r 0 0 371 p 0 043 this positive association suggests that the aromatics were mainly characterized by n containing and s containing compounds specifically under the esi mode there were significant negative correlations between noscwa an index for redox potential of a given formula qiu et al 2020 with scod doc and don r 0 415 p 0 022 which further confirms that aromatic compounds were present in significant quantities in the organic matters patriarca et al 2018 in addition bod5 had significantly positive correlation with o cwa and s cwa r 0 525 p 0 003 while a negative correlation with mwwa cwa and hwa r 0 574 p 0 0009 these trends imply that the large molecules with a poor hydrogen bond could be utilized by microorganisms but they accounted for less than 15 of the organic matters in the light of bod5 scod 0 12 0 13 the molecular indexes brought more precise and comprehensive information to discriminate between which bulk indicators were responsible for the observed molecular signal 4 2 performance efficiency of each unit by combing quantitative information of both molecular dom and bulk indicators in order to reveal the performance of each unit along the whole process at the molecular level the spearman correlation analysis was further conducted between the dom molecules and quantitative bulk indicators of each unit effluent the quantity of molecules positively relating with scod and doc r 0 p 0 05 was less than the negatively relating ones r 0 p 0 05 fig s2 suggesting that only some compounds contributed to scod and doc as shown in the van krevelen diagrams fig 10 fig 11 this part of dom r 0 p 0 05 which is located in the region of o c 0 2 0 5 and h c 1 2 1 8 were categorized as lipids aliphatic proteins and lignin cram likes the sum of these three categories reaches 79 2 100 in each unit figs s3 and s4 in terms of the process performance scod and doc removal rates of the uf unit were up to 93 0 94 4 and 89 5 96 7 figs 2 a s1 with lignin cram likes and lipids accounting over 45 and 25 respectively figs 12 and 13 for the nf unit the scod and doc removal efficiency were 70 3 78 1 and 92 4 96 6 respectively table s2 where lignin cram likes accounted for 53 3 60 0 figs 12 and 13 in the biological treatment units 1anx unit removed 96 9 98 4 of the molecules positively correlated with bod5 r 0 p 0 05 where lipids aliphatic proteins and lignin cram likes accounted for 19 4 28 4 14 4 19 0 and 43 7 48 5 respectively in addition 92 0 93 5 of the unsaturated hydrocarbons positively correlated with bod5 and their relative abundances were reduced by 5 3 7 7 when treated by the 1anx unit indicating that the unsaturated hydrocarbons could be biodegradable when landfill leachate entered the 1anx unit the don increased from 19 42 mg l to 63 68 mg l and the richness of the dom molecules positively correlated with don increased by 129 7 256 2 the increased don was mainly attributed to the dom transformed by microbial metabolism on the one hand due to the n containing compounds signals being acquired easily under the esi mode cortés francisco and caixach 2013 d andrilli et al 2010 it was determined that the dom was positively correlated with don in the region of o c 0 2 and h c 1 0 1 7 under esi mode taking the don removal efficiency into consideration the uf unit was superior to the others where don decreased from 60 65 mg l to 27 37 mg l don was removed by the uf layer sludge yu 2020 mainly consisting of lipids 23 1 26 4 aliphatic proteins 11 0 20 3 and lignin cram likes 44 2 47 6 the removal efficiency of the nf unit was 57 2 67 1 in the aspect of dom molecular richness r 0 p 0 05 where the relative abundance of lignin cram likes increased by 53 0 54 6 with the don decreasing from 27 37 mg l to 11 16 mg l additionally the dom was negatively correlated with don with mainly low o c 0 2 or high h c 1 7 i e lipids lignin cram likes and unsaturated hydrocarbons they originated from mature landfill leachate primarily more than 95 of which were transformed by microbes but the rest ended in being persevered by nf on the other hand under the esi mode fig 13 lipids were positively correlated with don being transformed into lignin cram likes while the bio derived aliphatic proteins were negatively correlated with don concentrated in the nfe further suggests that it is challenging to remove the aforementioned dom 5 conclusions along the whole biological and membrane treatment train for the treatment of mature landfill leachate dom varied significantly in richness and composition approximately 83 2 92 2 of the dom were removed in terms of richness where the primary anoxic zone accounted for 55 1 70 0 followed by nanofiltration however it is difficult to remove the bio derived n containing compounds generated from the primary anoxic zone lignin cram likes dom with a relatively high saturation were preferentially removed by uf and highly unsaturated and phenolic compound with relatively small mw persisted in the final effluent from nf the relationships between the bulk indicators and molecular indexes along the full scale processes indicated that the refractory dom with a high dbewa were the major contributors to scod and doc in addition it was found that the high aromatic dom with high nwa especially bio derived lignin cram likes seem to be predominant source of don therefore these results suggest that the wastewater treatment processes could be optimized from the following points for example if a wastewater is dominated by highly unsaturated dom a primary anoxic unit plays a vital role to decontaminate whereas for a wastewater rich in lignin cram likes organics uf and nf are necessary to treat such pollutants furthermore when biological treatment units are applied the newly derived n containing organics should be taken into accounting declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
