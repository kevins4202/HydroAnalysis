5735,the objective of this study was to examine the impacts of urbanization on gross primary productivity gpp and the interactions between carbon and water fluxes including precipitation evapotranspiration et and water yield q a water centric ecosystem model water supply stress index model wassi that operates at the 12 digit 81 900 watersheds hydrologic unit code huc scale for the conterminous united states conus during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 was used linear regression and causal based models were then applied to identify key factors controlling urbanization impact on gpp simulations of gpp patterns compared favorably with a global 0 05 degree product of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif we found that total conus gpp declined from 8 68pgcyr 1 in 2000 to 8 54pgcyr 1 in 2010 to 8 36pgcyr 1 in 2050 and to 8 13pgcyr 1 in 2100 total gpp decreased from 6 81pgcyr 1 to 6 26pgcyr 1 for those watersheds affected by urbanization 55 000 total conus q increased from 2 03 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2000 to 2 04 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2010 to 2 06 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2050 and 2 09 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2100 while q increased from 1 68 106 million m3 yr 1 to 1 74 106 million m3 yr 1 for urbanized watersheds alone 55 000 although total conus δgpp was less than 0 55pgcyr 1 or 8 large changes δgpp 300 g c m 2 yr 1 were found in 245 1984 and 5655 of the 81 900 watersheds by 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively overall the impacts of urbanization on gpp in the conus were influenced by background climate previous land cover characteristics and the magnitudes of land use change effective integrated watershed management that attempts to minimize the negative ecological and environmental impacts of urbanization must consider regional hydrologic differences and fit local climatic and watershed conditions keywords carbon balance water balance urban sprawl ecosystem model causal analysis 1 introduction urbanized land area accounts for a tiny portion of the earth s terrestrial surface 3 liu et al 2014 but it contributes to 60 of residential water use 78 of carbon emission and 80 of wood consumption for industrial purposes grimm et al 2008 urbanization substantially reduces vegetation cover as urban areas are typically dominated by impervious surfaces rapid urbanization has significantly altered ecosystem functions grimm et al 2008 wu 2014 and threatened ecosystem services such as clean water supply sun et al 2015a climate regulation hao et al 2018 and carbon sequestration cui et al 2017 gross primary production gpp one of the key ecosystem services sun et al 2011b represents the total fixation of carbon by vegetation through the photosynthesis process chapin et al 2002 beer et al 2010 gpp plays a critical role in both the terrestrial ecosystem and global carbon cycles cui et al 2017 sun et al 2018 as estimated by xiao et al 2010 the gpp of the conterminous u s was between 6 91 and 7 33pgcyr 1 extreme climate events and disturbances such as drought and fire reduced annual gpp at regionals scales xiao et al 2011 sun et al 2015c xiao et al 2016 permanent vegetation removal due to urbanization particularly the transformation from rural land uses of agriculture or forestry to urban land uses characterized by large impervious surfaces might also reduce annual gpp sun and lockaby 2012 as evidenced conversions of croplands or grasslands to urban development dramatically reduced ecosystems carbon fixation ability up to 50 liu et al 2018b nuarsa et al 2018 few studies have quantified the impacts of urbanization on gpp zhao et al 2007 existing results are mixed due to the complexity of urbanization and diverse ecosystem responses to urbanization across space in general urban land development has negative effects on gpp at multiple scales mainly due to the decrease in vegetation coverage mchale et al 2017 nuarsa et al 2018 seto et al 2012 sun et al 2019 however positive effects were also observed in some regions previously dominated by crops or deserts buyantuyev and wu 2009 zhao et al 2007 as indicated by miller et al 2018 the urbanization effects vary by biome urban area growth and vegetation change may collectively cause an increase a decrease or no change in gpp of urban ecosystems through time cui et al 2017 our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on the terrestrial carbon cycle is still limited churkina 2008 romero lankao et al 2014 accurate in situ measurements of gpp in urban ecosystems are rare due to the complex urban landscape remote sensing and simulation models have been used to estimate gpp response to human disturbances in various regions gitelson et al 2014 jung et al 2017 monteith 1972 potter et al 1993 running and zhao 2015 sun et al 2011b sun et al 2019 sun et al 2019 categorized these models into four types 1 biophysical process based such as bess breathing earth system simulator and beps boreal ecosystem productivity simulator 2 vegetation indexed based such as vim vegetation indices model and grm greenness radiation model 3 light use efficiency based such as casa carnegie ames stanford approach and ec lue eddy covariance light use efficiency and 4 machine learning based models such as piecewise regression models artificial neural network and random forest however urban areas were usually excluded in regional studies due to the lack of parameters for urban ecosystems e g vegetation cover and type water and light use efficiency and the heterogeneity of urban landscape e g impervious surface buildings vegetation and management cui et al 2017 miller et al 2018 carbon and water cycles are tightly coupled sun et al 2011b sun et al 2019 wu et al 2016 as demonstrated by the close gpp and evapotranspiration et relationships law et al 2002 lei et al 2014 zhang et al 2016a proietti et al 2019 et is a key component of the hydrological cycle and a critical linkage to ecosystem carbon fluxes sun et al 2011a urbanization and climate change affect watershed hydrologic and carbon fluxes mainly through altering the et processes sun and lockaby 2012 indeed the connection between et and gpp has been successfully used to estimate ecosystem carbon fluxes beer et al 2007 sun et al 2011b or water flux zhang et al 2016a at a national scale the present study uses such type of water centric ecosystem model water supply stress index wassi sun et al 2011b to estimate carbon fluxes from water fluxes the wassi model has been widely used to quantify effects of urbanization on water fluxes caldwell et al 2012 and the effects of drought on gpp and water yield sun et al 2015b sun et al 2015c duan et al 2016 we are not aware of previous studies on the impacts of urbanization on gpp at a national level in the u s the overall goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the coupled changes in water and carbon fluxes in the next 100 years under a projected urbanization scenario across the u s such knowledge is essential for managing ecosystems mo et al 2018 and mitigating environmental problems caused by urbanization finzi et al 2011 at a national level the objective of this simulation study was to quantify the responses of watershed gpp et and water yield to urbanization using an integrated model we examined changes in carbon and water under various climate and land cover characteristics and land use and land cover changes lulcc through time at 12 digit 8 digit and 2 digit hydrologic unit code huc watershed scales the u s watersheds are classified using several hierarchy levels where lower hierarchy e g 12 digit are nested within the higher hierarchy levels e g 8 digit 2 digit we hypothesize that responses of gpp to urbanization are not created equal specifically our hypotheses are 1 the decreases of gpp are due to both the urban area growth and reduction in evapotranspiration hypothesis 1 h1 and 2 the magnitude of gpp change varies with background climate i e high precipitation vs low precipitation previous lulc e g grassland shrubland or barren with low biomass and forest with high biomass and the magnitude of lulcc hypothesis 2 h2 2 materials and methods 2 1 water supply stress index wassi model 2 1 1 wassi model description the wassi model sun et al 2011b caldwell et al 2012 was initially designed to estimate water and carbon balances and to determine the watershed water stress and ecosystem responses to changes in climate land use and land cover and human water demand the model simulates key ecohydrologic and carbon fluxes including water yield et and gpp and net ecosystem productivity nep the model has been tested in the u s australia china mexico and african countries for assessing forest management and climate change effects on ecosystem services bagstad et al 2018 duan et al 2016 liu et al 2018a sun et al 2011b for example duan et al 2016 and sun et al 2015b 2015c evaluated the impacts of climate change and drought on gpp and water yield in the u s national forests for water cycle modeling the wassi model simulates surface runoff baseflow et infiltration soil moisture storage and snowpack and melting by integrating built in algorithms from sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma and ancillary data table 1 sun et al 2011b the core of the wassi model is an et model that empirically estimates et as a function of pet leaf area index lai and water availability i e precipitation soil moisture sun et al 2011a as a water centric ecosystem model wassi estimates carbon balance from water fluxes using a water use efficiency wue approach sun et al 2011b gpp is determined as a function of et and biome specific wue that was derived from global eddy flux data gpp wue et sun et al 2011b for urban ecosystems in lieu of a reliable wue parameter wue for savanna ecosystem type reported in sun et al 2011b was used as a surrogate for vegetated urban areas gpp for impervious areas for any lulc type was assumed to be zero the wassi model simulates monthly water and carbon balance for each of the 10 land cover types used in the model and results are aggregated to the watershed level of 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc12 by an area weighted average approach caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b model outputs of et water yield and gpp were summarized to the annual level the 18 huc2 2 100 huc8 and about 81 900 huc12 level watersheds are defined by the watershed boundary dataset sun et al 2011b a few huc12 watersheds that represent coastal watersheds with missing land use data or waterbodies were excluded from this analysis more detailed descriptions and applications for the wassi model can be found in sun et al 2011b caldwell et al 2012 and sun et al 2015b c 2 1 2 wassi model input datasets this study estimated gpp responses to urbanization in recent 2000 2010 middle 2050 and long term 2100 time frame wassi model requires five categories of input datasets table 1 including historical climate of precipitation and air temperature 1961 2010 each of ten land cover fraction and impervious surface fraction within each land cover types in the four studied periods statsgo based soil parameters and mean monthly lai data 2000 2012 by each land cover type caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b the impervious surface fraction or lai for each land cover type was derived by overlaying the impervious surface layer or modis lai layer with the land cover layer the ten lulc categories include deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrubland grassland cropland waterbody wetland urban and barren land however because there is only one category for forest in the iclus datasets we divided the forest fraction equally and reconstructed three forest covers with the same lai value simulations for 2010 2050 and 2100 were compared to those for the baseline year 2000 to determine the impacts of urbanization on gpp and water yield this study does not intend to address ecosystem responses to climate change and therefore a static historical climate 1961 2010 was used for all the simulations similarly we assumed that lai would not change over time and the mean lai dataset 2000 2012 was used for all simulations 2 1 3 wassi model validation the wassi model has been applied worldwide and well validated with hydrologic measurements us caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b sun et al 2016 china liu et al 2013 australia liu et al 2018a rwanda bagstad et al 2018 therefore this study focused on gpp validation using two data sources to ensure the quality of gpp estimates and their potential bias for urban ecosystems because most remote sensing based gpp products do not include urban areas they are not appropriate for model validation purposes thus we validated wassi estimates for gpp using a proxy for gpp the orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 based solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence gosif products studies have found that sif was strongly correlated with gpp measured at flux sites across a wide variety of biomes li et al 2018c in this study we used a global oco 2 based sif product gosif that consists of 8 day gridded sif estimates over the period 2000 2018 li and xiao 2019 gosif was derived from three categories of datasets including sif soundings from the oco 2 data streams from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and meteorological reanalysis data the dataset is proved to be highly correlated with flux tower based gpp estimates li and xiao 2019 as mentioned earlier section 2 1 2 the iclus datasets had only one land use type for forest therefore we used the 2006 national land cover database nlcd for gpp validation the original 16 land cover types for nlcd were lumped into ten types to meet the requirements of the wassi model to be consistent with the nlcd products we used the impervious surface fraction from iclus v2 1 product and lai data products in the same year of 2006 zhao et al 2005 we aggregated the sif data from the gosif product li and xiao 2019 to both huc12 and huc8 watershed levels to compare the mean sif values for 2000 2010 to the wassi gpp estimates in 2006 similarly we compared an upscaled gpp product ec mod xiao et al 2014b with the sif product li and xiao 2019 at both huc12 and huc8 watershed levels the ec mod gpp product was derived from eddy covariance modis and meteorological reanalysis data using a data driven approach xiao et al 2008 xiao et al 2010 and consists of 8 day 1 km resolution gpp estimates for north america over the period 2000 2012 this comparison only applies to non urban areas because urban lands were masked out in the ec mod gpp product xiao et al 2010 2 2 statistical analyses 2 2 1 selection of independent variables based on our hypotheses and previous literature as syakur et al 2010 awal et al 2010 cui et al 2017 miller et al 2018 nuarsa et al 2018 we chose 17 independent variables to examine their influences on the urbanization impacts on gpp these 17 variables were categorized into three groups 1 background climate including precipitation ppt and temperature temp 2 previous land cover characteristics expressed as the area fraction of impervious surface and seven land cover types i e forest cropland shrubland grassland wetland waterbody and urban within a watershed of the baseline year 2000 and 3 land use and land cover change lulcc expressed as the absolute changes of a particular land cover fraction within a watershed from 2000 to 2010 2050 and 2100 all the previous land cover characteristics and lulc changes were denoted by the first three or four letters of the land cover type with the source year or time period attached for example forest fraction in 2000 and its changes from 2000 to 2050 were denoted by for00 and for0050 respectively in addition all the variables were standardized i e mean 0 standard deviation of 1 to eliminate the effects of dimensions for further analyses 2 2 2 interactions between carbon and water fluxes we compared both the spatiotemporal changes of gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et and water yield q for 48 000 55 000 huc12 watersheds impacted by urbanization during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 to assess the interactions of carbon and water fluxes in addition the linear regression of the changes in gpp to changes in et during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 at both huc12 and huc8 scales were further conducted to quantify their interactions 2 2 3 the impacts of urbanization on gpp by linear regression analyses linear regression analyses were used to examine gpp responses to urbanization and associated hydrological change including et testing hypothesis 1 h1 standardized stepwise regression was used to explore the relationships among gpp background climate previous land cover characteristics and lulcc to test hypothesis 2 h2 prior to the stepwise regression analysis collinearity analysis was conducted to remove the independent variables using thresholds of variance inflation factor vif and minimum tolerance values large than 5 or less than 0 2 respectively the importance of independent variables in explaining gpp variations was ranked by the stepwise regression coefficients because the independent variables were standardized 2 2 4 the impacts of urbanization on gpp by a causal model we further used a general causal model the directed acyclic graph dag is absent ida to determine the causation relationship between the change in gpp and the selected environmental factors kalisch et al 2012 because correlations do not necessarily mean causation there are a few established methods such as the structural equation model sem that can be used to identify the causal effect between variables from the observational data grace 2006 however such methods are usually based on an unrealistic assumption that the potential causal relationships between variables are known maathuis et al 2010 unlike the previous mathematical models ida simulates an intervention process of the system and predicts the causal effects of the interventions without such prior causal knowledge maathuis et al 2010 pearl 1995 ida has been well validated for a biological system maathuis et al 2010 and has been applied in many other research fields such as soil contamination liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b and social science morgan 2013 the causal structure identification and causal effect estimation are two modules for ida and are computed with either the peter clark pc pearl 1995 or pearl s do calculus algorithm pearl 2003 the causal structure derived by pc algorithms is explicitly characterized by a network with nodes representing dependent and independent variables and edges direct causals called a directed acyclic graph dag pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the pc algorithms initially identify an undirected graph with nodes and edges and then convert it to a complete partially directed acyclic graph cpdag by d separation pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the cpdag is in the form of nodes and both directional and unidirectional edges based on the conditional independence tests e g gauss ci test at a certain significance level kalisch and bühlmann 2007 kalisch et al 2012 pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the edges are deleted if conditionally independent otherwise they are retained the pc algorithm creates one cpdag and the equivalence class of the dags with the same skeleton v structures and equally valid conditional independence information to characterize the causal structure the arrows might be in different directions in different dags in the equivalence class meaning that the possible causal effect is not a unique value but a set of causes the pearl s do calculus algorithm was conducted on each equivalence class of the dags by either global or local method a multiset of possible casual values was estimated and we used the lower bound of the causal effects as the final results the pcalg package for r version r3 4 2 was used to develop ida kalisch et al 2012 3 results 3 1 validation of modeled gpp the aggregated mean watershed scale ec mod gpp xiao et al 2008 xiao et al 2011 xiao et al 2010 correlated well with gosif li and xiao 2019 at both huc12 and huc8 watershed scales urban area not included r2 0 97 0 98 p 0 05 fig 1 this demonstrates the validity of gosif as a proxy of gpp at the watershed scale we further compared the mean gpp modeled by wassi with the gosif product both including urban areas as indicated by fig 1 our modeled mean gpp was also well collated with mean gosif at both huc12 and huc8 spatial scales r2 0 91 0 96 p 0 05 confirming the strength of the wassi model in modeling gpp for all lulc 3 2 change in urban areas among the 81 900 huc12 watersheds the mean fraction for urban areas ranged from 11 7 to 20 6 in 2000 2010 2050 and 2100 about 30 40 of the watersheds did not show change in urbanization fig 2 we focused on the 48 000 55 000 watersheds experiencing obvious changes in urban growth at both the huc12 and huc8 watershed scales among the 48 000 55 0000 watersheds experiencing urban expansion the urban growth rate increased dramatically over time the mean absolute change in the urban area fraction was 0 05 0 08 and 0 13 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 1 d the number of watersheds with an increase in urban area fraction greater than 0 5 accelerated from 201 during the 2000 2010 period to 777 during 2000 2050 and to 2628 during 2000 2100 fig 2 b similarly mean relative changes in urban area were 148 351 and 712 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 2 e the number of watersheds with a relative urban area increase of greater than 300 increased from 3933 during 2000 2010 to 7830 during 2000 2050 and to 11 963 during 2000 2100 fig 2 b in addition the conus urban area growth was pronounced in the southern u s for areas such as oklahoma ok arkansas ar louisianan la and texas tx fig 2 b 2 c 3 3 modeled change in gpp among the 81 900 watersheds total gross carbon uptake of the conus was estimated to be 8 68 8 54 8 36 and 8 13pgcyr 1 in 2000 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively this represented as a decrease in gpp of 1 61 3 69 and 6 34 in 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively the gross carbon uptake for only urbanized watersheds 55 000 decreased from gpp for the 6 81pgcyr 1 in 2000 to 6 67pgcyr 1 in 2010 to 6 49pgcyr 1 in 2050 and 6 26pgcyr 1 in 2100 with the decrease of 2 06 4 70 and 8 08 in 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively although the impact of future urbanization on mean gpp δgpp was small at the national level large changes δgpp 300 g c m 2 yr 1 were found in 245 1984 and 5655 of the 81 900 watersheds by 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively in contrast the total water yield q at the conus level increased from 2 03 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2000 to 2 04 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2010 to 2 06 1012 million m3 yr 1 in 2050 and 2 09 1012 million m3 yr 1 in 2100 while increased from 1 68 106 to 1 74 106 for only urbanized watersheds 55 000 the gross carbon uptake ability of the conus ecosystems decreased through time and varied spatially among the 18 water resource regions wrrs for example the top four areas with the greatest decreased gpp during 2000 2050 were wrr03 mean standard deviation 11 5 15 6 109 g c yr 1 wrr06 8 8 9 6 109 g c yr 1 wrr08 11 6 16 5 109 g c yr 1 and wrr11 10 3 15 9 109 g c yr 1 in the southeastern u s fig 3 these regions are wet regions with high et due to high precipitation and available energy in contrast to a decrease in gpp these wrrs showed an increase in q the increase in total water yield volume for wrr03 wrr06 wrr18 and wrr12 during 2000 2050 was 10 2 19 8 105 m3 6 8 9 8 105 m3 6 6 13 1 105 m3 and 9 1 21 2 105 m3 respectively due to reductions in et fig 3 changes in gpp and q showed similar contrasting pattern during other two time periods i e 2000 2010 and 2000 2100 not shown the modeled decrease in gpp from 2000 to 2100 varied greatly over the us figs 4 s1 for watersheds projected to increase in urban area total 48 000 55 000 the mean and standard deviations of annual decrease in gpp were 31 0 45 3 67 0 97 3 and 108 6 151 1 g c m 2 yr 1 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 5 a similarly the absolute change in gpp was most pronounced in the southeastern u s and coincided with high gpp values of the baseline year 2000 however the mean relative change in gpp was most obvious in the dry regions ranging from 8 1 to 2 3 figs 5 b s1 3 4 interactions between carbon and water fluxes by model design the carbon gpp and water fluxes et are inherently coupled and thus gpp et and q patterns followed each other closely among the 48 000 55 000 watersheds with urbanization gpp and et generally decreased while q increased during the three time periods fig 6 the top four regions in change in q δq overlapped with regions with decrease in carbon uptake wrr03 wrr06 wrr08 and wrr12 fig 3 similarly the absolute change in et was most obvious in eastern u s with mean annual changes ranging from 2 8 to 11 7 mm during the three time periods figs 7 8 a however the mean relative change in et ranged from 0 5 to 2 1 with high values mainly located in western u s fig 8 b s2 although modeled gpp was estimated to be directly proportional to et by biome in this study the relationship between changes in gpp and changes in et rates were not linear at the watershed level as indicated by the low adjusted r2 values at both the huc12 and huc8 watershed scales during the three time periods fig 9 3 5 relationships between gpp and urbanization 3 5 1 gpp responses to urbanization determined by linear regression models the change in gpp δgpp was linearly correlated with the increase in urban areas at both watershed scales when data were pooled for all time periods r2 0 81 0 94 p 0 05 figs 10 s3 however the impacts of urbanization on δgpp varied greatly among watersheds that have different watershed size baseline land cover background climate and magnitude of land cover change figs 11 13 s4 s6 the δgpp for watersheds at the huc8 scale is larger than that at the huc12 scale the δgpp data for huc12 watersheds were more scattered indicating a higher variability than the larger huc8 watersheds the differences at the two spatial levels suggested that the urbanization effects became more variable as the watershed sizes decreased δgpp values were generally high for the watersheds previously dominated by wetland cropland and forest and urban land compared with those of grassland and shrubland as indicated by the steeper slopes of the relationships fig 11 s4 similarly the mean gpp for watersheds in wet regions was more sensitive r2 0 90 0 94 regression model slope 990 650 than that in dry regions r2 0 78 0 94 slope 547 468 fig 12 s5 as determined by the standardized stepwise regression coefficients the magnitude of urbanization i e changes in urban area and the changes in grassland area were the two most influential factors controlling δgpp during the three time periods fig 13 s6 in contrast background climate and previous land cover types contributed little to δgpp 3 5 2 gpp responses to urbanization as determined by the causal model the ida analysis showed that the changes in urban area from 2000 to 2050 urb0050 and grassland gras0050 were the direct causes of δgpp during 2000 2050 with the causal effect size of 3 72 and 0 55 respectively fig 14 this means that when urb0050 and gras0050 increase or decrease by 1 standard unit δgpp decreases or increases by 3 72 or 0 55 standard unit respectively previous land use types of cropland crop00 and forest for00 and changes in forest for0050 were the indirect causes of δgpp with gpp changes with effect size of 0 06 0 09 and 0 65 respectively although with directed edges to the dependent factor historical climate of ppt and temp and changes in cropland crop0050 and impervious surface imp0050 were not considered as the causes of δgpp due to their small effect size of 0 similarly during 2000 2010 the land use change of urb0010 and gras0010 were the direct and indirect causes of δgpp with effect size of 1 76 and 0 94 respectively fig s7 during 2000 2100 the land use change of urb00100 was the direct cause of δgpp with effect size of 2 96 fig s8 previous land use types crop00 for00 gras00 shru00 urb00 and land use change of crop00100 and for00100 were the indirect causes with effect size ranged from 0 15 to 0 65 fig s8 4 discussion 4 1 complex interactions between responses of gpp and water to urbanization at the watershed scale as expected we found that δgpp closely followed the increase in urban area and the impacts varied across the conus over time wassi appeared to be effective for projecting the negative impacts of urbanization on gpp consistent with what were widely reported by previous individual studies diem et al 2006 imhoff et al 2004 seto et al 2012 trusilova and churkina 2008 the validation of the modeled gpp using the sif product li and xiao 2019 showed that wassi reasonably captured gpp patterns under urbanization the success was presumably because the wassi model considered the key controls on carbon and water balances including climate water energy and vegetation lai wue as identified in recent studies jenerette et al 2009 messori et al 2019 p sun 2019 z y sun 2019 zhou and xin 2019 for example chen et al 2019 identified precipitation temperature and lai as the three key drivers of ecosystem carbon fluxes at a global scale as a water centric model wassi used the same three variables to estimate et a direct integrated variable to estimate gpp however we found that urbanization caused an increase in gpp for 108 297 watersheds mainly in arid or semi arid regions such results were coincided with findings of zhao et al 2007 and buyantuyev and wu 2009 who suggested that urbanization resulted in an increase in vegetation cover due to artificial greening furthermore we found that δgpp varied by watershed size previous land use and cover types and local climate first larger watersheds have larger δgpp than smaller ones because larger watersheds can reduce more vegetation when the urban sprawl rate is equal i e increase in urban area in each watershed area unit however the urbanization effects become more variable as the watersheds become smaller second δgpp was more sensitive for watersheds dominated by wetlands forest cropland and urban land the probable reason was that high water use efficiency wue and change in et for those land covers compared to grassland and shrubland the changes in et for wetlands is the highest among all the land uses due to their high levels of pet and large et reduce capacity when converted to impervious surfaces assumed to be close to zero in this study watersheds dominated by vegetation coverage with deep roots such as forest generally have higher evapotranspiration rates et ppt deng et al 2015 li et al 2018b and the changes in et is relatively high compared to other land use conversions in addition different land uses have various wue cropland forest grassland shrubland savanas and wetland sun et al 2011b thus watersheds dominated by wetland forest and cropland would have higher change in wue or et therefore δgpp as a result of urban area expansion similarly urban dominated watersheds generally have greater urban area growth rates than non urban i e forest shrubland and grassland dominated watersheds and thus have larger δgpp when removing vegetations by urbanization previous studies also found that hydrological responses of urban dominated watersheds were more sensitive to urbanization than the non urban dominated watersheds kumar et al 2018 putro et al 2016 rouge and cai 2014 third δgpp in wet regions was more sensitive to urbanization due to large coverages of forest and wetland in wet regions wet and forested areas had large changes in wue and et when they were converted to other land uses all these results support a previous study conclusion that urbanization effects varied by vegetation type and biome miller et al 2018 the δgpp at the watershed scale did not linearly follow the et changes by lulc as originally surmised the main reason was that the wue gpp et differed among land cover types ekness and randhir 2015 li et al 2018a sun et al 2011b and the watershed land use compositions including impervious surface fraction patters were complex resulting in a nonlinear relationship between et and gpp at the watershed level the complex interactions between carbon and water at a large scale was also noted in cheng et al 2017 they found that the changes in terrestrial carbon uptake did not proportionally follow the changes in et but rather followed changes in wue however the inter annual et gpp coupling in semi arid regions appeared to be rather high biederman et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b 4 2 urbanization impacts across time and space our modeling analysis suggested that both the previous land cover characteristics and historical climate and land cover changes influenced δgpp through time which supported hypothesis 2 among these controlling factors changes in urban area and grassland played the most important role however correlation does not necessarily imply causation the ida results further demonstrated that urban area growth was the direct cause of the changes in gpp through time in contrast previous lulcc of non urban lands were identified as indirect causes of δgpp in general our findings are consistent with previous individual studies buyantuyev and wu 2009 diem et al 2006 imhoff et al 2004 seto et al 2012 trusilova and churkina 2008 the present study represents a novel integration of various findings at a national scale 4 3 implications for watershed ecosystem management this study suggested that that there was a tradeoff between water yield and gpp reduction in ecosystem gpp may cause concerns of organic matter inputs to urban aquatic ecosystems and thus negatively affect fauna habitats biodiversity and aquatic ecosystem productivity sun and lockaby 2012 the increase of water yield from a watershed can be beneficial i e reduced water stress or harmful increased overland flow and stormflow erosion and sedimentation at the national scale carbon water tradeoffs should be considered in developing policies for reducing carbon emission and maintaining stream water supply and water quality for example similar to previous findings boggs and sun 2011 and oudin et al 2018 the wrr03 wrr06 wrr08 and wrr12 in the wet regions in the southeastern u s are projected to have pronounced increase in water yield but large decrease in gpp however the amplification of water quantity by urbanization often causes water quality problems and cautions are needed to consider the likely negative effects of gpp decline sun and lockaby 2012 maintaining forest coverage and thus gpp during urbanization in the watersheds in southeastern u s is essential to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on watershed ecosystem health forest maintenance and restoration is a way in preventing a drastic decrease in gpp nuarsa et al 2018 one important finding from this study and others miller et al 2018 was that the impacts of urbanization on gpp varied among watersheds under different climate and watershed characteristics i e previous land cover type and land use and cover changes therefore effective integrated watershed management strategies must be designed to fit local climatic and watershed conditions 4 4 uncertainty as for any modeling results uncertainty comes from both the model itself and from input data driving the model xiao et al 2014a zheng et al 2018 the wassi model algorithms for estimating gpp is biome based unfortunately very few urban flux sites existed and gpp and et data are limited to derive urban ecosystem wue in this study we lumped three types of forest i e deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest into one category of forest due to the limitation of iclus data we set the same impervious fraction and lai values per land use of the three subtypes of forest thus gpp reported here may have bias for some watersheds either overestimated or underestimated the uncertainty of models could be reduced by improving model inputs such as refined land use and cover and modis based lai datasets as demonstrated by other studies kimball et al 2018 refined land cover and climate dataset inputs increased the accuracy of modis based gpp estimates similarly improved climate data for urban areas will improve modeling result accuracy climate is a key factor controlling et and gpp at a broad scale chen et al 2019 messori et al 2019 and confirmed by the current study however this study mainly focused on the sensitivity of urbanization assuming a static climate conditions through time future climate change including the rise of co2 concentration is likely to affect vegetation dynamics and carbon fixation golladay et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018a et wue and gpp however the climate change projections are highly uncertain and its impacts on ecosystem structure and functions are extremely variable mankin et al 2019 precipitation was found to exert positive impacts on ecosystem productivity in semiarid regions while warming may have negative effects zhao et al 2019 the impacts of climate change and other factors such as nitrogen deposition co2 fertilization and urban heat island effects on wue remains controversial mankin et al 2019 future global climate change and local urban meteorological change such as urban heat island zhou et al 2019 or urban dry island hao et al 2018 may overwhelm the lulcc effects on water fluxes as recently demonstrated by martin et al 2017 at a global scale climate factors including rising co2 temperature and water conditions generally had positive impacts on gpp sun et al 2018 demonstrated that lulcc had a negative impact on global gpp especially in regions with high rates of forest loss which is consistent with our findings thus climate change and lulcc driven by urbanization are often coupled and they should be addressed together to fully quantify the tradeoffs between gpp loss and water yield rise in watersheds 5 conclusions the effects of urbanization on gross primary productivity gpp and water yield across the continental united states conus were quantified by integrating a water centric ecosystem model wassi historical climate 1961 2010 and both historical and projected future lulcc at both 12 digit and 8 digit hydrologic unit code watershed scales we found that the total amount of conus carbon uptake decreased through time and varied across space watersheds with a large decrease in gpp were found in warm and wet regions of the southeastern u s overlapped with regions of large water production the trade offs and coupling between carbon and water fluxes i e gpp et water yield at the watershed level were complex and were affected by climate vegetation structure and watershed landcover compositions in addition the impacts of urbanization on gpp varied among watersheds with different background climate previous land cover types and the magnitude of lulcc lulcc especially urban growth in watershed dominated by urban uses played the most important role in controlling the variations of gpp in future periods water and carbon fluxes are closely coupled and our study supports the hypothesis that gpp responses to urbanization vary across the space through time as affected by water and energy availability we conclude that effective environmental management measures and strategies must be designed to fit regional and local watershed conditions to reduce impacts of urbanization on ecosystems including terrestrial and aquatic components of the watersheds it is important to maintain vegetation covers and hydrological functions in urbanizing watersheds through conserving forests and wetlands or developing other green infrastructure the current study examined the gpp sensitivity to potential urbanization at the concus scale and how this potential change interacted with water availability i e the balance of precipitation and et our study provides a benchmark on the likely impacts of urbanization alone on ecosystem water and carbon fluxes future studies should evaluate urbanization effects under a changing climate because urbanization may aggravate or offset the effects of climate change on gpp depending on future climate and management conditions credit authorship contribution

5735,the objective of this study was to examine the impacts of urbanization on gross primary productivity gpp and the interactions between carbon and water fluxes including precipitation evapotranspiration et and water yield q a water centric ecosystem model water supply stress index model wassi that operates at the 12 digit 81 900 watersheds hydrologic unit code huc scale for the conterminous united states conus during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 was used linear regression and causal based models were then applied to identify key factors controlling urbanization impact on gpp simulations of gpp patterns compared favorably with a global 0 05 degree product of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif we found that total conus gpp declined from 8 68pgcyr 1 in 2000 to 8 54pgcyr 1 in 2010 to 8 36pgcyr 1 in 2050 and to 8 13pgcyr 1 in 2100 total gpp decreased from 6 81pgcyr 1 to 6 26pgcyr 1 for those watersheds affected by urbanization 55 000 total conus q increased from 2 03 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2000 to 2 04 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2010 to 2 06 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2050 and 2 09 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2100 while q increased from 1 68 106 million m3 yr 1 to 1 74 106 million m3 yr 1 for urbanized watersheds alone 55 000 although total conus δgpp was less than 0 55pgcyr 1 or 8 large changes δgpp 300 g c m 2 yr 1 were found in 245 1984 and 5655 of the 81 900 watersheds by 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively overall the impacts of urbanization on gpp in the conus were influenced by background climate previous land cover characteristics and the magnitudes of land use change effective integrated watershed management that attempts to minimize the negative ecological and environmental impacts of urbanization must consider regional hydrologic differences and fit local climatic and watershed conditions keywords carbon balance water balance urban sprawl ecosystem model causal analysis 1 introduction urbanized land area accounts for a tiny portion of the earth s terrestrial surface 3 liu et al 2014 but it contributes to 60 of residential water use 78 of carbon emission and 80 of wood consumption for industrial purposes grimm et al 2008 urbanization substantially reduces vegetation cover as urban areas are typically dominated by impervious surfaces rapid urbanization has significantly altered ecosystem functions grimm et al 2008 wu 2014 and threatened ecosystem services such as clean water supply sun et al 2015a climate regulation hao et al 2018 and carbon sequestration cui et al 2017 gross primary production gpp one of the key ecosystem services sun et al 2011b represents the total fixation of carbon by vegetation through the photosynthesis process chapin et al 2002 beer et al 2010 gpp plays a critical role in both the terrestrial ecosystem and global carbon cycles cui et al 2017 sun et al 2018 as estimated by xiao et al 2010 the gpp of the conterminous u s was between 6 91 and 7 33pgcyr 1 extreme climate events and disturbances such as drought and fire reduced annual gpp at regionals scales xiao et al 2011 sun et al 2015c xiao et al 2016 permanent vegetation removal due to urbanization particularly the transformation from rural land uses of agriculture or forestry to urban land uses characterized by large impervious surfaces might also reduce annual gpp sun and lockaby 2012 as evidenced conversions of croplands or grasslands to urban development dramatically reduced ecosystems carbon fixation ability up to 50 liu et al 2018b nuarsa et al 2018 few studies have quantified the impacts of urbanization on gpp zhao et al 2007 existing results are mixed due to the complexity of urbanization and diverse ecosystem responses to urbanization across space in general urban land development has negative effects on gpp at multiple scales mainly due to the decrease in vegetation coverage mchale et al 2017 nuarsa et al 2018 seto et al 2012 sun et al 2019 however positive effects were also observed in some regions previously dominated by crops or deserts buyantuyev and wu 2009 zhao et al 2007 as indicated by miller et al 2018 the urbanization effects vary by biome urban area growth and vegetation change may collectively cause an increase a decrease or no change in gpp of urban ecosystems through time cui et al 2017 our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on the terrestrial carbon cycle is still limited churkina 2008 romero lankao et al 2014 accurate in situ measurements of gpp in urban ecosystems are rare due to the complex urban landscape remote sensing and simulation models have been used to estimate gpp response to human disturbances in various regions gitelson et al 2014 jung et al 2017 monteith 1972 potter et al 1993 running and zhao 2015 sun et al 2011b sun et

indexed based such as vim vegetation indices model and grm greenness radiation model 3 light use efficiency based such as casa carnegie ames stanford approach and ec lue eddy covariance light use

climate change affect watershed hydrologic and carbon fluxes mainly through altering the et processes sun and lockaby 2012 indeed the connection between et and gpp has been successfully used to estimate ecosystem carbon fluxes beer et al 2007 sun et al 2011b or water flux zhang et al 2016a at a national scale the present study uses such type of water centric ecosystem model water supply stress index wassi sun et al 2011b to estimate carbon fluxes from water fluxes the wassi model has been widely used to quantify effects of urbanization on water fluxes caldwell et al 2012 and the effects of drought on gpp and water yield sun et al 2015b sun et al 2015c duan et al 2016 we are not aware of previous studies on the impacts of urbanization on gpp at a national level in the u s the overall goal of this study was to improve our understanding of the coupled changes in water and carbon fluxes in the next 100 years under a projected urbanization scenario across the u s such knowledge is essential for managing ecosystems mo et al 2018 and mitigating environmental problems caused by urbanization finzi et al 2011 at a national level the objective of this simulation study was to quantify the responses of watershed gpp et and water yield to urbanization using an integrated model we examined changes in carbon and water under various climate and land cover characteristics and land use and land cover changes lulcc through time at 12 digit 8 digit and 2 digit hydrologic unit code huc watershed scales the u s watersheds are classified using several hierarchy levels where lower hierarchy e g 12 digit are nested within the higher hierarchy levels e g 8 digit 2 digit we hypothesize that responses of gpp to urbanization are not created equal specifically our hypotheses are 1 the decreases of gpp are due to both the urban area growth and reduction in evapotranspiration hypothesis 1 h1 and 2 the magnitude of gpp change varies with background climate i e high precipitation vs low precipitation previous lulc e g grassland shrubland or barren with low biomass and forest with high biomass and the magnitude of lulcc hypothesis 2 h2 2 materials and methods 2 1 water supply stress index wassi model 2 1 1 wassi model description the wassi model sun et al 2011b caldwell et al 2012 was initially designed to estimate water and carbon balances and to determine the watershed water stress and ecosystem responses to changes in climate land use and land cover and human water demand the model simulates key ecohydrologic and carbon fluxes including water yield et and gpp and net ecosystem productivity nep the model has been tested in the u s australia china mexico and african countries for assessing forest management and climate change effects on ecosystem services bagstad et al 2018 duan et al 2016 liu et al 2018a sun et al 2011b for example duan et al 2016 and sun et al 2015b 2015c evaluated the impacts of climate change and drought on gpp and water yield in the u s national forests for water cycle modeling the wassi model simulates surface runoff baseflow et infiltration soil moisture storage and snowpack and melting by integrating built in algorithms from sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma and ancillary data table 1 sun et al 2011b the core of the wassi model is an et model that empirically estimates et as a function of pet leaf area index lai and water availability i e precipitation soil moisture sun et al 2011a as a water centric ecosystem model wassi estimates carbon balance from water fluxes using a water use efficiency wue approach sun et al 2011b gpp is determined as a function of et and biome specific wue that was derived from global eddy flux data gpp wue et sun et al 2011b for urban ecosystems in lieu of a reliable wue parameter wue for savanna ecosystem type reported in sun et al 2011b was used as a surrogate for vegetated urban areas gpp for impervious areas for any lulc type was assumed to be zero the wassi model simulates monthly water and carbon balance for each of the 10 land cover types used in the model and results are aggregated to the watershed level of 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc12 by an area weighted average approach caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b model outputs of et water yield and gpp were summarized to the annual level the 18 huc2 2 100 huc8 and about 81 900 huc12 level watersheds are defined by the watershed boundary dataset sun et al 2011b a few huc12 watersheds that represent coastal watersheds with missing land use data or waterbodies were excluded from this analysis more detailed descriptions and applications for the wassi model can be found in sun et al 2011b caldwell et al 2012 and sun et al 2015b c 2 1 2 wassi model input datasets this study estimated gpp responses to urbanization in recent 2000 2010 middle 2050 and long term 2100 time frame wassi model requires five categories of input datasets table 1 including historical climate of precipitation and air temperature 1961 2010 each of ten land cover fraction and impervious surface fraction within each land cover types in the four studied periods statsgo based soil parameters and mean monthly lai data 2000 2012 by each land cover type caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b the impervious surface fraction or lai for each land cover type was derived by overlaying the impervious surface layer or modis lai layer with the land cover layer the ten lulc categories include deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest shrubland grassland cropland waterbody wetland urban and barren land however because there is only one category for forest in the iclus datasets we divided the forest fraction equally and reconstructed three forest covers with the same lai value simulations for 2010 2050 and 2100 were compared to those for the baseline year 2000 to determine the impacts of urbanization on gpp and water yield this study does not intend to address ecosystem responses to climate change and therefore a static historical climate 1961 2010 was used for all the simulations similarly we assumed that lai would not change over time and the mean lai dataset 2000 2012 was used for all simulations 2 1 3 wassi model validation the wassi model has been applied worldwide and well validated with hydrologic measurements us caldwell et al 2012 sun et al 2011b sun et al 2016 china liu et al 2013 australia liu et al 2018a rwanda bagstad et al 2018 therefore this study focused on gpp validation using two data sources to ensure the quality of gpp estimates and their potential bias for urban ecosystems because most remote sensing based gpp products do not include urban areas they are not appropriate for model validation purposes thus we validated wassi estimates for gpp using a proxy for gpp the orbiting carbon observatory 2 oco 2 based solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence gosif products studies have found that sif was strongly correlated with gpp measured at flux sites across a wide variety of biomes li et al 2018c in this study we used a global oco 2 based sif product gosif that consists of 8 day gridded sif estimates over the period 2000 2018 li and xiao 2019 gosif was derived from three categories of datasets including sif soundings from the oco 2 data streams from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and meteorological reanalysis data the dataset is proved to be highly correlated with flux tower based gpp estimates li and xiao 2019 as mentioned earlier section 2 1 2 the iclus datasets had only one land use type for forest therefore we used the 2006 national land cover database nlcd for gpp validation the original 16 land cover types for nlcd were lumped into ten types to meet the requirements of the wassi model to be consistent with the nlcd products we used the impervious surface fraction from iclus v2 1 product and lai data products in the same year of 2006 zhao et al 2005 we aggregated the sif data from the gosif product li and xiao 2019 to both huc12 and huc8 watershed levels to compare the mean sif values for 2000 2010 to the wassi gpp estimates in 2006 similarly we compared an upscaled gpp product ec mod xiao et al 2014b with the sif product li and xiao 2019 at both huc12 and huc8 watershed levels the ec mod gpp product was derived from eddy covariance modis and meteorological reanalysis data using a data driven approach xiao et al 2008 xiao et al 2010 and consists of 8 day 1 km resolution gpp estimates for north america over the period 2000 2012 this comparison only applies to non urban areas because urban lands were masked out in the ec mod gpp product xiao et al 2010 2 2 statistical analyses 2 2 1 selection of independent variables based on our hypotheses and previous literature as syakur et al 2010 awal et al 2010 cui et al 2017 miller et al 2018 nuarsa et al 2018 we chose 17 independent variables to examine their influences on the urbanization impacts on gpp these 17 variables were categorized into three groups 1 background climate including precipitation ppt and temperature temp 2 previous land cover characteristics expressed as the area fraction of impervious surface and seven land cover types i e forest cropland shrubland grassland wetland waterbody and urban within a watershed of the baseline year 2000 and 3 land use and land cover change lulcc expressed as the absolute changes of a particular land cover fraction within a watershed from 2000 to 2010 2050 and 2100 all the previous land cover characteristics and lulc changes were denoted by the first three or four letters of the land cover type with the source year or time period attached for example forest fraction in 2000 and its changes from 2000 to 2050 were denoted by for00 and for0050 respectively in addition all the variables were standardized i e mean 0 standard deviation of 1 to eliminate the effects of dimensions for further analyses 2 2 2 interactions between carbon and water fluxes we compared both the spatiotemporal changes of gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et and water yield q for 48 000 55 000 huc12 watersheds impacted by urbanization during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 to assess the interactions of carbon and water fluxes in addition the linear regression of the changes in gpp to changes in et during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 at both huc12 and huc8 scales were further conducted to quantify their interactions 2 2 3 the impacts of urbanization on gpp by linear regression analyses linear regression analyses were used to examine gpp responses to urbanization and associated hydrological change including et testing hypothesis 1 h1 standardized stepwise regression was used to explore the relationships among gpp background climate previous land cover characteristics and lulcc to test hypothesis 2 h2 prior to the stepwise regression analysis collinearity analysis was conducted to remove the independent variables using thresholds of variance inflation factor vif and minimum tolerance values large than 5 or less than 0 2 respectively the importance of independent variables in explaining gpp variations was ranked by the stepwise regression coefficients because the independent variables were standardized 2 2 4 the impacts of urbanization on gpp by a causal model we further used a general causal model the directed acyclic graph dag is absent ida to determine the causation relationship between the change in gpp and the selected environmental factors kalisch et al 2012 because correlations do not necessarily mean causation there are a few established methods such as the structural equation model sem that can be used to identify the causal effect between variables from the observational data grace 2006 however such methods are usually based on an unrealistic assumption that the potential causal relationships between variables are known maathuis et al 2010 unlike the previous mathematical models ida simulates an intervention process of the system and predicts the causal effects of the interventions without such prior causal knowledge maathuis et al 2010 pearl 1995 ida has been well validated for a biological system maathuis et al 2010 and has been applied in many other research fields such as soil contamination liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018b and social science morgan 2013 the causal structure identification and causal effect estimation are two modules for ida and are computed with either the peter clark pc pearl 1995 or pearl s do calculus algorithm pearl 2003 the causal structure derived by pc algorithms is explicitly characterized by a network with nodes representing dependent and independent variables and edges direct causals called a directed acyclic graph dag pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the pc algorithms initially identify an undirected graph with nodes and edges and then convert it to a complete partially directed acyclic graph cpdag by d separation pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the cpdag is in the form of nodes and both directional and unidirectional edges based on the conditional independence tests e g gauss ci test at a certain significance level kalisch and bühlmann 2007 kalisch et al 2012 pearl 2003 wang et al 2018b the edges are deleted if conditionally independent otherwise they are retained the pc algorithm creates one cpdag and the equivalence class of the dags with the same skeleton v structures and equally valid conditional independence information to characterize the causal structure the arrows might be in different directions in different dags in the equivalence class meaning that the possible causal effect is not a unique value but a set of causes the pearl s do calculus algorithm was conducted on each equivalence class of the dags by either global or local method a multiset of possible casual values was estimated and we used the lower bound of the causal effects as the final results the pcalg package for r version r3 4 2 was used to develop ida kalisch et al 2012 3 results 3 1 validation of modeled gpp the aggregated mean watershed scale ec mod gpp xiao et al 2008 xiao et al 2011 xiao et al 2010 correlated well with gosif li and xiao 2019 at both huc12 and huc8 watershed scales urban area not included r2 0 97 0 98 p 0 05 fig 1 this demonstrates the validity of gosif as a proxy of gpp at the watershed scale we further compared the mean gpp modeled by wassi with the gosif product both including urban areas as indicated by fig 1 our modeled mean gpp was also well collated with mean gosif at both huc12 and huc8 spatial scales r2 0 91 0 96 p 0 05 confirming the strength of the wassi model in modeling gpp for all lulc 3 2 change in urban areas among the 81 900 huc12 watersheds the mean fraction for urban areas ranged from 11 7 to 20 6 in 2000 2010 2050 and 2100 about 30 40 of the watersheds did not show change in urbanization fig 2 we focused on the 48 000 55 000 watersheds experiencing obvious changes in urban growth at both the huc12 and huc8 watershed scales among the 48 000 55 0000 watersheds experiencing urban expansion the urban growth rate increased dramatically over time the mean absolute change in the urban area fraction was 0 05 0 08 and 0 13 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 1 d the number of watersheds with an increase in urban area fraction greater than 0 5 accelerated from 201 during the 2000 2010 period to 777 during 2000 2050 and to 2628 during 2000 2100 fig 2 b similarly mean relative changes in urban area were 148 351 and 712 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 2 e the number of watersheds with a relative urban area increase of greater than 300 increased from 3933 during 2000 2010 to 7830 during 2000 2050 and to 11 963 during 2000 2100 fig 2 b in addition the conus urban area growth was pronounced in the southern u s for areas such as oklahoma ok arkansas ar louisianan la and texas tx fig 2 b 2 c 3 3 modeled change in gpp among the 81 900 watersheds total gross carbon uptake of the conus was estimated to be 8 68 8 54 8 36 and 8 13pgcyr 1 in 2000 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively this represented as a decrease in gpp of 1 61 3 69 and 6 34 in 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively the gross carbon uptake for only urbanized watersheds 55 000 decreased from gpp for the 6 81pgcyr 1 in 2000 to 6 67pgcyr 1 in 2010 to 6 49pgcyr 1 in 2050 and 6 26pgcyr 1 in 2100 with the decrease of 2 06 4 70 and 8 08 in 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively although the impact of future urbanization on mean gpp δgpp was small at the national level large changes δgpp 300 g c m 2 yr 1 were found in 245 1984 and 5655 of the 81 900 watersheds by 2010 2050 and 2100 respectively in contrast the total water yield q at the conus level increased from 2 03 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2000 to 2 04 106 million m3 yr 1 in 2010 to 2 06 1012 million m3 yr 1 in 2050 and 2 09 1012 million m3 yr 1 in 2100 while increased from 1 68 106 to 1 74 106 for only urbanized watersheds 55 000 the gross carbon uptake ability of the conus ecosystems decreased through time and varied spatially among the 18 water resource regions wrrs for example the top four areas with the greatest decreased gpp during 2000 2050 were wrr03 mean standard deviation 11 5 15 6 109 g c yr 1 wrr06 8 8 9 6 109 g c yr 1 wrr08 11 6 16 5 109 g c yr 1 and wrr11 10 3 15 9 109 g c yr 1 in the southeastern u s fig 3 these regions are wet regions with high et due to high precipitation and available energy in contrast to a decrease in gpp these wrrs showed an increase in q the increase in total water yield volume for wrr03 wrr06 wrr18 and wrr12 during 2000 2050 was 10 2 19 8 105 m3 6 8 9 8 105 m3 6 6 13 1 105 m3 and 9 1 21 2 105 m3 respectively due to reductions in et fig 3 changes in gpp and q showed similar contrasting pattern during other two time periods i e 2000 2010 and 2000 2100 not shown the modeled decrease in gpp from 2000 to 2100 varied greatly over the us figs 4 s1 for watersheds projected to increase in urban area total 48 000 55 000 the mean and standard deviations of annual decrease in gpp were 31 0 45 3 67 0 97 3 and 108 6 151 1 g c m 2 yr 1 during 2000 2010 2000 2050 and 2000 2100 respectively fig 5 a similarly the absolute change in gpp was most pronounced in the southeastern u s and coincided with high gpp values of the baseline year 2000 however the mean relative change in gpp was most obvious in the dry regions ranging from 8 1 to 2 3 figs 5 b s1 3 4 interactions between carbon and water fluxes by model design the carbon gpp and water fluxes et are inherently coupled and thus gpp et and q patterns followed each other closely among the 48 000 55 000 watersheds with urbanization gpp and et generally decreased while q increased during the three time periods fig 6 the top four regions in change in q δq overlapped with regions with decrease in carbon uptake wrr03 wrr06 wrr08 and wrr12 fig 3 similarly the absolute change in et was most obvious in eastern u s with mean annual changes ranging from 2 8 to 11 7 mm during the three time periods figs 7 8 a however the mean relative change in et ranged from 0 5 to 2 1 with high values mainly located in western u s fig 8 b s2 although modeled gpp was estimated to be directly proportional to et by biome in this study the relationship between changes in gpp and changes in et rates were not linear at the watershed level as indicated by the low adjusted r2 values at both the huc12 and huc8 watershed scales during the three time periods fig 9 3 5 relationships between gpp and urbanization 3 5 1 gpp responses to urbanization determined by linear regression models the change in gpp δgpp was linearly correlated with the increase in urban areas at both watershed scales when data were pooled for all time periods r2 0 81 0 94 p 0 05 figs 10 s3 however the impacts of urbanization on δgpp varied greatly among watersheds that have different watershed size baseline land cover background climate and magnitude of land cover change figs 11 13 s4 s6 the δgpp for watersheds at the huc8 scale is larger than that at the huc12 scale the δgpp data for huc12 watersheds were more scattered indicating a higher variability than the larger huc8 watersheds the differences at the two spatial levels suggested that the urbanization effects became more variable as the watershed sizes decreased δgpp values were generally high for the watersheds previously dominated by wetland cropland and forest and urban land compared with those of grassland and shrubland as indicated by the steeper slopes of the relationships fig 11 s4 similarly the mean gpp for watersheds in wet regions was more sensitive r2 0 90 0 94 regression model slope 990 650 than that in dry regions r2 0 78 0 94 slope 547 468 fig 12 s5 as determined by the standardized stepwise regression coefficients the magnitude of urbanization i e changes in urban area and the changes in grassland area were the two most influential factors controlling δgpp during the three time periods fig 13 s6 in contrast background climate and previous land cover types contributed little to δgpp 3 5 2 gpp responses to urbanization as determined by the causal model the ida analysis showed that the changes in urban area from 2000 to 2050 urb0050 and grassland gras0050 were the direct causes of δgpp during 2000 2050 with the causal effect size of 3 72 and 0 55 respectively fig 14 this means that when urb0050 and gras0050 increase or decrease by 1 standard unit δgpp decreases or increases by 3 72 or 0 55 standard unit respectively previous land use types of cropland crop00 and forest for00 and changes in forest for0050 were the indirect causes of δgpp with gpp changes with effect size of 0 06 0 09 and 0 65 respectively although with directed edges to the dependent factor historical climate of ppt and temp and changes in cropland crop0050 and impervious surface imp0050 were not considered as the causes of δgpp due to their small effect size of 0 similarly during 2000 2010 the land use change of urb0010 and gras0010 were the direct and indirect causes of δgpp with effect size of 1 76 and 0 94 respectively fig s7 during 2000 2100 the land use change of urb00100 was the direct cause of δgpp with effect size of 2 96 fig s8 previous land use types crop00 for00 gras00 shru00 urb00 and land use change of crop00100 and for00100 were the indirect causes with effect size ranged from 0 15 to 0 65 fig s8 4 discussion 4 1 complex interactions between responses of gpp and water to urbanization at the watershed scale as expected we found that δgpp closely followed the increase in urban area and the impacts varied across the conus over time wassi appeared to be effective for projecting the negative impacts of urbanization on gpp consistent with what were widely reported by previous individual studies diem et al 2006 imhoff et al 2004 seto et al 2012 trusilova and churkina 2008 the validation of the modeled gpp using the sif product li and xiao 2019 showed that wassi reasonably captured gpp patterns under urbanization the success was presumably because the wassi model considered the key controls on carbon and water balances including climate water energy and vegetation lai wue as identified in recent studies jenerette et al 2009 messori et al 2019 p sun 2019 z y sun 2019 zhou and xin 2019 for example chen et al 2019 identified precipitation temperature and lai as the three key drivers of ecosystem carbon fluxes at a global scale as a water centric model wassi used the same three variables to estimate et a direct integrated variable to estimate gpp however we found that urbanization caused an increase in gpp for 108 297 watersheds mainly in arid or semi arid regions such results were coincided with findings of zhao et al 2007 and buyantuyev and wu 2009 who suggested that urbanization resulted in an increase in vegetation cover due to artificial greening furthermore we found that δgpp varied by watershed size previous land use and cover types and local climate first larger watersheds have larger δgpp than smaller ones because larger watersheds can reduce more vegetation when the urban sprawl rate is equal i e increase in urban area in each watershed area unit however the urbanization effects become more variable as the watersheds become smaller second δgpp was more sensitive for watersheds dominated by wetlands forest cropland and urban land the probable reason was that high water use efficiency wue and change in et for those land covers compared to grassland and shrubland the changes in et for wetlands is the highest among all the land uses due to their high levels of pet and large et reduce capacity when converted to impervious surfaces assumed to be close to zero in this study watersheds dominated by vegetation coverage with deep roots such as forest generally have higher evapotranspiration rates et ppt deng et al 2015 li et al 2018b and the changes in et is relatively high compared to other land use conversions in addition different land uses have various wue cropland forest grassland shrubland savanas and wetland sun et al 2011b thus watersheds dominated by wetland forest and cropland would have higher change in wue or et therefore δgpp as a result of urban area expansion similarly urban dominated watersheds generally have greater urban area growth rates than non urban i e forest shrubland and grassland dominated watersheds and thus have larger δgpp when removing vegetations by urbanization previous studies also found that hydrological responses of urban dominated watersheds were more sensitive to urbanization than the non urban dominated watersheds kumar et al 2018 putro et al 2016 rouge and cai 2014 third δgpp in wet regions was more sensitive to urbanization due to large coverages of forest and wetland in wet regions wet and forested areas had large changes in wue and et when they were converted to other land uses all these results support a previous study conclusion that urbanization effects varied by vegetation type and biome miller et al 2018 the δgpp at the watershed scale did not linearly follow the et changes by lulc as originally surmised the main reason was that the wue gpp et differed among land cover types ekness and randhir 2015 li et al 2018a sun et al 2011b and the watershed land use compositions including impervious surface fraction patters were complex resulting in a nonlinear relationship between et and gpp at the watershed level the complex interactions between carbon and water at a large scale was also noted in cheng et al 2017 they found that the changes in terrestrial carbon uptake did not proportionally follow the changes in et but rather followed changes in wue however the inter annual et gpp coupling in semi arid regions appeared to be rather high biederman et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b 4 2 urbanization impacts across time and space our modeling analysis suggested that both the previous land cover characteristics and historical climate and land cover changes influenced δgpp through time which supported hypothesis 2 among these controlling factors changes in urban area and grassland played the most important role however correlation does not necessarily imply causation the ida results further demonstrated that urban area growth was the direct cause of the changes in gpp through time in contrast previous lulcc of non urban lands were identified as indirect causes of δgpp in general our findings are consistent with previous individual studies buyantuyev and wu 2009 diem et al 2006 imhoff et al 2004 seto et al 2012 trusilova and churkina 2008 the present study represents a novel integration of various findings at a national scale 4 3 implications for watershed ecosystem management this study suggested that that there was a tradeoff between water yield and gpp reduction in ecosystem gpp may cause concerns of organic matter inputs to urban aquatic ecosystems and thus negatively affect fauna habitats biodiversity and aquatic ecosystem productivity sun and lockaby 2012 the increase of water yield from a watershed can be beneficial i e reduced water stress or harmful increased overland flow and stormflow erosion and sedimentation at the national scale carbon water tradeoffs should be considered in developing policies for reducing carbon emission and maintaining stream water supply and water quality for example similar to previous findings boggs and sun 2011 and oudin et al 2018 the wrr03 wrr06 wrr08 and wrr12 in the wet regions in the southeastern u s are projected to have pronounced increase in water yield but large decrease in gpp however the amplification of water quantity by urbanization often causes water quality problems and cautions are needed to consider the likely negative effects of gpp decline sun and lockaby 2012 maintaining forest coverage and thus gpp during urbanization in the watersheds in southeastern u s is essential to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on watershed ecosystem health forest maintenance and restoration is a way in preventing a drastic decrease in gpp nuarsa et al 2018 one important finding from this study and others miller et al 2018 was that the impacts of urbanization on gpp varied among watersheds under different climate and watershed characteristics i e previous land cover type and land use and cover changes therefore effective integrated watershed management strategies must be designed to fit local climatic and watershed conditions 4 4 uncertainty as for any modeling results uncertainty comes from both the model itself and from input data driving the model xiao et al 2014a zheng et al 2018 the wassi model algorithms for estimating gpp is biome based unfortunately very few urban flux sites existed and gpp and et data are limited to derive urban ecosystem wue in this study we lumped three types of forest i e deciduous forest evergreen forest mixed forest into one category of forest due to the limitation of iclus data we set the same impervious fraction and lai values per land use of the three subtypes of forest thus gpp reported here may have bias for some watersheds either overestimated or underestimated the uncertainty of models could be reduced by improving model inputs such as refined land use and cover and modis based lai datasets as demonstrated by other studies kimball et al 2018 refined land cover and climate dataset inputs increased the accuracy of modis based gpp estimates similarly improved climate data for urban areas will improve modeling result accuracy climate is a key factor controlling et and gpp at a broad scale chen et al 2019 messori et al 2019 and confirmed by the current study however this study mainly focused on the sensitivity of urbanization assuming a static climate conditions through time future climate change including the rise of co2 concentration is likely to affect vegetation dynamics and carbon fixation golladay et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2018a et wue and gpp however the climate change projections are highly uncertain and its impacts on ecosystem structure and functions are extremely variable mankin et al 2019 precipitation was found to exert positive impacts on ecosystem productivity in semiarid regions while warming may have negative effects zhao et al 2019 the impacts of climate change and other factors such as nitrogen deposition co2 fertilization and urban heat island effects on wue remains controversial mankin et al 2019 future global climate change and local urban meteorological change such as urban heat island zhou et al 2019 or urban dry island hao et al 2018 may overwhelm the lulcc effects on water fluxes as recently demonstrated by martin et al 2017 at a global scale climate factors including rising co2 temperature and water conditions generally had positive impacts on gpp sun et al 2018 demonstrated that lulcc had a negative impact on global gpp especially in regions with high rates of forest loss which is consistent with our findings thus climate change and lulcc driven by urbanization are often coupled and they should be addressed together to fully quantify the tradeoffs between gpp loss and water yield rise in watersheds 5 conclusions the effects of urbanization on gross primary productivity gpp and water yield across the continental united states conus were quantified by integrating a water centric ecosystem model wassi historical climate 1961 2010 and both historical and projected future lulcc at both 12 digit and 8 digit hydrologic unit code watershed scales we found that the total amount of conus carbon uptake decreased through time and varied across space watersheds with a large decrease in gpp were found in warm and wet regions of the southeastern u s overlapped with regions of large water production the trade offs and coupling between carbon and water fluxes i e gpp et water yield at the watershed level were complex and were affected by climate vegetation structure and watershed landcover compositions in addition the impacts of urbanization on gpp varied among watersheds with different background climate previous land cover types and the magnitude of lulcc lulcc especially urban growth in watershed dominated by urban uses played the most important role in controlling the variations of gpp in future periods water and carbon fluxes are closely coupled and our study supports the hypothesis that gpp responses to urbanization vary across the space through time as affected by water and energy availability we conclude that effective environmental management measures and strategies must be designed to fit regional and local watershed conditions to reduce impacts of urbanization on ecosystems including terrestrial and aquatic components of the watersheds it is important to maintain vegetation covers and hydrological functions in urbanizing watersheds through conserving forests and wetlands or developing other green infrastructure the current study examined the gpp sensitivity to potential urbanization at the concus scale and how this potential change interacted with water availability i e the balance of precipitation and et our study provides a benchmark on the likely impacts of urbanization alone on ecosystem water and carbon fluxes future studies should evaluate urbanization effects under a changing climate because urbanization may aggravate or offset the effects of climate change on gpp depending on future climate and management conditions credit authorship contribution

5736,protecting flood prone locations through floodwater recharge of the depleted aquifers and using it for protecting dry season irrigated agriculture is the rationale for a form of intervention termed as underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi this helps reduce the intensity of seasonal floods by tapping and storing excess floodwater in aquifers for productive agricultural use this paper presents a case study of managing the recharge interventions in the context of the ramganga basin india using a case study approach this study determines the socio economic and institutional context of the study area proposes three potential routes to institutionalize utfi and provides insights for scaling up the interventions in the ganges and other river basins that face seasonal floods and dry season water shortages managing the interventions involves community participation in regular operations and maintenance tasks given the limited scale of the pilot utfi intervention implemented to date and the socio economic and institutional context of the case study region the benefits are not conspicuous though the piloting helped in identifying potential ways forward for the long term management of the pilot site and for scaling up the interventions initially pilot site management was handled by the project team working closely with the community leaders and villagers as the intervention was demonstrated to perform effectively management was handed over to the district authorities after providing appropriate training to the government personnel to manage the system and liaise with the local community to ensure the site is operated and managed appropriately the district administration is willing to support utfi by pooling money from different sources and routing them through the sub district administration while this is working in the short term the paper outlines a programmatic longer term approach for wider replication keywords floods droughts groundwater management institution ganges basin india 1 introduction managing supply and demand of water resources are amongst the most critical policy issues the need for greater action in this domain is becoming more pressing as communities are increasingly experiencing water stress related to scarcity drought as well as excess flood in most river basins these situations of water scarcity and abundance coexist although they are divided by time and or space molden et al 2014 nepal santosh et al 2014 protecting flood prone locations through flood water recharge of the depleted aquifers and using it for protecting dry season agriculture is termed as underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi pavelic et al 2012 utfi is an improvised version of implementing managed aquifer recharge mar methods such as ganges water machine gwm pumping along canals pac and distributed pumping and recharge dpr khan et al 2014 utfi fosters mar mechanisms while pumping is distributed across irrigated crop locations and it promotes the much needed conjunctive use and management of water resources pavelic et al 2012 utfi helps in reducing the intensity of seasonal floods by tapping and storing excess flood waters in aquifers for productive agricultural use 1 1 the concept utfi is an intervention applicable at the watershed or basin level that is prone to both floods and droughts 1 1 while a number of river basins are suitable for utfi interventions assessments for potential utfi interventions are carried out for ganges basin in india and chao phraya in thailand and this study is considering ganges basin utfi interventions utfi in terms of the individual physical components is not necessarily new although the approach is the origins of the utfi approach emerged as a spinoff from a pilot scale mar trial conducted in a sub basin of the chao phraya river basin thailand pavelic et al 2012 utfi adds new value to often ad hoc mar efforts and puts it into a larger scale perspective that offers a wider range of benefits and potentially provides net benefits for both upstream and downstream communities central to utfi is dispersing recharge enhancing interventions across strategic parts of the basin to provide supplies to meet additional dry season demand for this water recovered via agricultural wells rather than allowing surface water to concentrate and be problematic in the floodplain areas however this not to undermine the benefits from floods in specific cases viz soil improvement aquaculture etc 1 2 geohydrological aspects 2 2 for details on technical aspects please see pavelic et al 2015 the use of surface structures fig 1 such as infiltration basins that are easy to construct and maintain are preferable to deep infiltration systems such as recharge wells pavelic et al 2015 whilst this will preclude the potential for utfi in some hydrogeological settings due to low permeability soil layers or poor surficial aquifers sites can be identified where conditions are most suitable factors like the extent of flooding area quantity of water that can be tapped nature and size of aquifers hard rock alluvial or deep shallow etc and their connectivity to the land surface determine the type of interventions required ponds check dams recharge wells bunding etc in the pilot site fig 1 ten recharge wells 25 30 m deep were drilled into the base of a village pond 75 m 35 m situated adjacent to an irrigation canal the aquifer type is a fine medium quaternary alluvium pavelic et al forthcoming 1 3 managing utfi the physical infrastructure associated with utfi needs to be maintained thus utfi requires a unified approach that considers both supply and demand side management the supply side involves creating and maintaining the mar infrastructure at scale while the demand side includes incentives to achieve widespread participation of farmers and institutional arrangements that will sustainably govern the groundwater resources and the infrastructure in the long run given the scale of seasonal flooding as well as the size of the communities that are affected utfi interventions need to be implemented at scale in order to be effective and provide tangible benefits this paper presents a case study of managing the recharge interventions in the context of ramganga sub basin of gangetic basin india the case study presented here provides insights for scaling up the interventions in the ganges and other river basins that face seasonal floods and dry season water shortages 2 objectives and approach utfi as a total package deals with conjunctive water resources management with specific foci in floods surface water and groundwater resources while some supportive elements may be present a unified framework is lacking for the implementation of utfi at scale in south asian countries using the case study approach this paper provides a practical approach for managing utfi interventions given the existing socioeconomic environmental institutional and policy environment in the study region specific objectives are to 1 assess the relevant institutional approaches to utfi particularly from a regional context 2 assess the existing socioeconomic institutional dynamics and potential for changes to suite utfi management in the study region and 3 suggest potentially viable governance arrangements and policies for utfi implementation in the short as well as medium to long term utfi infrastructure is established in the jiwai jadid village situated in rampur district uttar pradesh however socio economic and livelihood analysis of other villages that have utfi potential and are likely to get the infrastructure later has been conducted these other villages are spread over the sub basin covering upstream and downstream locations fig 2 the intention is to understand the broader context by including the ongoing pilot village jiwai jadid as well as future villages where there is potential for utfi intervention this would provide scientific and robust basis for assessment besides the information from some of the villages could be used for comparing sites with and without utfi interventions for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation though attribution could be a problem due to time dependent effects 2 1 approach the study was carried out within the context of the flood prone region of the ramganga sub basin of ganges basin located in the rampur district of uttar pradesh state in india the study was conducted at three levels viz district village and household primary and secondary data was used to assess the flood related aspects and groundwater across locations and socioeconomic groups primary data was collected at the community and household level the focus was on socioeconomic livelihoods and institutional aspects related to utfi interventions while the secondary information at the district level was gathered on the incidence of flooding and its impacts mainly from the disaster management department village level data was drawn from the 2011 census of india and from household surveys based on their suitability for utfi ten sample villages were selected to conduct further analysis six of these villages representing upstream locations and four downstream within the sub basin table 1 both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to elicit information at the village community and household levels as part of qualitative research key informant interviews kii and focus group discussions fgds were conducted kiis were conducted with village pradhan and other elderly and knowledgeable people and also officials from the revenue irrigation and rural development departments fgds were conducted in all the villages in order to identify and assess the community s priorities and perceptions about floods groundwater and the management of utfi these groups include agricultural labourers small and marginal farmers medium and large farmers and also women and mixed groups a total of 21 14 7 fgds and 33 14 19 kiis were conducted semi structured interviews were conducted during first and second rounds of field work respectively with three main stakeholder groups i e i jiwai jadid community ii members of jiwai jadid gram panchayat of the panchayati raj institutional system 3 3 a system of local self governance in india wherein the gram panchayats are the basic units of local administration from now on referred to as panchayat and iii block and district level officials that are responsible for the whole of rampur district milak block where jiwai jadid falls under as well as block development officers bdo from three other blocks that are suitable for utfi implementation qualitative data from the semi structured interviews was used to understand the post implementation perceptions on the post project situation and assess the scope for institutionalizing utfi as part of the quantitative research a structured household questionnaire was canvassed from around 30 households from each sample village i e a total of 302 households table 1 the sample was drawn purposively to represent all the socioeconomic groups in the village while social categories were followed as per local norms households owning up to 5 acres of land were categorised as small and marginal farmers smf and those owning more than 5 acres were categorised as large and medium farmers lmf care was taken to include households that are both vulnerable and not vulnerable to flooding the questionnaire was designed to capture demographic institutional socioeconomic livelihood flood and groundwater related aspects and simple cross tabulation was used to analyse the quantitative data at household level the data collection was conducted in three phases november 2015 winter and march 2016 pre summer when the baseline assessment was carried out to assess the socioeconomic and institutional status and the potential for scaling up utfi in the basin for the purpose of deeper understanding a revisit to the sample sites was conducted during june 2017 summer and additional interviews were conducted in jiwai jadid pilot village between march pre summer and september 2018 monsoon this qualitative and quantitative analysis forms the basis for arriving at the institutional framework for managing utfi in the long run 3 institutional prerequisites and instruments utfi interventions are derived from and have strong overlap with those adopted under watershed development wsd and mar and have direct linkages to flood mitigation fm while mar interventions primarily address groundwater recharge wsd and fm interventions address runoff control soil moisture conservation and surface water management as well as groundwater recharge all three interventions are land based requiring allocation of land private or public ideally in a contiguous manner 4 4 it may be noted that land based interventions have implications for equity as land distribution is skewed all three are integral to utfi though the location of specific interventions varies fig 3 utfi interventions result in direct and indirect benefits depending on the location downstream locations a and b in fig 3 benefit directly from flood mitigation through mar and fm interventions similarly upstream locations c in fig 3 benefit directly from groundwater recharge through watershed and mar interventions there is also a need for interventions in high slopes and forests d in fig 3 the extent of benefits and costs of interventions however vary between locations there could be indirect beneficiaries who benefit from the positive externalities of these interventions though these interventions are appropriate at a basin sub basin scale the scale of the pilot is much smaller involvement and participation of local communities is critical for the success and sustainability of these interventions more importantly location of interventions and location of benefits do not overlap clearly i e interventions made by one community may also benefit some other community located elsewhere leading to spatial inequity even within the community the benefits may not be distributed equally for instance benefits from a recharge structure may accrue more to a farmer situated nearby or to a large farmer more than a small farmer as the former is capable of installing a bore well and deepening it early on which would have been dry in the absence of a recharge structure ratna 2005 thus from an institutional perspective the enabling conditions or prerequisites for implementing utfi include a widespread environmental services associated with the interventions b clear identification of the beneficiaries users and providers sellers of these services c clear identification of the number of communities or stakeholders that are involved in the process and extent of area to be covered d favourable benefit cost ratio 5 5 b c ratio can be calculated using the benefit flows from flood mitigation improved access to irrigation during summer and other ecosystem services and cost of utfi infrastructure and its maintenance for the interventions e appropriate mechanisms policy and practice that ensure sustainability of these interventions and equitable distribution of the costs and benefits though achieving equity is a difficult proposition especially in the context of land based interventions compensation principles could be used to ensure equity f widespread community participation for sustaining the institutions in the long run b downstream location with high flood intensity where utfi irrigation management and managed aquifer recharge interventions reduce flood intensity irrigation and groundwater departments are the major stake holders c upstream location where utfi watershed interventions would help recharge groundwater and reduce flood intensity down stream groundwater and rural development agriculture departments are the major stakeholders d forest areas in upstream with forest management interventions to reduce flood intensity forest department is the main stakeholder the existing institutional approaches and instruments adopted in natural resource management nrm in the south asian context will form the basis for utfi institutional framework prioritising the approaches and instruments that are readily acceptable at the community as well as policy level low hanging fruits will become part of the institutional frame in terms of the specific aspects of utfi the institutional approaches need to transcend or integrate different sectors and agencies dealing with them utfi offers notable public benefits approaches to internalize the public benefits need to be considered while assessing the benefits various approaches aiming at bringing behavioural change towards sustainable nrm are assessed in this regard jill et al 2005 though these approaches are not mutually exclusive they operate with different philosophical underpinnings 3 1 instruments market approach works on economic rationality of polluter pays or user pays principles market based approaches provide cost benefit sharing models for stakeholders and aim to promote efficient allocation of resources various instruments are used within market based approaches namely price based quantity based and market friction mechanisms jill et al 2005 in the case of price based instruments charges subsidies may be used to discourage encourage a polluting mitigating activity similarly the benefits from mitigating activity could be charged to the polluter user when the mitigating and benefiting communities are different which falls under a broader term payments for ecosystem services pes the basic principle behind such approaches is that those who provide the benefits providers are compensated through taxing charging those who benefit users however compensation instruments such as subsidised credit pagiola and platais 2002 and investment subsidies are shown to be the least effective mechanism krupnik 2012 kerr and jindal 2007 pes has been experimented in several asian countries including bangladesh landell mills and porras 2002 china bannet 2008 india kumar and managi 2009 and sri lanka kallesoe and de alvis 2004 though designing effective pes instruments is a challenge community based instruments like i community participation and contribution ii participatory learning and iii social regulation aim at awareness building community involvement in planning decision making and contribution kind or cash in a formal as well as informal manner james 2000 mosse 2003 these are being extended to include groundwater management in recent years das and burke 2013 ratna et al 2014 some of these initiatives are showing positive impacts though their technical validity and sustainability remains a moot point ratna et al 2014 besides the viability and sustainability of the institutional arrangements depend on the existing socioeconomic and institutional profile of the region the potential of some of these instruments will be explored in the context of our case study 4 profile of the sample region and villages this section provides the basis for assessing the socioeconomic potential of the local communities to manage utfi interventions this assessment was then used to suggest potential short and long term institutional strategies for managing utfi the size of the ten sample villages in terms of number of households and population ranges between 110 households to 600 households with an average size ranging between 5 7 and 6 2 overall average of 5 9 the proportion of female population is below 50 percent in all the sample villages i e ranging between 46 and 49 percent demographic profiles do not vary much between upstream and downstream sample villages socially backward communities obc 6 6 obc oc and sc are collective terms used by the government of india to classify castes which are educationally and or economically disadvantaged account for 50 percent of the total population with other communities oc and scheduled caste sc are equally divided concentration of obc is more in downstream villages compared to upstream villages the proportion of scs is less in the downstream villages the economic structure is more homogenous in both the cases landless households account for 20 to 30 percent in the sample villages 75 percent of the sample households have access to land with about 80 percent in the upstream villages and 70 percent downstream the majority of farmers are smf cultivating up to 2 ha of land with about 90 percent of the land owning households falling in this category at the aggregate level 95 percent in the upstream villages and 85 percent in downstream the average farm size varies among the villages however is higher in the downstream villages access to water is more evenly distributed as the extent of irrigation is almost 100 percent in most cases differences between upstream and downstream villages as well as between smf and lmf are marginal the predominant occupation in the sample villages is agriculture table 2 occupational structure varies widely between upstream and downstream upstream villages are more dependent on agricultural labour than cultivation the dependence on non farm occupations is more in upstream villages 32 percent when compared to downstream villages 16 percent inter village variations in occupational structure is also high in the case of upstream with agriculture and livestock accounting for 54 percent of the aggregate household income table 3 agriculture and livestock contributes more in the downstream villages 69 percent while labour contributes 40 percent of the household income in the case of irrigation infrastructure 73 percent of the households have borewells in the region while open wells are no longer in use for irrigation it may be noted that a greater proportion of households 76 percent in the upstream villages have borewells when compared to downstream this could be due to the relatively scarce groundwater situation on upstream villages for in the upstream villages the average depth of the bore well is high and the area irrigated per well is low in both the locations more than 80 percent of the households have more than one well in all the villages i e average number of wells per household is 1 2 in upstream as well as downstream lnrmi 2017 4 1 impact of floods flooding is a major problem in rampur district and the surrounding areas in the recent past floods were experienced in milak block affecting 15 villages during 2010 and again in 2013 affecting 18 villages damaging crops and property in 2015 a total of 207 villages were affected and about rs 1 8 million were spent on relief work in the district 7 7 http www imd gov in section hydro dynamic rfmaps weeklyprogress htm range a324 according to the household survey the five main impacts of floods were inundation of residential areas farmlands crop losses livestock losses loss of employment and health impacts of these monetary losses are not reported in fact inundation of farmlands is often considered as a positive impact as it improves soil fertility through deposition of silt laden floodwater it is estimated that altogether an average household loses about us 114 rs 8 000 8 8 exchange rate us rs 70 is used throughout during moderate floods and about us 228 rs 16 000 during severe floods table 4 while the losses range between us 100 rs 7 000 and us 200 rs 14 000 in the upstream villages households in downstream locations incur losses to the tune of us 286 rs 20 000 during severe flooding as a proportion of household income the losses account for 5 to 10 percent during moderate and severe floods respectively in the upstream and 8 to 14 percent in the downstream the burden is disproportionately born by the economically weaker sections ll and smf of the communities as a proportion of household income flood losses account for 3 to 7 percent of lmf while they account for 6 to 18 percent in the case of smf households depending on the intensity of floods it may be noted that groundwater stress is increasingly felt in these regions especially during below normal rainfall years households reported decline in groundwater tables in all the sample villages over the years the decline is more so in the upstream villages which experience low incidence of floods in most of the villages open wells are drying up and in the majority of villages open wells are used for drinking water purpose only as a result the number of bore wells is on the rise in the region though no severe impacts are observed due to groundwater droughts on farming households the declining groundwater tables are certainly increasing the irrigation costs which is akin to loss of household income from agriculture as these impacts are not measured only flood impacts are included here some of the sample villages have reported drinking water shortages during summer months 4 2 costs and benefits of utfi at scale the capital cost for replicating the pilot non inclusive of research related costs is us 11 500 8 00 000 annual maintenance costs are estimated to be us 1 400 100 000 alam and pavelic forthcoming the estimated levelised cost of water recharged is us 0 048 3 4 per m3 estimates of the utfi attributed agricultural output are based on the average recharge volume of 45 000 m3 yr of which 75 percent is withdrawn for agriculture and the remaining 25 percent is retained in the aquifer to support environmental flows the quantity of irrigation water is sufficient to irrigate 9 6 ha of wheat during the rabi winter cropping season with an irrigation water requirement of 350 mm gross economic returns to farmers are us 315 rs 22 000 per hectare goi 2017 the total benefits from an agricultural production viewpoint alone are larger than the operating costs with a benefit cost ratio of 1 34 1 pavelic et al forthcoming utfi has the potential to enhance a range of ecosystem service benefits such as flood control groundwater recharge and dry season water availability some of these benefits are difficult to establish reliably at the scale of a pilot trial and may be better quantified through broader basin scale modelling studies chinnasamy et al 2017 for the case where 20 percent of the mean outflow from the ramganga river basin 6000 mm3 is recharged through a distributed arrangement of utfi structures this model shows that groundwater level declines and flood frequency could be substantially reduced and baseflow to rivers and streams enhanced on the basis of the trial results it is estimated that around 27 000 village ponds would need to be converted to achieve 20 percent reduction flood water across rampur district alone where mapping has taken place there are no fewer than 1 800 ponds indicating high potential for scaling up within the basin 4 3 institutional context collective choice institutions are not a strong characteristic of the region there are no community driven initiatives or institutions in the sample villages though one can observe the presence of self help groups shgs in some villages they are not common like in other regions there are no other user or farmer groups in the sample villages and no non governmental organizations ngos in the region the only institution that is functional in these villages is the village panchayat thus it is a big challenge to design and promote new institutional entities for utfi management all the farmers interviewed in jiwai jadid pilot village reported that during the monsoon july september and winter months december march water availability is adequate though they face water scarcity during summer months april july water yields of irrigation well as well as handpumps used for drinking water go down during summer according to one woman respondent we have to pump 10 15 times to fill one bucket of water 20 l during the monsoon as compared to the summer when we have to pump 20 25 times to fill one bucket although there is a declining trend in groundwater levels and the community faces seasonal water scarcity the majority of the jiwai jadid farmers reported that the village s water resources are still sufficiently abundant and water management is not a top priority hence the community has no incentive to act collectively impacting the utfi intervention none of the participants were willing to voluntarily contribute to the management operation and maintenance of utfi one male respondents commented at present we can t contribute from our own pockets but if support is provided from outside or we see some actual benefits then we would be willing to help managing the structures another factor that hinders the community s motivation to participate in utfi is the absence of direct observable benefit from the intervention one interviewee male stated yes groundwater is going down because the number of borewells has increased a lot but i am not convinced about utfi and it s feasibility because i am not seeing any benefits in jiwai jadid between 26 000 and 62 000 m3 has been recharged over three years 2016 2018 and the farmers have noticed an increase in the water table but only during the rainy seasons however they are not able to gauge even the approximate level of increase in water table pre and post intervention during summer months there is no difference in water table pre and post intervention the majority of interviewees stated that they are unable to recognize whether the water table is increasing because of utfi groundwater goes up after monsoon season naturally and we do not know how much utfi is helping we need water in the summer so it would have been better if the structures were recharging in the summer there is a common belief in jiwai jadid that recharge should happen during the summer months which shows a lack of understanding with regards to utfi operations as stated by a farmer the site is operational for only two months of the year but if it were operational all year round then it would be more beneficial for the community additionally one irrigator stated for this to be beneficial to our community the structures should have been bigger or they should have built a dam instead the lack of understanding could be attributed to the lack of capacity building from the initial stages of the project additionally the majority of the community failed to realize the dual purpose of utfi this is because although the department of land development and water resources 2009 classifies rampur as a flood prone district the last severe flood was reported in the year 2010 though floods were reported during 2013 and 2015 since 2010 severe flood occurrence and frequency is limited in the village though flood damages are substantial communities don t perceive it as a major economic problem and hence the community did not draw any linkage between reduction in floods and utfi interventions on the other hand the inability of irrigators to recognize the benefits of utfi can be attributed to i the hydrogeological properties of alluvial aquifers as well as ii the scale of operations which is too small to show tangible economic benefits to the stakeholders therefore requires up scaling for its full benefits to be realized as concluded by gangopadhyay et al 2018 the preliminary results from the pilot site show an improvement in the local groundwater resources however to achieve the full benefit of the method it is required to implement it in larger scale although the preliminary assessment shows an increase in groundwater levels this increase has not been adequately recognised by the farmers the community s social composition and weak local institutions are factors that contribute to the lack of collective action and hence motivation to participate in utfi collective action is weak in jiwai jadid especially with regards to groundwater management since the majority of farmers have private wells amongst the jiwai jadid community there is a common belief agreed by all irrigators interviewed that the government is responsible for providing solutions in the form of subsidies and panchayat funds and believe that the utfi intervention should be under the ownership of the panchayat according to an irrigation farmer the panchayat should take over the management of utfi and if the panchayat is involved people will take it more seriously a few irrigators expressed an interest for creation of a subcommittee under the panchayat s control to manage utfi activities provided that the funds come from the government as people are not ready to support the maintenance activities from their own pocket some irrigators expressed interest in group committee formation in case the group is linked with activities that provide monetary benefits one example that was mentioned during the interview was to convert the utfi ponds into fishponds one irrigation farmer suggested the fisheries department can provide funds to grow fish in the pond 5 sustainable management of utfi the process of implementing utfi begins with identifying the potential areas viz flood prone areas with potential for groundwater recharge and utilisation potential sites are expected to experience floods during wet season and water shortage during dry season identifying such villages within the basin or watershed is the first step the second step prior to implementation it to identify the villages with suitable ponds that are connected to a source that can carry flood waters to fill the ponds during wet season the number of ponds required at the sub basin scale is estimated at 27 000 and the region has the potential to support the scaling up without any need for land allocation public or private pavelic et al forthcoming in these villages it is required to estimate the capital and operational costs during the village identification process prior to implementation it is essential to involve the village communities and the village panchayat by making them aware of the costs and benefits from the interventions additionally it is necessary to identify the implementing agency with technical expertise as well as to identify and or evolve local institutions or specific user groups at the village level with the help of village panchayat the roles and responsibilities of the user group need to be articulated clearly while the user group will be responsible for implementing and maintaining structures the village panchayat will provide the guidance and act as a monitoring authority once the implementation is completed regular maintenance of the structures as well as regular monitoring and evaluation the benefit flows especially during the flood and drought events needs to be ensured in what fallows workable implementation institutional arrangements are proposed based on the socioeconomic and institutional assessment along with the perceptions of the local communities and officials from district and block levels these arrangements are divided into short and long term arrangements 5 1 short term the main reasons for low levels of collective action within communities are their weak institutional and socioeconomic conditions and the limited perceived need for change in water management the low economic ability of the communities to support the implementation and post implementation responsibilities calls for public support especially during the initial stages this is very much reflected in the perceptions of the communities on taking up maintenance activities government can support the maintenance of utfi in three ways i programmatic ii departmental and iii administrative currently there are not many ongoing programs under which utfi can be placed the rural development department which is responsible for implementing the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme mgnregs through village panchayats has resources to support the labour component of the utfi interventions i e maintenance the infrastructure and capacity building components need additional support from other departments or sources such as the finance commission this requires inter departmental coordination at the district sub district levels and each department has its own mandate or guidelines therefore an administrative route would be appropriate and practical fig 4 especially in the short run because the administration has the authority and flexibility to pool financial and human resources at the district sub district level under the administrative authority of the district magistrate dm the chief district officer cdo coordinates the activities with the block and village level officials the block development officer bdo supported by the assistant development officer ado would be responsible for identifying the potential villages resourcing required funds and implementing utfi across the villages in their block technical and non technical support from the district authorities will be routed through block administration to the villages where utfi is being implemented at the ground level village panchayat would be given the responsibility to implement and maintain utfi structures while the village secretary coordinates the village and block level activities a utfi management committee umc would be formed as a community based organisation user group which is responsible for actual implementation and maintenance the existing open defecation free committees odfs that work under block administration could also be entrusted the responsibility to take up the works immediately or till a umc is formed though the district administration is divided on giving the responsibilities to the panchayati raj institution pri communities prefer village panchayat to handle the responsibilities besides there is merit 9 9 interface between the pris and the cbos would usher in better mechanisms of accountability linkages are necessary to sustain and strengthen the cbos and make them accountable to all the stakeholders at the gram sabha ratna et al 2009 in decentralisation and hence pri should play an overarching role in creating guiding and monitoring umc odf in reality pri is the only active institutional anchor present at the village level in the study region in order to overcome the limitations of pris viz elite capture political capture etc it is suggested to provide guidelines for forming the user groups a nuanced assessment of organising the local communities umc to manage utfi is needed to identify and strengthen the drivers of collective strategies which could be village specific 5 1 1 fund flows capital and operating costs utfi interventions requires one time capital expenditure as well as annual maintenance as discussed in the previous section though utfi interventions and management transcends number of areas administrative units departments and programmes availability of funds for implementing and maintaining the interventions is limited in the absence of any related on going programs watershed etc in the region at present administrative orders are issued for jiwai jadid pilot village giving the utfi responsibility to the village level and block level to the village panchayat and the block development officer respectively the district administration proposes to draw the capital expenditure from the central finance commission grants district magistrate will be the nodal administrative head at the district accessing these funds and route the funds to the pilot village through block administration the village panchayat would be given the responsibility of overseeing the implementation with the help of the umc fig 5 groundwater and minor irrigation departments could provide technical support to the programme and can take utfi under their programmes in the coming years involvement of these departments would ensure the linkages from the beginning as most of the aspects come under the purview of these departments operation and maintenance of the structures are taken up under the employment guarantee program implemented by the department of rural development the panchayat should play an overarching role of guiding and monitoring umc at present the available funds could not support the entire requirement of operation and maintenance due to the constraints within the programme while the funds could be utilised for pond maintenance which is required every few years the funds are not available every year for maintenance of the recharge wells 10 10 as per the programme guidelines the funds can be used for the same purpose only once in three years alternative sources of funding need to be explored either from the village or block or district level as discussed earlier various potential sources including village communities could be brought in with the support and partnership of district administration involvement of communities and village panchayat from the initial stages of utfi implementation would facilitate such support however it is important to note some potential drawbacks firstly during implementation of utfi in jiwai jadid one of the main challenges experienced were the frequent changes in block and district administration staff with every staff change the utfi implementation team had to pursue the administration for continued support secondly implementing participatory approaches and creating community based organizations cbos i e umc is by no means easy or straightforward especially in the context of weak institutional status of the case study village meaningfully engaging the community requires time and funds and is highly contextual depending on the community s needs and socio economic and cultural background therefore there is no unique strategy 5 2 medium long term 11 11 the discussion here may be considered as policy suggestions as the project team can t do much in this regard given the substantial economic benefits utfi could be linked or placed under some of the existing programs and institutions like watershed management water user associations participatory groundwater institutions ratna et al 2018 umc could be formed with the support from these existing programs integration of all these programmes is required as utfi addresses surface sub surface and watershed management aspects a practical problem with the programmatic approach is that at present none of these programs are active in the study region though some of them are likely to be implemented in the coming years another disadvantage is the absence of ngos in the region ngos play an important role in promoting and supporting community groups ratna et al 2009 and in ensuring fund flow mechanisms capacity building and monitoring and evaluation of the interventions at the village level which are critical aspects for scaling up of utfi interventions it is suggested that more emphasis is put on expanding and implementing the well needed government programs in the region as well as the district administration strengthening the ngo sector these suggestions would offer benefits to the region as a whole regardless of utfi support at the policy and political level is essential however to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks other sectors such as private and public sector banks as well as private companies under their corporate social responsibility could also be involved in promoting recharge activities banks and private sector are already supporting farmers to overcome climate risks in some regions viz providing market linkages and building the capacity of the communities to mitigate climate risks through promoting farmer producer organisations nabard 2015 the funding is meant to cover the cost of mobilizing farmers registration operation and management training exposure visits etc more emphasis on putting utfi under climate mitigation 12 12 utfi can address climate risks declining rainfall reduced groundwater recharge flash floods due to intense rainfall events and glacier melt strategy would help garnering funding support from such organizations 5 2 1 capacity building and training absence of perceived benefits from the interventions in jiwai jadid is the main bottleneck for collective action given the substantial long term benefits over costs from the interventions communities need to be motivated through awareness and capacity building along with monitoring and evaluation of incremental benefits with the scaling up of the interventions in jiwai jadid there have been number of community consultations and information sessions but awareness and capacity building and social mobilization has not occurred in a systematic manner it is increasingly recognized that human capital is a major shortfall when it comes to addressing pressing challenges of groundwater management in asia villholth 2009 therefore regardless of the instruments or incentives chosen to motivate the community the need for awareness and capacity building is highly critical for the success of the interventions 5 2 2 monitoring and evaluation monitoring and evaluation is critical for up and out scaling the interventions the base line information generated for the pilot village would help in capturing the impacts clearly at any future point however communities benefiting from the interventions are the best judges of the impacts on a regular basis district administration can monitor and evaluate indicators with the help of implementing agencies and the communities this helps in carrying out mid course corrections in the scaling out process a third party evaluation would be useful in providing unbiased assessment of the interventions at a later stage creating good baseline information for all the villages where utfi implementation is being planned is necessary for any robust future monitoring and evaluation this should be part of the intervention package 6 conclusions utfi interventions could provide environmental services through flood protection downstream and enhanced hydrological services upstream assessing the opportunities in terms of identifying locations communities that make economic rationale to capture the excess water from flooding and store in the aquifers for productive use afterwards is a first step in this direction community centered management systems are critical for sustaining these interventions at the village level since these interventions are mostly at the village level a number of village specific systems need to be created given the poor socioeconomic and institutional conditions of the region there is need for investment and involvement of public agencies the case study presented here outlines a management system based on the experience of pilot village given the limited scale of the case study the benefit flows from the interventions are not conspicuous though the estimated benefits from scaling up interventions at the sub basin level are substantial when compared to costs besides the region is not endowed with strong community based institutions however the pilot helped improving the awareness among the communities communities are willing to participate in the management of utfi interventions provided they get the financial and administrative support from the line departments under the supervision of village panchayat the district administration is willing to support the systems by pooling money from different sources and route them through block administration though this appears to be working in the short run there is need for evolving a systematic programmatic approach in the long run given that the district administration is convinced about the utfi benefits the interventions need to be scaled up in order to realise the benefits at a large scale for this there is need for policy changes like integrating utfi as part of regular ongoing programs like watershed development strengthening the social capital in the region through reviving the shgs and other cbos pertaining to agriculture though there are a number of policy initiatives at the central level viz farmer groups gopal mitra farmer producer organisations they are conspicuously absent in the region state and district administration need to promote these initiatives in the region at the same time taking up awareness and capacity building initiatives on the technical and socioeconomic aspects of utfi at the community as well as administrative level requires immediate attention of the district and state administration

5736,protecting flood prone locations through floodwater recharge of the depleted aquifers and using it for protecting dry season irrigated agriculture is the rationale for a form of intervention termed as underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi this helps reduce the intensity of seasonal floods by tapping and storing excess floodwater in aquifers for productive agricultural use this paper presents a case study of managing the recharge interventions in the context of the ramganga basin india using a case study approach this study determines the socio economic and institutional context of the study area proposes three potential routes to institutionalize utfi and provides insights for scaling up the interventions in the ganges and other river basins that face seasonal floods and dry season water shortages managing the interventions involves community participation in regular operations and maintenance tasks given the limited scale of the pilot utfi intervention implemented to date and the socio economic and institutional context of the case study region the benefits are not conspicuous though the piloting helped in identifying potential ways forward for the long term management of the pilot site and for scaling up the interventions initially pilot site management was handled by the project team working closely with the community leaders and villagers as the intervention was demonstrated to perform effectively management was handed over to the district authorities after providing appropriate training to the government personnel to manage the system and liaise with the local community to ensure the site is operated and managed appropriately the district administration is willing to support utfi by pooling money from different sources and routing them through the sub district administration while this is working in the short term the paper outlines a programmatic longer term approach for wider replication keywords floods droughts groundwater management institution ganges basin india 1 introduction managing supply and demand of water resources are amongst the most critical policy issues the need for greater action in this domain is becoming more pressing as communities are increasingly experiencing water stress related to scarcity drought as well as excess flood in most river basins these situations of water scarcity and abundance coexist although they are divided by time and or space molden et al 2014 nepal santosh et al 2014 protecting flood prone locations through flood water recharge of the depleted aquifers and using it for protecting dry season agriculture is termed as underground transfer of floods for irrigation utfi pavelic et al 2012 utfi is an improvised version of implementing managed aquifer recharge mar methods such as ganges water machine gwm pumping along canals pac and distributed pumping and recharge dpr khan et al 2014 utfi fosters mar mechanisms while pumping is distributed across irrigated crop locations and it promotes the much needed conjunctive use and management of water resources pavelic et al 2012 utfi helps in reducing the intensity of seasonal floods by tapping and storing excess flood waters in aquifers for productive agricultural use 1 1 the concept utfi is an intervention applicable at the watershed or basin level that is prone to both floods and droughts 1 1 while a number of river basins are suitable for utfi interventions assessments for potential utfi interventions are carried out for ganges basin in india and chao phraya in thailand and this study is considering ganges basin utfi interventions utfi in terms of the individual physical components is not necessarily new although the approach is the origins of the utfi approach emerged as a spinoff from a pilot scale mar trial conducted in a sub basin of the chao phraya river basin thailand pavelic et al 2012 utfi adds new value to often ad hoc mar efforts and puts it into a larger scale perspective that offers a wider range of benefits and potentially provides net benefits for both upstream and downstream communities central to utfi is dispersing recharge enhancing interventions across strategic parts of the basin to provide supplies to meet additional dry season demand for this water recovered via agricultural wells rather than allowing surface water to concentrate and be problematic in the floodplain areas however this not to undermine the benefits from floods in specific cases viz soil improvement aquaculture etc 1 2 geohydrological aspects 2 2 for details on technical aspects please see pavelic et al 2015 the use of surface structures fig 1 such as infiltration basins that are easy to construct and maintain are preferable to deep infiltration systems such as recharge wells pavelic et al 2015 whilst this will preclude the potential for utfi in some hydrogeological settings due to low permeability soil layers or poor surficial aquifers sites can be identified where conditions are most suitable factors like the extent of flooding area quantity of water that can be tapped nature and size of aquifers hard rock alluvial or deep shallow etc and their connectivity to the land surface determine the type of interventions required ponds check dams recharge wells bunding etc in the pilot site fig 1 ten recharge wells 25 30 m deep were drilled into the base of a village pond 75 m 35 m situated adjacent to an irrigation canal the aquifer type is a fine medium quaternary alluvium pavelic et al forthcoming 1 3 managing utfi the physical infrastructure associated with utfi needs to be maintained thus utfi requires a unified approach that considers both supply and demand side management the supply side involves creating and maintaining the mar infrastructure at scale while the demand side includes incentives to achieve widespread participation of farmers and institutional arrangements that will sustainably govern the groundwater resources and the infrastructure in the long run given the scale of seasonal flooding as well as the size of the communities that are affected utfi interventions need to be implemented at scale in order to be effective and provide tangible benefits this paper presents a case study of managing the recharge interventions in the context of ramganga sub basin of gangetic basin india the case study presented here provides insights for scaling up the interventions in the ganges and other river basins that face seasonal floods and dry season water shortages 2 objectives and approach utfi as a total package deals with conjunctive water resources management with specific foci in floods surface water and groundwater resources while some supportive elements may be present a unified framework is lacking for the implementation of utfi at scale in south asian countries using the case study approach this paper provides a practical approach for managing utfi interventions given the existing socioeconomic environmental institutional and policy environment in the study region specific objectives are to 1 assess the relevant institutional approaches to utfi particularly from a regional context 2 assess the existing socioeconomic institutional dynamics and potential for changes to suite utfi management in the study region and 3 suggest potentially viable governance arrangements and policies for utfi implementation in the short as well as medium to long term utfi infrastructure is established in the jiwai jadid village situated in rampur district uttar pradesh however socio economic and livelihood analysis of other villages that have utfi potential and are likely to get the infrastructure later has been conducted these other villages are spread over the sub basin covering upstream and downstream locations fig 2 the intention is to understand the broader context by including the ongoing pilot village jiwai jadid as well as future villages where there is potential for utfi intervention this would provide scientific and robust basis for assessment besides the information from some of the villages could be used for comparing sites with and without utfi interventions for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation though attribution could be a problem due to time dependent effects 2 1 approach the study was carried out within the context of the flood prone region of the ramganga sub basin of ganges basin located in the rampur district of uttar pradesh state in india the study was conducted at three levels viz district village and household primary and secondary data was used to assess the flood related aspects and groundwater across locations and socioeconomic groups primary data was collected at the community and household level the focus was on socioeconomic livelihoods and institutional aspects related to utfi interventions while the secondary information at the district level was gathered on the incidence of flooding and its impacts mainly from the disaster management department village level data was drawn from the 2011 census of india and from household surveys based on their suitability for utfi ten sample villages were selected to conduct further analysis six of these villages representing upstream locations and four downstream within the sub basin table 1 both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to elicit information at the village community and household levels as part of qualitative research key informant interviews kii and focus group discussions fgds were conducted kiis were conducted with village pradhan and other elderly and knowledgeable people and also officials from the revenue irrigation and rural development departments fgds were conducted in all the villages in order to identify and assess the community s priorities and perceptions about floods groundwater and the management of utfi these groups include agricultural labourers small and marginal farmers medium and large farmers and also women and mixed groups a total of 21 14 7 fgds and 33 14 19 kiis were conducted semi structured interviews were conducted during first and second rounds of field work respectively with three main stakeholder groups i e i jiwai jadid community ii members of jiwai jadid gram panchayat of the panchayati raj institutional system 3 3 a system of local self governance in india wherein the gram panchayats are the basic units of local administration from now on referred to as panchayat and iii block and district level officials that are responsible for the whole of rampur district milak block where jiwai jadid falls under as well as block development officers bdo from three other blocks that are suitable for utfi implementation qualitative data from the semi structured interviews was used to understand the post implementation perceptions on the post project situation and assess the scope for institutionalizing utfi as part of the quantitative research a structured household questionnaire was canvassed from around 30 households from each sample village i e a total of 302 households table 1 the sample was drawn purposively to represent all the socioeconomic groups in the village while social categories were followed as per local norms households owning up to 5 acres of land were categorised as small and marginal farmers smf and those owning more than 5 acres were categorised as large and medium farmers lmf care was taken to include households that are both vulnerable and not vulnerable to flooding the questionnaire was designed to capture demographic institutional socioeconomic livelihood flood and groundwater related aspects and simple cross tabulation was used to analyse the quantitative data at household level the data collection was conducted in three phases november 2015 winter and march 2016 pre summer when the baseline assessment was carried out to assess the socioeconomic and institutional status and the potential for scaling up utfi in the basin for the purpose of deeper understanding a revisit to the sample sites was conducted during june 2017 summer and additional interviews were conducted in jiwai jadid pilot village between march pre summer and september 2018 monsoon this qualitative and quantitative analysis forms the basis for arriving at the institutional framework for managing utfi in the long run 3 institutional prerequisites and instruments utfi interventions are derived from and have strong overlap with those adopted under watershed development wsd and mar and have direct linkages to flood mitigation fm while mar interventions primarily address groundwater recharge wsd and fm interventions address runoff control soil moisture conservation and surface water management as well as groundwater recharge all three interventions are land based requiring allocation of land private or public ideally in a contiguous manner 4 4 it may be noted that land based interventions have implications for equity as land distribution is skewed all three are integral to utfi though the location of specific interventions varies fig 3 utfi interventions result in direct and indirect benefits depending on the location downstream locations a and b in fig 3 benefit directly from flood mitigation through mar and fm interventions similarly upstream locations c in fig 3 benefit directly from groundwater recharge through watershed and mar interventions there is also a need for interventions in high slopes and forests d in fig 3 the extent of benefits and costs of interventions however vary between locations there could be indirect beneficiaries who benefit from the positive externalities of these interventions though these interventions are appropriate at a basin sub basin scale the scale of the pilot is much smaller involvement and participation of local communities is critical for the success and sustainability of these interventions more importantly location of interventions and location of benefits do not overlap clearly i e interventions made by one community may also benefit some other community located elsewhere leading to spatial inequity even within the community the benefits may not be distributed equally for instance benefits from a recharge structure may accrue more to a farmer situated nearby or to a large farmer more than a small farmer as the former is capable of installing a bore well and deepening it early on which would have been dry in the absence of a recharge structure ratna 2005 thus from an institutional perspective the enabling conditions or prerequisites for implementing utfi include a widespread environmental services associated with the interventions b clear identification of the beneficiaries users and providers sellers of these services c clear identification of the number of communities or stakeholders that are involved in the process and extent of area to be covered d favourable benefit cost ratio 5 5 b c ratio can be calculated using the benefit flows from flood mitigation improved access to irrigation during summer and other ecosystem services and cost of utfi infrastructure and its maintenance for the interventions e appropriate mechanisms policy and practice that ensure sustainability of these interventions and equitable distribution of the costs and benefits though achieving equity is a difficult proposition especially in the context of land based interventions compensation principles could be used to ensure equity f widespread community participation for sustaining the institutions in the long run b downstream location with high flood intensity where utfi irrigation management and managed aquifer recharge interventions reduce flood intensity irrigation and groundwater departments are the major stake holders c upstream location where utfi watershed interventions would help recharge groundwater and reduce flood intensity down stream groundwater and rural development agriculture departments are the major stakeholders d forest areas in upstream with forest management interventions to reduce flood intensity forest department is the main stakeholder the existing institutional approaches and instruments adopted in natural resource management nrm in the south asian context will form the basis for utfi institutional framework prioritising the approaches and instruments that are readily acceptable at the community as well as policy level low hanging fruits will become part of the institutional frame in terms of the specific aspects of utfi the institutional approaches need to transcend or integrate different sectors and agencies dealing with them utfi offers notable public benefits approaches to internalize the public benefits need to be considered while assessing the benefits various approaches aiming at bringing behavioural change towards sustainable nrm are assessed in this regard jill et al 2005 though these approaches are not mutually exclusive they operate with different philosophical underpinnings 3 1 instruments market approach works on economic rationality of polluter pays or user pays principles market based approaches provide cost benefit sharing models for stakeholders and aim to promote efficient allocation of resources various instruments are used within market based approaches namely price based quantity based and market friction mechanisms jill et al 2005 in the case of price based instruments charges subsidies may be used to discourage encourage a polluting mitigating activity similarly the benefits from mitigating activity could be charged to the polluter user when the mitigating and benefiting communities are different which falls under a broader term payments for ecosystem services pes the basic principle behind such approaches is that those who provide the benefits providers are compensated through taxing charging those who benefit users however compensation instruments such as subsidised credit pagiola and platais 2002 and investment subsidies are shown to be the least effective mechanism krupnik 2012 kerr and jindal 2007 pes has been experimented in several asian countries including bangladesh landell mills and porras 2002 china bannet 2008 india kumar and managi 2009 and sri lanka kallesoe and de alvis 2004 though designing effective pes instruments is a challenge community based instruments like i community participation and contribution ii participatory learning and iii social regulation aim at awareness building community involvement in planning decision making and contribution kind or cash in a formal as well as informal manner james 2000 mosse 2003 these are being extended to include groundwater management in recent years das and burke 2013 ratna et al 2014 some of these initiatives are showing positive impacts though their technical validity and sustainability remains a moot point ratna et al 2014 besides the viability and sustainability of the institutional arrangements depend on the existing socioeconomic and institutional profile of the region the potential of some of these instruments will be explored in the context of our case study 4 profile of the sample region and villages this section provides the basis for assessing the socioeconomic potential of the local communities to manage utfi interventions this assessment was then used to suggest potential short and long term institutional strategies for managing utfi the size of the ten sample villages in terms of number of households and population ranges between 110 households to 600 households with an average size ranging between 5 7 and 6 2 overall average of 5 9 the proportion of female population is below 50 percent in all the sample villages i e ranging between 46 and 49 percent demographic profiles do not vary much between upstream and downstream sample villages socially backward communities obc 6 6 obc oc and sc are collective terms used by the government of india to classify castes which are educationally and or economically disadvantaged account for 50 percent of the total population with other communities oc and scheduled caste sc are equally divided concentration of obc is more in downstream villages compared to upstream villages the proportion of scs is less in the downstream villages the economic structure is more homogenous in both the cases landless households account for 20 to 30 percent in the sample villages 75 percent of the sample households have access to land with about 80 percent in the upstream villages and 70 percent downstream the majority of farmers are smf cultivating up to 2 ha of land with about 90 percent of the land owning households falling in this category at the aggregate level 95 percent in the upstream villages and 85 percent in downstream the average farm size varies among the villages however is higher in the downstream villages access to water is more evenly distributed as the extent of irrigation is almost 100 percent in most cases differences between upstream and downstream villages as well as between smf and lmf are marginal the predominant occupation in the sample villages is agriculture table 2 occupational structure varies widely between upstream and downstream upstream villages are more dependent on agricultural labour than cultivation the dependence on non farm occupations is more in upstream villages 32 percent when compared to downstream villages 16 percent inter village variations in occupational structure is also high in the case of upstream with agriculture and livestock accounting for 54 percent of the aggregate household income table 3 agriculture and livestock contributes more in the downstream villages 69 percent while labour contributes 40 percent of the household income in the case of irrigation infrastructure 73 percent of the households have borewells in the region while open wells are no longer in use for irrigation it may be noted that a greater proportion of households 76 percent in the upstream villages have borewells when compared to downstream this could be due to the relatively scarce groundwater situation on upstream villages for in the upstream villages the average depth of the bore well is high and the area irrigated per well is low in both the locations more than 80 percent of the households have more than one well in all the villages i e average number of wells per household is 1 2 in upstream as well as downstream lnrmi 2017 4 1 impact of floods flooding is a major problem in rampur district and the surrounding areas in the recent past floods were experienced in milak block affecting 15 villages during 2010 and again in 2013 affecting 18 villages damaging crops and property in 2015 a total of 207 villages were affected and about rs 1 8 million were spent on relief work in the district 7 7 http www imd gov in section hydro dynamic rfmaps weeklyprogress htm range a324 according to the household survey the five main impacts of floods were inundation of residential areas farmlands crop losses livestock losses loss of employment and health impacts of these monetary losses are not reported in fact inundation of farmlands is often considered as a positive impact as it improves soil fertility through deposition of silt laden floodwater it is estimated that altogether an average household loses about us 114 rs 8 000 8 8 exchange rate us rs 70 is used throughout during moderate floods and about us 228 rs 16 000 during severe floods table 4 while the losses range between us 100 rs 7 000 and us 200 rs 14 000 in the upstream villages households in downstream locations incur losses to the tune of us 286 rs 20 000 during severe flooding as a proportion of household income the losses account for 5 to 10 percent during moderate and severe floods respectively in the upstream and 8 to 14 percent in the downstream the burden is disproportionately born by the economically weaker sections ll and smf of the communities as a proportion of household income flood losses account for 3 to 7 percent of lmf while they account for 6 to 18 percent in the case of smf households depending on the intensity of floods it may be noted that groundwater stress is increasingly felt in these regions especially during below normal rainfall years households reported decline in groundwater tables in all the sample villages over the years the decline is more so in the upstream villages which experience low incidence of floods in most of the villages open wells are drying up and in the majority of villages open wells are used for drinking water purpose only as a result the number of bore wells is on the rise in the region though no severe impacts are observed due to groundwater droughts on farming households the declining groundwater tables are certainly increasing the irrigation costs which is akin to loss of household income from agriculture as these impacts are not measured only flood impacts are included here some of the sample villages have reported drinking water shortages during summer months 4 2 costs and benefits of utfi at scale the capital cost for replicating the pilot non inclusive of research related costs is us 11 500 8 00 000 annual maintenance costs are estimated to be us 1 400 100 000 alam and pavelic forthcoming the estimated levelised cost of water recharged is us 0 048 3 4 per m3 estimates of the utfi attributed agricultural output are based on the average recharge volume of 45 000 m3 yr of which 75 percent is withdrawn for agriculture and the remaining 25 percent is retained in the aquifer to support environmental flows the quantity of irrigation water is sufficient to irrigate 9 6 ha of wheat during the rabi winter cropping season with an irrigation water requirement of 350 mm gross economic returns to farmers are us 315 rs 22 000 per hectare goi 2017 the total benefits from an agricultural production viewpoint alone are larger than the operating costs with a benefit cost ratio of 1 34 1 pavelic et al forthcoming utfi has the potential to enhance a range of ecosystem service benefits such as flood control groundwater recharge and dry season water availability some of these benefits are difficult to establish reliably at the scale of a pilot trial and may be better quantified through broader basin scale modelling studies chinnasamy et al 2017 for the case where 20 percent of the mean outflow from the ramganga river basin 6000 mm3 is recharged through a distributed arrangement of utfi structures this model shows that groundwater level declines and flood frequency could be substantially reduced and baseflow to rivers and streams enhanced on the basis of the trial results it is estimated that around 27 000 village ponds would need to be converted to achieve 20 percent reduction flood water across rampur district alone where mapping has taken place there are no fewer than 1 800 ponds indicating high potential for scaling up within the basin 4 3 institutional context collective choice institutions are not a strong characteristic of the region there are no community driven initiatives or institutions in the sample villages though one can observe the presence of self help groups shgs in some villages they are not common like in other regions there are no other user or farmer groups in the sample villages and no non governmental organizations ngos in the region the only institution that is functional in these villages is the village panchayat thus it is a big challenge to design and promote new institutional entities for utfi management all the farmers interviewed in jiwai jadid pilot village reported that during the monsoon july september and winter months december march water availability is adequate though they face water scarcity during summer months april july water yields of irrigation well as well as handpumps used for drinking water go down during summer according to one woman respondent we have to pump 10 15 times to fill one bucket of water 20 l during the monsoon as compared to the summer when we have to pump 20 25 times to fill one bucket although there is a declining trend in groundwater levels and the community faces seasonal water scarcity the majority of the jiwai jadid farmers reported that the village s water resources are still sufficiently abundant and water management is not a top priority hence the community has no incentive to act collectively impacting the utfi intervention none of the participants were willing to voluntarily contribute to the management operation and maintenance of utfi one male respondents commented at present we can t contribute from our own pockets but if support is provided from outside or we see some actual benefits then we would be willing to help managing the structures another factor that hinders the community s motivation to participate in utfi is the absence of direct observable benefit from the intervention one interviewee male stated yes groundwater is going down because the number of borewells has increased a lot but i am not convinced about utfi and it s feasibility because i am not seeing any benefits in jiwai jadid between 26 000 and 62 000 m3 has been recharged over three years 2016 2018 and the farmers have noticed an increase in the water table but only during the rainy seasons however they are not able to gauge even the approximate level of increase in water table pre and post intervention during summer months there is no difference in water table pre and post intervention the majority of interviewees stated that they are unable to recognize whether the water table is increasing because of utfi groundwater goes up after monsoon season naturally and we do not know how much utfi is helping we need water in the summer so it would have been better if the structures were recharging in the summer there is a common belief in jiwai jadid that recharge should happen during the summer months which shows a lack of understanding with regards to utfi operations as stated by a farmer the site is operational for only two months of the year but if it were operational all year round then it would be more beneficial for the community additionally one irrigator stated for this to be beneficial to our community the structures should have been bigger or they should have built a dam instead the lack of understanding could be attributed to the lack of capacity building from the initial stages of the project additionally the majority of the community failed to realize the dual purpose of utfi this is because although the department of land development and water resources 2009 classifies rampur as a flood prone district the last severe flood was reported in the year 2010 though floods were reported during 2013 and 2015 since 2010 severe flood occurrence and frequency is limited in the village though flood damages are substantial communities don t perceive it as a major economic problem and hence the community did not draw any linkage between reduction in floods and utfi interventions on the other hand the inability of irrigators to recognize the benefits of utfi can be attributed to i the hydrogeological properties of alluvial aquifers as well as ii the scale of operations which is too small to show tangible economic benefits to the stakeholders therefore requires up scaling for its full benefits to be realized as concluded by gangopadhyay et al 2018 the preliminary results from the pilot site show an improvement in the local groundwater resources however to achieve the full benefit of the method it is required to implement it in larger scale although the preliminary assessment shows an increase in groundwater levels this increase has not been adequately recognised by the farmers the community s social composition and weak local institutions are factors that contribute to the lack of collective action and hence motivation to participate in utfi collective action is weak in jiwai jadid especially with regards to groundwater management since the majority of farmers have private wells amongst the jiwai jadid community there is a common belief agreed by all irrigators interviewed that the government is responsible for providing solutions in the form of subsidies and panchayat funds and believe that the utfi intervention should be under the ownership of the panchayat according to an irrigation farmer the panchayat should take over the management of utfi and if the panchayat is involved people will take it more seriously a few irrigators expressed an interest for creation of a subcommittee under the panchayat s control to manage utfi activities provided that the funds come from the government as people are not ready to support the maintenance activities from their own pocket some irrigators expressed interest in group committee formation in case the group is linked with activities that provide monetary benefits one example that was mentioned during the interview was to convert the utfi ponds into fishponds one irrigation farmer suggested the fisheries department can provide funds to grow fish in the pond 5 sustainable management of utfi the process of implementing utfi begins with identifying the potential areas viz flood prone areas with potential for groundwater recharge and utilisation potential sites are expected to experience floods during wet season and water shortage during dry season identifying such villages within the basin or watershed is the first step the second step prior to implementation it to identify the villages with suitable ponds that are connected to a source that can carry flood waters to fill the ponds during wet season the number of ponds required at the sub basin scale is estimated at 27 000 and the region has the potential to support the scaling up without any need for land allocation public or private pavelic et al forthcoming in these villages it is required to estimate the capital and operational costs during the village identification process prior to implementation it is essential to involve the village communities and the village panchayat by making them aware of the costs and benefits from the interventions additionally it is necessary to identify the implementing agency with technical expertise as well as to identify and or evolve local institutions or specific user groups at the village level with the help of village panchayat the roles and responsibilities of the user group need to be articulated clearly while the user group will be responsible for implementing and maintaining structures the village panchayat will provide the guidance and act as a monitoring authority once the implementation is completed regular maintenance of the structures as well as regular monitoring and evaluation the benefit flows especially during the flood and drought events needs to be ensured in what fallows workable implementation institutional arrangements are proposed based on the socioeconomic and institutional assessment along with the perceptions of the local communities and officials from district and block levels these arrangements are divided into short and long term arrangements 5 1 short term the main reasons for low levels of collective action within communities are their weak institutional and socioeconomic conditions and the limited perceived need for change in water management the low economic ability of the communities to support the implementation and post implementation responsibilities calls for public support especially during the initial stages this is very much reflected in the perceptions of the communities on taking up maintenance activities government can support the maintenance of utfi in three ways i programmatic ii departmental and iii administrative currently there are not many ongoing programs under which utfi can be placed the rural development department which is responsible for implementing the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme mgnregs through village panchayats has resources to support the labour component of the utfi interventions i e maintenance the infrastructure and capacity building components need additional support from other departments or sources such as the finance commission this requires inter departmental coordination at the district sub district levels and each department has its own mandate or guidelines therefore an administrative route would be appropriate and practical fig 4 especially in the short run because the administration has the authority and flexibility to pool financial and human resources at the district sub district level under the administrative authority of the district magistrate dm the chief district officer cdo coordinates the activities with the block and village level officials the block development officer bdo supported by the assistant development officer ado would be responsible for identifying the potential villages resourcing required funds and implementing utfi across the villages in their block technical and non technical support from the district authorities will be routed through block administration to the villages where utfi is being implemented at the ground level village panchayat would be given the responsibility to implement and maintain utfi structures while the village secretary coordinates the village and block level activities a utfi management committee umc would be formed as a community based organisation user group which is responsible for actual implementation and maintenance the existing open defecation free committees odfs that work under block administration could also be entrusted the responsibility to take up the works immediately or till a umc is formed though the district administration is divided on giving the responsibilities to the panchayati raj institution pri communities prefer village panchayat to handle the responsibilities besides there is merit 9 9 interface between the pris and the cbos would usher in better mechanisms of accountability linkages are necessary to sustain and strengthen the cbos and make them accountable to all the stakeholders at the gram sabha ratna et al 2009 in decentralisation and hence pri should play an overarching role in creating guiding and monitoring umc odf in reality pri is the only active institutional anchor present at the village level in the study region in order to overcome the limitations of pris viz elite capture political capture etc it is suggested to provide guidelines for forming the user groups a nuanced assessment of organising the local communities umc to manage utfi is needed to identify and strengthen the drivers of collective strategies which could be village specific 5 1 1 fund flows capital and operating costs utfi interventions requires one time capital expenditure as well as annual maintenance as discussed in the previous section though utfi interventions and management transcends number of areas administrative units departments and programmes availability of funds for implementing and maintaining the interventions is limited in the absence of any related on going programs watershed etc in the region at present administrative orders are issued for jiwai jadid pilot village giving the utfi responsibility to the village level and block level to the village panchayat and the block development officer respectively the district administration proposes to draw the capital expenditure from the central finance commission grants district magistrate will be the nodal administrative head at the district accessing these funds and route the funds to the pilot village through block administration the village panchayat would be given the responsibility of overseeing the implementation with the help of the umc fig 5 groundwater and minor irrigation departments could provide technical support to the programme and can take utfi under their programmes in the coming years involvement of these departments would ensure the linkages from the beginning as most of the aspects come under the purview of these departments operation and maintenance of the structures are taken up under the employment guarantee program implemented by the department of rural development the panchayat should play an overarching role of guiding and monitoring umc at present the available funds could not support the entire requirement of operation and maintenance due to the constraints within the programme while the funds could be utilised for pond maintenance which is required every few years the funds are not available every year for maintenance of the recharge wells 10 10 as per the programme guidelines the funds can be used for the same purpose only once in three years alternative sources of funding need to be explored either from the village or block or district level as discussed earlier various potential sources including village communities could be brought in with the support and partnership of district administration involvement of communities and village panchayat from the initial stages of utfi implementation would facilitate such support however it is important to note some potential drawbacks firstly during implementation of utfi in jiwai jadid one of the main challenges experienced were the frequent changes in block and district administration staff with every staff change the utfi implementation team had to pursue the administration for continued support secondly implementing participatory approaches and creating community based organizations cbos i e umc is by no means easy or straightforward especially in the context of weak institutional status of the case study village meaningfully engaging the community requires time and funds and is highly contextual depending on the community s needs and socio economic and cultural background therefore there is no unique strategy 5 2 medium long term 11 11 the discussion here may be considered as policy suggestions as the project team can t do much in this regard given the substantial economic benefits utfi could be linked or placed under some of the existing programs and institutions like watershed management water user associations participatory groundwater institutions ratna et al 2018 umc could be formed with the support from these existing programs integration of all these programmes is required as utfi addresses surface sub surface and watershed management aspects a practical problem with the programmatic approach is that at present none of these programs are active in the study region though some of them are likely to be implemented in the coming years another disadvantage is the absence of ngos in the region ngos play an important role in promoting and supporting community groups ratna et al 2009 and in ensuring fund flow mechanisms capacity building and monitoring and evaluation of the interventions at the village level which are critical aspects for scaling up of utfi interventions it is suggested that more emphasis is put on expanding and implementing the well needed government programs in the region as well as the district administration strengthening the ngo sector these suggestions would offer benefits to the region as a whole regardless of utfi support at the policy and political level is essential however to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks other sectors such as private and public sector banks as well as private companies under their corporate social responsibility could also be involved in promoting recharge activities banks and private sector are already supporting farmers to overcome climate risks in some regions viz providing market linkages and building the capacity of the communities to mitigate climate risks through promoting farmer producer organisations nabard 2015 the funding is meant to cover the cost of mobilizing farmers registration operation and management training exposure visits etc more emphasis on putting utfi under climate mitigation 12 12 utfi can address climate risks declining rainfall reduced groundwater recharge flash floods due to intense rainfall events and glacier melt strategy would help garnering funding support from such organizations 5 2 1 capacity building and training absence of perceived benefits from the interventions in jiwai jadid is the main bottleneck for collective action given the substantial long term benefits over costs from the interventions communities need to be motivated through awareness and capacity building along with monitoring and evaluation of incremental benefits with the scaling up of the interventions in jiwai jadid there have been number of community consultations and information sessions but awareness and capacity building and social mobilization has not occurred in a systematic manner it is increasingly recognized that human capital is a major shortfall when it comes to addressing pressing challenges of groundwater management in asia villholth 2009 therefore regardless of the instruments or incentives chosen to motivate the community the need for awareness and capacity building is highly critical for the success of the interventions 5 2 2 monitoring and evaluation monitoring and evaluation is critical for up and out scaling the interventions the base line information generated for the pilot village would help in capturing the impacts clearly at any future point however communities benefiting from the interventions are the best judges of the impacts on a regular basis district administration can monitor and evaluate indicators with the help of implementing agencies and the communities this helps in carrying out mid course corrections in the scaling out process a third party evaluation would be useful in providing unbiased assessment of the interventions at a later stage creating good baseline information for all the villages where utfi implementation is being planned is necessary for any robust future monitoring and evaluation this should be part of the intervention package 6 conclusions utfi interventions could provide environmental services through flood protection downstream and enhanced hydrological services upstream assessing the opportunities in terms of identifying locations communities that make economic rationale to capture the excess water from flooding and store in the aquifers for productive use afterwards is a first step in this direction community centered management systems are critical for sustaining these interventions at the village level since these interventions are mostly at the village level a number of village specific systems need to be created given the poor socioeconomic and institutional conditions of the region there is need for investment and involvement of public agencies the case study presented here outlines a management system based on the experience of pilot village given the limited scale of the case study the benefit flows from the interventions are not conspicuous though the estimated benefits from scaling up interventions at the sub basin level are substantial when compared to costs besides the region is not endowed with strong community based institutions however the pilot helped improving the awareness among the communities communities are willing to participate in the management of utfi interventions provided they get the financial and administrative support from the line departments under the supervision of village panchayat the district administration is willing to support the systems by pooling money from different sources and route them through block administration though this appears to be working in the short run there is need for evolving a systematic programmatic approach in the long run given that the district administration is convinced about the utfi benefits the interventions need to be scaled up in order to realise the benefits at a large scale for this there is need for policy changes like integrating utfi as part of regular ongoing programs like watershed development strengthening the social capital in the region through reviving the shgs and other cbos pertaining to agriculture though there are a number of policy initiatives at the central level viz farmer groups gopal mitra farmer producer organisations they are conspicuously absent in the region state and district administration need to promote these initiatives in the region at the same time taking up awareness and capacity building initiatives on the technical and socioeconomic aspects of utfi at the community as well as administrative level requires immediate attention of the district and state administration

5737,baseflow is the slowly varying portion of streamflow and it is essential for sustaining river flows several methods have been developed for separating baseflow from streamflow however due to the lack of measured baseflow past studies generally compared these baseflow separation methods qualitatively based on their hydrologic plausibility to quantitively determine which baseflow separation method has the best accuracy this study established a reliable evaluation criterion that relies only on measured streamflow by applying the evaluation criterion to 1815 catchments across the contiguous united states 9 baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were evaluated the evaluation result shows that the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 has the best performance and its performance is independent of catchment characteristics thus eckhardt digital filter method is recommended for baseflow separation across the contiguous united states keywords evaluation baseflow separation digital filter 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of streamflow that comes from groundwater storage and other delayed sources hall 1968 accurate baseflow estimation is of significance for catchment ecological protection and water resources management sánchez murillo 2014 singh et al 2019 baseflow can be obtained using isotopic chemical tracer methods genereux 1998 jones et al 2006 miller et al 2014 muñoz villers et al 2016 while the tracer based methods are expensive and laborious in field measurements lott and stewart 2016 therefore numerous non tracer based methods have been developed to estimate baseflow from streamflow without field measurements such as graphic methods and digital filter methods the graphic methods estimate baseflow by connecting specific low flow points of a streamflow hydrograph institute of hydrology 1980 sloto and crouse 1996 the digital filter methods estimate baseflow by signal analysis with the assumption that baseflow is the low frequency part of streamflow chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lin et al 2007 lyne and hollick 1979 tularam and ilahee 2007 a number of graphic methods and digital filter methods are used in different basins worldwide arnold and allen 1999 gnann et al 2019 taormina et al 2015 wu et al 2019 typically used graphic methods include the smoothed minima method developed by the uk institute of hydrology 1980 and three methods involved in the computer program called hysep sloto and crouse 1996 lyne and hollick 1979 proposed the earliest digital filter method lh method which was found to yield similar baseflow separation results to the smoothed minima method nathan and mcmahon 1990 based on the lh method chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 tularam and ilahee 2008 developed several digital filter methods with different equation forms all of these non tracer based methods only need streamflow as input and can provide objective and repeatable baseflow separation baratelli et al 2018 nevertheless it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of baseflow estimation for these baseflow separation methods li et al 2014 since baseflow cannot be measured directly previous studies commonly compare different baseflow separation methods based on their hydrologic plausibility such as the delayed response of baseflow nathan and mcmahon 1990 compared the lh digital filter method with a graphic method by analyzing their differences in the estimation of the baseflow index bfi namely the ratio of baseflow to streamflow they found that the lh digital filter method has a better performance chapman 1999 compared three digital filter methods with a different number of parameters in 11 basins and concluded that the two parameter method provides a smooth baseflow peak and is more plausible than the one parameter or three parameter method although these comparisons provide some insightful results for the performances of baseflow separation methods these comparisons are qualitative and tend to be affected by subjective errors partington et al 2012 in order to quantitively evaluate different baseflow separation methods several studies have used baseflow estimated from hydrologic models or tracer based methods as the baseflow reference furey and gupta 2003 found that the baseflow estimated from a digital filter method agrees well with that estimated from a hydrologic model partington et al 2012 evaluated 10 baseflow separation methods using the reference baseflow simulated by the hydrogeosphere hydrologic model similar studies using the baseflow simulated by hydrologic models as the reference were conducted in li et al 2014 and su et al 2016 as for using the baseflow derived from tracer based methods as the reference gonzales et al 2009 compared 7 baseflow separation methods with a dissolved silica based method and suggested that the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 is suitable for lowland catchments lott and stewart 2016 used specific conductance as a tracer to obtain baseflow for evaluating 6 baseflow separation methods these evaluations are quantitive and seem to be more reasonable however both hydrologic models and tracer based methods have noticeable limitations in baseflow estimation hydrologic models have their uncertainties in baseflow estimation due to the oversimplification of baseflow generation processes bai et al 2018 gallart et al 2007 wang et al 2018 tracer based methods are limited by their high cost and intensive labor miller et al 2015 the present study aims to establish a reliable evaluation criterion that does not rely on hydrologic models or tracers and then apply this criterion to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods in 1815 catchments with different climatic and topographic conditions 2 study area and data used 2 1 streamflow observations and study catchments daily streamflow observations were obtained from the dataset of geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow ii gages ii the gages ii dataset includes long term daily streamflow observations in the continental united states falcone 2011 gages ii dataset identifies 2057 catchments with limited influence of human activities based on a hydrologic disturbance index falcone et al 2010 additionally the dataset provides monthly average air temperature derived from the 800 m parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism dataset daly et al 2008 the average air temperature between november 1 and march 31 denoted by tm was used to identify if the catchment is frozen in winter if a catchment satisfies tm 0 then the catchment is frozen in winter thus streamflow observations between november 1 and march 31 of these catchments with tm 0 were excluded to avoid the influence of freezing we applied two exclusion steps to the 2057 catchments with limited anthropogenic influences in the gages ii dataset to minimize the impact of river channel routing and avoid localized precipitation in dry periods beck et al 2013 santhi et al 2008 catchments with an area larger than 5000 km2 were excluded additionally to reduce the uncertainties in estimating parameters of the nine baseflow separation methods and ensure the reliability of baseflow evaluation catchments with streamflow observations less than 5 years were excluded the two exclusion steps screened out 1815 catchments from the gages ii dataset as shown in fig 1 all 1815 catchments have long term daily streamflow observations and spread across the contiguous us which provides an opportunity to identify the relationships between different catchment characteristics and the performances of baseflow separation methods 2 2 climatic and topographic characteristics sixteen climatic and topographic characteristics were used to analyze the relationships between the performances of baseflow separation methods and catchment characteristics beck et al 2013 used similar climatic and topographic characteristics to estimate global baseflow index bfi which shows that potential evapotranspiration pet air temperature ta percent of snow to total precipitation snow mean elevation elev and percent of water water were moderately well related to bfi the 16 characteristics and their descriptions were listed in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 baseflow evaluation criterion since the baseflow cannot be measured directly it is a challenge to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods here we established a reliable evaluation criterion to evaluate different baseflow separation methods the main guideline is as follows the streamflow is equal to baseflow when the quick flow the sum of interflow and overland flow ceases in the catchment we selected daily streamflow of these days when quick flow ceases as strict baseflow points these strict baseflow points were put together as the baseflow reference unlike using tracer based methods to find all baseflow points as the reference using strict baseflow points as the reference relies only on daily streamflow and can be applied for a large number of catchments strict baseflow points can be obtained through the following four rules brutsaert 2008 erase all the data points of daily streamflow with dy dt 0 where d y i dt y i 1 y i 1 2 eliminate the previous 2 points before points with dy dt 0 as well as the next 3 points eliminate 5 points after major events that were identified by flood peaks greater than the 90th quantile of all streamflow observations cheng et al 2016 exclude data points followed by a data point with smaller dy dt namely d 2 y d x 2 0 explanations of the four rules are as follows 1 since the streamflow would drop when there is no quick flow the daily streamflow points with non negative dy dt are points contain quick flow and should be removed 2 to avoid the effect of possible precipitation which cannot offset the decrease of baseflow two points before the non negative dy dt are eliminated 3 considering the movement duration of quick flow to catchment outlets three points after the non negative dy dt or five points after major events are eliminated 4 moreover dy dt is expected to decrease monotonically during a recession period the daily streamflow points followed by a larger dy dt are likely caused by measurement errors and should be removed the four rules can be divided into 2 categories according to their purposes the first three rules are set to remove daily streamflow points that may have quick flow and the last rule is set to remove daily streamflow points that violate the pattern of baseflow recession during dry periods namely followed by a larger dy dt daily streamflow points removed by the four rules are illustrated in fig 2 after implementing the four rules the remaining daily streamflow points red circle in fig 2 are strict baseflow points which were used as the baseflow reference to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 nse 1 t t 1 t 2 t n q m t q 0 t 2 t t 1 t 2 t n q 0 t q 0 2 where t 1 t 2 t n represent the date of the nth strict baseflow point q m t is the baseflow estimated from a baseflow separation method in date t q 0 t is the value of the strict baseflow point in date t q 0 is the mean value of all strict baseflow points nse is the evaluation criterion for the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods nse ranges from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect match of the baseflow estimated from the baseflow separation method and the strict baseflow points kling gupta efficiency kge was also used to evaluate the accuracies of the nine baseflow separation methods knoben et al 2019 2 kge 1 r 1 2 σ m σ o 1 2 q m q 0 1 2 where r is the pearson s r between the value of strict baseflow points and corresponding estimated baseflow σ o is the standard deviation of strict baseflow points and σ m is the standard deviation of corresponding estimated baseflow q 0 is the mean value of strict baseflow points and q m is the mean value of corresponding estimated baseflow kge ranges from to 1 as well 3 2 baseflow separation methods nine baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were implemented in this study the baseflow separation methods must meet two requirements to be adopted in this evaluation i methods can be programmed and provide objective separation of baseflow ii methods rely on daily measured streamflow only some other baseflow separation methods do meet the two requirements such as the computer program part developed by the u s geological survey usgs rutledge 1998 however the part program is recommended to apply for catchments less than 500 square miles namely 1295 square kilometers we have tested this program and found that it did yield poor estimates in large catchments thus it was not used here to our best knowledge the adopted nine methods can represent the typical methods that rely on streamflow only the principles and details of these methods are described below 3 2 1 graphic methods the graphic method generally consists of two steps 1 find specific low flow points from a streamflow hydrograph 2 connect these points into a baseflow line and limit the baseflow line under the streamflow hydrograph as the baseflow hydrograph the four graphic methods used here are the smooth minima method developed by the uk institute of hydrology 1980 and three hysep methods developed by usgs sloto and crouse 1996 the smooth minima method is represented by ukih the three hysep methods are fixed interval method sliding interval method and local minimum method denoted by fixed slide local respectively 3 2 1 1 ukih method the key step of the ukih method is to find turning points the turning points are selected from daily streamflow points step by step as follows aksoy et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 divide the entire period of record into 5 day blocks without overlapping and denote the minimum streamflow of each block as q 1 q 2 q t make every three minimum points as a group namely q 1 q 2 q 3 q 2 q 3 q 4 q t 1 q t q t 1 select groups that satisfied q t 1 11 q t 1 and q t 1 11 q t 1 the central values of selected groups are turning points once all turning points are found the turning points are linearly interpolated as a baseflow line the baseflow hydrograph is constructed by restricting the baseflow line smaller than the streamflow hydrograph 3 2 1 2 hysep methods the hysep methods include three optional algorithms namely fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum these algorithms are different in selections of the low flow points the local minimum method local method is taken as an example to briefly introduce the hysep methods sloto and crouse 1996 first estimate the movement duration of overland flow from the empirical relation 3 n a 0 2 where n is the number of days when the overland flow will cease and a is the basin area in square miles next the entire period of streamflow is traversed with a sliding window whose interval is equal to the odd integer nearest to 2 n if the streamflow of window median date is the lowest streamflow in the window then it is a local minimum point finally these local minimum points are connected to define the baseflow hydrograph 3 2 2 digital filter methods lyne and hollick 1979 chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 tularam and ilahee 2008 developed several digital filtering baseflow separation methods with different equation forms denoted by lh method chapman method cm method eckhardt method and ewma method respectively all of these digital filter methods have the consistent assumptions baseflow is the low frequency part of the streamflow that responds slowly to the precipitation and quick flow interflow and overland flow is the high frequency part that responds quickly to the precipitation the initial baseflow values of the five digital filter methods are set to the streamflow values on january 1 of the year in which the streamflow records started 3 2 2 1 lh method lyne and hollick method lh method is a widely used baseflow separation method based on digital filter arnold and allen 1999 gnann et al 2019 its equation is as follows 4 f k β f k 1 1 β 2 y k y k 1 in the constraint of 5 f k 0 where f k indicates the kth quick flow filtered by eq 4 β is the filter parameter and y k is the sum of kth baseflow and quick flow 6 b k y k f k it is worth noting that the filter parameter β has a low physical connection with the catchment characteristics β could be 0 8 0 925 0 95 etc in this study 0 925 is assigned to α according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 additionally the filter was passed two times forward and backward to nullify the phase distortion according to spongberg 2000 3 2 2 2 chapman method chapman 1991 commented that the lh method is unreasonable when there is no quick flow if eliminating f k in eqs 4 with equation 6 7 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 0 b k y k the simplification of eq 7 would be b k b k 1 when there is no quick flow namely y k b k y k 1 b k 1 it is incompatible with the fact that baseflow decreases in drought periods to avoid this incompatibility chapman replaced y k with f k in eq 7 and obtained a new digital filter method with the form of 8 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 f k f k 1 0 b k y k the new digital filter method satisfies the baseflow exponential recession wang 2011 under which the filter parameter α is recession constant α can be calculated by recession analysis eckhardt 2008 3 2 2 3 cm method by converting eq 8 to the weighted average of one day s quick flow and previous day s baseflow chapman and maxwell 1996 developed the following digital filter method 9 b k α b k 1 1 α f k f k 0 which can be written as 10 b k α 2 α b k 1 1 α 2 α y k 0 b k y k where α is recession constant and is calculated by recession analysis as well eckhardt 2008 3 2 2 4 eckhardt method eckhardt 2005 considers eq 10 can be summarized as a common form of digital filter method 11 b k a b k 1 b y k with the linear reservoir assumption and a new parameter bf i max which indicates the maximum value of bfi a two parameter digital filter method deduced from eq 11 is established 12 b k 1 b f i max α b k 1 1 α b f i max y k 1 α b f i max α is the recession constant bf i max is determined according to the field investigation of hydrogeological conditions eckhardt 2008 suggested that bf i max is equal to 0 8 for perennial streams with porous aquifers 0 5 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers in order to implement eckhardt method without the field investigation of hydrogeological conditions collischonn and fan 2013 put forward a backward filter method that uses the recession constant to calculate bf i max 13 b k 1 b k α b k y k a backward iterative operation based on eq 13 is performed on the daily streamflow then bf i max is obtained by dividing the maximum possible total baseflow by the total streamflow we applied the backward filter to generate different bf i max parameters for each of the 1815 catchments which to some extent reflect the soil heterogeneities and the spatial variations of hydroclimatic variables 3 2 2 5 ewma method the exponential weighted moving average ewma filter tularam and ilahee 2008 is in the form of 14 b k ε y k 1 ε b k 1 0 b k y k where ε is the smoothing constant in previous studies ε ranges from 0 011 to 0 015 indarto et al 2016 in this study ε is set to the average value namely 0 013 4 results 4 1 comparisons of baseflow separation methods fig 3 shows the evaluation result each box in the figure represents the nse or kge distribution of the corresponding baseflow separation method for the 1815 catchments the nse median values for each method namely the horizontal black lines for each box in fig 3a are 0 68 0 84 0 93 0 94 0 69 0 91 0 84 0 84 0 98 from left to right the kge median values for each method namely the horizontal black lines for each box in fig 3b are 0 45 0 75 0 80 0 76 0 25 0 70 0 72 0 75 0 94 from left to right overall the eckhardt method has the best performance with both the largest nse median value and the largest kge median value on the other hand we compared the nine baseflow separation methods based on their hydrologic plausibility fig 4 shows the separation outcomes of the nine methods subjective comparison results are as follows i the five digital filter methods generally yield a smoother baseflow than the four graphic methods ii focusing on the flood that occurred in february 2018 we found that baseflow peaks obtained by the chapman cm ewma and eckhardt methods occurred after streamflow peaks while the other methods do not have the phenomenon the delayed baseflow peaks may be reasonable as it takes less time for the interflow and overland flow to converge into a river than for the baseflow iii the lh chapman and eckhardt methods return medium volumes of baseflow among the nine methods to summarize the eckhardt method may have better performance than other methods in terms of the hydrologic plausibility this conclusion matches the result of a case study that used baseflow estimated from a tracer based method as the reference to evaluate 7 non tracer based methods gonzales et al 2009 the bfi of the 1815 catchments calculated from the eckhardt method is shown in fig 5 4 2 performances of baseflow separation methods in different catchments eckhardt method is also the most robust method by analyzing the spatial distribution of method performances in fig 6 eckhardt method has the best performance in 1145 catchments blue circles in fig 6 slide method has the best performance in 324 catchments red triangles and cm method has the best performance in 187 catchments purple squares fixed method chapman method ewma method local method and ukih method together have the best performance in the remaining 159 catchments lh method does not have the best performance in all catchments although slide and cm methods together have the best performances in 511 catchments the performance differences between the two methods and eckhardt method is small in the 511 catchments the catchments where slide method has the best performance are mainly located in the west coast and new england the mean nse value of slide method nseslide in these catchments is 0 96 and the mean nse value of eckhardt method nseeckhardt in these catchments is 0 87 the catchments where cm method has the best performance are mainly located in the south of the midwest region the mean nse value of cm method nsecm in these catchments is 0 97 and the mean nseeckhardt in these catchments is 0 92 the comparisons indicate that eckhardt method also has a relatively good performance in the 511 catchments 4 3 relationships between method performances and catchment characteristics the relationships between nseeckhardt and 16 catchment characteristics are shown in fig 7 the pearson s r between nseeckhardt and the 16 characteristics range from 0 15 to 0 09 all the values of pearson s r satisfying r 0 3 means that the relationships between nse eckhardt and the 16 characteristics are weak the spearman s ρ between nseeckhardt and the 16 characteristics range from 0 12 to 0 12 and yield the same conclusion this conclusion is consistent with the finding in fig 6 that is the performance of eckhardt method is independent of catchment characteristics additionally the relationships between the kge value of eckhardt method kge eckhardt and the 16 characteristics are weak r 0 3 as well which implies that the choice of the two evaluation metrics does not have significant effects on the results we noted that the p value of correlation test might be misleading for a large number of catchments beck et al 2013 lin et al 2013 sullivan and feinn 2012 as the p value is influenced by the sample size besides the correlation test uses p value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis r 0 or not which does not determine the strength of a linear relationship thus the p value was not calculated here the relationships between the performances of the other baseflow separation methods and catchment characteristics are shown in the supplements 5 discussion 5 1 effects of parameter estimations on the method performances the parameter estimations of the four graphic methods may lead to their poor performances in specific catchments contrary to the eckhardt method the performances of the four graphic methods are related to several catchment characteristics fig 8 shows the relationships between the nse value of local method nse local and the 16 catchment characteristics six catchment characteristics including ai pet snow elev slo and forest are moderately well related to the nse local r greater than 0 30 red lines in fig 8 which implies that the performance of local method is likely to be positively correlated with snow and forest it can be explained as follows if the percentage of snowfall or forest in a catchment is relatively low the eq 3 tends to overestimate the duration of overland flow n days in the catchment as the eq 3 only depends on the catchment area and does not take climatic or topographic characteristics into account since the local method used 2n as the interval of a sliding window to traverse the entire period of streamflow overestimating n will result in more baseflow that cannot be separated and produce a lower nse the other three graphic methods ukih fixed and slide methods have the similar pattern due to the poor estimates of the parameter n in particular the ukih method use a constant 5 as an estimate of the parameter n which may be the cause of the worst performance among the four graphic methods as for the digital filter methods both lh method and ewma method adopt fixed filter parameters the other three digital filter methods chapman cm and eckhardt methods use the recession analysis to estimate the recession constant α parameters for each of the 1815 catchments and eckhardt method also uses the backward filter to generate different bf i max parameters for different catchments the different parameter estimations may be one of the reasons for the different performances of the digital filter methods although the eckhardt method has the best performance there are still a few outliers in specific catchments table 2 shows the variable statistics of the 19 catchments with the lowest nse values of the eckhardt method nseeckhardt we found that most of the outliers occurred in catchments with a low streamflow volume for instance the usgs no 02301990 catchment has a low streamflow volume during dry periods the floods dramatically increased the streamflow volume of the catchment while the floods lasted only a few days such a kind of streamflow may lead to an underestimation of the bf i max parameter which makes the eckhardt method less effective as shown in the last two columns of table 2 if we used a fixed value of 0 8 for the bf i max parameters of the 19 catchments all nseeckhardt will increase a lower α parameter will increase the nseeckhardt as well consequently to gain better performance of the eckhardt method future studies are warranted to optimize the parameter bf i max and α by employing hydroclimatic characteristics and other related data 5 2 uncertainties of digital filter methods there are two main sources of uncertainties in digital filter methods namely the linear reservoir assumption and the approximation of groundwater recharge the digital filter methods estimate recession constant with the linear reservoir assumption 15 s k b s is the groundwater storage above the zero flow level k is the characteristic duration that streamflow decreases to 37 of the first day in a dry series brutsaert 2008 b is the baseflow in the outlet of the catchment incorporating eq 15 with the groundwater balance equation 16 ds dt μ b the recession constant α is derived 17 α b t δ t b t e 1 k δ t μ is the groundwater recharge that infiltrates into the water table and is equal to 0 in dry periods δ t is the time interval and is usually equal to 1 day previous studies find that the relationship between groundwater storage and baseflow is non linear brutsaert and nieber 1977 huyck et al 2005 troch et al 1993 assume that the non linear relationship is of the simple form 18 s f b incorporating eq 16 with 18 two outcomes are yielded 19 α b t δ t b t e b s δ t 20 b t δ t α b t 1 α μ t the difference of eqs 17 and 19 implies the uncertainty of linear reservoir assumption although the linear reservoir assumption generated α parameters with spatial variations these α parameters were static in time since the α parameters should vary in time due to changes in soil moisture fenicia et al 2006 gan and luo 2013 it might yield better baseflow outcomes for the digital filter methods to use a nonlinear reservoir assumption to estimate a time varying α parameter another uncertainty is the approximation of groundwater recharge μ t in eq 20 μ t is approximately estimated using eqs 21 22 23 in chapman method cm method eckhardt method respectively 21 μ t f t f t δ t 2 22 μ t f t δ t 23 μ t bf i max 1 b f i max f t δ t the above three approximations use the same assumption that the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow is constant over time which is a source of error in digital filter methods nonetheless eq 23 is a more reasonable approximation than eqs 21 and 22 bf i max in eq 23 can be considered as the average ratio of groundwater recharge to the total streamflow and bf i max 1 b f i max is the average ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow the ratio should vary in space due to the soil heterogeneity thus it is more reasonable to use bf i max 1 b f i max to estimate the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow in different catchments than to use a constant 1 as the ratio for all catchments further studies could introduce machine learning approaches to better estimate groundwater recharge for reducing the uncertainties of digital filter methods fotovatikhah et al 2018 moazenzadeh et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019 5 3 reasonableness of evaluation criterion to our best knowledge only two previous studies use strict baseflow points to evaluate baseflow separation methods furey and gupta 2001 considered that the annual minimum value of daily streamflow is predominantly baseflow and can be used as the reference of baseflow for evaluating different separation methods these limited strict baseflow points could lead to a relatively low statistical significance indarto et al 2016 found that no or limited precipitation occurs from july and september in the east java regions and streamflow observations from july and september can be used as the reference baseflow this evaluation criterion can only be used in specific regions the evaluation criterion used in this study seems to be more reasonable than the above two criterions firstly the strict baseflow points in this study are evenly distributed over time which means that both dry periods and wet periods have strict baseflow points for evaluation secondly about 59 of strict baseflow points are larger than q 50 the streamflow value that 50 time equaled or exceeded which implies that strict baseflow points at the beginning of baseflow recessions can be successfully selected by using these points at the beginning of baseflow recessions to evaluate baseflow separation methods their plausibility of hydrologic behavior such as the delayed response of baseflow can be described quantitatively although this evaluation criterion has advantages that only need daily streamflow as input to reflect the hydrologic plausibility of the estimated baseflow it has a limitation in determining the accuracies of baseflow points near the streamflow peaks considering the complexity of the baseflow generation processes and the availability of massive earth system data the use of advanced soft computing techniques may help predict baseflow points near the streamflow peaks chau 2019 qasem et al 2019 thereby making the evaluation criterion more effective 6 conclusions by selecting strict baseflow points as the reference a reliable evaluation criterion was established to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods in this study the evaluation criterion only needs streamflow as input and can be applied to different catchments with streamflow observations nine baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were evaluated in 1815 catchments across the contiguous united states the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 has the best performance in 1145 catchments in the catchments where other baseflow separation methods have the best performance the eckhardt method also has a relatively good performance in addition the performance of eckhardt method is independent of catchment characteristics therefore eckhardt method is recommended for baseflow separation across the contiguous united states further researches could concentrate on the following aspects to improve the accuracy of baseflow estimation 1 applying the evaluation criterion to evaluate baseflow separation methods that rely on precipitation and hydraulic data 2 employing hydroclimatic data to estimate the parameter bf i max and the recession constant α 3 introducing state of the art machine learning approaches in baseflow separation 4 incorporating non linear reservoir method into the calculation of baseflow recession parameters 5 accurate estimations or measurements of

5737,baseflow is the slowly varying portion of streamflow and it is essential for sustaining river flows several methods have been developed for separating baseflow from streamflow however due to the lack of measured baseflow past studies generally compared these baseflow separation methods qualitatively based on their hydrologic plausibility to quantitively determine which baseflow separation method has the best accuracy this study established a reliable evaluation criterion that relies only on measured streamflow by applying the evaluation criterion to 1815 catchments across the contiguous united states 9 baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were evaluated the evaluation result shows that the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 has the best performance and its performance is independent of catchment characteristics thus eckhardt digital filter method is recommended for baseflow separation across the contiguous united states keywords evaluation baseflow separation digital filter 1 introduction baseflow is the portion of streamflow that comes from groundwater storage and other delayed sources hall 1968 accurate baseflow estimation is of significance for catchment ecological protection and water resources management sánchez murillo 2014 singh et al 2019 baseflow can be obtained using isotopic chemical tracer methods genereux 1998 jones et al 2006 miller et al 2014 muñoz villers et al 2016 while the tracer based methods are expensive and laborious in field measurements lott and stewart 2016 therefore numerous non tracer based methods have been developed to estimate baseflow from streamflow without field measurements such as graphic methods and digital filter methods the graphic methods estimate baseflow by connecting specific low flow points of a streamflow hydrograph institute of hydrology 1980 sloto and crouse 1996 the digital filter methods estimate baseflow by signal analysis with the assumption that baseflow is the low frequency part of streamflow chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lin et al 2007 lyne and hollick 1979 tularam and ilahee 2007 a number of graphic methods and digital filter methods are used in different basins worldwide arnold and allen 1999 gnann et al 2019 taormina et al 2015 wu et al 2019 typically used graphic methods include the smoothed minima method developed by the uk institute of hydrology 1980 and three methods involved in the computer program called hysep sloto and crouse 1996 lyne and hollick 1979 proposed the earliest digital filter method lh method which was found to yield similar baseflow separation results to the smoothed minima method nathan and mcmahon 1990 based on the lh method chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 tularam and ilahee 2008 developed several digital filter methods with different equation forms all of these non tracer based methods only need streamflow as input and can provide objective and repeatable baseflow separation baratelli et al 2018 nevertheless it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of baseflow estimation for these baseflow separation methods li et al 2014 since baseflow cannot be measured directly previous studies commonly compare different baseflow separation methods based on their hydrologic plausibility such as the delayed response of baseflow nathan and mcmahon 1990 compared the lh digital filter method with a graphic method by analyzing their differences in the estimation of the baseflow index bfi namely the ratio of baseflow to streamflow they found that the lh digital filter method has a better performance chapman 1999 compared three digital filter methods with a different number of parameters in 11 basins and concluded that the two parameter method provides a smooth baseflow peak and is more plausible than the one parameter or three parameter method although these comparisons provide some insightful results for the performances of baseflow separation methods these comparisons are qualitative and tend to be affected by subjective errors partington et al 2012 in order to quantitively evaluate different baseflow separation methods several studies have used baseflow estimated from hydrologic models or tracer based methods as the baseflow reference furey and gupta 2003 found that the baseflow estimated from a digital filter method agrees well with that estimated from a hydrologic model partington et al 2012 evaluated 10 baseflow separation methods using the reference baseflow simulated by the hydrogeosphere hydrologic model similar studies using the baseflow simulated by hydrologic models as the reference were conducted in li et al 2014 and su et al 2016 as for using the baseflow derived from tracer based methods as the reference gonzales et al 2009 compared 7 baseflow separation methods with a dissolved silica based method and suggested that the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 is suitable for lowland catchments lott and stewart 2016 used specific conductance as a tracer to obtain baseflow for evaluating 6 baseflow separation methods these evaluations are quantitive and seem to be more reasonable however both hydrologic models and tracer based methods have noticeable limitations in baseflow estimation hydrologic models have their uncertainties in baseflow estimation due to the oversimplification of baseflow generation processes bai et al 2018 gallart et al 2007 wang et al 2018 tracer based methods are limited by their high cost and intensive labor miller et al 2015 the present study aims to establish a reliable evaluation criterion that does not rely on hydrologic models or tracers and then apply this criterion to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods in 1815 catchments with different climatic and topographic conditions 2 study area and data used 2 1 streamflow observations and study catchments daily streamflow observations were obtained from the dataset of geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow ii gages ii the gages ii dataset includes long term daily streamflow observations in the continental united states falcone 2011 gages ii dataset identifies 2057 catchments with limited influence of human activities based on a hydrologic disturbance index falcone et al 2010 additionally the dataset provides monthly average air temperature derived from the 800 m parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism dataset daly et al 2008 the average air temperature between november 1 and march 31 denoted by tm was used to identify if the catchment is frozen in winter if a catchment satisfies tm 0 then the catchment is frozen in winter thus streamflow observations between november 1 and march 31 of these catchments with tm 0 were excluded to avoid the influence of freezing we applied two exclusion steps to the 2057 catchments with limited anthropogenic influences in the gages ii dataset to minimize the impact of river channel routing and avoid localized precipitation in dry periods beck et al 2013 santhi et al 2008 catchments with an area larger than 5000 km2 were excluded additionally to reduce the uncertainties in estimating parameters of the nine baseflow separation methods and ensure the reliability of baseflow evaluation catchments with streamflow observations less than 5 years were excluded the two exclusion steps screened out 1815 catchments from the gages ii dataset as shown in fig 1 all 1815 catchments have long term daily streamflow observations and spread across the contiguous us which provides an opportunity to identify the relationships between different catchment characteristics and the performances of baseflow separation methods 2 2 climatic and topographic characteristics sixteen climatic and topographic characteristics were used to analyze the relationships between the performances of baseflow separation methods and catchment characteristics beck et al 2013 used similar climatic and topographic characteristics to estimate global baseflow index bfi which shows that potential evapotranspiration pet air temperature ta percent of snow to total precipitation snow mean elevation elev and percent of water water were moderately well related to bfi the 16 characteristics and their descriptions were listed in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 baseflow evaluation criterion since the baseflow cannot be measured directly it is a challenge to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods here we established a reliable evaluation criterion to evaluate different baseflow separation methods the main guideline is as follows the streamflow is equal to baseflow when the quick flow the sum of interflow and overland flow ceases in the catchment we selected daily streamflow of these days when quick flow ceases as strict baseflow points these strict baseflow points were put together as the baseflow reference unlike using tracer based methods to find all baseflow points as the reference using strict baseflow points as the reference relies only on daily streamflow and can be applied for a large number of catchments strict baseflow points can be obtained through the following four rules brutsaert 2008 erase all the data points of daily streamflow with dy dt 0 where d y i dt y i 1 y i 1 2 eliminate the previous 2 points before points with dy dt 0 as well as the next 3 points eliminate 5 points after major events that were identified by flood peaks greater than the 90th quantile of all streamflow observations cheng et al 2016 exclude data points followed by a data point with smaller dy dt namely d 2 y d x 2 0 explanations of the four rules are as follows 1 since the streamflow would drop when there is no quick flow the daily streamflow points with non negative dy dt are points contain quick flow and should be removed 2 to avoid the effect of possible precipitation which cannot offset the decrease of baseflow two points before the non negative dy dt are eliminated 3 considering the movement duration of quick flow to catchment outlets three points after the non negative dy dt or five points after major events are eliminated 4 moreover dy dt is expected to decrease monotonically during a recession period the daily streamflow points followed by a larger dy dt are likely caused by measurement errors and should be removed the four rules can be divided into 2 categories according to their purposes the first three rules are set to remove daily streamflow points that may have quick flow and the last rule is set to remove daily streamflow points that violate the pattern of baseflow recession during dry periods namely followed by a larger dy dt daily streamflow points removed by the four rules are illustrated in fig 2 after implementing the four rules the remaining daily streamflow points red circle in fig 2 are strict baseflow points which were used as the baseflow reference to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 nse 1 t t 1 t 2 t n q m t q 0 t 2 t t 1 t 2 t n q 0 t q 0 2 where t 1 t 2 t n represent the date of the nth strict baseflow point q m t is the baseflow estimated from a baseflow separation method in date t q 0 t is the value of the strict baseflow point in date t q 0 is the mean value of all strict baseflow points nse is the evaluation criterion for the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods nse ranges from to 1 nse 1 indicates a perfect match of the baseflow estimated from the baseflow separation method and the strict baseflow points kling gupta efficiency kge was also used to evaluate the accuracies of the nine baseflow separation methods knoben et al 2019 2 kge 1 r 1 2 σ m σ o 1 2 q m q 0 1 2 where r is the pearson s r between the value of strict baseflow points and corresponding estimated baseflow σ o is the standard deviation of strict baseflow points and σ m is the standard deviation of corresponding estimated baseflow q 0 is the mean value of strict baseflow points and q m is the mean value of corresponding estimated baseflow kge ranges from to 1 as well 3 2 baseflow separation methods nine baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were implemented in this study the baseflow separation methods must meet two requirements to be adopted in this evaluation i methods can be programmed and provide objective separation of baseflow ii methods rely on daily measured streamflow only some other baseflow separation methods do meet the two requirements such as the computer program part developed by the u s geological survey usgs rutledge 1998 however the part program is recommended to apply for catchments less than 500 square miles namely 1295 square kilometers we have tested this program and found that it did yield poor estimates in large catchments thus it was not used here to our best knowledge the adopted nine methods can represent the typical methods that rely on streamflow only the principles and details of these methods are described below 3 2 1 graphic methods the graphic method generally consists of two steps 1 find specific low flow points from a streamflow hydrograph 2 connect these points into a baseflow line and limit the baseflow line under the streamflow hydrograph as the baseflow hydrograph the four graphic methods used here are the smooth minima method developed by the uk institute of hydrology 1980 and three hysep methods developed by usgs sloto and crouse 1996 the smooth minima method is represented by ukih the three hysep methods are fixed interval method sliding interval method and local minimum method denoted by fixed slide local respectively 3 2 1 1 ukih method the key step of the ukih method is to find turning points the turning points are selected from daily streamflow points step by step as follows aksoy et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 divide the entire period of record into 5 day blocks without overlapping and denote the minimum streamflow of each block as q 1 q 2 q t make every three minimum points as a group namely q 1 q 2 q 3 q 2 q 3 q 4 q t 1 q t q t 1 select groups that satisfied q t 1 11 q t 1 and q t 1 11 q t 1 the central values of selected groups are turning points once all turning points are found the turning points are linearly interpolated as a baseflow line the baseflow hydrograph is constructed by restricting the baseflow line smaller than the streamflow hydrograph 3 2 1 2 hysep methods the hysep methods include three optional algorithms namely fixed interval sliding interval and local minimum these algorithms are different in selections of the low flow points the local minimum method local method is taken as an example to briefly introduce the hysep methods sloto and crouse 1996 first estimate the movement duration of overland flow from the empirical relation 3 n a 0 2 where n is the number of days when the overland flow will cease and a is the basin area in square miles next the entire period of streamflow is traversed with a sliding window whose interval is equal to the odd integer nearest to 2 n if the streamflow of window median date is the lowest streamflow in the window then it is a local minimum point finally these local minimum points are connected to define the baseflow hydrograph 3 2 2 digital filter methods lyne and hollick 1979 chapman 1991 chapman and maxwell 1996 eckhardt 2005 tularam and ilahee 2008 developed several digital filtering baseflow separation methods with different equation forms denoted by lh method chapman method cm method eckhardt method and ewma method respectively all of these digital filter methods have the consistent assumptions baseflow is the low frequency part of the streamflow that responds slowly to the precipitation and quick flow interflow and overland flow is the high frequency part that responds quickly to the precipitation the initial baseflow values of the five digital filter methods are set to the streamflow values on january 1 of the year in which the streamflow records started 3 2 2 1 lh method lyne and hollick method lh method is a widely used baseflow separation method based on digital filter arnold and allen 1999 gnann et al 2019 its equation is as follows 4 f k β f k 1 1 β 2 y k y k 1 in the constraint of 5 f k 0 where f k indicates the kth quick flow filtered by eq 4 β is the filter parameter and y k is the sum of kth baseflow and quick flow 6 b k y k f k it is worth noting that the filter parameter β has a low physical connection with the catchment characteristics β could be 0 8 0 925 0 95 etc in this study 0 925 is assigned to α according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 additionally the filter was passed two times forward and backward to nullify the phase distortion according to spongberg 2000 3 2 2 2 chapman method chapman 1991 commented that the lh method is unreasonable when there is no quick flow if eliminating f k in eqs 4 with equation 6 7 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 y k y k 1 0 b k y k the simplification of eq 7 would be b k b k 1 when there is no quick flow namely y k b k y k 1 b k 1 it is incompatible with the fact that baseflow decreases in drought periods to avoid this incompatibility chapman replaced y k with f k in eq 7 and obtained a new digital filter method with the form of 8 b k α b k 1 1 α 2 f k f k 1 0 b k y k the new digital filter method satisfies the baseflow exponential recession wang 2011 under which the filter parameter α is recession constant α can be calculated by recession analysis eckhardt 2008 3 2 2 3 cm method by converting eq 8 to the weighted average of one day s quick flow and previous day s baseflow chapman and maxwell 1996 developed the following digital filter method 9 b k α b k 1 1 α f k f k 0 which can be written as 10 b k α 2 α b k 1 1 α 2 α y k 0 b k y k where α is recession constant and is calculated by recession analysis as well eckhardt 2008 3 2 2 4 eckhardt method eckhardt 2005 considers eq 10 can be summarized as a common form of digital filter method 11 b k a b k 1 b y k with the linear reservoir assumption and a new parameter bf i max which indicates the maximum value of bfi a two parameter digital filter method deduced from eq 11 is established 12 b k 1 b f i max α b k 1 1 α b f i max y k 1 α b f i max α is the recession constant bf i max is determined according to the field investigation of hydrogeological conditions eckhardt 2008 suggested that bf i max is equal to 0 8 for perennial streams with porous aquifers 0 5 for ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and 0 25 for perennial streams with hard rock aquifers in order to implement eckhardt method without the field investigation of hydrogeological conditions collischonn and fan 2013 put forward a backward filter method that uses the recession constant to calculate bf i max 13 b k 1 b k α b k y k a backward iterative operation based on eq 13 is performed on the daily streamflow then bf i max is obtained by dividing the maximum possible total baseflow by the total streamflow we applied the backward filter to generate different bf i max parameters for each of the 1815 catchments which to some extent reflect the soil heterogeneities and the spatial variations of hydroclimatic variables 3 2 2 5 ewma method the exponential weighted moving average ewma filter tularam and ilahee 2008 is in the form of 14 b k ε y k 1 ε b k 1 0 b k y k where ε is the smoothing constant in previous studies ε ranges from 0 011 to 0 015 indarto et al 2016 in this study ε is set to the average value namely 0 013 4 results 4 1 comparisons of baseflow separation methods fig 3 shows the evaluation result each box in the figure represents the nse or kge distribution of the corresponding baseflow separation method for the 1815 catchments the nse median values for each method namely the horizontal black lines for each box in fig 3a are 0 68 0 84 0 93 0 94 0 69 0 91 0 84 0 84 0 98 from left to right the kge median values for each method namely the horizontal black lines for each box in fig 3b are 0 45 0 75 0 80 0 76 0 25 0 70 0 72 0 75 0 94 from left to right overall the eckhardt method has the best performance with both the largest nse median value and the largest kge median value on the other hand we compared the nine baseflow separation methods based on their hydrologic plausibility fig 4 shows the separation outcomes of the nine methods subjective comparison results are as follows i the five digital filter methods generally yield a smoother baseflow than the four graphic methods ii focusing on the flood that occurred in february 2018 we found that baseflow peaks obtained by the chapman cm ewma and eckhardt methods occurred after streamflow peaks while the other methods do not have the phenomenon the delayed baseflow peaks may be reasonable as it takes less time for the interflow and overland flow to converge into a river than for the baseflow iii the lh chapman and eckhardt methods return medium volumes of baseflow among the nine methods to summarize the eckhardt method may have better performance than other methods in terms of the hydrologic plausibility this conclusion matches the result of a case study that used baseflow estimated from a tracer based method as the reference to evaluate 7 non tracer based methods gonzales et al 2009 the bfi of the 1815 catchments calculated from the eckhardt method is shown in fig 5 4 2 performances of baseflow separation methods in different catchments eckhardt method is also the most robust method by analyzing the spatial distribution of method performances in fig 6 eckhardt method has the best performance in 1145 catchments blue circles in fig 6 slide method has the best performance in 324 catchments red triangles and cm method has the best performance in 187 catchments purple squares fixed method chapman method ewma method local method and ukih method together have the best performance in the remaining 159 catchments lh method does not have the best performance in all catchments although slide and cm methods together have the best performances in 511 catchments the performance differences between the two methods and eckhardt method is small in the 511 catchments the catchments where slide method has the best performance are mainly located in the west coast and new england the mean nse value of slide method nseslide in these catchments is 0 96 and the mean nse value of eckhardt method nseeckhardt in these catchments is 0 87 the catchments where cm method has the best performance are mainly located in the south of the midwest region the mean nse value of cm method nsecm in these catchments is 0 97 and the mean nseeckhardt in these catchments is 0 92 the comparisons indicate that eckhardt method also has a relatively good performance in the 511 catchments 4 3 relationships between method performances and catchment characteristics the relationships between nseeckhardt and 16 catchment characteristics are shown in fig 7 the pearson s r between nseeckhardt and the 16 characteristics range from 0 15 to 0 09 all the values of pearson s r satisfying r 0 3 means that the relationships between nse eckhardt and the 16 characteristics are weak the spearman s ρ between nseeckhardt and the 16 characteristics range from 0 12 to 0 12 and yield the same conclusion this conclusion is consistent with the finding in fig 6 that is the performance of eckhardt method is independent of catchment characteristics additionally the relationships between the kge value of eckhardt method kge eckhardt and the 16 characteristics are weak r 0 3 as well which implies that the choice of the two evaluation metrics does not have significant effects on the results we noted that the p value of correlation test might be misleading for a large number of catchments beck et al 2013 lin et al 2013 sullivan and feinn 2012 as the p value is influenced by the sample size besides the correlation test uses p value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis r 0 or not which does not determine the strength of a linear relationship thus the p value was not calculated here the relationships between the performances of the other baseflow separation methods and catchment characteristics are shown in the supplements 5 discussion 5 1 effects of parameter estimations on the method performances the parameter estimations of the four graphic methods may lead to their poor performances in specific catchments contrary to the eckhardt method the performances of the four graphic methods are related to several catchment characteristics fig 8 shows the relationships between the nse value of local method nse local and the 16 catchment characteristics six catchment characteristics including ai pet snow elev slo and forest are moderately well related to the nse local r greater than 0 30 red lines in fig 8 which implies that the performance of local method is likely to be positively correlated with snow and forest it can be explained as follows if the percentage of snowfall or forest in a catchment is relatively low the eq 3 tends to overestimate the duration of overland flow n days in the catchment as the eq 3 only depends on the catchment area and does not take climatic or topographic characteristics into account since the local method used 2n as the interval of a sliding window to traverse the entire period of streamflow overestimating n will result in more baseflow that cannot be separated and produce a lower nse the other three graphic methods ukih fixed and slide methods have the similar pattern due to the poor estimates of the parameter n in particular the ukih method use a constant 5 as an estimate of the parameter n which may be the cause of the worst performance among the four graphic methods as for the digital filter methods both lh method and ewma method adopt fixed filter parameters the other three digital filter methods chapman cm and eckhardt methods use the recession analysis to estimate the recession constant α parameters for each of the 1815 catchments and eckhardt method also uses the backward filter to generate different bf i max parameters for different catchments the different parameter estimations may be one of the reasons for the different performances of the digital filter methods although the eckhardt method has the best performance there are still a few outliers in specific catchments table 2 shows the variable statistics of the 19 catchments with the lowest nse values of the eckhardt method nseeckhardt we found that most of the outliers occurred in catchments with a low streamflow volume for instance the usgs no 02301990 catchment has a low streamflow volume during dry periods the floods dramatically increased the streamflow volume of the catchment while the floods lasted only a few days such a kind of streamflow may lead to an underestimation of the bf i max parameter which makes the eckhardt method less effective as shown in the last two columns of table 2 if we used a fixed value of 0 8 for the bf i max parameters of the 19 catchments all nseeckhardt will increase a lower α parameter will increase the nseeckhardt as well consequently to gain better performance of the eckhardt method future studies are warranted to optimize the parameter bf i max and α by employing hydroclimatic characteristics and other related data 5 2 uncertainties of digital filter methods there are two main sources of uncertainties in digital filter methods namely the linear reservoir assumption and the approximation of groundwater recharge the digital filter methods estimate recession constant with the linear reservoir assumption 15 s k b s is the groundwater storage above the zero flow level k is the characteristic duration that streamflow decreases to 37 of the first day in a dry series brutsaert 2008 b is the baseflow in the outlet of the catchment incorporating eq 15 with the groundwater balance equation 16 ds dt μ b the recession constant α is derived 17 α b t δ t b t e 1 k δ t μ is the groundwater recharge that infiltrates into the water table and is equal to 0 in dry periods δ t is the time interval and is usually equal to 1 day previous studies find that the relationship between groundwater storage and baseflow is non linear brutsaert and nieber 1977 huyck et al 2005 troch et al 1993 assume that the non linear relationship is of the simple form 18 s f b incorporating eq 16 with 18 two outcomes are yielded 19 α b t δ t b t e b s δ t 20 b t δ t α b t 1 α μ t the difference of eqs 17 and 19 implies the uncertainty of linear reservoir assumption although the linear reservoir assumption generated α parameters with spatial variations these α parameters were static in time since the α parameters should vary in time due to changes in soil moisture fenicia et al 2006 gan and luo 2013 it might yield better baseflow outcomes for the digital filter methods to use a nonlinear reservoir assumption to estimate a time varying α parameter another uncertainty is the approximation of groundwater recharge μ t in eq 20 μ t is approximately estimated using eqs 21 22 23 in chapman method cm method eckhardt method respectively 21 μ t f t f t δ t 2 22 μ t f t δ t 23 μ t bf i max 1 b f i max f t δ t the above three approximations use the same assumption that the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow is constant over time which is a source of error in digital filter methods nonetheless eq 23 is a more reasonable approximation than eqs 21 and 22 bf i max in eq 23 can be considered as the average ratio of groundwater recharge to the total streamflow and bf i max 1 b f i max is the average ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow the ratio should vary in space due to the soil heterogeneity thus it is more reasonable to use bf i max 1 b f i max to estimate the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow in different catchments than to use a constant 1 as the ratio for all catchments further studies could introduce machine learning approaches to better estimate groundwater recharge for reducing the uncertainties of digital filter methods fotovatikhah et al 2018 moazenzadeh et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019 5 3 reasonableness of evaluation criterion to our best knowledge only two previous studies use strict baseflow points to evaluate baseflow separation methods furey and gupta 2001 considered that the annual minimum value of daily streamflow is predominantly baseflow and can be used as the reference of baseflow for evaluating different separation methods these limited strict baseflow points could lead to a relatively low statistical significance indarto et al 2016 found that no or limited precipitation occurs from july and september in the east java regions and streamflow observations from july and september can be used as the reference baseflow this evaluation criterion can only be used in specific regions the evaluation criterion used in this study seems to be more reasonable than the above two criterions firstly the strict baseflow points in this study are evenly distributed over time which means that both dry periods and wet periods have strict baseflow points for evaluation secondly about 59 of strict baseflow points are larger than q 50 the streamflow value that 50 time equaled or exceeded which implies that strict baseflow points at the beginning of baseflow recessions can be successfully selected by using these points at the beginning of baseflow recessions to evaluate baseflow separation methods their plausibility of hydrologic behavior such as the delayed response of baseflow can be described quantitatively although this evaluation criterion has advantages that only need daily streamflow as input to reflect the hydrologic plausibility of the estimated baseflow it has a limitation in determining the accuracies of baseflow points near the streamflow peaks considering the complexity of the baseflow generation processes and the availability of massive earth system data the use of advanced soft computing techniques may help predict baseflow points near the streamflow peaks chau 2019 qasem et al 2019 thereby making the evaluation criterion more effective 6 conclusions by selecting strict baseflow points as the reference a reliable evaluation criterion was established to evaluate the accuracies of different baseflow separation methods in this study the evaluation criterion only needs streamflow as input and can be applied to different catchments with streamflow observations nine baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were evaluated in 1815 catchments across the contiguous united states the digital filter method proposed by eckhardt 2005 has the best performance in 1145 catchments in the catchments where other baseflow separation methods have the best performance the eckhardt method also has a relatively good performance in addition the performance of eckhardt method is independent of catchment characteristics therefore eckhardt method is recommended for baseflow separation across the contiguous united states further researches could concentrate on the following aspects to improve the accuracy of baseflow estimation 1 applying the evaluation criterion to evaluate baseflow separation methods that rely on precipitation and hydraulic data 2 employing hydroclimatic data to estimate the parameter bf i max and the recession constant α 3 introducing state of the art machine learning approaches in baseflow separation 4 incorporating non linear reservoir method into the calculation of baseflow recession parameters 5 accurate estimations or measurements of

5738,investigating variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf is of critical importance for throwing light on mechanisms of hydrological cycle under changing environment previous studies mostly focused on examining variability of single hydro meteorological variable in forms of change point while neglecting complicated interactions among hydro meteorological variables and thus failing to fully reveal variability of hydrological cycle in this study a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is developed for disclosing change point of dshf whilst controlling for the effect of covariate eight major catchments across the loess plateau lp china are selected as study regions results indicate that change points of dependence structures between streamflow and precipitation potential evapotranspiration varies across the lp due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate and anthropogenic activities moreover change points of dependence structure between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on the lp match well with the time of global warming hypothesis i e the early 1980s additionally we find that controlling for the effect of precipitation is extremely essential when examining change point of dependence structure between streamflow and potential evapotranspiration on rain dominated region such as the lp further the proposed pacolr algorithm is also applicable for detecting change points of dshf in transient snow and snowmelt dominant regions keywords dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors change point partial copula covariate effect loess plateau 1 introduction there is a consensus that mechanisms of hydrological cycle have been experiencing noticeable changes on a global scale due to the occurrence of intensified anthropogenic activities and global warming taylor et al 2013 amundson et al 2015 reager et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as a result a lot of water resources problems has appeared which severely impedes development of local societies and economies particularly in developing countries hubacek and sun 2005 alcamo et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 to tackle these water related problems successfully developing an in depth understanding of hydrological cycle variability under changing environment is a crucial issue luo et al 2013 haddeland et al 2014 fisher et al 2017 over the past years a wealth of studies has been carried out on this issue through examining variability of individual hydro meteorological variable in forms of change point using univariate statistical approaches caloiero et al 2011 gebremicael et al 2013 minaei and irannezhad 2016 for instance yang and tian 2009 employed the sequential mann kendall test to determine the abrupt changes in runoff in eight sub catchments of haihe river basin khan et al 2014 performed the cumulative sum charts and bootstrapping for the detection of change points in the surface air temperature time series for asansol weather observation station inida gao et al 2015 used the pettitt test to examine shifts in streamflow and base flow in the yanhe river china chen et al 2018 applied the scanning t test to detect the change points in mean to monthly streamflow and rainfall in xijiang river basin however worthy of note is that hydro meteorological processes do not occur independent of one another but rather occur amidst complex interactions huang and van den dool 1993 gurnell et al 2016 investigating variability of hydro meteorological factors from such univariate perspective merely partially explain variations of regional hydrological cycle take precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow for example they are generally considered as three major components of hydrological cycle system and key processes of basin scaled water balance pagano and sorooshian 2002 liang et al 2015 variability in streamflow reflects the combined effects of precipitation snowmelt evapotranspiration vegetation and soil rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 precipitation supplies water for evaporation northey et al 2017 in turn evaporation serves as a driving force behind precipitation generation rana and katerji 2000 kimura et al 2007 in light of the above individual hydrological factor analyses fail to disclose complex nonlinear feedback loops among hydrological factors and thus provide limited or even misleading information on hydrological cycle therefore disclosing variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf in multivariate manner exhibits particular indispensability for better understanding mechanisms of regional hydrological cycle under changing environment however to date studies concerning dshf variability from a multivariate perspective are relatively few bender et al 2014 guo et al 2015 2017 xiong et al 2015 these limited methods seemingly all are closely related to the methodology of copula which characterizes the shape and strength of dshf via a copula function and its parameter s respectively for instance guo et al 2015 2017 applied the archimedean copula based likelihood ratio test method developed by dias and embrechts 2004 to detect the change point of precipitation runoff relationship in the yellow river basin xiong et al 2015 innovatively extended the copula based likelihood ratio test method to disclose change point of dependence structure for trivariate flood series however as aforementioned worthy of note is that hydro meteorological processes occur amidst complex interactions whilst exploring dshf variability within the complex hydrological system containing a large number of interactions effect of controlling variates i e covariates should be taken into account seriously this point is consistent with that of previous studies jukić and denić jukić 2015 feng et al 2016 implying that dshf varies according to the other covariate gao et al 2017 also highlighted that overlooking the existence of covariate would lead to misleading results on dshf for example evapotranspiration is tightly correlated with precipitation and streamflow in order to obtain the real strength of dependence structure between precipitation and streamflow eliminating the effect of evapotranspiration on precipitation and streamflow is particularly indispensable however as far as we know studies on examining the dshf variability in the multivariate manner remain few and even fewer take into account the effect of covariate on dshf given aforementioned concerns a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is proposed for disclosing dshf variability in forms of change point whilst controlling for the effect of covariate in pacolr the partial copula is employed to describe the nonlinear multivariate dependence structure of variables of interest after removing any part of the variation due to the influence of the covariate spanhel and kurz 2016 as highlighted by keay 2016 partial copula can completely characterize the conditional dependence moreover unlike the partial correlation coefficient widely used in hydrological field jukić and denić jukić 2015 wang et al 2018 partial copula relaxes limitation on the joint elliptical distribution and provides a meaningful nonlinear measure of conditional dependence for general distributions gijbels et al 2015 spanhel and kurz 2016 meanwhile similar to the traditionally used copulas the partial copula requires the independent and identically distributed iid marginal variables when modeling the joint dependence structure of variables of interest however in practical terms the presence of serial correlations also known as autocorrelation and conditional heteroscedasticity also known as conditional variance in time series generally invalidates the iid assumption consequently reducing model efficiency and introducing new sources of uncertainty otache et al 2012 worthy of note is that previous studies have proved the presence of serial correlation and conditional heteroscedasticity on hydro meteorological variables wang et al 2005 modarres and ouarda 2013 therefore taking this aspect into account is indispensable for the copula construction to obtain iid marginal variables for partial copula construction the arma garch model one widely used hybrid model in the economic field sébastien et al 2016 chen et al 2017 is applied to model univariate hydro meteorological series in the hybrid model arma and garch models are used in combination with partial copula to compensate for the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the hydro meteorological series respectively overall the main objective of this study is to develop the pacolr algorithm for detecting the change point of dshf in the complex hydrological cycle system under changing environment it constitutes the primary significance of this study and also the main contribution to the study of variability investigation of hydrological cycle here the arma garch model is performed for eliminating the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in univariate hydro meteorological series residuals of the arma garch models are used for the copula construction partial copula is employed to control for the effect of covariate on dshf precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe and streamflow q series are the selected hydro meteorological variables in this study we focus on identifying the change points of dependence structure between q and p whilst controlling for the effect of pe abbreviated as q p pe and change points of dependence structure between q and pe whilst controlling for the effect of p abbreviated as q pe p through the pacolr algorithm meanwhile detecting the change point of dependence structure between p and pe abbreviated as p pe is carried out through the copula based likelihood ratio test method dias and embrechts 2004 the three copula based models are expected to characterize the hydrological cycle interactions eight catchments on the china s loess plateau hereafter lp known as cradle of chinese civilization are selected as the study regions in this paper the lp is a large ecological and agricultural zone of china frequent rainstorms low vegetation cover highly erodible loess and steep landscape have led the lp to be one of the most severely eroded regions throughout the world regional industrial and agricultural production and socioeconomic development have been severely restricted to date examining variability of hydrological cycle for the lp has attracted widespread attention within the hydrologic community kimura et al 2007 wang et al 2011 li et al 2012 peng et al 2017 shi et al 2017 however most of previous studies focus on exploring variability of hydrological cycle from univariate perspective while ignoring the interactions among hydro meteorological variables analysis of dshf variability can provide deep insight into the variability of hydrological cycle from a multivariate perspective for the lp the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the methods adopted results and discussion are presented in section 3 section 4 presents main conclusions drawn from this study 2 methodology 2 1 methodological framework of the pacolr algorithm in this section the outline of the pacolr algorithm is described first we employ the arma garch model to fit univariate hydrological series then we construct the partial copula based joint distribution model to depict dshf on the basis of the fitted arma garch model finally the copula based likelihood ratio test clr method is applied to detect change points of dshf based on the partial copula based model details of the methods mentioned above are presented as below 2 2 arma garch based marginal distribution model selecting appropriate marginal distribution models is the first step for copula construction here we restrict our attention to arma garch based marginal models for eliminating the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity of individual variables the arma garch model bollerslev 1986 is a combination of two models 1 the arma model is employed to eliminate serial correlation of individual time series and 2 the nonlinear garch model is used to compensate for the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual extracted from the arma model specifically for time series xt the arma m n garch r s model is given as follows 1 x t i 1 m ϕ i x t i ε t j 1 n θ j ε t j c ε t σ t ξ t σ t 2 ω i 1 r α i ε t i 2 j 1 s β j σ t j 2 where i 1 m ϕ i 1 ω 0 α i 0 β j 0 and i 1 r α i j 1 s β j 1 ε t is a white noise sequence with a zero mean and standard deviation σ t ϕ i θ j and c are parameters of the arma part ω α i and β j are parameters of the garch part maximum likelihood method is employed to estimate the parameters of arma garch model m and n are orders of arma part x t i 1 m ϕ i x t i ε t j 1 n θ j ε t j c r and s are orders of garch part σ t 2 ω i 1 r α i ε t i 2 j 1 s β j σ t j 2 two different indexes aic akaike s information criterion and bic bayes information criterion are employed to determine orders of the arma garch model models with smaller aic or bic values are considered to perform better in terms of fitting univariate variables ξ t denotes an independent and identically distributed sequence with a zero mean and unit variance i e the standardized residual from arma garch model here we can use a specific distribution to transform ξ t to a uniform distribution in fact the exact distribution of ξ t is generally not known to avoid misspecification in distribution model the non parametric empirical cumulative distribution function cdf i e the gringorten plotting position formula in this study appendix a is used to transform ξ t to uniform distribution for copula construction 2 3 partial copula based joint distribution in this study the partial copula proposed by bergsma 2004 is exploited to measure the dependence of pairs y z conditioned on x denoted by y z x based on the definition of the copula the partial copula is defined as a joint distribution of u and v which are distributions of y and z conditioned on x 3 c u v θ 1 θ 2 θ c u f 2 1 y x θ 1 v f 3 1 z x θ 2 θ f 23 1 y z x where f 2 1 y x θ 1 pr y y x x and f 3 1 z x θ 2 pr z z x x are conditional distribution functions of y and z given x x θ 1 and θ 2 are parameters of conditional distributions f 2 1 and f 3 1 θ is the parameter of the partial copula which measures the dependence strength of y and z conditioned on x the transformation of y z into u v is called the rosenblatt transform by song 2009 or partial copula transform by bergsma 2010 the basic theorem of partial copula is that if x 1 x 2 xn are random variables with a continuous multivariate distribution f the following random variables u i i 1 2 n 4 u 1 f 1 x 1 u 2 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 u n f n 1 2 n 1 x n x 1 x 2 x n 1 are iid u 0 1 analogous to the form of conditional distribution function f 2 1 y x θ 1 conditional distribution un in eq 4 can be expressed as 5 u n f n 1 2 n 1 x n x 1 x 2 x n 1 θ n pr x n x n x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n 1 x n 1 therefore the conditional distribution of the ith component u i conditioned on the first i 1 components of u 1 u 2 u n t can be defined from densities of the i dimensional marginal and of the derivatives 6 c i u i u 1 u 2 u i 1 pr u i u i u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u i 1 u i 1 i 1 c i u 1 u 2 u i u 1 u i 1 i 1 c i u 1 u 2 u i 1 u 1 u i 1 when n 3 the pair copula aas et al 2009 can also be used to model dependence structures of multivariate data while using bivariate copulas as building blocks if n 2 c 2 u 2 u 1 pr u 2 u 2 u 1 u 1 c u 1 u 2 u 1 therefore conditional distribution functions of y and z conditioned on x x are expressed as 7 f 2 1 y x θ 1 pr y y x x c f y f x θ 1 f x 8 f 3 1 z x θ 2 pr z z x x c f z f x θ 2 f x here f y f x and f z are marginal distributions of y x and z in the present study marginal distribution f is estimated from iid ξ t sequence of arma garch model therefore eq 3 can be written as 9 c u v θ 1 θ 2 θ c f 2 1 y x θ 1 f 3 1 z x θ 2 θ c c f y f x θ 1 f x c f z f x θ 2 f x θ once a copula form is selected the next crucial step is to estimate parameters of the partial copula function in present study the stepwise parametric method introduced by kim et al 2011 is applied for parameters estimation of partial copula details of the method are introduced in appendix b 2 4 pacolr algorithm for dshf change point detection details of the clr method are shown as follows assuming that no change in types of copulas occurs the null hypothesis stating that the parameter of the dependence structure of x i i 1 2 n is constant is defined as 13 h 0 θ 1 θ 2 θ n against the null hypothesis h 0 the alternative hypothesis is h 1 not all of θ 1 θ 2 θn are equal 15 in general the positions of change points are unknown here we assume that the location of change point is k where the test statistic k of copula based likelihood ratio is minimum for the whole time series dias and embrechts 2004 15 k l n η 0 l k η 1 l n k η 2 1 i n c f x i f y i η 0 1 i k c f x i f y i η 1 k 1 i n c f x i f y i η 2 where l n denotes the likelihood function of the whole time series l k where l n k is the likelihood function of the time series for before and after the change point of the dependence structure where c is the probability distribution function of the copula and η 0 η 1 and η 2 are the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameter to avoid neglecting the existence of multiple change points once a change point is detected the original whole time series are divided into two segments as new whole time series then the clr method is be applied again to the two so called new whole time series independently this procedure is iterated until no further change points are detected i e the so called binary segmentation method proposed by vostrikova 1981 additionally the change point k should be limited to a suitable range to avoid sampling uncertainties when estimating parameters of marginal and joint distributions due to the small sample size employed in the present study k is limited to between 36 and n 36 following lenth 2001 for better computing the test statistic k is log transformed shown as 16 2 ln k 2 ln l k η 1 ln l n k η 2 ln l n η 0 therefore the location of change point is k with max z n 17 z n max 1 k n 1 2 ln k according to likelihood ratio test methods the asymptotic distribution of statistic z n 1 2 can generally be estimated via the monte carlo simulation method with a heavy computational burden hence we use another convenient method introduced by gombay and horváth 1996 to approximate the distribution of z n 1 2 which can be given as follows 18 pr z n 1 2 z z p exp z 2 2 2 p 2 γ p 2 1 p z 2 ln 1 h 1 l hl 4 z 2 o 1 z 4 here h l l n n 3 2 n when z and p denotes the number of copula parameters when the p value of z n 1 2 is less than 5 the time corresponding to the change point can be estimated as follows 19 k arg max 1 k n 2 ln k 2 5 copula based models for dshf measurement as aforementioned in the introduction p evapotranspiration and q are key process of basin scaled water balance p and q can be easily obtained by direct observation by contrast there exist remarkable difficulties and uncertainties in measuring or estimating evapotranspiration verstraeten et al 2008 therefore in present study the evapotranspiration is substituted by pe which reflects the atmosphere s capacity to spur evapotranspiration chattopadhyay et al 2009 thus the following three copula based models are used for measuring the strength of dshf i the dependence structure between q and p whilst controlling for the effect of pe i e q p pe 10 f q p pe q p pe c f 2 1 q pe θ 1 f 3 1 p pe θ 2 θ ii the dependence structure between q and pe whilst controlling for the effect of p i e q pe p 11 f q pe p q pe p c f 2 1 q p θ 1 f 3 1 pe p θ 2 θ iii the dependence structure between p and pe i e p pe 12 f p pe p pe c f p f pe θ as for the copula function this paper employs two widely used copula families in the hydrology field to model the dshf i e the elliptical copulas student t copula gaussian copula and archimedean copulas clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula bardossy 2006 salvadori and de michele 2007 genest et al 2007 wang et al 2010 ma et al 2013 xiong et al 2014 for sake of simplicity specific formulas of these copulas are not presented in this paper readers interested in theoretical details are referred to the studies by nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 3 application to the yellow river basin 3 1 study area and data set the lp 34 41 n 100 115 e is situated in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in north china fig 1 the total area of the lp is 632520 km2 accounting for 6 3 of the entire land area of china liang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 elevation ranges from 1000 m to 1600 m above the sea level continuous loess on hills basins and alluvial plains covers the surface of the lp with height ranging from 100 to 300 m in thickness the lp lies mostly in the arid and semi arid continental monsoon climatic zone the mean annual temperature ranges from 4 3 to 14 3 c from the northwest to the southeast of the lp mean annual precipitation varies between 200 mm in the northwest and 750 mm in the southeast which predominantly falls between june and september rainfall within summer months is in the form of high intensity rainstorms the lp contributes approximately 90 of the total sediment in the yellow river basin in the current work 8 primary catchments fig 1 with strong climate and land surface gradients are selected to represent the combined influence of climatic and land surface factors on hydrological processes the 8 catchments cover about 32 0 of the lp area and contribute about 60 4 of total runoff and about 71 6 of sediment discharge from the lp details of them and the corresponding annual mean magnitude of p pe and q are displayed in table 1 monthly runoff data 1960 2010 for the 8 hydrological stations are used in the current work these data were provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which monitors collects and releases hydrological information on the yellow river basin daily meteorological data 1960 2010 on precipitation mean maximum minimum temperature air pressure relative humidity wind velocity and sunshine duration levels are provided through the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn daily potential evapotranspiration levels measured at each individual station are calculated via the fao56 penman monteith method appendix c using these meteorological data then the monthly areal p and pe for each catchment are obtained through the thiessen polygon method 3 2 construction of the arma garch based marginal models prior to estimating the arma garch models we first remove the seasonality from monthly q p and pe series through subtracting monthly mean values and then dividing seasonal standard deviations of the original series see shang 2006 eq 7 46 eq 7 47b then the autocorrelation function values are calculated to examine the presence of serial correlation in these deseasonalized series shown in table s1 supplemental material afterwards the arma model is used to eliminate the autocorrelation then the engle s lagrange multiplier test is performed for investigating the heteroscedasticity of the residuals in the arma model fig 2 exhibits the results of engle s lagrange multiplier test for residuals from arma model for deseasonalized q figs s1 and s2 supplemental material show this for deseasonalized p and pe once the heteroscedasticity is discovered the garch model is incorporated into the previously obtained arma model then the parameters in the arma garch model is obtained through the maximum likelihood method here the aic and bic is employed to determine the appropriate orders of arma garch model optimal arma garch models are shown in table 2 from table s1 figs 2 and s1 s2 it can be found that i both the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity are not significant in the deseasonalized p series at the 5 level in the lp except for that in the kuye catchment ii deseasonalized q series exhibit significant autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity at the 5 level in the lp iii deseasonalized pe series exhibit significant autocorrelation and non significant heteroscedasticity at the 5 level in the lp worthy of note is that not only in the lp serial correlation and heteroscedasticity also have been detected in hydro meteorological factors in the other regions laux et al 2011 wang et al 2012 modarres and ouarda 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2017 previous studies have highlighted that presence of serial correlation and heteroscedasticity may invalidate iid assumption and thus lead to misleading conclusions such as on trend detection caloiero et al 2011 sonali and kumar 2013 frequency analysis yoo et al 2016 and so on laux et al 2011 wang et al 2012 therefore taking the serial correlation and heteroscedasticity into account is extremely worthwhile for statistical model construction such as for the copula construction in present study under this context the arma garch model seems to be an appropriate choice specifically iid residuals of arma arma garch models for the deseasonalized q p and pe series are transformed to uniform distributions using empirical cumulative distribution function for copula partial copula construction 3 3 construction of copula based models for dshf measurement once the marginal distribution is estimated the next step is to construct copula based models in general this step consists of measuring the dependence of variables of interest and selecting appropriate copula functions as aforementioned in section 2 3 the copula parameter measures the dependence strength between hydro meteorological factors the larger the parameter θ of a specific copula the stronger the strength between variables while the parameters among different types of copulas are less comparable hence the kendall rank coefficient is selected to as a general measure to measure the dependence of variables instead of the copula parameter the primary reason behind this selection is the one to one transformation from copula parameter space into the range of the values for the corresponding kendall rank coefficient frahm et al 2003 yu et al 2014 table 3 reports kendall tau values between q p and pe series filtered and not filtered by arma arma garch models for brevity the correlation coefficients between q p and pe are written as corr q p corr q pe and corr p pe it can be seen from table 3 that the corr q p between original q and p series are smaller than that between filtered q and p series by arma arma garch models by contrast the corr q pe and corr p pe between original series are both similar to that between filtered series however it is worthy of note that the corr q p corr q pe and corr p pe are all significant at 99 confidence level no matter whether or not the arma arma garch models are performed moreover from table 3 we can conclude that the correlation directions of q p are all positive in different catchments in the lp while that of q pe and p pe are negative besides the absolute values of kendall tau of q p are all larger than that of q pe indicating a stronger dependence of q p than q pe in the lp this finding is consistent with that of zuo et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 the primary reason is that catchments in the lp are rain dominated regions where rainfall is the main source of streamflow zhan et al 2014 li and gao 2015 higher rainfall means larger streamflow under natural environment meanwhile pe reflects atmosphere s capacity to spur evapotranspiration which has indirect connection with streamflow thus the dependence strength between q and pe is weaker than that between q and p as for the copula function selection this study employs the aic index copula functions with smaller aic value are considered to perform better in terms of modeling the dshf table 4 lists corresponding results while the selected copulas are shown in bold values moreover it can be found from table 4 that the selected copula functions are different for different pairs of hydro meteorological variables in different catchments 3 4 results of the dshf change points on the basis of these selected copulas change points of dshf in the lp are identified through the pacolr algorithm table 4 in addition to the change points of dshf we investigate change points of univariate deseasonalized q p and pe series through pettitt test method as one rank based nonparametric method the pettitt test has received widespread attention within the hydrologic community gao et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 related results are listed in table 5 it can be found from table 5 that change points of q p pe and q pe p exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity compared with that of pe p in the lp in terms of q p pe 1997 6 and 1998 11 are significant change points at 1 significance level in the kuye and wuding catchments respectively in qinhe catchment significant change point of q p pe occurs in 1991 4 there is no change point at 5 significance level for the other catchments from table 5 it can be found that change points of q p pe basically coincide with that of q specifically change points 1997 6 1998 11 and 1991 4 of q p pe are consistent with 1998 7 1999 2 and 1990 6 of univariate q series in the kuye wuding and qinhe catchments respectively in addition to above worthy of note from table 5 is that the existence change point of q doesn t mean the presence of change point of q pe p absolutely such as the in the fenhe jinghe weihe and yiluo catchments as for the q pe p 1993 8 is the significant change point in the fenhe catchment at 5 significance level while no change point occurs in the other catchments here the change point 1993 8 of q pe p in the fenhe catchment seems to be related more to the change point of pe in 1993 12 intuitively similarly the presence of change point in univariate series fails to manifest the change point of q pe p above results highlight that the individual hydrological factor analyses can provide limited information on hydrological cycle revealing variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors is particularly indispensable for better understanding regional hydrological cycle detecting change point of p pe is beneficial to revealing regional climate change results reported in table 5 show that change points of p pe mainly occur in approximately 1980 for all the catchments in the lp except the weihe and qinhe catchments intuitively the time seems to coincide with the global warming hypothesis karl and trenberth 2003 hansen et al 2012 in addition 1991 8 is the significant change point of p pe at 5 significance for the fenhe and weihe catchments the major cause of change point of p pe may be the difference of decreasing trends in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration across the lp as xu et al 2007 stated to examine the effect of covariate on change points of dshf we take the kuye catchment as an example and present the difference of statistic zn between two conditions which considering the effect of covariate or not fig 3 it can be found from fig 3 that the temporal change of zn under q p pe is nearly consistent with that under q p for the kuye catchment by contrast the temporal change of zn exhibits significant difference between q pe p and q pe this phenomenon can mainly be attributed to the fact that lp is a rain dominant watershed streamflow responds quickly and directly to precipitation in the lp but is relatively less influenced by changes of pe in other words the effect of p on q is independent of that of pe while the effect of pe on q is dependent of effect of p sun et al 2013 thus when examining change points of dependence between q and p there is smaller difference between eliminating and not eliminating the effect of pe on p and q in contrast controlling for the effect of p on pe and q is indispensable when examining change points of dependence structure between pe and q particularly in rain dominated basin 4 summary and conclusions exploring the change points of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf is greatly beneficial for disclosing the evolution of hydrological cycle under the changing environment in view of this a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is developed to examine change points of dshf here the partial copula is used to model the complex nonlinear relationship between hydro meteorological factors and eliminate the effect of covariate on dshf moreover as the copula based models require independent and identically distributed univariate margins hydro meteorological variables are transformed through the arma garch arma autoregressive moving average garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity time series model eight major catchments across the loess plateau lp are selected as study regions change points of dependence structures between streamflow q precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pe are detected through the pacolr algorithm for simplicity dependence structure between q and p pe whilst controlling for the effect of pe p are marked as q p pe q pe p due to the spatial heterogeneity of climatic patterns and anthropogenic activities change points of q p pe and q pe p vary across the lp change points of the dependence structures between p and pe in the lp occur around early 1980s which seems to coincide with the time of global warming hypothesis intuitively another noteworthy point is that the effect of covariate on the change points of dshf in the lp a rain dominated region when examining change points of dependence structure between q and pe eliminating effect of p on q and pe is extremely essential the main reason behind this is that effect of p on q is independently related to that of pe while effect of pe on q is dependently related to effect of p in the rain dominated basin such as the lp in this study declaration of competing

5738,investigating variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf is of critical importance for throwing light on mechanisms of hydrological cycle under changing environment previous studies mostly focused on examining variability of single hydro meteorological variable in forms of change point while neglecting complicated interactions among hydro meteorological variables and thus failing to fully reveal variability of hydrological cycle in this study a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is developed for disclosing change point of dshf whilst controlling for the effect of covariate eight major catchments across the loess plateau lp china are selected as study regions results indicate that change points of dependence structures between streamflow and precipitation potential evapotranspiration varies across the lp due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate and anthropogenic activities moreover change points of dependence structure between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration on the lp match well with the time of global warming hypothesis i e the early 1980s additionally we find that controlling for the effect of precipitation is extremely essential when examining change point of dependence structure between streamflow and potential evapotranspiration on rain dominated region such as the lp further the proposed pacolr algorithm is also applicable for detecting change points of dshf in transient snow and snowmelt dominant regions keywords dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors change point partial copula covariate effect loess plateau 1 introduction there is a consensus that mechanisms of hydrological cycle have been experiencing noticeable changes on a global scale due to the occurrence of intensified anthropogenic activities and global warming taylor et al 2013 amundson et al 2015 reager et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as a result a lot of water resources problems has appeared which severely impedes development of local societies and economies particularly in developing countries hubacek and sun 2005 alcamo et al 2007 donohue et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 to tackle these water related problems successfully developing an in depth understanding of hydrological cycle variability under changing environment is a crucial issue luo et al 2013 haddeland et al 2014 fisher et al 2017 over the past years a wealth of studies has been carried out on this issue through examining variability of individual hydro meteorological variable in forms of change point using univariate statistical approaches caloiero et al 2011 gebremicael et al 2013 minaei and irannezhad 2016 for instance yang and tian 2009 employed the sequential mann kendall test to determine the abrupt changes in runoff in eight sub catchments of haihe river basin khan et al 2014 performed the cumulative sum charts and bootstrapping for the detection of change points in the surface air temperature time series for asansol weather observation station inida gao et al 2015 used the pettitt test to examine shifts in streamflow and base flow in the yanhe river china chen et al 2018 applied the scanning t test to detect the change points in mean to monthly streamflow and rainfall in xijiang river basin however worthy of note is that hydro meteorological processes do not occur independent of one another but rather occur amidst complex interactions huang and van den dool 1993 gurnell et al 2016 investigating variability of hydro meteorological factors from such univariate perspective merely partially explain variations of regional hydrological cycle take precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow for example they are generally considered as three major components of hydrological cycle system and key processes of basin scaled water balance pagano and sorooshian 2002 liang et al 2015 variability in streamflow reflects the combined effects of precipitation snowmelt evapotranspiration vegetation and soil rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 precipitation supplies water for evaporation northey et al 2017 in turn evaporation serves as a driving force behind precipitation generation rana and katerji 2000 kimura et al 2007 in light of the above individual hydrological factor analyses fail to disclose complex nonlinear feedback loops among hydrological factors and thus provide limited or even misleading information on hydrological cycle therefore disclosing variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf in multivariate manner exhibits particular indispensability for better understanding mechanisms of regional hydrological cycle under changing environment however to date studies concerning dshf variability from a multivariate perspective are relatively few bender et al 2014 guo et al 2015 2017 xiong et al 2015 these limited methods seemingly all are closely related to the methodology of copula which characterizes the shape and strength of dshf via a copula function and its parameter s respectively for instance guo et al 2015 2017 applied the archimedean copula based likelihood ratio test method developed by dias and embrechts 2004 to detect the change point of precipitation runoff relationship in the yellow river basin xiong et al 2015 innovatively extended the copula based likelihood ratio test method to disclose change point of dependence structure for trivariate flood series however as aforementioned worthy of note is that hydro meteorological processes occur amidst complex interactions whilst exploring dshf variability within the complex hydrological system containing a large number of interactions effect of controlling variates i e covariates should be taken into account seriously this point is consistent with that of previous studies jukić and denić jukić 2015 feng et al 2016 implying that dshf varies according to the other covariate gao et al 2017 also highlighted that overlooking the existence of covariate would lead to misleading results on dshf for example evapotranspiration is tightly correlated with precipitation and streamflow in order to obtain the real strength of dependence structure between precipitation and streamflow eliminating the effect of evapotranspiration on precipitation and streamflow is particularly indispensable however as far as we know studies on examining the dshf variability in the multivariate manner remain few and even fewer take into account the effect of covariate on dshf given aforementioned concerns a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is proposed for disclosing dshf variability in forms of change point whilst controlling for the effect of covariate in pacolr the partial copula is employed to describe the nonlinear multivariate dependence structure of variables of interest after removing any part of the variation due to the influence of the covariate spanhel and kurz 2016 as highlighted by keay 2016 partial copula can completely characterize the conditional dependence moreover unlike the partial correlation coefficient widely used in hydrological field jukić and denić jukić 2015 wang et al 2018 partial copula relaxes limitation on the joint elliptical distribution and provides a meaningful nonlinear measure of conditional dependence for general distributions gijbels et al 2015 spanhel and kurz 2016 meanwhile similar to the traditionally used copulas the partial copula requires the independent and identically distributed iid marginal variables when modeling the joint dependence structure of variables of interest however in practical terms the presence of serial correlations also known as autocorrelation and conditional heteroscedasticity also known as conditional variance in time series generally invalidates the iid assumption consequently reducing model efficiency and introducing new sources of uncertainty otache et al 2012 worthy of note is that previous studies have proved the presence of serial correlation and conditional heteroscedasticity on hydro meteorological variables wang et al 2005 modarres and ouarda 2013 therefore taking this aspect into account is indispensable for the copula construction to obtain iid marginal variables for partial copula construction the arma garch model one widely used hybrid model in the economic field sébastien et al 2016 chen et al 2017 is applied to model univariate hydro meteorological series in the hybrid model arma and garch models are used in combination with partial copula to compensate for the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the hydro meteorological series respectively overall the main objective of this study is to develop the pacolr algorithm for detecting the change point of dshf in the complex hydrological cycle system under changing environment it constitutes the primary significance of this study and also the main contribution to the study of variability investigation of hydrological cycle here the arma garch model is performed for eliminating the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in univariate hydro meteorological series residuals of the arma garch models are used for the copula construction partial copula is employed to control for the effect of covariate on dshf precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe and streamflow q series are the selected hydro meteorological variables in this study we focus on identifying the change points of dependence structure between q and p whilst controlling for the effect of pe abbreviated as q p pe and change points of dependence structure between q and pe whilst controlling for the effect of p abbreviated as q pe p through the pacolr algorithm meanwhile detecting the change point of dependence structure between p and pe abbreviated as p pe is carried out through the copula based likelihood ratio test method dias and embrechts 2004 the three copula based models are expected to characterize the hydrological cycle interactions eight catchments on the china s loess plateau hereafter lp known as cradle of chinese civilization are selected as the study regions in this paper the lp is a large ecological and agricultural zone of china frequent rainstorms low vegetation cover highly erodible loess and steep landscape have led the lp to be one of the most severely eroded regions throughout the world regional industrial and agricultural production and socioeconomic development have been severely restricted to date examining variability of hydrological cycle for the lp has attracted widespread attention within the hydrologic community kimura et al 2007 wang et al 2011 li et al 2012 peng et al 2017 shi et al 2017 however most of previous studies focus on exploring variability of hydrological cycle from univariate perspective while ignoring the interactions among hydro meteorological variables analysis of dshf variability can provide deep insight into the variability of hydrological cycle from a multivariate perspective for the lp the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the methods adopted results and discussion are presented in section 3 section 4 presents main conclusions drawn from this study 2 methodology 2 1 methodological framework of the pacolr algorithm in this section the outline of the pacolr algorithm is described first we employ the arma garch model to fit univariate hydrological series then we construct the partial copula based joint distribution model to depict dshf on the basis of the fitted arma garch model finally the copula based likelihood ratio test clr method is applied to detect change points of dshf based on the partial copula based model details of the methods mentioned above are presented as below 2 2 arma garch based marginal distribution model selecting appropriate marginal distribution models is the first step for copula construction here we restrict our attention to arma garch based marginal models for eliminating the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity of individual variables the arma garch model bollerslev 1986 is a combination of two models 1 the arma model is employed to eliminate serial correlation of individual time series and 2 the nonlinear garch model is used to compensate for the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residual extracted from the arma model specifically for time series xt the arma m n garch r s model is given as follows 1 x t i 1 m ϕ i x t i ε t j 1 n θ j ε t j c ε t σ t ξ t σ t 2 ω i 1 r α i ε t i 2 j 1 s β j σ t j 2 where i 1 m ϕ i 1 ω 0 α i 0 β j 0 and i 1 r α i j 1 s β j 1 ε t is a white noise sequence with a zero mean and standard deviation σ t ϕ i θ j and c are parameters of the arma part ω α i and β j are parameters of the garch part maximum likelihood method is employed to estimate the parameters of arma garch model m and n are orders of arma part x t i 1 m ϕ i x t i ε t j 1 n θ j ε t j c r and s are orders of garch part σ t 2 ω i 1 r α i ε t i 2 j 1 s β j σ t j 2 two different indexes aic akaike s information criterion and bic bayes information criterion are employed to determine orders of the arma garch model models with smaller aic or bic values are considered to perform better in terms of fitting univariate variables ξ t denotes an independent and identically distributed sequence with a zero mean and unit variance i e the standardized residual from arma garch model here we can use a specific distribution to transform ξ t to a uniform distribution in fact the exact distribution of ξ t is generally not known to avoid misspecification in distribution model the non parametric empirical cumulative distribution function cdf i e the gringorten plotting position formula in this study appendix a is used to transform ξ t to uniform distribution for copula construction 2 3 partial copula based joint distribution in this study the partial copula proposed by bergsma 2004 is exploited to measure the dependence of pairs y z conditioned on x denoted by y z x based on the definition of the copula the partial copula is defined as a joint distribution of u and v which are distributions of y and z conditioned on x 3 c u v θ 1 θ 2 θ c u f 2 1 y x θ 1 v f 3 1 z x θ 2 θ f 23 1 y z x where f 2 1 y x θ 1 pr y y x x and f 3 1 z x θ 2 pr z z x x are conditional distribution functions of y and z given x x θ 1 and θ 2 are parameters of conditional distributions f 2 1 and f 3 1 θ is the parameter of the partial copula which measures the dependence strength of y and z conditioned on x the transformation of y z into u v is called the rosenblatt transform by song 2009 or partial copula transform by bergsma 2010 the basic theorem of partial copula is that if x 1 x 2 xn are random variables with a continuous multivariate distribution f the following random variables u i i 1 2 n 4 u 1 f 1 x 1 u 2 f 2 1 x 2 x 1 u n f n 1 2 n 1 x n x 1 x 2 x n 1 are iid u 0 1 analogous to the form of conditional distribution function f 2 1 y x θ 1 conditional distribution un in eq 4 can be expressed as 5 u n f n 1 2 n 1 x n x 1 x 2 x n 1 θ n pr x n x n x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x n 1 x n 1 therefore the conditional distribution of the ith component u i conditioned on the first i 1 components of u 1 u 2 u n t can be defined from densities of the i dimensional marginal and of the derivatives 6 c i u i u 1 u 2 u i 1 pr u i u i u 1 u 1 u 2 u 2 u i 1 u i 1 i 1 c i u 1 u 2 u i u 1 u i 1 i 1 c i u 1 u 2 u i 1 u 1 u i 1 when n 3 the pair copula aas et al 2009 can also be used to model dependence structures of multivariate data while using bivariate copulas as building blocks if n 2 c 2 u 2 u 1 pr u 2 u 2 u 1 u 1 c u 1 u 2 u 1 therefore conditional distribution functions of y and z conditioned on x x are expressed as 7 f 2 1 y x θ 1 pr y y x x c f y f x θ 1 f x 8 f 3 1 z x θ 2 pr z z x x c f z f x θ 2 f x here f y f x and f z are marginal distributions of y x and z in the present study marginal distribution f is estimated from iid ξ t sequence of arma garch model therefore eq 3 can be written as 9 c u v θ 1 θ 2 θ c f 2 1 y x θ 1 f 3 1 z x θ 2 θ c c f y f x θ 1 f x c f z f x θ 2 f x θ once a copula form is selected the next crucial step is to estimate parameters of the partial copula function in present study the stepwise parametric method introduced by kim et al 2011 is applied for parameters estimation of partial copula details of the method are introduced in appendix b 2 4 pacolr algorithm for dshf change point detection details of the clr method are shown as follows assuming that no change in types of copulas occurs the null hypothesis stating that the parameter of the dependence structure of x i i 1 2 n is constant is defined as 13 h 0 θ 1 θ 2 θ n against the null hypothesis h 0 the alternative hypothesis is h 1 not all of θ 1 θ 2 θn are equal 15 in general the positions of change points are unknown here we assume that the location of change point is k where the test statistic k of copula based likelihood ratio is minimum for the whole time series dias and embrechts 2004 15 k l n η 0 l k η 1 l n k η 2 1 i n c f x i f y i η 0 1 i k c f x i f y i η 1 k 1 i n c f x i f y i η 2 where l n denotes the likelihood function of the whole time series l k where l n k is the likelihood function of the time series for before and after the change point of the dependence structure where c is the probability distribution function of the copula and η 0 η 1 and η 2 are the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameter to avoid neglecting the existence of multiple change points once a change point is detected the original whole time series are divided into two segments as new whole time series then the clr method is be applied again to the two so called new whole time series independently this procedure is iterated until no further change points are detected i e the so called binary segmentation method proposed by vostrikova 1981 additionally the change point k should be limited to a suitable range to avoid sampling uncertainties when estimating parameters of marginal and joint distributions due to the small sample size employed in the present study k is limited to between 36 and n 36 following lenth 2001 for better computing the test statistic k is log transformed shown as 16 2 ln k 2 ln l k η 1 ln l n k η 2 ln l n η 0 therefore the location of change point is k with max z n 17 z n max 1 k n 1 2 ln k according to likelihood ratio test methods the asymptotic distribution of statistic z n 1 2 can generally be estimated via the monte carlo simulation method with a heavy computational burden hence we use another convenient method introduced by gombay and horváth 1996 to approximate the distribution of z n 1 2 which can be given as follows 18 pr z n 1 2 z z p exp z 2 2 2 p 2 γ p 2 1 p z 2 ln 1 h 1 l hl 4 z 2 o 1 z 4 here h l l n n 3 2 n when z and p denotes the number of copula parameters when the p value of z n 1 2 is less than 5 the time corresponding to the change point can be estimated as follows 19 k arg max 1 k n 2 ln k 2 5 copula based models for dshf measurement as aforementioned in the introduction p evapotranspiration and q are key process of basin scaled water balance p and q can be easily obtained by direct observation by contrast there exist remarkable difficulties and uncertainties in measuring or estimating evapotranspiration verstraeten et al 2008 therefore in present study the evapotranspiration is substituted by pe which reflects the atmosphere s capacity to spur evapotranspiration chattopadhyay et al 2009 thus the following three copula based models are used for measuring the strength of dshf i the dependence structure between q and p whilst controlling for the effect of pe i e q p pe 10 f q p pe q p pe c f 2 1 q pe θ 1 f 3 1 p pe θ 2 θ ii the dependence structure between q and pe whilst controlling for the effect of p i e q pe p 11 f q pe p q pe p c f 2 1 q p θ 1 f 3 1 pe p θ 2 θ iii the dependence structure between p and pe i e p pe 12 f p pe p pe c f p f pe θ as for the copula function this paper employs two widely used copula families in the hydrology field to model the dshf i e the elliptical copulas student t copula gaussian copula and archimedean copulas clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula bardossy 2006 salvadori and de michele 2007 genest et al 2007 wang et al 2010 ma et al 2013 xiong et al 2014 for sake of simplicity specific formulas of these copulas are not presented in this paper readers interested in theoretical details are referred to the studies by nelsen 2006 and salvadori et al 2007 3 application to the yellow river basin 3 1 study area and data set the lp 34 41 n 100 115 e is situated in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin in north china fig 1 the total area of the lp is 632520 km2 accounting for 6 3 of the entire land area of china liang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 elevation ranges from 1000 m to 1600 m above the sea level continuous loess on hills basins and alluvial plains covers the surface of the lp with height ranging from 100 to 300 m in thickness the lp lies mostly in the arid and semi arid continental monsoon climatic zone the mean annual temperature ranges from 4 3 to 14 3 c from the northwest to the southeast of the lp mean annual precipitation varies between 200 mm in the northwest and 750 mm in the southeast which predominantly falls between june and september rainfall within summer months is in the form of high intensity rainstorms the lp contributes approximately 90 of the total sediment in the yellow river basin in the current work 8 primary catchments fig 1 with strong climate and land surface gradients are selected to represent the combined influence of climatic and land surface factors on hydrological processes the 8 catchments cover about 32 0 of the lp area and contribute about 60 4 of total runoff and about 71 6 of sediment discharge from the lp details of them and the corresponding annual mean magnitude of p pe and q are displayed in table 1 monthly runoff data 1960 2010 for the 8 hydrological stations are used in the current work these data were provided by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission which monitors collects and releases hydrological information on the yellow river basin daily meteorological data 1960 2010 on precipitation mean maximum minimum temperature air pressure relative humidity wind velocity and sunshine duration levels are provided through the china meteorological data sharing service system http cdc cma gov cn daily potential evapotranspiration levels measured at each individual station are calculated via the fao56 penman monteith method appendix c using these meteorological data then the monthly areal p and pe for each catchment are obtained through the thiessen polygon method 3 2 construction of the arma garch based marginal models prior to estimating the arma garch models we first remove the seasonality from monthly q p and pe series through subtracting monthly mean values and then dividing seasonal standard deviations of the original series see shang 2006 eq 7 46 eq 7 47b then the autocorrelation function values are calculated to examine the presence of serial correlation in these deseasonalized series shown in table s1 supplemental material afterwards the arma model is used to eliminate the autocorrelation then the engle s lagrange multiplier test is performed for investigating the heteroscedasticity of the residuals in the arma model fig 2 exhibits the results of engle s lagrange multiplier test for residuals from arma model for deseasonalized q figs s1 and s2 supplemental material show this for deseasonalized p and pe once the heteroscedasticity is discovered the garch model is incorporated into the previously obtained arma model then the parameters in the arma garch model is obtained through the maximum likelihood method here the aic and bic is employed to determine the appropriate orders of arma garch model optimal arma garch models are shown in table 2 from table s1 figs 2 and s1 s2 it can be found that i both the autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity are not significant in the deseasonalized p series at the 5 level in the lp except for that in the kuye catchment ii deseasonalized q series exhibit significant autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity at the 5 level in the lp iii deseasonalized pe series exhibit significant autocorrelation and non significant heteroscedasticity at the 5 level in the lp worthy of note is that not only in the lp serial correlation and heteroscedasticity also have been detected in hydro meteorological factors in the other regions laux et al 2011 wang et al 2012 modarres and ouarda 2013 mehdizadeh et al 2017 previous studies have highlighted that presence of serial correlation and heteroscedasticity may invalidate iid assumption and thus lead to misleading conclusions such as on trend detection caloiero et al 2011 sonali and kumar 2013 frequency analysis yoo et al 2016 and so on laux et al 2011 wang et al 2012 therefore taking the serial correlation and heteroscedasticity into account is extremely worthwhile for statistical model construction such as for the copula construction in present study under this context the arma garch model seems to be an appropriate choice specifically iid residuals of arma arma garch models for the deseasonalized q p and pe series are transformed to uniform distributions using empirical cumulative distribution function for copula partial copula construction 3 3 construction of copula based models for dshf measurement once the marginal distribution is estimated the next step is to construct copula based models in general this step consists of measuring the dependence of variables of interest and selecting appropriate copula functions as aforementioned in section 2 3 the copula parameter measures the dependence strength between hydro meteorological factors the larger the parameter θ of a specific copula the stronger the strength between variables while the parameters among different types of copulas are less comparable hence the kendall rank coefficient is selected to as a general measure to measure the dependence of variables instead of the copula parameter the primary reason behind this selection is the one to one transformation from copula parameter space into the range of the values for the corresponding kendall rank coefficient frahm et al 2003 yu et al 2014 table 3 reports kendall tau values between q p and pe series filtered and not filtered by arma arma garch models for brevity the correlation coefficients between q p and pe are written as corr q p corr q pe and corr p pe it can be seen from table 3 that the corr q p between original q and p series are smaller than that between filtered q and p series by arma arma garch models by contrast the corr q pe and corr p pe between original series are both similar to that between filtered series however it is worthy of note that the corr q p corr q pe and corr p pe are all significant at 99 confidence level no matter whether or not the arma arma garch models are performed moreover from table 3 we can conclude that the correlation directions of q p are all positive in different catchments in the lp while that of q pe and p pe are negative besides the absolute values of kendall tau of q p are all larger than that of q pe indicating a stronger dependence of q p than q pe in the lp this finding is consistent with that of zuo et al 2015 and zhao et al 2018 the primary reason is that catchments in the lp are rain dominated regions where rainfall is the main source of streamflow zhan et al 2014 li and gao 2015 higher rainfall means larger streamflow under natural environment meanwhile pe reflects atmosphere s capacity to spur evapotranspiration which has indirect connection with streamflow thus the dependence strength between q and pe is weaker than that between q and p as for the copula function selection this study employs the aic index copula functions with smaller aic value are considered to perform better in terms of modeling the dshf table 4 lists corresponding results while the selected copulas are shown in bold values moreover it can be found from table 4 that the selected copula functions are different for different pairs of hydro meteorological variables in different catchments 3 4 results of the dshf change points on the basis of these selected copulas change points of dshf in the lp are identified through the pacolr algorithm table 4 in addition to the change points of dshf we investigate change points of univariate deseasonalized q p and pe series through pettitt test method as one rank based nonparametric method the pettitt test has received widespread attention within the hydrologic community gao et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 related results are listed in table 5 it can be found from table 5 that change points of q p pe and q pe p exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity compared with that of pe p in the lp in terms of q p pe 1997 6 and 1998 11 are significant change points at 1 significance level in the kuye and wuding catchments respectively in qinhe catchment significant change point of q p pe occurs in 1991 4 there is no change point at 5 significance level for the other catchments from table 5 it can be found that change points of q p pe basically coincide with that of q specifically change points 1997 6 1998 11 and 1991 4 of q p pe are consistent with 1998 7 1999 2 and 1990 6 of univariate q series in the kuye wuding and qinhe catchments respectively in addition to above worthy of note from table 5 is that the existence change point of q doesn t mean the presence of change point of q pe p absolutely such as the in the fenhe jinghe weihe and yiluo catchments as for the q pe p 1993 8 is the significant change point in the fenhe catchment at 5 significance level while no change point occurs in the other catchments here the change point 1993 8 of q pe p in the fenhe catchment seems to be related more to the change point of pe in 1993 12 intuitively similarly the presence of change point in univariate series fails to manifest the change point of q pe p above results highlight that the individual hydrological factor analyses can provide limited information on hydrological cycle revealing variability of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors is particularly indispensable for better understanding regional hydrological cycle detecting change point of p pe is beneficial to revealing regional climate change results reported in table 5 show that change points of p pe mainly occur in approximately 1980 for all the catchments in the lp except the weihe and qinhe catchments intuitively the time seems to coincide with the global warming hypothesis karl and trenberth 2003 hansen et al 2012 in addition 1991 8 is the significant change point of p pe at 5 significance for the fenhe and weihe catchments the major cause of change point of p pe may be the difference of decreasing trends in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration across the lp as xu et al 2007 stated to examine the effect of covariate on change points of dshf we take the kuye catchment as an example and present the difference of statistic zn between two conditions which considering the effect of covariate or not fig 3 it can be found from fig 3 that the temporal change of zn under q p pe is nearly consistent with that under q p for the kuye catchment by contrast the temporal change of zn exhibits significant difference between q pe p and q pe this phenomenon can mainly be attributed to the fact that lp is a rain dominant watershed streamflow responds quickly and directly to precipitation in the lp but is relatively less influenced by changes of pe in other words the effect of p on q is independent of that of pe while the effect of pe on q is dependent of effect of p sun et al 2013 thus when examining change points of dependence between q and p there is smaller difference between eliminating and not eliminating the effect of pe on p and q in contrast controlling for the effect of p on pe and q is indispensable when examining change points of dependence structure between pe and q particularly in rain dominated basin 4 summary and conclusions exploring the change points of dependence structures between hydro meteorological factors dshf is greatly beneficial for disclosing the evolution of hydrological cycle under the changing environment in view of this a partial copula based likelihood ratio pacolr test algorithm is developed to examine change points of dshf here the partial copula is used to model the complex nonlinear relationship between hydro meteorological factors and eliminate the effect of covariate on dshf moreover as the copula based models require independent and identically distributed univariate margins hydro meteorological variables are transformed through the arma garch arma autoregressive moving average garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity time series model eight major catchments across the loess plateau lp are selected as study regions change points of dependence structures between streamflow q precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pe are detected through the pacolr algorithm for simplicity dependence structure between q and p pe whilst controlling for the effect of pe p are marked as q p pe q pe p due to the spatial heterogeneity of climatic patterns and anthropogenic activities change points of q p pe and q pe p vary across the lp change points of the dependence structures between p and pe in the lp occur around early 1980s which seems to coincide with the time of global warming hypothesis intuitively another noteworthy point is that the effect of covariate on the change points of dshf in the lp a rain dominated region when examining change points of dependence structure between q and pe eliminating effect of p on q and pe is extremely essential the main reason behind this is that effect of p on q is independently related to that of pe while effect of pe on q is dependently related to effect of p in the rain dominated basin such as the lp in this study declaration of competing

5739,groundwater is a major component of the water cycle in the river deltaic environment however the dynamics of groundwater flows in the river delta remains an open question owing to the complexities in the hydrologic and geological settings this study employed a hydrogeological modeling approach to investigate groundwater dynamics in the mississippi river delta mrd a detailed groundwater model for the top 50 m of the mrd was constructed from the head of passes rk 0 to jesuits bend rk 108 using geotechnical borings and topobathymetric maps mississippi river stage and tide stage data were the key hydrologic data which reflect hydrologic forcing floods storms and hurricanes to the groundwater system by investigating the 2012 hydrologic year the study presents several intriguing findings groundwater discharge and recharge rates to the river and surrounding bays were estimated 3 or 4 orders of magnitude smaller than mississippi river discharge rate to the gulf of mexico nevertheless the model showed strong surface groundwater interactions controlled by local hydraulic gradient at the river and bay interfaces during severe hydrologic events specifically during hurricane isaac pore water pressure was estimated 4 6 times higher than the normal condition and peak groundwater recharge was reached due to storm surges peak groundwater discharge sharply occurred a few days later after the hurricane passed the study found such a dramatic change in surface groundwater interactions was due to quick surface water receding and delayed groundwater response as a consequence more areas are likely exposed to harmful high pore water pressure and low factor of safety condition which would destabilize sediments enhance erosion and compromise safety of coastal infrastructures such as the ring levees keywords mississippi river delta groundwater surface water modeling surface groundwater interactions 1 introduction a river delta is a landform created by deposition of riverine sediments as a river enters another body of water such as ocean and lake reading 1978 in the coastal area a river delta is normally entrenched by the river and surrounded by interdistributary bays and tends to be aerially extensive and low relief groundwater is a major component in the river deltaic environment fig 1 is a conceptual diagram depicting hydrogeological architecture and surface groundwater interactions a river deltaic groundwater system is composed of confining layers and aquifers groundwater can interact with surface water through rivers interdistributary bays canals and drains groundwater can also interact with atmospheric waters through precipitation and evapotranspiration groundwater plays an important role in biogeochemical processes via influencing water quality nutrient flux chen et al 2007 debnath and mukherjee 2016 liu and mou 2016 and vegetation structure fan et al 2011 however dynamics of groundwater flows in the river deltaic environment remains an open question due to complexities in river deltaic stratigraphy and hydrology river deltaic stratigraphy is formed under fluvial deltaic and coastal processes and river deltaic hydrology involves frequent disturbance from floods storms and hurricanes nevertheless groundwater flow is often overlooked in the river deltaic environment because of rich low permeability silty and clayey sediments where groundwater flow is less important as a matter of fact the river deltaic system also contains a large volume of sandy sediments placed at depth as bar finger sands or buried near surface as crevasse splay deposits fisk 1961 welder 1955 these sandy deposits are favorable places for surface groundwater interactions in the river deltaic environment coleman et al 2016 kolker et al 2013 sawyer et al 2015 in this study we investigate the dynamics of groundwater flows in the mississippi river delta mrd the mrd is the river delta formed at the confluence of the mississippi river with the gulf of mexico fig 2 the modern mississippi river delta plain formed in the past 7500 years consists of multiple subdeltas maringouin teche st bernard

sustainability for the mrd and adjacent regions cpra 2012 2017 many studies were conducted on the mrd aiming at understanding the river deltaic system bentley et al 2016 chamberlain et al 2018 and providing insights for coastal restoration allison et al 2012 day et al 2007 meselhe et al 2016 xu et al 2019 many previous groundwater related studies in the mrd were conducted in the context of submarine groundwater discharge sgd which refers to seaward flow or discharge of water from aquifers to oceans burnett et al 2006 researchers used geochemical tracers to assess groundwater fluxes in the near shore marine environment cable et al 1996 kim 2016 krest et al 1999 mccoy et al 2007 moore and krest 2004 and to identify flow pathways for the sgd kolker et al 2013 flow rates from 0 1 to 2 5 cm day were reported in the coastal area along the mrd kim 2016 the tracer method can be used to detect groundwater discharge at measurement locations and estimate discharge rates however it is still challenging to use this method to evaluate the dynamics of groundwater flows in a coastal groundwater system that involves multiple aquifers and that shows significant spatial and temporal variabilities burnett et al 2006 moreover the sgd only accounts for one direction of groundwater flow landward flow or recharge of water from oceans to aquifers have seldom been discussed in the mrd this study attempts to fill in the knowledge gap in how the hydrologic and hydrogeological settings influence groundwater flows in the mrd major research questions in this study include 1 where groundwater and surface water river and bay waters interact in a river deltaic system 2 how groundwater head and groundwater flow respond to seasonal flood storm and hurricane events and 3 what role groundwater may play in the coastal sustainability past studies have employed groundwater models to address some of these questions thompson et al 2007 developed a large scale conceptualized groundwater model up to depth 5 km to evaluate groundwater seawater circulation in the continental shelf of louisiana the study concluded that no substantial terrestrial origin groundwater discharge exists on the continental shelf on the contrary o connor and moffett 2015 developed a small scale groundwater model to study surface groundwater interactions in a young prograding delta island within the wax lake delta west of the mrd the study found that intensity and direction of the groundwater flow are controlled by hydraulic gradients at surface water groundwater interfaces however both groundwater models were hydrogeologically simple and did not capture the heterogeneity in the depositional environment of sandy silty and clayey sediments for a river deltaic system this study developed a more detailed groundwater model to address the aforementioned questions in this study an integrated groundwater model was constructed along mississippi river from the head of passes rk river kilometer 0 to jesuits bend rk 108 the model focuses on the topmost 50 m of the river delta many emerging datasets geotechnical borings topobathymetric maps river and tide gauges etc were used to construct the model geotechnical borings were used to construct a stratigraphy model which serve as the structure of the groundwater model topobathymetric maps were used to determine the surface of the groundwater model river and tide gauges were used to determine flood storm and hurricane events to the model boundary conditions 2 study area the study area shown in fig 2 covers a large portion of the plaquemines balize delta lobe which is formed between lafourche delta lobe to the southwest and st bernard delta lobe to the northeast the area is about 1800 km2 with maximum length of 100 km and maximum width 20 km the area is bounded by barataria bay to the northwest breton sound to the east and gulf of mexico to the south and southwest as shown in fig 3 the upper half of the area mainly consists of a trunk river channel natural levees tidal marshes and impounding lakes the lower half of the area mainly consists of the trunk river channel splay channels broken tidal marshes and open waters residential and business areas are protected by the ring levees along mississippi river due to its subtropical latitude low lying topography and proximity to the gulf of mexico southeastern louisiana has a humid subtropical climate the study area has long hot and humid summers and short and mild winters annual average temperature is about 21 c annual average precipitation is about 1600 mm the area has about 110 days of precipitation per year national climatic data center 2018 the mrd is often affected by hydrologic events such as river floods and tropical cyclones the lowlands are very vulnerable to major hurricanes and the area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms especially in summer months hurricane katrina and hurricane isaac are the two most recent major hurricanes that made landfall within 30 km of the study area hurricane katrina was a category 5 hurricane that made landfall near buras triumph louisiana in august 2005 causing more than 1800 fatalities and 125 billion dollars of property damage knabb et al 2005 hurricane isaac was a category 1 hurricane that made landfall near the southwest of the mississippi river mouth in august 2012 causing 41 fatalities and 3 billion dollars of property damage berg 2013 3 hydrologic data and hydrologic events in 2012 this study investigates groundwater dynamics associated with hydrologic forcing between november 1 2011 and october 31 2012 daily river stage data were collected from stations at alliance pointe a la hache empire venice west bay and head of passes fig 2 the river gage data are maintained by the u s army corps of engineers usace usace 2018 fig 4 a shows hydrographs for the six stations the vertical datum for all river stages is the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 this period includes three seasonal mississippi river floods before may 2012 tropical storm debby in june 2012 and hurricane isaac in august 2012 each of the three floods lasted about one and a half months crest stages were over 1 5 m at northern stations tropical storm debby was formed on june 23 2012 from a trough of low pressure and made landfall in florida s big bend region on 26 june 2012 kimberlain 2013 river stages were raised by storm surges and were above 1 m at northern stations hurricane isaac caused dramatic water level increase in all stations in mississippi river between august 21 and september 1 2012 hurricane isaac was a category 1 hurricane prior to making two landfalls in southeastern louisiana berg 2013 fig 2 shows the hurricane track the first landfall was made at the southwest pass at the mouth of the mississippi river around 0000 coordinated universal time utc 29 august the second landfall was made west to port fourchon louisiana around 0800 utc 29 august berg 2013 the hurricane slowed down while approaching the coast of louisiana the slow movement prolonged the strong wind high storm surges and heavy rainfall along the coast strong easterly wind caused large storm surges along the eastern shore of the plaquemines balize and st bernard delta lobes and the western shore of lake borgne guy et al 2013 the storm surges elevated water level in mississippi river more than 1 5 m at all stations and more than 2 m at northern stations the hydrologic events in 2012 set an ideal groundwater study based upon two distinct hydrologic episodes on the mrd one hydrologic episode is the hydrologic loading from seasonal mississippi river floods which usually end before june every year junk et al 1989 the other hydrologic episode is the hurricane season which starts june every year larson et al 2005 another possible hydrologic episode that both mississippi river floods and hurricanes occur at the same time never happened before hurricane barry in july 2019 was a close one but barry made a landfall about 210 km west of the study area when it became a category 1 hurricane national weather service 2019 tidal stage data were collected from 86 tide gages in and around the study area fig 2 eighty 80 gages were from cpra s coastwide reference monitoring system cpra 2018 four 4 gages were from noaa s tides and currents database noaa 2018a b and two 2 gages were from usgs national surface water database usgs 2018 all water level data were adjusted to the navd 88 datum using noaa s vertical datum transformation tool noaa 2018a b fig 4b shows the daily water levels from november 1 2011 to october 31 2012 for all 86 tide gages normal tidal water levels in all tide gages are generally between 0 m and 1 m navd 88 the seasonal mississippi river floods had minimum influence on tidal water levels however tidal water levels were elevated by tropical storm debby and hurricane isaac tropical storm debby raised tidal water level over 1 m at several gages strong storm surges from hurricane isaac caused a spike in all tide gages some tide gages experienced more than 3 m water levels tidal stage data were interpolated to determine boundary conditions for the model s lateral boundaries moreover tidal stage data were also interpolated to determine surficial boundary conditions that reflect open water and inundated areas in the model domain and water levels above land surface inundations increase groundwater recharge from land surface in general more than 60 of the model domain was under water during the normal condition no mississippi river high water no severe storms and no hurricanes as shown in fig 4c due to the low relief topography small fluctuations in tides can substantially alter the extent of the inundated areas there is a spike on march 21 2012 that more than 80 of the model domain was under water this was caused by a trough of low pressure that slowly moved eastwards and generated severe thunderstorms and outbreak of tornados across southeast louisiana storm prediction center 2012 tropical strom debby caused more than 85 of the model domain to be inundated hurricane isaac caused more than 90 of the model domain to be inundated 4 methods 4 1 construction of stratigraphy model geotechnical data were used to determine sediment types and build a stratigraphy model for the study area 619 borings were collected from the usace usgs and cpra the boring sites are along the river levees and on marshlands fig 2 each boring records sediment types and corresponding elevations with respect to the navd 88 sediment types were classified by the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2017 which include poorly graded sand sp silty sand sm clayey sand sc silt ml elastic silt mh low plasticity clay cl high plasticity clay ch organic clay oh and peat pt distribution of sediment types for the study area was estimated at 0 3 m 1 ft intervals from 3 m to 46 m navd 88 the model was discretized into 161 layers each layer has 44 810 cells cell size is 200 m by 200 m a multiple indicator natural neighbor interpolation minn method was used to obtain layer wise distribution of sediment types for each layer the minn method is based on the natural neighbor interpolation nn method sibson 1980 sibson 1981 tsai et al 2005 indicator values of the 9 sediment types were calculated by the minn method at a location the final sediment type for the location was determined by the highest indicator value then the 161 layers were stacked and upscaled into a three dimensional stratigraphy model by merging adjacent vertical cells that have the same sediment type li et al 2019a li et al 2019b the upscaling procedure resulted in a 25 layer stratigraphy model with a total of 1 120 250 cells we will discuss the stratigraphic modeling results in the results and discussion section a topobathymetric map was used to determine the relief of the stratigraphy model and later the groundwater model the topobathymetric map was generated by merging a digital elevation model of new orleans love et al 2010a and a digital elevation model of southern louisiana love et al 2010b both of the data sets have a resolution of 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m and vertical datum navd 88 4 2 groundwater model development the structure of a groundwater model was built based upon the stratigraphy model this study used modflow usg panday et al 2017 to simulate groundwater flow in the mrd modflow usg uses a generalized control volume finite difference cvfe approach to solve groundwater flow equations narasimhan and witherspoon 1976 the groundwater model simulated daily groundwater head and groundwater flow from november 1 2011 to october 31 2012 there were 366 daily time steps as groundwater head distribution on november 1 2011 represents the groundwater condition without severe hydrologic events for a month groundwater head in the first time step was simulated under the steady state condition groundwater head in other time steps was simulated under the transient condition the daily time step was used instead of hourly time step in the simulation to understand groundwater dynamics on events that last for days e g neap spring tides storms and hurricanes or months e g floods in a time frame of a hydrologic year there are three types of boundaries in the model as shown in fig 5 these boundaries correspond to the surface groundwater interfaces the river boundary is at the interface between mississippi river and the subsurface and was identified as river cells in the model the tide boundary is at the interface between surrounding bays including inundated areas and the subsurface and was identified as tide cells the lateral boundaries are the model outer boundaries shown in fig 5b which are influenced by tides the cross sections show that mississippi river incises 20 m to 40 m into the subsurface other non boundary cells are inner cells in the model domain a general head boundary condition was assigned to the three types of boundaries which characterizes a head dependent flux across a material at the boundary as follows q k a h h b where q is the flow rate m3 day across the boundary material k is the hydraulic conductivity per unit width of the boundary material 1 day a is the cross sectional area of the boundary material perpendicular to the flow m2 h is the hydraulic head of a boundary forcing term m and h b is the groundwater head at the boundary m k a is the hydraulic conductance m2 day to assign hydraulic head at the river boundary water levels at the 6 river gauges fig 4a were interpolated to all river cells according to river kilometers to assign hydraulic head at the tide boundary tidal stages at the 86 tide gauges fig 4b were interpolated to all tide cells special attention was paid to determining tide cells for the inundated areas because the inundated areas changed over time wet and dry condition for surficial cells was taken care by comparing tidal water level to land elevation for the lateral boundaries interpolated tidal stages at the model boundary were used to assign the boundary values surficial groundwater recharge from precipitation and groundwater loss from evapotranspiration were not directly considered in the model because the majority of the model domain is under water the river and tidal water levels have taken precipitation and evaporation into consideration as a result groundwater storage gain or loss in the mrd depends on groundwater interactions with the mississippi river and the surrounding bays and groundwater fluxes through the lateral boundaries a simplified water balance equation is δ s i river i bays i lateral o river o bays o lateral where δ s is the storage change m3 i is the inflow m3 and o is the outflow m3 the inflow and outflow terms at the boundaries are determined by the groundwater model through water budget analysis 4 3 model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses model parameters include hydraulic conductivity k specific storage sy and specific yield ss for the 9 sediment types and k for the river tide and lateral boundaries in total there are 30 parameters need to be determined unfortunately there is no groundwater data available in the study area for model calibration instead sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how model parameters affect groundwater recharge rates from the river tide and lateral boundaries table 1 lists the range of parameter values from the literature for sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out for the thirty parameters a composite scaled sensitivity css method hill et al 1998 was used to identify the most sensitive parameters among all parameters to calculate the css the total groundwater recharge flowrate for the kth value of parameter p j k was calculated by q k t 1 t i 1 n q it k where q it k is the flowrate at boundary cell i at time t with respect to parameter p j k then the css value for the kth value of parameter p j k was calculated by cs s j k q k p j k p j k σ q where σ q is the standard deviation of the total groundwater recharge flowrate q the final css value with respect to parameter p j was calculated as cs s j 1 m k 1 m css j k 2 where m is the sample size of parameter p j k the css ranked the model parameters from the most sensitive parameter to the least sensitive parameter then uncertainty analysis was carried out by sampling the top most sensitive parameters using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method helton and davis 2003 ranking of the sensitivities will be discussed in the results and discussion section thirty 30 sets of realizations were generated using the lhs method simulations were carried out using these sets of sampled parameters model results from these simulations will be discussed later 4 4 factor of safety fs calculations factor of safety fs is a commonly used measure for the potential concern of sand boils and uplifting harr 1962 usace 1993 fema 2015 this study adopts the fs as an indicator to imply sediment stability in the river deltaic setting fs is estimated from a ratio of effective weight of the soil to net pressure head against the top stratum a factor of safety greater than 1 5 is preferred fs is also referred as the ratio of the critical upward hydraulic gradient to in situ upward hydraulic gradient usace 1993 fs i c i where i c is the critical hydraulic gradient and i is the hydraulic gradient across the top stratum the hydraulic gradient across the top stratum was derived from the groundwater model since the top stratum is not homogeneous transformed thickness in terms of clay sediments was calculated for the top stratum based on the method in usace 1992 a value of 0 8 is commonly used for the critical hydraulic gradient usace 1956 5 results and discussion 5 1 mrd stratigraphy the emerging subsurface investigation dataset made possible for this study to estimate the spatial distribution of different sediments and to evaluate connectivity between groundwater and surface water bodies in the mrd as shown in fig 6 a the surface of the mrd is dominated by estimated silty ml and mh clayey cl and ch and organic clay oh sediments which form a large surficial confining layer however a large area of estimated sandy sediments in the middle of the mrd is exposed to land surface or directly contacts bay water estimated sandy sediments are also exposed to the mississippi river channel or near the river mouth silty and clayey sediments also make up the largest portion under the mrd as shown in the cross sections fig 6b thickness of the surficial confining layer varies greatly from 0 to the entire model depth most of the sandy sediments sp sm and sc were deposited along and below the main mississippi river channel and are confined by fine grained sediments except for those exposed to the topobathymetric surface see cross section cc some sands are interlayered by silty and clayey sediments near surface sedimentological heterogeneity causes complex hydrogeological heterogeneity in the river deltaic system o connor and moffett 2015 wolski and savenije 2006 though the stratigraphy model shows a general clay sand clay layering in the mrd the near surface stratigraphy is complicated by sandy sediments deposited through splay channel in fill overbank flooding and tributary extension bomer et al 2019 esposito et al 2017 kolker et al 2013 shen et al 2015 these sandy sediments can serve as preferential conduits for groundwater flow and form hotspots for groundwater exchanging and mixing with river and bay waters 5 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters the rank is shown in fig 7 specific yield of cl and specific storage of sm ml cl sp and sc are the top 6 sensitive parameters other parameters have css less than 4 cl is abundant at or near the surface and sm ml sp and sc are abundant and connect to the river which makes the specific yield of cl and the specific storage of sm ml cl sp and sc the most sensitive model parameters uncertainty analysis was conducted by sampling from the 6 most sensitive parameters thirty 30 sets of parameters were generated using the lhs method and input to the groundwater model to evaluate uncertainty one standard deviation was used to quantify the uncertainties in flow rates and storage changes 5 3 groundwater mississippi river interactions groundwater recharge from or discharge to mississippi river depends on local hydraulic gradients along the river fig 8 shows the simulated mean flow rates through the river boundary with one standard deviation uncertainty from nov 2011 to oct 2012 higher flow rates associate with higher estimation uncertainty for non flood and non hurricane periods groundwater recharge and discharge rates were estimated generally within 0 4 million m3 day groundwater recharge rate could reach as high as 0 75 million m3 day during the three flood events nevertheless low groundwater discharge rate still occurred whenever river stage dropped below groundwater head during the floods tropical storm debby intensified groundwater recharge rates which was estimated up to 0 5 million m3 day storm surges by hurricane isaac created a sharp groundwater recharge rate which was estimated as high as 2 5 million m3 day followed by a sharp groundwater discharge rate estimated around 1 million m3 day in responding to the rapid river water drop after the hurricane passed comparing to the mean mississippi river flow rate 1 145 billion m3 day 468 000 ft3 sec at belle chasse it is not surprising to see that the groundwater recharge and discharge rates in the mrd are very small this result is in agreement with a previous study in the breton sound hyfield et al 2008 that the groundwater flow rate is significantly less than inputs from precipitation or river diversion moreover dividing the estimated groundwater flux with the river channel surface area yields specific discharge between 0 1 cm day and 1 cm day which is similar to the previous measurements e g kim 2016 however the groundwater flux estimation in this study is much less than the estimation made by some of the previous studies in the river deltaic environment for example moore and krest 2004 concluded that groundwater fluxes on the western side of the mrd equal to 7 of the average mississippi river discharge and basu et al 2001 claimed that the groundwater flux in the bay is approximately 19 of the total discharge in the ganges brahmaputra river bangladesh 5 4 groundwater bay interactions groundwater recharge from and discharge to the surrounding bays are controlled by vertical hydraulic gradients at the topobathymetric surface as shown in fig 9 the groundwater system exchanges water more frequently with bays than with the mississippi river processes such as spring and neap tides li et al 2000 cyclically fluctuate the sea level and thus alternate vertical hydraulic gradients recurrently moreover cold fronts in the region may also contribute to the sea level fluctuation cold fronts normally last for 3 to 7 days and are the common weather pattern between october and april along louisiana s coast chuang and wiseman 1983 the onshore wind during pre frontal phase of a cold front can set up sea level along the coast christopher et al 1993 and the offshore wind during the post frontal phase can flush out water in the bay and drop sea level feng and li 2010 groundwater recharge and discharge rates were estimated generally within 1 million m3 day during nov 2011 to oct 2012 the three major floods had minimum impact on the groundwater tide interactions however thunderstorms around march 21 2012 storm prediction center 2012 and tropical storm debby during june 23 26 2012 elevated sea level and intensified groundwater recharge rate estimated more than 1 million m3 day storm surges by hurricane isaac august 28 to september 1 significantly elevated sea level and induced sharply high groundwater recharge rate estimated about 5 6 million m3 day which was quickly reversed by groundwater discharge with a rate about 2 million m3 day in responding to the sharp sea level drop the inundation area fig 4c is proportional to the groundwater bay exchange rate and is the reason why groundwater bay interactions is stronger than groundwater river interactions in the mrd however the temporal change in the inundation area likely determines either groundwater recharge or groundwater discharge because groundwater head slowly responses to tides due to the low relief topography of the study site frequent changes in the tidal stage can cause frequent changes in inundation patterns and direction of groundwater flow on the tidal flats o connor and moffett 2015 the frequent changes in groundwater flow direction may lead to a tidal pumping effect liu et al 2017 and recirculation of seawater which may account for a large portion of total sgd fluxes santos et al 2009 through exchanging and mixing of groundwater and surface water biogeochemical processes can take place to alter biogeochemistry in the river deltaic system bianchi et al 2013 5 5 groundwater flux across lateral boundaries groundwater flow across the lateral boundaries is influenced by both mississippi river and the interdistributary bays fig 10 shows that groundwater outflow dominates groundwater inflow at the lateral boundaries most of the time this is because of the general seaward hydraulic gradient established by the relatively high mississippi river water with respect to the interdistributary bays however the flow rates were estimated one order of magnitude smaller than those at the groundwater river and groundwater tide interfaces the three flood events established high groundwater head around the river and pushed more groundwater out through the lateral boundaries most of the elevated groundwater discharge rates were estimated below 10 000 m3 day on the contrary storm surges from the severe thunderstorms in march tropical storm debby in june and hurricane isaac in august increased sea level and resulted in groundwater recharge from the lateral boundaries the peak recharge rate was estimated 34 000 m3 day during hurricane isaac 5 6 groundwater storage variation groundwater storage increase or decrease in the mrd strongly associates with surface water dynamics as shown in fig 11 daily groundwater storage variation was estimated within 1 million m3 except for the storm and hurricane events the peak daily storage gain was occurred during hurricane isaac estimated nearly 7 5 million m3 followed by the peak daily storage loss after 3 days cumulative storage changes with respect to the storage on 01 11 2011 show a regular pattern that groundwater storage always increases during flood storm and hurricane events followed by groundwater storage recession fig 11 the groundwater flow simulation started at a low river stage and the year 2012 was a wet year for the mrd the tropical storm debby and the hurricane isaac reversed the recessing trend of groundwater storage between june and september although floods in 2012 were smaller than 2011 the relatively higher post flood river stage along with the storm and hurricane events in 2012 caused the groundwater system to gain around 9 million m3 at the end of the simulation period 10 31 2012 5 7 groundwater head dynamics due to a lack of groundwater models previous studies rarely discuss groundwater head dynamics in the river deltaic setting this section discusses the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater head in different hydrologic conditions in the mrd 5 7 1 pre flood season condition groundwater head distribution on november 1 2011 represents the groundwater condition without severe hydrologic events for a long time say one month groundwater head is relatively uniform and low as shown in fig 12 a groundwater head was estimated between 0 1 m and 0 7 m in most of the area during pre flood season river stages and tidal stages are relatively low low hydraulic gradients indicate low groundwater flow exchanges with the river and the surrounding bays 5 7 2 groundwater response to flood peak groundwater head distribution on february 11 2012 represents the groundwater condition at the crest of a flood groundwater head was high around the mississippi river as shown in fig 12b groundwater head along the river and near the river mouth was estimated between 0 7 m and 2 2 m high groundwater head was built up in the sandy deposits between elevation 10 m and 35 m and dissipated seaward high river stage leads to high groundwater recharge the result indicates a good hydraulic connection of the groundwater system to river water in deltaic distributary channel networks sawyer et al 2015 5 7 3 groundwater response to storm groundwater head distribution on june 25 2012 represents the groundwater condition at peak river tidal stages caused by a tropical storm as shown in fig 12c groundwater head was estimated between 0 7 m and 1 m around the river and between 0 1 m and 1 3 m underneath the surrounding bays different from the flood condition elevated groundwater head occurred not only in deep sands between 10 m and 35 m but also in surficial sands for example the cross section cc moreover the seaward hydraulic gradient around the river is lower than the flood condition due to low pre storm river stage that lasted more than one and a half months 5 7 4 groundwater responses to hurricane similar to the storm a hurricane can also elevate groundwater head around the river and beneath the surrounding bays but with much higher groundwater head as shown in fig 12d on august 29 2012 groundwater head was estimated between 1 6 m and 2 8 m along the river and between 1 0 m and 2 8 m underneath the surrounding bays high river and tidal stages lead to much higher groundwater recharge due to the track and counterclockwise rotation of the hurricane storm surges significantly elevated water level in the upper right corner of the study site the upper portion of the breton sound estuary and caused significate elevation in the groundwater head fig 12d 5 8 impact on factor of safety the factor of safety was calculated using 30 realizations of model parameters at one of peak flood stages february 15 2012 as shown in fig 13 a several areas have more than 90 chance that the estimated factor of safety is lower than 1 5 the majority of the concerned areas are inside the ring levees suggesting strong uplifting force acting on landside levee toes the low factor of safety was due to high groundwater head either beneath a thin clayey blanket or in exposed sand for example at the cross section cc in fig 6b a thin clayey layer can be seen in the eastern bank of mississippi river and a blanket is missing in the western bank low factors of safety are shown in this cross section when river water is high fig 13b shows areas with a factor of safety less than 1 5 at a lower river stage two weeks after the peak flood march 1 2012 the impacted areas are similar to the peak flood condition this is because the levee confined mississippi river water produces groundwater level higher than land elevation in these areas the factor of safety was calculated using 30 realizations of model parameters at peak river and tidal stages august 30 2012 during hurricane isaac as shown in fig 14 a areas with a factor of safety lower than 1 5 are smaller than the flood condition this is due to storm surge elevates mississippi river water and bay water and creates a downward hydraulic gradient in most of the study area except areas within the ring levees fig 14b shows much larger areas of having a factor of safety lower than 1 5 three days after the hurricane passed september 2 2012 this is because the retreating surface water removed overburdens and caused reversed vertical hydraulic gradient at some areas outside the ring levees to experience uplifting forces fast reversion of hydraulic gradient along with high pore water pressure during and after hurricanes can threaten the ring levee systems as well as the coastal communities and industries in the mrd 5 9 groundwater implications 5 9 1 infrastructure safety groundwater surface water interactions in the mrd suggest a concern about infrastructure safety for example man made river diversion can cause tens of meters of scouring in the diversion channel yuill et al 2016 the scouring could alter subsurface hydrology by creating extra flow pathways for groundwater to interact with surface water especially during severe hydrologic events high pore water pressure could be delivered through the flow pathways to the foundations of infrastructures such as levees and river diversion complexes thus could reduce effective stress of sediments and destabilize the foundation of structures nelson and leclair 2006 sills et al 2008 this mechanism may be intensified in a scenario when prolonged flooding overlapped with storms or hurricanes bilskie and hagen 2018 further study is needed to evaluate this concern 5 9 2 salinization sand desalinization as a river deltaic system evolves under the influence of both river and sea balance between fresh and saline water from these two sources drives variation in salinity in the delta fan et al 2011 surface groundwater interactions in the mrd can fluctuate salinity in the groundwater system river discharge to the groundwater system during flood months can reduce salinity in the sediments however the overwash process anderson 2002 terry and falkland 2010 associated with storms and hurricanes can bring saline water into the near surface sediments as a result seawater intrusion to the groundwater system may harm vegetation and result in wetland deterioration and elevation loss day et al 2011 shapouri et al 2015 5 9 3 sediment erosion high pore water pressure is one of the major mechanisms for enhancing sediment erosion by reducing effective stress in sediments robertson et al 2007 although groundwater simulation was conducted on a regional scale instead of a local scale resolution this study suggests that high pore water pressure associated with severe hydrologic events is likely to destabilize sediments and enhance sediment erosion fine grained sediments near the surface could migrate upward through seepage flow zhang et al 2017 areas experience significant elevation in pore water pressure may become a hotspot for sediment erosion xu et al 2016 moreover groundwater discharge associated with rapid drawdown of the surge water after hurricanes may also lead to momentary liquefaction sumer 2002 6 conclusions the major findings on the dynamics of groundwater flows in the mississippi river delta mrd can be summarized as follows 1 this study reveals the complexity of the mrd hydrogeological setting in the top 50 m although the stratigraphy model shows a general clay sand clay layering in the mrd the near surface stratigraphy is complicated by sandy sediments deposited through splay channel in fill overbank flooding and tributary extension these sandy sediments can serve as preferential conduits for groundwater flow and form hotspots for exchanging and mixing of groundwater with bay water confined sands incised by the mississippi river channel between 10 m and 35 m are main places where high pore water pressure is delivered from the river to the groundwater system 2 groundwater discharge to and recharge from mississippi river and the surrounding bays depend on local hydraulic gradients at the interfaces due to more frequent changes in inundation patterns and hydraulic gradients the groundwater system exchanges more frequently with bays than with the mississippi river the estimated groundwater fluxes across the river and tide boundaries are in the magnitude of 105 106 m3 day which is three to four orders of magnitude less than the mississippi river discharge rate although the groundwater fluxes are relatively insignificant groundwater may play a significant role in exchanging and mixing with surface water and forming hotspots for biogeochemical processes 3 dramatic groundwater head variation in the mrd can occur in sandy sediments and is closely associated with hydrologic events groundwater head is low and its distribution is relatively uniform across the mrd given a long pre flood period a long flood season can elevate pore water pressure around the river but does not impact much groundwater head underneath the surrounding bays severe tropical storms and hurricanes can significantly elevate groundwater head in the mrd especially in the areas experiencing the highest storm surges hurricanes are the most damaging players which can elevate pore water pressure 4 times or more higher than the normal condition within a few days groundwater recharge rate is at its peak during peak river and tide stages but quickly drops and reverses to peak groundwater discharge rate a few days later after hurricanes pass 4 groundwater surface water interactions triggered by severe hydrological events such as floods and storms can significantly elevate groundwater heads and result in low factors of safety a harmful condition can be created a few days later after a hurricane passes this study discovers a sharp groundwater recharge to discharge reversion occurs right after hurricanes vertical hydraulic gradient can be reversed quickly once the receding surface water removes the overburdens the delayed groundwater response to receding surface waters can create a high upward hydraulic gradient to shallow sediments and larger areas with low factor of safety 5 this study suggests that high pore water pressure and low factor of safety during floods storms and hurricanes may compromise coastal infrastructures high pore water pressure can reduce effective stress in sediments weaken soil strength destabilize sediments and enhance sediment erosion in coastal zones this mechanism may be intensified in a scenario when prolonged flooding overlapped with storms or hurricanes further study is needed to evaluate this concern credit authorship contribution statement an li conceptualization

5739,groundwater is a major component of the water cycle in the river deltaic environment however the dynamics of groundwater flows in the river delta remains an open question owing to the complexities in the hydrologic and geological settings this study employed a hydrogeological modeling approach to investigate groundwater dynamics in the mississippi river delta mrd a detailed groundwater model for the top 50 m of the mrd was constructed from the head of passes rk 0 to jesuits bend rk 108 using geotechnical borings and topobathymetric maps mississippi river stage and tide stage data were the key hydrologic data which reflect hydrologic forcing floods storms and hurricanes to the groundwater system by investigating the 2012 hydrologic year the study presents several intriguing findings groundwater discharge and recharge rates to the river and surrounding bays were estimated 3 or 4 orders of magnitude smaller than mississippi river discharge rate to the gulf of mexico nevertheless the model showed strong surface groundwater interactions controlled by local hydraulic gradient at the river and bay interfaces during severe hydrologic events specifically during hurricane isaac pore water pressure was estimated 4 6 times higher than the normal condition and peak groundwater recharge was reached due to storm surges peak groundwater discharge sharply occurred a few days later after the hurricane passed the study found such a dramatic change in surface groundwater interactions was due to quick surface water receding and delayed groundwater response as a consequence more areas are likely exposed to harmful high pore water pressure and low factor of safety condition which would destabilize sediments enhance erosion and compromise safety of coastal infrastructures such as the ring levees keywords mississippi river delta groundwater surface water modeling surface groundwater interactions 1 introduction a river delta is a landform created by deposition of riverine sediments as a river enters another body of water such as ocean and lake reading 1978 in the coastal area a river delta is normally entrenched by the river and surrounded by interdistributary bays and tends to be aerially extensive and low relief groundwater is a major component in the river deltaic environment fig 1 is a conceptual diagram depicting hydrogeological architecture and surface groundwater interactions a river deltaic groundwater system is composed of confining layers and aquifers groundwater can interact with surface water through rivers interdistributary bays canals and drains groundwater can also interact with atmospheric waters through precipitation and evapotranspiration groundwater plays an important role in biogeochemical processes via influencing water quality nutrient flux chen et al 2007 debnath and mukherjee 2016 liu and mou 2016 and vegetation structure fan et al 2011 however dynamics of groundwater flows in the river deltaic environment remains an open question due to complexities in river deltaic stratigraphy and hydrology river deltaic stratigraphy is formed under fluvial deltaic and coastal processes and river deltaic hydrology involves frequent disturbance from floods storms and hurricanes nevertheless groundwater flow is often overlooked in the river deltaic environment because of rich low permeability silty and clayey sediments where groundwater flow is less important as a matter of fact the river deltaic system also contains a large volume of sandy sediments placed at depth as bar finger sands or buried near surface as crevasse splay deposits fisk 1961 welder 1955 these sandy deposits are favorable places for surface groundwater interactions in the river deltaic environment coleman et al 2016 kolker et al 2013 sawyer et al 2015 in this study we investigate the dynamics of groundwater flows in the mississippi river delta mrd the mrd is the river delta formed at the confluence of the mississippi river with the gulf of mexico fig 2 the modern mississippi river delta plain formed in the past 7500 years consists of multiple subdeltas maringouin teche st bernard lafourche plaquemines balize and atchafalaya wax lake coleman 1988 development of a subdelta generally follows the delta cycle which consists of a river dominated regressive phase and a marine dominated transgressive phase roberts 1997 from top to bottom the stratigraphy of a river delta normally features a silty clayey delta plain sandy distributary mouth bars silty delta front deposits and clayey prodelta deposits frazier and osanik 1969 the mrd is one of the largest delta systems in the world milliman and meade 1983 the delta system is socioeconomically imperative to louisiana and the united states however the delta system has been degrading and suffering from a high rate of land loss which threatens coastal communities industries wildlife and infrastructures allison et al 2016 day and giosan 2008 törnqvist and meffert 2008 fifty billion u s dollars of coastal protection and restoration projects have been planned to cope with the land loss problem and to promote sustainability for the mrd and adjacent regions cpra 2012 2017 many studies were conducted on the mrd aiming at understanding the river deltaic system bentley et al 2016 chamberlain et al 2018 and providing insights for coastal restoration allison et al 2012 day et al 2007 meselhe et al 2016 xu et al 2019 many previous groundwater related studies in the mrd were conducted in the context of submarine groundwater discharge sgd which refers to seaward flow or discharge of water from aquifers to oceans burnett et al 2006 researchers used geochemical tracers to assess groundwater fluxes in the near shore marine environment cable et al 1996 kim 2016 krest et al 1999 mccoy et al 2007 moore and krest 2004 and to identify flow pathways for the sgd kolker et al 2013 flow rates from 0 1 to 2 5 cm day were reported in the coastal area along the mrd kim 2016 the tracer method can be used to detect groundwater discharge at measurement locations and estimate discharge rates however it is still challenging to use this method to evaluate the dynamics of groundwater flows in a coastal groundwater system that involves multiple aquifers and that shows significant spatial and temporal variabilities burnett et al 2006 moreover the sgd only accounts for one direction of groundwater flow landward flow or recharge of water from oceans to aquifers have seldom been discussed in the mrd this study attempts to fill in the knowledge gap in how the hydrologic and hydrogeological settings influence groundwater flows in the mrd major research questions in this study include 1 where groundwater and surface water river and bay waters interact in a river deltaic system 2 how groundwater head and groundwater flow respond to seasonal flood storm and hurricane events and 3 what role groundwater may play in the coastal sustainability past studies have employed groundwater models to address some of these questions thompson et al 2007 developed a large scale conceptualized groundwater model up to depth 5 km to evaluate groundwater seawater circulation in the continental shelf of louisiana the study concluded that no substantial terrestrial origin groundwater discharge exists on the continental shelf on the contrary o connor and moffett 2015 developed a small scale groundwater model to study surface groundwater interactions in a young prograding delta island within the wax lake delta west of the mrd the study found that intensity and direction of the groundwater flow are controlled by hydraulic gradients at surface water groundwater interfaces however both groundwater models were hydrogeologically simple and did not capture the heterogeneity in the depositional environment of sandy silty and clayey sediments for a river deltaic system this study developed a more detailed groundwater model to address the aforementioned questions in this study an integrated groundwater model was constructed along mississippi river from the head of passes rk river kilometer 0 to jesuits bend rk 108 the model focuses on the topmost 50 m of the river delta many emerging datasets geotechnical borings topobathymetric maps river and tide gauges etc were used to construct the model geotechnical borings were used to construct a stratigraphy model which serve as the structure of the groundwater model topobathymetric maps were used to determine the surface of the groundwater model river and tide gauges were used to determine flood storm and hurricane events to the model boundary conditions 2 study area the study area shown in fig 2 covers a large portion of the plaquemines balize delta lobe which is formed between lafourche delta lobe to the southwest and st bernard delta lobe to the northeast the area is about 1800 km2 with maximum length of 100 km and maximum width 20 km the area is bounded by barataria bay to the northwest breton sound to the east and gulf of mexico to the south and southwest as shown in fig 3 the upper half of the area mainly consists of a trunk river channel natural levees tidal marshes and impounding lakes the lower half of the area mainly consists of the trunk river channel splay channels broken tidal marshes and open waters residential and business areas are protected by the ring levees along mississippi river due to its subtropical latitude low lying topography and proximity to the gulf of mexico southeastern louisiana has a humid subtropical climate the study area has long hot and humid summers and short and mild winters annual average temperature is about 21 c annual average precipitation is about 1600 mm the area has about 110 days of precipitation per year national climatic data center 2018 the mrd is often affected by hydrologic events such as river floods and tropical cyclones the lowlands are very vulnerable to major hurricanes and the area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms especially in summer months hurricane katrina and hurricane isaac are the two most recent major hurricanes that made landfall within 30 km of the study area hurricane katrina was a category 5 hurricane that made landfall near buras triumph louisiana in august 2005 causing more than 1800 fatalities and 125 billion dollars of property damage knabb et al 2005 hurricane isaac was a category 1 hurricane that made landfall near the southwest of the mississippi river mouth in august 2012 causing 41 fatalities and 3 billion dollars of property damage berg 2013 3 hydrologic data and hydrologic events in 2012 this study investigates groundwater dynamics associated with hydrologic forcing between november 1 2011 and october 31 2012 daily river stage data were collected from stations at alliance pointe a la hache empire venice west bay and head of passes fig 2 the river gage data are maintained by the u s army corps of engineers usace usace 2018 fig 4 a shows hydrographs for the six stations the vertical datum for all river stages is the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 this period includes three seasonal mississippi river floods before may 2012 tropical storm debby in june 2012 and hurricane isaac in august 2012 each of the three floods lasted about one and a half months crest stages were over 1 5 m at northern stations tropical storm debby was formed on june 23 2012 from a trough of low pressure and made landfall in florida s big bend region on 26 june 2012 kimberlain 2013 river stages were raised by storm surges and were above 1 m at northern stations hurricane isaac caused dramatic water level increase in all stations in mississippi river between august 21 and september 1 2012 hurricane isaac was a category 1 hurricane prior to making two landfalls in southeastern louisiana berg 2013 fig 2 shows the hurricane track the first landfall was made at the southwest pass at the mouth of the mississippi river around 0000 coordinated universal time utc 29 august the second landfall was made west to port fourchon louisiana around 0800 utc 29 august berg 2013 the hurricane slowed down while approaching the coast of louisiana the slow movement prolonged the strong wind high storm surges and heavy rainfall along the coast strong easterly wind caused large storm surges along the eastern shore of the plaquemines balize and st bernard delta lobes and the western shore of lake borgne guy et al 2013 the storm surges elevated water level in mississippi river more than 1 5 m at all stations and more than 2 m at northern stations the hydrologic events in 2012 set an ideal groundwater study based upon two distinct hydrologic episodes on the mrd one hydrologic episode is the hydrologic loading from seasonal mississippi river floods which usually end before june every year junk et al 1989 the other hydrologic episode is the hurricane season which starts june every year larson et al 2005 another possible hydrologic episode that both mississippi river floods and hurricanes occur at the same time never happened before hurricane barry in july 2019 was a close one but barry made a landfall about 210 km west of the study area when it became a category 1 hurricane national weather service 2019 tidal stage data were collected from 86 tide gages in and around the study area fig 2 eighty 80 gages were from cpra s coastwide reference monitoring system cpra 2018 four 4 gages were from noaa s tides and currents database noaa 2018a b and two 2 gages were from usgs national surface water database usgs 2018 all water level data were adjusted to the navd 88 datum using noaa s vertical datum transformation tool noaa 2018a b fig 4b shows the daily water levels from november 1 2011 to october 31 2012 for all 86 tide gages normal tidal water levels in all tide gages are generally between 0 m and 1 m navd 88 the seasonal mississippi river floods had minimum influence on tidal water levels however tidal water levels were elevated by tropical storm debby and hurricane isaac tropical storm debby raised tidal water level over 1 m at several gages strong storm surges from hurricane isaac caused a spike in all tide gages some tide gages experienced more than 3 m water levels tidal stage data were interpolated to determine boundary conditions for the model s lateral boundaries moreover tidal stage data were also interpolated to determine surficial boundary conditions that reflect open water and inundated areas in the model domain and water levels above land surface inundations increase groundwater recharge from land surface in general more than 60 of the model domain was under water during the normal condition no mississippi river high water no severe storms and no hurricanes as shown in fig 4c due to the low relief topography small fluctuations in tides can substantially alter the extent of the inundated areas there is a spike on march 21 2012 that more than 80 of the model domain was under water this was caused by a trough of low pressure that slowly moved eastwards and generated severe thunderstorms and outbreak of tornados across southeast louisiana storm prediction center 2012 tropical strom debby caused more than 85 of the model domain to be inundated hurricane isaac caused more than 90 of the model domain to be inundated 4 methods 4 1 construction of stratigraphy model geotechnical data were used to determine sediment types and build a stratigraphy model for the study area 619 borings were collected from the usace usgs and cpra the boring sites are along the river levees and on marshlands fig 2 each boring records sediment types and corresponding elevations with respect to the navd 88 sediment types were classified by the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2017 which include poorly graded sand sp silty sand sm clayey sand sc silt ml elastic silt mh low plasticity clay cl high plasticity clay ch organic clay oh and peat pt distribution of sediment types for the study area was estimated at 0 3 m 1 ft intervals from 3 m to 46 m navd 88 the model was discretized into 161 layers each layer has 44 810 cells cell size is 200 m by 200 m a multiple indicator natural neighbor interpolation minn method was used to obtain layer wise distribution of sediment types for each layer the minn method is based on the natural neighbor interpolation nn method sibson 1980 sibson 1981 tsai et al 2005 indicator values of the 9 sediment types were calculated by the minn method at a location the final sediment type for the location was determined by the highest indicator value then the 161 layers were stacked and upscaled into a three dimensional stratigraphy model by merging adjacent vertical cells that have the same sediment type li et al 2019a li et al 2019b the upscaling procedure resulted in a 25 layer stratigraphy model with a total of 1 120 250 cells we will discuss the stratigraphic modeling results in the results and discussion section a topobathymetric map was used to determine the relief of the stratigraphy model and later the groundwater model the topobathymetric map was generated by merging a digital elevation model of new orleans love et al 2010a and a digital elevation model of southern louisiana love et al 2010b both of the data sets have a resolution of 1 3 arc second approximately 10 m and vertical datum navd 88 4 2 groundwater model development the structure of a groundwater model was built based upon the stratigraphy model this study used modflow usg panday et al 2017 to simulate groundwater flow in the mrd modflow usg uses a generalized control volume finite difference cvfe approach to solve groundwater flow equations narasimhan and witherspoon 1976 the groundwater model simulated daily groundwater head and groundwater flow from november 1 2011 to october 31 2012 there were 366 daily time steps as groundwater head distribution on november 1 2011 represents the groundwater condition without severe hydrologic events for a month groundwater head in the first time step was simulated under the steady state condition groundwater head in other time steps was simulated under the transient condition the daily time step was used instead of hourly time step in the simulation to understand groundwater dynamics on events that last for days e g neap spring tides storms and hurricanes or months e g floods in a time frame of a hydrologic year there are three types of boundaries in the model as shown in fig 5 these boundaries correspond to the surface groundwater interfaces the river boundary is at the interface between mississippi river and the subsurface and was identified as river cells in the model the tide boundary is at the interface between surrounding bays including inundated areas and the subsurface and was identified as tide cells the lateral boundaries are the model outer boundaries shown in fig 5b which are influenced by tides the cross sections show that mississippi river incises 20 m to 40 m into the subsurface other non boundary cells are inner cells in the model domain a general head boundary condition was assigned to the three types of boundaries which characterizes a head dependent flux across a material at the boundary as follows q k a h h b where q is the flow rate m3 day across the boundary material k is the hydraulic conductivity per unit width of the boundary material 1 day a is the cross sectional area of the boundary material perpendicular to the flow m2 h is the hydraulic head of a boundary forcing term m and h b is the groundwater head at the boundary m k a is the hydraulic conductance m2 day to assign hydraulic head at the river boundary water levels at the 6 river gauges fig 4a were interpolated to all river cells according to river kilometers to assign hydraulic head at the tide boundary tidal stages at the 86 tide gauges fig 4b were interpolated to all tide cells special attention was paid to determining tide cells for the inundated areas because the inundated areas changed over time wet and dry condition for surficial cells was taken care by comparing tidal water level to land elevation for the lateral boundaries interpolated tidal stages at the model boundary were used to assign the boundary values surficial groundwater recharge from precipitation and groundwater loss from evapotranspiration were not directly considered in the model because the majority of the model domain is under water the river and tidal water levels have taken precipitation and evaporation into consideration as a result groundwater storage gain or loss in the mrd depends on groundwater interactions with the mississippi river and the surrounding bays and groundwater fluxes through the lateral boundaries a simplified water balance equation is δ s i river i bays i lateral o river o bays o lateral where δ s is the storage change m3 i is the inflow m3 and o is the outflow m3 the inflow and outflow terms at the boundaries are determined by the groundwater model through water budget analysis 4 3 model parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses model parameters include hydraulic conductivity k specific storage sy and specific yield ss for the 9 sediment types and k for the river tide and lateral boundaries in total there are 30 parameters need to be determined unfortunately there is no groundwater data available in the study area for model calibration instead sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate how model parameters affect groundwater recharge rates from the river tide and lateral boundaries table 1 lists the range of parameter values from the literature for sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was carried out for the thirty parameters a composite scaled sensitivity css method hill et al 1998 was used to identify the most sensitive parameters among all parameters to calculate the css the total groundwater recharge flowrate for the kth value of parameter p j k was calculated by q k t 1 t i 1 n q it k where q it k is the flowrate at boundary cell i at time t with respect to parameter p j k then the css value for the kth value of parameter p j k was calculated by cs s j k q k p j k p j k σ q where σ q is the standard deviation of the total groundwater recharge flowrate q the final css value with respect to parameter p j was calculated as cs s j 1 m k 1 m css j k 2 where m is the sample size of parameter p j k the css ranked the model parameters from the most sensitive parameter to the least sensitive parameter then uncertainty analysis was carried out by sampling the top most sensitive parameters using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method helton and davis 2003 ranking of the sensitivities will be discussed in the results and discussion section thirty 30 sets of realizations were generated using the lhs method simulations were carried out using these sets of sampled parameters model results from these simulations will be discussed later 4 4 factor of safety fs calculations factor of safety fs is a commonly used measure for the potential concern of sand boils and uplifting harr 1962 usace 1993 fema 2015 this study adopts the fs as an indicator to imply sediment stability in the river deltaic setting fs is estimated from a ratio of effective weight of the soil to net pressure head against the top stratum a factor of safety greater than 1 5 is preferred fs is also referred as the ratio of the critical upward hydraulic gradient to in situ upward hydraulic gradient usace 1993 fs i c i where i c is the critical hydraulic gradient and i is the hydraulic gradient across the top stratum the hydraulic gradient across the top stratum was derived from the groundwater model since the top stratum is not homogeneous transformed thickness in terms of clay sediments was calculated for the top stratum based on the method in usace 1992 a value of 0 8 is commonly used for the critical hydraulic gradient usace 1956 5 results and discussion 5 1 mrd stratigraphy the emerging subsurface investigation dataset made possible for this study to estimate the spatial distribution of different sediments and to evaluate connectivity between groundwater and surface water bodies in the mrd as shown in fig 6 a the surface of the mrd is dominated by estimated silty ml and mh clayey cl and ch and organic clay oh sediments which form a large surficial confining layer however a large area of estimated sandy sediments in the middle of the mrd is exposed to land surface or directly contacts bay water estimated sandy sediments are also exposed to the mississippi river channel or near the river mouth silty and clayey sediments also make up the largest portion under the mrd as shown in the cross sections fig 6b thickness of the surficial confining layer varies greatly from 0 to the entire model depth most of the sandy sediments sp sm and sc were deposited along and below the main mississippi river channel and are confined by fine grained sediments except for those exposed to the topobathymetric surface see cross section cc some sands are interlayered by silty and clayey sediments near surface sedimentological heterogeneity causes complex hydrogeological heterogeneity in the river deltaic system o connor and moffett 2015 wolski and savenije 2006 though the stratigraphy model shows a general clay sand clay layering in the mrd the near surface stratigraphy is complicated by sandy sediments deposited through splay channel in fill overbank flooding and tributary extension bomer et al 2019 esposito et al 2017 kolker et al 2013 shen et al 2015 these sandy sediments can serve as preferential conduits for groundwater flow and form hotspots for groundwater exchanging and mixing with river and bay waters 5 2 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses sensitivity analysis was conducted on the model parameters the rank is shown in fig 7 specific yield of cl and specific storage of sm ml cl sp and sc are the top 6 sensitive parameters other parameters have css less than 4 cl is abundant at or near the surface and sm ml sp and sc are abundant and connect to the river which makes the specific yield of cl and the specific storage of sm ml cl sp and sc the most sensitive model parameters uncertainty analysis was conducted by sampling from the 6 most sensitive parameters thirty 30 sets of parameters were generated using the lhs method and input to the groundwater model to evaluate uncertainty one standard deviation was used to quantify the uncertainties in flow rates and storage changes 5 3 groundwater mississippi river interactions groundwater recharge from or discharge to mississippi river depends on local hydraulic gradients along the river fig 8 shows the simulated mean flow rates through the river boundary with one standard deviation uncertainty from nov 2011 to oct 2012 higher flow rates associate with higher estimation uncertainty for non flood and non hurricane periods groundwater recharge and discharge rates were estimated generally within 0 4 million m3 day groundwater recharge rate could reach as high as 0 75 million m3 day during the three flood events nevertheless low groundwater discharge rate still occurred whenever river stage dropped below groundwater head during the floods tropical storm debby intensified groundwater recharge rates which was estimated up to 0 5 million m3 day storm surges by hurricane isaac created a sharp groundwater recharge rate which was estimated as high as 2 5 million m3 day followed by a sharp groundwater discharge rate estimated around 1 million m3 day in responding to the rapid river water drop after the hurricane passed comparing to the mean mississippi river flow rate 1 145 billion m3 day 468 000 ft3 sec at belle chasse it is not surprising to see that the groundwater recharge and discharge rates in the mrd are very small this result is in agreement with a previous study in the breton sound hyfield et al 2008 that the groundwater flow rate is significantly less than inputs from precipitation or river diversion moreover dividing the estimated groundwater flux with the river channel surface area yields specific discharge between 0 1 cm day and 1 cm day which is similar to the previous measurements e g kim 2016 however the groundwater flux estimation in this study is much less than the estimation made by some of the previous studies in the river deltaic environment for example moore and krest 2004 concluded that groundwater fluxes on the western side of the mrd equal to 7 of the average mississippi river discharge and basu et al 2001 claimed that the groundwater flux in the bay is approximately 19 of the total discharge in the ganges brahmaputra river bangladesh 5 4 groundwater bay interactions groundwater recharge from and discharge to the surrounding bays are controlled by vertical hydraulic gradients at the topobathymetric surface as shown in fig 9 the groundwater system exchanges water more frequently with bays than with the mississippi river processes such as spring and neap tides li et al 2000 cyclically fluctuate the sea level and thus alternate vertical hydraulic gradients recurrently moreover cold fronts in the region may also contribute to the sea level fluctuation cold fronts normally last for 3 to 7 days and are the common weather pattern between october and april along louisiana s coast chuang and wiseman 1983 the onshore wind during pre frontal phase of a cold front can set up sea level along the coast christopher et al 1993 and the offshore wind during the post frontal phase can flush out water in the bay and drop sea level feng and li 2010 groundwater recharge and discharge rates were estimated generally within 1 million m3 day during nov 2011 to oct 2012 the three major floods had minimum impact on the groundwater tide interactions however thunderstorms around march 21 2012 storm prediction center 2012 and tropical storm debby during june 23 26 2012 elevated sea level and intensified groundwater recharge rate estimated more than 1 million m3 day storm surges by hurricane isaac august 28 to september 1 significantly elevated sea level and induced sharply high groundwater recharge rate estimated about 5 6 million m3 day which was quickly reversed by groundwater discharge with a rate about 2 million m3 day in responding to the sharp sea level drop the inundation area fig 4c is proportional to the groundwater bay exchange rate and is the reason why groundwater bay interactions is stronger than groundwater river interactions in the mrd however the temporal change in the inundation area likely determines either groundwater recharge or groundwater discharge because groundwater head slowly responses to tides due to the low relief topography of the study site frequent changes in the tidal stage can cause frequent changes in inundation patterns and direction of groundwater flow on the tidal flats o connor and moffett 2015 the frequent changes in groundwater flow direction may lead to a tidal pumping effect liu et al 2017 and recirculation of seawater which may account for a large portion of total sgd fluxes santos et al 2009 through exchanging and mixing of groundwater and surface water biogeochemical processes can take place to alter biogeochemistry in the river deltaic system bianchi et al 2013 5 5 groundwater flux across lateral boundaries groundwater flow across the lateral boundaries is influenced by both mississippi river and the interdistributary bays fig 10 shows that groundwater outflow dominates groundwater inflow at the lateral boundaries most of the time this is because of the general seaward hydraulic gradient established by the relatively high mississippi river water with respect to the interdistributary bays however the flow rates were estimated one order of magnitude smaller than those at the groundwater river and groundwater tide interfaces the three flood events established high groundwater head around the river and pushed more groundwater out through the lateral boundaries most of the elevated groundwater discharge rates were estimated below 10 000 m3 day on the contrary storm surges from the severe thunderstorms in march tropical storm debby in june and hurricane isaac in august increased sea level and resulted in groundwater recharge from the lateral boundaries the peak recharge rate was estimated 34 000 m3 day during hurricane isaac 5 6 groundwater storage variation groundwater storage increase or decrease in the mrd strongly associates with surface water dynamics as shown in fig 11 daily groundwater storage variation was estimated within 1 million m3 except for the storm and hurricane events the peak daily storage gain was occurred during hurricane isaac estimated nearly 7 5 million m3 followed by the peak daily storage loss after 3 days cumulative storage changes with respect to the storage on 01 11 2011 show a regular pattern that groundwater storage always increases during flood storm and hurricane events followed by groundwater storage recession fig 11 the groundwater flow simulation started at a low river stage and the year 2012 was a wet year for the mrd the tropical storm debby and the hurricane isaac reversed the recessing trend of groundwater storage between june and september although floods in 2012 were smaller than 2011 the relatively higher post flood river stage along with the storm and hurricane events in 2012 caused the groundwater system to gain around 9 million m3 at the end of the simulation period 10 31 2012 5 7 groundwater head dynamics due to a lack of groundwater models previous studies rarely discuss groundwater head dynamics in the river deltaic setting this section discusses the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater head in different hydrologic conditions in the mrd 5 7 1 pre flood season condition groundwater head distribution on november 1 2011 represents the groundwater condition without severe hydrologic events for a long time say one month groundwater head is relatively uniform and low as shown in fig 12 a groundwater head was estimated between 0 1 m and 0 7 m in most of the area during pre flood season river stages and tidal stages are relatively low low hydraulic gradients indicate low groundwater flow exchanges with the river and the surrounding bays 5 7 2 groundwater response to flood peak groundwater head distribution on february 11 2012 represents the groundwater condition at the crest of a flood groundwater head was high around the mississippi river as shown in fig 12b groundwater head along the river and near the river mouth was estimated between 0 7 m and 2 2 m high groundwater head was built up in the sandy deposits between elevation 10 m and 35 m and dissipated seaward high river stage leads to high groundwater recharge the result indicates a good hydraulic connection of the groundwater system to river water in deltaic distributary channel networks sawyer et al 2015 5 7 3 groundwater response to storm groundwater head distribution on june 25 2012 represents the groundwater condition at peak river tidal stages caused by a tropical storm as shown in fig 12c groundwater head was estimated between 0 7 m and 1 m around the river and between 0 1 m and 1 3 m underneath the surrounding bays different from the flood condition elevated groundwater head occurred not only in deep sands between 10 m and 35 m but also in surficial sands for example the cross section cc moreover the seaward hydraulic gradient around the river is lower than the flood condition due to low pre storm river stage that lasted more than one and a half months 5 7 4 groundwater responses to hurricane similar to the storm a hurricane can also elevate groundwater head around the river and beneath the surrounding bays but with much higher groundwater head as shown in fig 12d on august 29 2012 groundwater head was estimated between 1 6 m and 2 8 m along the river and between 1 0 m and 2 8 m underneath the surrounding bays high river and tidal stages lead to much higher groundwater recharge due to the track and counterclockwise rotation of the hurricane storm surges significantly elevated water level in the upper right corner of the study site the upper portion of the breton sound estuary and caused significate elevation in the groundwater head fig 12d 5 8 impact on factor of safety the factor of safety was calculated using 30 realizations of model parameters at one of peak flood stages february 15 2012 as shown in fig 13 a several areas have more than 90 chance that the estimated factor of safety is lower than 1 5 the majority of the concerned areas are inside the ring levees suggesting strong uplifting force acting on landside levee toes the low factor of safety was due to high groundwater head either beneath a thin clayey blanket or in exposed sand for example at the cross section cc in fig 6b a thin clayey layer can be seen in the eastern bank of mississippi river and a blanket is missing in the western bank low factors of safety are shown in this cross section when river water is high fig 13b shows areas with a factor of safety less than 1 5 at a lower river stage two weeks after the peak flood march 1 2012 the impacted areas are similar to the peak flood condition this is because the levee confined mississippi river water produces groundwater level higher than land elevation in these areas the factor of safety was calculated using 30 realizations of model parameters at peak river and tidal stages august 30 2012 during hurricane isaac as shown in fig 14 a areas with a factor of safety lower than 1 5 are smaller than the flood condition this is due to storm surge elevates mississippi river water and bay water and creates a downward hydraulic gradient in most of the study area except areas within the ring levees fig 14b shows much larger areas of having a factor of safety lower than 1 5 three days after the hurricane passed september 2 2012 this is because the retreating surface water removed overburdens and caused reversed vertical hydraulic gradient at some areas outside the ring levees to experience uplifting forces fast reversion of hydraulic gradient along with high pore water pressure during and after hurricanes can threaten the ring levee systems as well as the coastal communities and industries in the mrd 5 9 groundwater implications 5 9 1 infrastructure safety groundwater surface water interactions in the mrd suggest a concern about infrastructure safety for example man made river diversion can cause tens of meters of scouring in the diversion channel yuill et al 2016 the scouring could alter subsurface hydrology by creating extra flow pathways for groundwater to interact with surface water especially during severe hydrologic events high pore water pressure could be delivered through the flow pathways to the foundations of infrastructures such as levees and river diversion complexes thus could reduce effective stress of sediments and destabilize the foundation of structures nelson and leclair 2006 sills et al 2008 this mechanism may be intensified in a scenario when prolonged flooding overlapped with storms or hurricanes bilskie and hagen 2018 further study is needed to evaluate this concern 5 9 2 salinization sand desalinization as a river deltaic system evolves under the influence of both river and sea balance between fresh and saline water from these two sources drives variation in salinity in the delta fan et al 2011 surface groundwater interactions in the mrd can fluctuate salinity in the groundwater system river discharge to the groundwater system during flood months can reduce salinity in the sediments however the overwash process anderson 2002 terry and falkland 2010 associated with storms and hurricanes can bring saline water into the near surface sediments as a result seawater intrusion to the groundwater system may harm vegetation and result in wetland deterioration and elevation loss day et al 2011 shapouri et al 2015 5 9 3 sediment erosion high pore water pressure is one of the major mechanisms for enhancing sediment erosion by reducing effective stress in sediments robertson et al 2007 although groundwater simulation was conducted on a regional scale instead of a local scale resolution this study suggests that high pore water pressure associated with severe hydrologic events is likely to destabilize sediments and enhance sediment erosion fine grained sediments near the surface could migrate upward through seepage flow zhang et al 2017 areas experience significant elevation in pore water pressure may become a hotspot for sediment erosion xu et al 2016 moreover groundwater discharge associated with rapid drawdown of the surge water after hurricanes may also lead to momentary liquefaction sumer 2002 6 conclusions the major findings on the dynamics of groundwater flows in the mississippi river delta mrd can be summarized as follows 1 this study reveals the complexity of the mrd hydrogeological setting in the top 50 m although the stratigraphy model shows a general clay sand clay layering in the mrd the near surface stratigraphy is complicated by sandy sediments deposited through splay channel in fill overbank flooding and tributary extension these sandy sediments can serve as preferential conduits for groundwater flow and form hotspots for exchanging and mixing of groundwater with bay water confined sands incised by the mississippi river channel between 10 m and 35 m are main places where high pore water pressure is delivered from the river to the groundwater system 2 groundwater discharge to and recharge from mississippi river and the surrounding bays depend on local hydraulic gradients at the interfaces due to more frequent changes in inundation patterns and hydraulic gradients the groundwater system exchanges more frequently with bays than with the mississippi river the estimated groundwater fluxes across the river and tide boundaries are in the magnitude of 105 106 m3 day which is three to four orders of magnitude less than the mississippi river discharge rate although the groundwater fluxes are relatively insignificant groundwater may play a significant role in exchanging and mixing with surface water and forming hotspots for biogeochemical processes 3 dramatic groundwater head variation in the mrd can occur in sandy sediments and is closely associated with hydrologic events groundwater head is low and its distribution is relatively uniform across the mrd given a long pre flood period a long flood season can elevate pore water pressure around the river but does not impact much groundwater head underneath the surrounding bays severe tropical storms and hurricanes can significantly elevate groundwater head in the mrd especially in the areas experiencing the highest storm surges hurricanes are the most damaging players which can elevate pore water pressure 4 times or more higher than the normal condition within a few days groundwater recharge rate is at its peak during peak river and tide stages but quickly drops and reverses to peak groundwater discharge rate a few days later after hurricanes pass 4 groundwater surface water interactions triggered by severe hydrological events such as floods and storms can significantly elevate groundwater heads and result in low factors of safety a harmful condition can be created a few days later after a hurricane passes this study discovers a sharp groundwater recharge to discharge reversion occurs right after hurricanes vertical hydraulic gradient can be reversed quickly once the receding surface water removes the overburdens the delayed groundwater response to receding surface waters can create a high upward hydraulic gradient to shallow sediments and larger areas with low factor of safety 5 this study suggests that high pore water pressure and low factor of safety during floods storms and hurricanes may compromise coastal infrastructures high pore water pressure can reduce effective stress in sediments weaken soil strength destabilize sediments and enhance sediment erosion in coastal zones this mechanism may be intensified in a scenario when prolonged flooding overlapped with storms or hurricanes further study is needed to evaluate this concern credit authorship contribution statement an li conceptualization
