990,across the afrotropical ecosystems human activities are increasingly modifying natural flow regimes nutrient and organic matter loading and processing in streams and rivers with implications on ecosystem structure and functioning the mara river basin has undergone extensive land use change but influences of these changes on water quality and aquatic communities are not well understood this study investigated changes in water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages across a disturbance gradient arising from rural human activities in nineteen sites grouped into three condition categories reference undisturbed n 7 moderately disturbed n 6 and disturbed n 6 temperature dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids ph and electrical conductivity were measured in situ at each sampling site and samples collected for analysis of nutrients and total suspended solids sampled macroinvertebrates were identified mainly to family level for analysis of structural and functional composition there were significant spatial variations in water quality variables across the disturbance gradient p 0 05 highest mean temperature and suspended solids were recorded at the disturbed sites and lowest at undisturbed sites ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept taxa dominated 70 in abundance undisturbed sites while diptera dominated 48 in abundance at disturbed sites additionally higher diversity and richness indices were recorded at undisturbed sites collectors were the dominant taxa at all sites with the abundance of shredders being highest at undisturbed sites this study adds further evidence showing that land use change from forestry to agriculture has a strong influence on the structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrates in afrotropical streams keywords land use macroinvertebrates functional organization biomonitoring afrotropics 1 introduction human population growth is a major precursor to land use change by increasing extraction of natural resources in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems dudgeon et al 2006 steffen et al 2015 grill et al 2019 consequently aquatic ecosystems have been altered globally by broad scale changes to rates of natural resources acquisition forestry agriculture and mining settlements urbanization and infrastructural developments dams transport infrastructure etc allan 2004 foley et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 reid et al 2019 these threats have modified the character of watersheds and degraded rivers resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning vaughn 2010 carpenter et al 2011 tickner et al 2020 furthermore degradation of rivers through non point source pollution from increasing agricultural activities crop farming and livestock grazing has been recognized as a global problem neil et al 2001 vaughn 2010 woodward et al 2012 leip et al 2015 in the afrotropics human population growth and the subsequent demand for land for settlements livestock grazing and crop farming to meet increasing food demands pose the greatest challenge to biodiversity conservation and water resources at the catchment scale land use change is characterized by expansion of croplands and human settlements including urbanization and road construction grazing for livestock and introduction of exotic species fugère et al 2016 ogutu et al 2016 ordway et al 2017 mapulanga naito 2019 iteba et al under review at the local reach scale land use and human activities are characterized by heavy trampling by people and their livestock excessive water abstraction for irrigation domestic and industrial use waste disposal solid and liquid damming and introduction of exotic species mathooko 2001 nyenje et al 2010 minaya et al 2013 mcclain 2013 m erimba et al 2014 fouchy et al 2019 england 2019 these activities at both the catchment and reach scale have been implicated in the deterioration of water and habitat quality changes in nutrient cycling organic matter processing and basal food resources for aquatic communities leading to biodiversity loss and general impairment of ecological integrity of streams and rivers masese mcclain 2012 masese et al 2014a b fugère et al 2018a mangadze et al 2019 tampo et al 2020 understanding how aquatic communities respond to multiple disturbance gradients such as land use change at both the reach and catchment scales is important for management and conservation of water resources and aquatic biodiversity in streams and rivers benthic macroinvertebrates have been recognized as the best indicators of water and habitat quality and overall integrity of streams and rivers rosenberg and resh 1993 dickens graham 2002 masese et al 2013 in aquatic food webs macroinvertebrates play a major role in linking basal resources and higher trophic levels by processing allochthonous organic matter and making it available for other aquatic consumers vannote et al 1980 the high diversity of macroinvertebrates broad adaptations to environmental conditions and dependence on diverse sources of energy among different taxa makes them sensitive to all forms and levels of human disturbances in streams and rivers thus land use changes at the catchment and reach scale with implication on environmental conditions and basal food resources can have ramifications on the structure and functional organization of macroinvertebrate communities based on this understanding both structural and functional compositions of macroinvertebrates have been used to assess the ecological condition and ecosystem level processes in streams and rivers barbour et al 1999 merritt et al 2017 in the afrotropics development of biomonitoring indices and programs for streams and rivers still lags behind other regions around the world but great strides have been made to understand how aquatic communities respond to multiple stressors in streams and rivers most studies have utilized macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of ecosystem integrity and human disturbance in streams and rivers masese et al 2013 mangadze et al 2019 as a result of this growing knowledge biotic indices continue to be developed for different countries for biomonitoring of streams and rivers dickens and graham 2002 kaaya e al 2015 aschalew moog 2015 however more data on the effects of human disturbance from rural agriculture and human settlements on water quality and aquatic communities are still needed to strengthen existing biomonitoring indices and contribute to the development of new ones for bioindication moreover most studies have mainly focused on structural indicators of change while a limited number have looked at functional indicators including the composition of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups as indicators on human disturbance in streams and rivers the mara river basin just as many other tropical river catchments is threatened by encroachment on protected forests and other fragile ecosystems for human settlement livestock grazing and agricultural activities and human settlements mati et al 2008 masese et al 2014a population growth of people and their livestock and poor land management practices on recently deforested lands lead to soil erosion and increased sediment loads into the mara river a potential change in the flow regime of the river as a result of climate variability and land use change has also been simulated melesse et al 2008 mango et al 2011 kilonzo 2014 these alterations to the existing natural conditions and disturbance regimes and the spatial arrangement of terrestrial vegetation and soils have important long term consequences for the river and associated ecosystems mati et al 2008 masese et al 2014a hence need for continuous biomonitoring in this study we investigated spatial variation in the structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrates in response to different levels of disturbance caused by land use change in the upper mara river basin kenya the hypotheses tested were that 1 water quality physico chemical variables deteriorated with increasing levels of disturbance due to the nutrient loading from the anthropogenic activities in the basin 2 there were both structural and functional responses in macroinvertebrate communities to changes in water quality and environmental conditions caused by land use change in streams and rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in mid altitude 1900 2300 m a s l streams draining the western slopes of the mau escarpment within the kenyan rift valley the trans boundary maasai mara basin mrb kenya tanzania has a surface area of 13 835 km2 and lies between latitudes 0 21 s and 1 54 s and longitudes 33 42 e and 35 54 e in its headwaters the mara river drains the extensive tropical moist broadleaf mau forest complex mfc that is a source of many other rivers draining into lakes baringo nakuru and victoria the mfc is the largest single block of montane forest in east africa but its present coverage is much fragmented and reduced because of excisions for human settlement coniferous forest plantations large scale livestock rearing and large and small scale cultivation of tea wasser lovett 1993 masese et al 2014a b the upper catchment in kenya has relatively cool temperatures throughout the year with mean annual figures ranging from 12 c to 16 c average minimum temperatures within the middle catchment are in the range of 10 c to 14 c whereas the mean maximum temperatures range from 22 c to 26 c annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 2000 mm and is bimodal dry conditions occur during january march and july september and two wet conditions during april june and october december which are periods for the long and short rains respectively some intact forest blocks are protected as part of forest reserves and national parks lamprey reid 2004 in the catchment people living in the adjoining areas are involved in semi intensive smallholder agriculture characterized by cash crops mainly tea food crops mainly maize beans and potatoes and animal husbandry livestock rearing is the second most important contributor to the economy of this catchment and consists mainly of rearing cattle goats and sheep yanda majule 2004 the biomass of livestock as a proportion of total livestock and wildlife biomass recorded within the maasai mara national reserve mmnr boundaries has increased to 23 in the 2000s from an average of 2 in the 1970s ogutu et al 2016 over the last decade livestock biomass has become more than 8 times greater than that of any resident wildlife species in the nyangores and amala regions low to medium densities of livestock 50 individuals per km2 have been reported as most of the inhabitants in these regions are also involved in smallholder mixed agriculture metobwa et al 2018 2 2 sampling design a total of 19 study sites were classified into 3 broad categories characterized by a disturbance gradient in the catchment and riparian areas and reach scale human influences based on the digital elevation model of kenya 90 m by 90 m produced using data from the shuttle radar topography mission catchments were delineated and the area of each major land use upstream of each sampling site was calculated fig 1 the first category included undisturbed sites n 7 that were least impaired and dominated by forest cover in the upstream catchment 60 the second category included moderately disturbed sites n 6 defined by 40 60 forest cover in the upstream catchment while the third category included disturbed sites n 6 that were dominated by agricultural land use tea coffee maize farming and livestock grazing with the upstream land use dominated by agriculture at 60 fig 1 2 3 field sampling 2 3 1 physico chemical variables measurements of physico chemical water quality variables were made during the dry season in the months of january march 2013 dissolved oxygen do concentration ph temperature electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and salinity were taken in situ in three replicates at each site using a ysi multi probe water quality meter 556 mps yellow springs instruments ohio usa water samples for analysis of nutrients total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp nitrites no2 nitrates no3 soluble reactive phosphorus srp and ammonium nh4 were collected in two replicates in acid washed 500 ml high density polyethylene hdpe plastic bottles and stored in a cooler in the field using ice packs before being transported to the laboratory for analysis at each site known volumes of water samples were filtered through pre combusted and pre weighed whatman gf f glass filters 0 7 µm pore size and 47mm diameter for tss determination these filters were then wrapped in aluminium envelopes and stored in a cooler box for transport to the laboratory for analysis 2 3 2 macroinvertebrate sampling macroinvertebrate sampling was conducted using a semi quantitative kick net 300 um mesh size following dickens graham 2002 sampling was done along a 100 m stretch within a representative reach that reflected the typical reach characteristics the sampling process involved disturbing the substrate by foot and the dislodged macroinvertebrates allowed to flow and washed downstream by water currents into the net 300 μm mesh size kicking was carried out on an area of approximately 1 m2 for a standard 1 minute per biotope the collected macroinvertebrates were thereafter preserved in 70 ethyl ethanol and transported to the laboratory for analysis habitats sampled included riffles pools runs and marginal vegetation the sampled habitats were then classified into three major biotopes defined by substrate type and flow velocity dickens and graham 2002 1 gsm gravel sand and mud 2 stones bedrock boulders cobbles and pebbles either under flowing or non flowing conditions 3 veg submerged and marginal vegetation 2 4 laboratory analyses in the laboratory water column nutrient analyses were determined using standard colourimetric methods apha 2005 unfiltered water samples were used for tp and tn analysis for tp the ascorbic acid method was used while tn was determined using koroleff method srp was analyzed following the ascorbic method nh4 following the hypochlorite method while no2 and no3 were analyzed following the salicylate method apha 2005 for tss analysis gf f

references dobson et al 2002 merritt and cummins 2008 masese et al 2014a merritt et al 2017 2 5 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to test for significant differences in water quality variables nutrients and stream size variables among site categories followed by tukey multiple post hoc comparisons of the means where there were significant differences principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the physico chemical variables and nutrients data community structure was described in terms of taxon richness abundance and community indices species occurrence presence absence and distribution data were summarized for each site and means calculated for each site disturbance category using the number of taxa s and the total relative abundances several reach scale diversity indices were calculated for each study site and means calculated for each site category shannon s diversity index hʹ was derived as a measure of diversity magurran 2004 and an associated h h max index pielou 1975 was used as a measure of evenness the reciprocal form of the simpson index 1 ds simpson 1949 was used as a measure of species richness we used hill s number i e gamma diversity hill 1973 and fisher s alpha fisher et al 1943 as extra measures of macroinvertebrates diversity hill s number was calculated as the ratio between hʹ and 1 d hill 1973 margalef s species richness index was calculated as an extra measure of taxon richness functional structure was also described in terms of taxon richness and abundance of the different ffgs at the different sites and site categories to determine which key macroinvertebrates indicator taxa were responsible for the differences observed among the three site categories attributed to changes in land use nutrient levels and water quality similarity percentages analysis simper was used the percentage contribution of each taxon and ffgs to the overall dissimilarity between the site categories was quantified simper is a strictly pairwise analysis between two factor levels clarke warwick 2001 and in this case comparisons were made between undisturbed and disturbed and disturbed and moderately disturbed sites canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to investigate the relationship between macroinvertebrate structural and functional composition water quality variables nutrients and stream size variables across the different disturbance gradients all analyses were performed using past software version 3 21 and figures were created in sigmaplot version 12 and ms office excel 2016 3 results 3 1 physico chemical variables there were significant differences in electrical conductivity temperature tds tss salinity tn srp no3 nh4 depth and stream discharge p 0 05

no2 and no3 were higher in disturbed sites with undisturbed sites recording the least concentration levels highest tss and nutrients levels were recorded in the disturbed sites while tds and conductivity recorded the highest concentration levels at the moderately disturbed sites table 1 there were significant differences in physico chemical and stream size variables between site categories permanova f 5 14 df 2 p 0 01 the pca summarized relationships among water quality and stream size variables in the rivers fig 2 pca pc 1 axis explained 35 5 of the total dataset variance while the second pca axis pc 2 explained 22 7 of the total variance in water physico chemistry among site categories fig 2 disturbed sites were associated with high electrical conductivity turbidity tss and temperature nutrient concentrations than both the moderately disturbed and undisturbed sites fig 2 3 2 macroinvertebrate communities 3 2 1 structural composition a total of 48 848 macroinvertebrate individuals belonging to 9 orders and 21 families were identified of these 55 9 were collected at the undisturbed sites 19 2 at moderately disturbed sites and 24 9 at disturbed sites undisturbed sites had a total of 19 orders with 16 orders being recorded in disturbed sites while moderately disturbed sites had 13 orders orders arachnida bivalvia ephemeroptera hemiptera hirudinea lepidoptera odonata trichoptera and turbellaria were identified from all the site categories orders coleoptera and gastropoda were found in both undisturbed and disturbed sites but were missing in the moderately disturbed sites order collembola was restricted to the undisturbed sites orders diptera ephemeroptera and trichoptera dominated at all site categories disturbance levels diptera dominated disturbed sites in terms of relative abundance 55 and taxon richness 22 while ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera ept dominated undisturbed sites in both relative abundance 70 and taxon richness 34 fig 3 there were mixed results in diversity indices used to measure community structure of macroinvertebrates at sites in the three condition categories with some showing wide ranges such as taxon richness dominance margalef s species richness index and fisher s alpha diversity while the rest showed narrow ranges table 2 shannon diversity index was higher 2 45 in undisturbed sites than in the disturbed sites 2 06 similar trends were obtained using the simpson index 1 ds with higher values in undisturbed sites 0 88 compared with the disturbed 0 80 and moderately disturbed sites 0 83 pielou s evenness index displayed the lowest response across the disturbance gradient with a value of 0 19 at undisturbed sites and 0 20 at both moderately disturbed and disturbed sites in contrast fisher s alpha diversity showed the widest range with the highest value 7 29 at undisturbed sites and the lowest value 5 00 at disturbed sites dominance index followed the opposite trend as fisher s alpha diversity index with the highest value 0 20 at disturbed sites and the lowest value 0 12 at undisturbed sites undisturbed sites had the highest number of taxa 60 followed by disturbed sites 51 and lastly the moderately disturbed sites which had the least number of taxa 39 pair wise simper s comparisons of macroinvertebrate taxa abundances between undisturbed and disturbed sites identified simuliidae 26 0 baetidae 17 5 chironomidae 11 2 and hydropsychidae 10 8 as the major families contributing the greatest dissimilarity between the two categories with higher abundance in undisturbed sites table 3 the same families simuliidae 22 7 baetidae 13 9 chironomidae 13 1 and hydropsychidae 13 4 also contributed the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and moderately disturbed sites with higher abundance at the moderately disturbed sites other than for baetidae that had higher abundance in undisturbed sites table 3 3 2 2 functional composition of macroinvertebrates of the 48 848 macroinvertebrates individuals collected 39 032 were collectors collector gatherers and collector filterers 1554 were predators 7116 were scrapers and 1146 were shredders collectors dominated in abundance in all the three site categories fig 4 scrapers 17 and predators 12 abundance was highest in the disturbed sites while shredder abundance was highest 14 in the undisturbed sites and least 1 in the disturbed sites predator abundance was least 2 in the moderately disturbed sites fig 4a predator taxa richness increased with increase in disturbance from undisturbed sites 35 to disturbed sites 47 on the contrary shredder and collector taxa richness decreased with increasing disturbance highest shredder 16 and collectors 33 relative richness were recorded in the undisturbed sites and were lowest at the disturbed sites with 10 and 27 respectively fig 4b 3 3 relationships between macroinvertebrates ffgs and water quality variables the cca triplot between selected variables water physico chemistry nutrients and stream size and macroinvertebrates showed distinct patterns where the variables correlated with specific macroinvertebrate assemblages under different levels of disturbance the first two components explained 66 0 of the total variation with the 1st component accounting for 34 9 and the 2nd component 31 1 fig 5 lepidostomatidae hydropsychidae crambidae tipulidae potamonautiedae leptoceridae and tricorythidae occurred mainly in undisturbed sites and were associated with low mean water temperature increase in temperature width tss and discharge was correlated with the occurrence of and higher abundances of baetidae libellulidae philopotamidae and simuliidae found mainly in moderately disturbed sites chironomidae were correlated with increased levels of conductivity at the disturbed sites fig 5 macroinvertebrates ffgs cca ordination with water quality variables nutrient concentrations and stream sizes variables also displayed distinct separations the first components explained 34 7 of the total variation in the dataset while the second component accounted for 31 3 fig 6 there was a distinct association of shredders with undisturbed sites with lower temperature levels while collectors were associated with higher temperature discharge and tss in moderately disturbed sites predators and scrapers were positively associated with increasing levels in conductivity and stream width at disturbed sites though scrapers were negatively associated with increased tss levels at the disturbed sites fig 6 simper s pair wise comparisons of condition categories based on ffgs identified collectors 74 35 and shredders 17 95 to contribute the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed sites with higher abundance in undisturbed sites again collectors 72 67 and shredders 24 19 contributed to the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and moderately disturbed sites with collectors having a higher abundance in the moderately disturbed sites while shredders had a higher abundance in the undisturbed sites even though predators contributed the least dissimilarity in both cases they recorded a high abundance in disturbed sites table 4 4 discussion this study demonstrates that both structural and functional organization of macroinvertebrates display spatial variability in taxon richness diversity and relative abundance of the various taxa in response to changes in water quality and nutrient concntrations across a disturbance gradient defined by both catchment and reach scale influences there was an increase in conductivity ec water temperature tss tds and nutrients concentrations especially dissolved fractions of nitrogen from values in undisturbed forested sites to high levels in disturbed agricultural sites there were also differences in the structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrates across the disturbance gradient with highest numbers of taxa recorded in the undisturbed sites higher shredder abundance was recorded in undisturbed sites while predators increased in both richness and abundance with increasing disturbance taxon richness and abundance of scrapers were higher at the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites where water temperature and nutrient concentrations were higher 4 1 physico chemical water quality variables and nutrients the higher levels of electrical conductivity temperature total suspended solids total dissolved solids and nutrients recorded in moderately disturbed and disturbed sites can be attributed to opening of the canopy diffuse pollution from agricultural farms and sedimentation caused by agricultural activities such as in cases where these sites serve as livestock watering points and the associated bank erosion the low temperature at the undisturbed sites can be attributed to shading from the forest cover these results are similar to studies by kibichii et al 2007 and kasangaki et al 2008 which attributed the high values of conductivity tss tds and temperature to near and in stream activities such as farming along the riparian zone livestock grazing and watering in the river and erosion other studies have also indicated that removal of riparian vegetation can lead to modification of stream hydraulics substrate features light and thermal system water chemistry composition and organic matter standing stocks kaufmann et al 2009 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 masese et al 2014a b the low dissolved oxygen levels in the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites can be attributed to livestock defecation and urination into these streams siltation and decomposition of organic matter which have been found to provoke responses in the water chemistry such as the reduction of dissolved oxygen levels raburu et al 2009 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 masese et al 2020a similarly the high tss and tds values draining disturbed sites most probably resulted from erosion of unprotected banks and siltation while the high nutrient levels tp and tn can be attributed to farm inputs fertilizer and manure as well as cattle defecation and urination into streams draining these areas masese et al 2017 4 2 structural composition of macroinvertebrates the study recorded a very high number of individuals with a total of 48 848 macroinvertebrate individuals belonging to 21 orders and 70 families the higher abundance diversity and richness in undisturbed sites could be explained by the fact that limited human disturbance these sites favoured a wider range of habitats that could support a diverse macroinvertebrate community these results concur with similar studies in the region that have indicated higher taxa diversity in forested land use than in the streams draining other land uses such as agriculture urban and settlements kasangaki et al 2006 kasangaki et al 2008 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 m erimba et al 2014 ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept richness and abundance were higher in undisturbed sites than in moderately disturbed and disturbed sites undisturbed sites also had the most diverse taxa richness and evenness the higher numbers of sensitive ept taxa and high macroinvertebrates diversity and richness in these sites could be attributed to habitat diversity and complexity in these sites coupled with good water quality conditions several studies have indicated a decrease in the number of taxa and the relative abundance of sensitive orders sich as the ept while tolerant orders such oligochaeta and diptera increasing as the pollution and negative changes in the river quality increases raburu et al 2009 kilonzo et al 2014 masese et al 2009 2014a however it is notable that some families among the ept such as baetidae caenidae and hydropsychidae can increase their abundance in organically polluted sites masese and raburu 2017 and this can compromise the performance of this index as a measure of disturbance species richness differed among the site categories ranging from 60 taxa in the undisturbed sites to 51 and 39 in the disturbed and moderately disturbed sites respectively the small streams in the forested sites had pristine conditions thereby habiting a diverse number of taxa the diversity indices used were largely in agreement regarding differences in macroinvertebrates diversity and richness among site categories as depicted by abundance data table 2 the low values of the shannon diversity index 2 1 in the disturbed and moderately disturbed sites indicate widespread degradation affecting macroinvertebrate communities in these sites disturbed streams seemed to be more affected by having depauperate communities with high dominance of a few taxa mainly diptera and hemiptera diptera and hemiptera showed an increased abundance and distribution in these sites an indication that these taxa are not highly affected by on going human mediated environmental and ecological changes masese mcclain 2012 raburu masese 2012 hill s number gamma diversity was not able to capture variability in taxa diversity among site categories on the contrary fisher s alpha diversity showed clear differences among categories suggesting that it is less sensitive to numerical dominance of invertebrate communities by a few dominating taxa hence better suited at assessing anthropogenic influences on the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the region although natural conditions influence taxon richness and abundance anthropogenic activities in the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites likely aggravated the effects observed in this study anthropogenic disturbances such as land use activities relating to agriculture farming and livestock husbandry deforestation unpaved road construction and settlements have been found to influence the quantity of runoff and sediments that enter recipient water bodies during the rains wang lyons 2003 donohue irvine 2004 masese et al 2017 and therefore negatively affecting the water quality in these systems which in turn influence the composition of the resident biota 4 3 functional composition of macroinvertebrates the presence of thick riparian canopy in the undisturbed sites created conditions with plenty of feeding material that supported the high abundance and richness of the shredder functional guild which utilizes leaf litter from these riparian zones as an energy source contrastingly this feeding guild recorded the lowest abundance and richness in the disturbed sites which is a function of stripped canopy cover along riparian zones and therein the lack of litterfall and increased temperature it has also been noted that shredders are intimately linked and dependent on to the nature of riparian vegetation because of their reliance on allochthonous food resources and as well contribute nutrient cycling and energy transfer to other trophic groups dobson et al 2002 boyero et al 2011 brasil et al 2014 masese et al 2014a scarpers abundance and richness were higher in the disturbance sites which can be attributed to the increased temperatures due to open canopy and nutrients from agricultural farms and livestock input which supported primary productivity algal production which served as an energy source for scrapers this is in line with an earlier study by barbee 2005 which pointed out that the densities of scrapers are determined by the presence or absence of algal biomass and production collectors had the highest number of individuals across the three site categories the high numbers across the sites can be attributed to the wide array of food resources consumed by this group studies have documented the dependence of collectors on the capacity of shredders to break down cpom to fpom which serves as an energy source for collectors and therefore their abundance is dependent on the availability of shredders in the system a dominance of collectors throughouta river network has been reported inother studies of tropical streams such as those of tomanova et al 2006 and jiang et al 2011 predators abundance and richness increased with increase in disturbance from undisturbed sites to disturbed sites predators such as odonata and hemipterans are more tolerant of pollution boyero et al 2009 favretto et al 2014 and therefore can withstand degraded habitat and water quality conditions the dominance of these taxa in the disturbed sites was made possible by the presence of other tolerant prey taxa such as oligochaeta barbee 2005 an argument that is in line with river continuum concept rcc which proposed that the abundance of predators depend on prey availability and abundance vannote et al 1980 4 4 relationships between macroinvertebrates assemblages and water quality variables the distribution of macroinvertebrate structural and functional assemblages was influenced by physico chemical water quality and nutrients across the site categories canonical correspondence analysis cca indicated that specific site categories correlated with specific water quality variables which in turn affected the distribution of the macroinvertebrates an increase in temperature and do affected lepidostomatidae leptoceridae crambidae baetidae and philopotamidae families which are sensitive to pollution mainly at the undisturbed sites shredders lepidostomatidae leptoceridae and crambidae found in the undisturbed sites forested area were favoured by the low temperatures high do levels and dense canopy studies by dobson et al 2002 minaya et al 2013 and masese et al 2014a reported similar trends increase in tp tn and conductivity levels positively influenced predators at the disturbed sites concurring with other studies such as by bojsen jacobsen 2003 which reported collectors and predators to be more tolerant to pollution hence dominating degraded sites in the moderately disturbed sites tss was established as the main variable affecting the scrapers this is attributed to greater depths and increased turbidity s in these sites which prevent light penetration into the water column thus hindering primary production algae which is the main energy source for scrapers increase in nutrient levels and reduction in water quality negatively impacted the distribution of sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa the deteriorating water quality with an increase in disturbance levels as noted by the increasing levels of tss temperature electrical conductivity and tds from undisturbed to disturbed through moderately disturbed sites also have contributed to the low richness and diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa in the disturbed sites replacement of native vegetation by pasture and intensive agriculture is associated with degradation of water quality and degradation of physical habitat bryce et al 2010 masese et al 2014 these results are consistent with numerous other studies that have also found abiotic factors to significantly explain variation in macroinvertebrate communities coucerio et al 2007 kasangaki et al 2006 2008 masese et al 2009 2014a 5 conclusions the patterns in the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages obtained in this study showed how changes in water quality streams and rivers influence the structural and functional compostion of macroinvertebrates specifically this study shows that even in areas under small scale agriculture and rural settlements macroinvertebrates can track even subtle changes in water quality changes in the composition and distribution of macroinvertebrates maily resulted from small scale agriculture livestock grazing and access to streams and rivers for watering these activities led to deterotation in both habitat and water quality in the streams this study contributes to further development of biomonitoring indices in the region by identifying taxa that are responsive to human activities in unurbanized catchments in the afrotropics future efforts for water quality and biodiversity conservation in streams and rivers should therefore prioritize minimizing human impact arising from these activities declaration of competing interest none declared ethics approval the

990,across the afrotropical ecosystems human activities are increasingly modifying natural flow regimes nutrient and organic matter loading and processing in streams and rivers with implications on ecosystem structure and functioning the mara river basin has undergone extensive land use change but influences of these changes on water quality and aquatic communities are not well understood this

streams keywords land use macroinvertebrates functional organization biomonitoring afrotropics 1 introduction human population growth is a major precursor to land use change by increasing extraction of natural resources in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems dudgeon et al 2006 steffen et al 2015 grill et al 2019 consequently aquatic ecosystems have been altered globally by broad scale changes to rates of natural resources acquisition forestry agriculture and mining settlements urbanization and infrastructural developments dams transport infrastructure etc allan 2004 foley et al 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 reid et al 2019 these threats have modified the character of watersheds and degraded rivers resulting in loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning vaughn 2010 carpenter et al 2011 tickner et al 2020 furthermore degradation of rivers through non point source pollution from increasing agricultural activities crop farming and livestock grazing has been recognized as a global problem neil et al 2001 vaughn 2010 woodward et al 2012 leip et al 2015 in the afrotropics human population growth and the subsequent demand for land for settlements livestock grazing and crop farming to meet increasing food demands pose the greatest challenge to biodiversity conservation and water resources at the catchment scale land use change is characterized by expansion of croplands and human settlements including urbanization and road construction grazing for livestock and introduction of exotic species fugère et al 2016 ogutu et al 2016 ordway et al 2017 mapulanga naito 2019 iteba et al under review at the local reach scale land use and human activities are characterized by heavy trampling by people and their livestock excessive water abstraction for irrigation domestic

england 2019 these activities at both the catchment and reach scale have been implicated in the deterioration of water and habitat quality changes in nutrient cycling organic matter processing and basal food resources for aquatic communities leading to biodiversity loss and general impairment of ecological integrity of streams and rivers masese mcclain 2012 masese et al 2014a b fugère et al 2018a mangadze et al 2019 tampo et al 2020 understanding how aquatic communities respond to multiple disturbance gradients such as land use change at both the reach and catchment scales is important for management and conservation of water resources and aquatic biodiversity in streams and rivers benthic macroinvertebrates have been recognized as the best indicators of water and habitat quality and overall integrity of streams and rivers rosenberg and resh 1993 dickens graham 2002 masese et al 2013 in aquatic food webs macroinvertebrates play a major role in linking basal resources and higher trophic levels by processing allochthonous organic matter and making it available for other aquatic consumers vannote et al 1980 the high diversity of macroinvertebrates broad adaptations to environmental conditions and dependence on diverse sources of energy among different taxa makes them sensitive to all forms and levels of human disturbances in streams and rivers thus land use changes at the catchment and reach scale with implication on environmental conditions and basal food resources can have ramifications on the structure and functional organization of macroinvertebrate communities based on this understanding both structural and functional compositions of macroinvertebrates have been used to assess the ecological condition and ecosystem level processes in streams and rivers barbour et al 1999 merritt et al 2017 in the afrotropics development of biomonitoring indices and programs for streams and rivers still lags behind other regions around the world but great strides have been made to understand how aquatic communities respond to multiple stressors in streams and rivers most studies have utilized macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of ecosystem integrity and human disturbance in streams and rivers masese et al 2013 mangadze et al 2019 as a result of this growing knowledge biotic indices continue to be developed for different countries for biomonitoring of streams and rivers dickens and graham 2002 kaaya e al 2015 aschalew moog 2015 however more data on the effects of human disturbance from rural agriculture and human settlements on water quality and aquatic communities are still needed to strengthen existing biomonitoring indices and contribute to the development of new ones for bioindication moreover most studies have mainly focused on structural indicators of change while a limited number have looked at functional indicators including the composition of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups as indicators on human disturbance in streams and rivers the mara river basin just as many other tropical river catchments is threatened by encroachment on protected forests and other fragile ecosystems for human settlement livestock grazing and agricultural activities and human settlements mati et al 2008 masese et al 2014a population growth of people and their livestock and poor land management practices on recently deforested lands lead to soil erosion and increased sediment loads into the mara river a potential change in the flow regime of the river as a result of climate variability and land use change has also been simulated melesse et al 2008 mango et al 2011 kilonzo 2014 these alterations to the existing natural conditions and disturbance regimes and the spatial arrangement of terrestrial vegetation and soils have important long term consequences for the river and associated ecosystems mati et al 2008 masese et al 2014a hence need for continuous biomonitoring in this study we investigated spatial variation in the structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrates in response to different levels of disturbance caused by land use change in the upper mara river basin kenya the hypotheses tested were that 1 water quality physico chemical variables deteriorated with increasing levels of disturbance due to the nutrient loading from the anthropogenic activities in the basin 2 there were both structural and functional responses in macroinvertebrate communities to changes in water quality and environmental conditions caused by land use change in streams and rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in mid altitude 1900 2300 m a s l streams draining the western slopes of the mau escarpment within the kenyan rift valley the trans boundary maasai mara basin mrb kenya tanzania has a surface area of 13 835 km2 and lies between latitudes 0 21 s and 1 54 s and longitudes 33 42 e and 35 54 e in its headwaters the mara river drains the extensive tropical moist broadleaf mau forest complex mfc that is a source of many other rivers draining into lakes baringo nakuru and victoria the mfc is the largest single block of montane forest in east africa but its present coverage is much fragmented and reduced because of excisions for human settlement coniferous forest plantations large scale livestock rearing and large and small scale cultivation of tea wasser lovett 1993 masese et al 2014a b the upper catchment in kenya has relatively cool temperatures throughout the year with mean annual figures ranging from 12 c to 16 c average minimum

consists mainly of rearing cattle goats and sheep yanda majule 2004 the biomass of livestock as a proportion of total livestock and wildlife biomass recorded within the maasai mara national reserve mmnr boundaries has increased to 23 in the 2000s from an average of 2 in the 1970s ogutu et al 2016 over the last decade livestock biomass has become more than 8 times greater than that of any resident wildlife species in the nyangores and amala regions low to medium densities of livestock 50 individuals per km2 have been reported as most of the inhabitants in these regions are also involved in smallholder mixed agriculture metobwa et al 2018 2 2 sampling design a total of 19 study sites were classified into 3 broad categories characterized by a disturbance gradient in the catchment and riparian areas and reach scale human influences based on the digital elevation model of kenya 90 m by 90 m produced using data from the shuttle radar topography mission catchments were delineated and the area of each major land use upstream of each sampling site was calculated fig 1 the first category included undisturbed sites n 7 that were least impaired and dominated by forest cover in the upstream catchment 60 the second category included moderately disturbed sites n 6 defined by 40 60 forest cover in the upstream catchment while the third category included disturbed sites

references dobson et al 2002 merritt and cummins 2008 masese et al 2014a merritt et al 2017 2 5 data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to test for significant differences in water quality variables nutrients and stream size variables among site categories followed by tukey multiple post hoc comparisons of the means where there were significant differences principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the physico chemical variables and nutrients data community structure was described in terms of taxon richness abundance and community indices species occurrence presence absence and distribution data were summarized for each site and means calculated for each site disturbance category using the number of taxa s and the total relative abundances several reach scale diversity indices were calculated for each study site and means calculated for each site category shannon s diversity index hʹ was derived as a measure of diversity magurran 2004 and an associated h h max index pielou 1975 was used as a measure of evenness the reciprocal form of the simpson index 1 ds simpson 1949 was used as a measure of species richness we used hill s number i e gamma diversity hill 1973 and fisher s alpha fisher et al 1943 as extra measures of macroinvertebrates diversity hill s number was calculated as the ratio between hʹ and 1 d hill 1973 margalef s species richness index was calculated as an extra measure of taxon richness functional structure was also described in terms of taxon richness and abundance of the different ffgs at the different sites and site categories to determine which key macroinvertebrates indicator taxa were responsible for the differences observed among the three site categories attributed to changes in land use nutrient levels and water quality similarity percentages analysis simper was used the percentage contribution of each taxon and ffgs to the overall dissimilarity between the site categories was quantified simper is a strictly pairwise analysis between two factor levels clarke warwick 2001 and in this case comparisons were made between undisturbed and disturbed and disturbed and moderately disturbed sites canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to investigate the relationship between macroinvertebrate structural and functional composition water quality variables nutrients and stream size variables across the different disturbance gradients all analyses were performed using past software version 3 21 and figures were created in sigmaplot version 12 and ms

categories permanova f 5 14 df 2 p 0 01 the pca summarized relationships among water quality and stream size variables in the rivers fig 2 pca pc 1 axis explained 35 5 of the total dataset variance while the second pca axis pc 2 explained 22 7 of the total variance in water physico chemistry among site categories fig 2 disturbed sites were associated with high electrical conductivity turbidity tss and temperature nutrient concentrations than both the moderately disturbed and undisturbed sites fig 2 3 2 macroinvertebrate communities 3 2 1 structural composition a total of 48 848 macroinvertebrate individuals belonging to 9 orders and 21 families were identified of these 55 9 were collected at the undisturbed sites 19 2 at moderately disturbed sites and 24 9 at disturbed sites undisturbed sites had a total of 19 orders with 16 orders being recorded in disturbed sites while moderately disturbed sites had 13 orders orders arachnida bivalvia ephemeroptera hemiptera hirudinea lepidoptera odonata trichoptera and turbellaria were identified from all the site categories orders coleoptera and gastropoda were found in both undisturbed and disturbed sites but were missing in the moderately disturbed sites order collembola was restricted to the undisturbed sites orders diptera ephemeroptera and trichoptera dominated at all site categories disturbance levels diptera dominated disturbed sites in terms of relative abundance 55 and taxon richness 22 while ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera ept dominated undisturbed sites in both relative abundance 70 and taxon richness 34 fig 3 there were mixed results in diversity indices used to measure community structure of macroinvertebrates at sites in the three condition categories with some showing wide ranges such as taxon richness dominance margalef s species richness index and fisher s alpha diversity while the rest showed narrow ranges table 2 shannon diversity index was higher 2 45 in undisturbed sites than in the disturbed sites 2 06 similar trends were obtained using the simpson index 1 ds with higher values in undisturbed sites 0 88 compared with the disturbed 0 80 and moderately disturbed sites 0 83 pielou s evenness index displayed the lowest response across the disturbance gradient with a value of 0 19 at undisturbed sites and 0 20 at both moderately disturbed and disturbed sites in contrast fisher s alpha diversity showed the widest range with the highest value 7 29 at undisturbed sites and the lowest value 5 00 at disturbed sites dominance index followed the opposite trend as fisher s alpha diversity index with the highest value 0 20 at disturbed sites and the lowest value 0 12 at undisturbed sites undisturbed sites had the highest number of taxa 60 followed by disturbed sites 51 and lastly the moderately disturbed sites which had the least number of taxa 39 pair wise simper s comparisons of macroinvertebrate taxa abundances between undisturbed and disturbed sites identified simuliidae 26 0 baetidae 17 5 chironomidae 11 2 and hydropsychidae 10 8 as the major families contributing the greatest dissimilarity between the two categories with higher abundance in undisturbed sites table 3 the same families simuliidae 22 7 baetidae 13 9 chironomidae 13 1 and hydropsychidae 13 4 also contributed the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and moderately disturbed sites with higher abundance at the moderately disturbed sites other than for baetidae that had higher abundance in undisturbed sites table 3 3 2 2 functional composition of macroinvertebrates of the 48 848 macroinvertebrates individuals collected 39 032 were collectors collector gatherers and collector filterers 1554 were predators 7116 were scrapers and 1146 were shredders collectors dominated in abundance in all the three site categories fig 4 scrapers 17 and predators 12 abundance was highest in the disturbed sites while shredder abundance was highest 14 in the undisturbed sites and least 1 in the disturbed sites predator abundance was least 2 in the moderately disturbed sites fig 4a predator taxa richness increased with increase in disturbance from undisturbed sites 35 to disturbed sites 47 on the contrary shredder and collector taxa richness decreased with increasing disturbance highest shredder 16 and collectors 33 relative richness were recorded in the undisturbed sites and were lowest at the disturbed sites with 10 and 27 respectively fig 4b 3 3 relationships between macroinvertebrates ffgs and water quality variables the cca triplot between selected variables water physico chemistry nutrients and stream size and macroinvertebrates showed distinct patterns where the variables correlated with specific macroinvertebrate assemblages under different levels of disturbance the first two components explained 66 0 of the total variation with the 1st component accounting for 34 9 and the 2nd component 31 1 fig 5 lepidostomatidae hydropsychidae crambidae tipulidae potamonautiedae leptoceridae and tricorythidae occurred mainly in undisturbed sites and were associated with low mean water temperature increase in temperature width tss and discharge was correlated with the occurrence of and higher abundances of baetidae libellulidae philopotamidae and simuliidae found mainly in moderately disturbed sites chironomidae were correlated with increased levels of conductivity at the disturbed sites fig 5 macroinvertebrates ffgs cca ordination with water quality variables nutrient concentrations and stream sizes variables also displayed distinct separations the first components explained 34 7 of the total variation in the dataset while the second component accounted for 31 3 fig 6 there was a distinct association of shredders with undisturbed sites with lower temperature levels while collectors were associated with higher temperature discharge and tss in moderately disturbed sites predators and scrapers were positively associated with increasing levels in conductivity and stream width at disturbed sites though scrapers were negatively associated with increased tss levels at the disturbed sites fig 6 simper s pair wise comparisons of condition categories based on ffgs identified collectors 74 35 and shredders 17 95 to contribute the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and disturbed sites with higher abundance in undisturbed sites again collectors 72 67 and shredders 24 19 contributed to the greatest dissimilarity between undisturbed and moderately disturbed sites with collectors having a higher abundance in the moderately disturbed sites while shredders had a higher abundance in the undisturbed sites even though predators contributed the least dissimilarity in both cases they recorded a high abundance in disturbed sites table 4 4 discussion this study demonstrates that both structural and functional organization of macroinvertebrates display spatial variability in taxon richness diversity and relative abundance of the various taxa in response to changes in water quality and nutrient concntrations across a disturbance gradient defined by both catchment and reach scale influences there was an increase in conductivity ec water temperature tss tds and nutrients concentrations especially dissolved fractions of nitrogen from values in undisturbed forested sites to high levels in disturbed agricultural sites there were also differences in the structural and functional composition of macroinvertebrates across the disturbance gradient with highest numbers of taxa recorded in the undisturbed sites higher shredder abundance was recorded in undisturbed sites while predators increased in both richness and abundance with increasing disturbance taxon richness and abundance of scrapers were higher at the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites where water temperature and nutrient concentrations were higher 4 1 physico chemical water quality variables and nutrients the higher levels of electrical conductivity temperature total suspended solids total dissolved solids and nutrients recorded in moderately disturbed and disturbed sites can be attributed to opening of the canopy diffuse pollution from agricultural farms and sedimentation caused by agricultural activities such as in cases where these sites serve as livestock watering points and the associated bank erosion the low temperature at the undisturbed sites can be attributed to shading from the forest cover these results are similar to studies by kibichii et al 2007 and kasangaki et al 2008 which attributed the high values of conductivity tss tds and temperature to near and in stream activities such as farming along the riparian zone livestock grazing and watering in the river and erosion other studies have also indicated that removal of riparian vegetation can lead to modification of stream hydraulics substrate features light and thermal system water chemistry composition and organic matter standing stocks kaufmann et al 2009 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 masese et al 2014a b the low dissolved oxygen levels in the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites can be attributed to livestock defecation and urination into these streams siltation and decomposition of organic matter which have been found to provoke responses in the water chemistry such as the reduction of dissolved oxygen levels raburu et al 2009 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 masese et al 2020a similarly the high tss and tds values draining disturbed sites most probably resulted from erosion of unprotected banks and siltation while the high nutrient levels tp and tn can be attributed to farm inputs fertilizer and manure as well as cattle defecation and urination into streams draining these areas masese et al 2017 4 2 structural composition of macroinvertebrates the study recorded a very high number of individuals with a total of 48 848 macroinvertebrate individuals belonging to 21 orders and 70 families the higher abundance diversity and richness in undisturbed sites could be explained by the fact that limited human disturbance these sites favoured a wider range of habitats that could support a diverse macroinvertebrate community these results concur with similar studies in the region that have indicated higher taxa diversity in forested land use than in the streams draining other land uses such as agriculture urban and settlements kasangaki et al 2006 kasangaki et al 2008 masese et al 2009 minaya et al 2013 m erimba et al 2014 ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept richness and abundance were higher in undisturbed sites than in moderately disturbed and disturbed sites undisturbed sites also had the most diverse taxa richness and evenness the higher numbers of sensitive ept taxa and high macroinvertebrates diversity and richness in these sites could be attributed to habitat diversity and complexity in these sites coupled with good water quality conditions several studies have indicated a decrease in the number of taxa and the relative abundance of sensitive orders sich as the ept while tolerant orders such oligochaeta and diptera increasing as the pollution and negative changes in the river quality increases raburu et al 2009 kilonzo et al 2014 masese et al 2009 2014a however it is notable that some families among the ept such as baetidae caenidae and hydropsychidae can increase their abundance in organically polluted sites masese and raburu 2017 and this can compromise the performance of this index as a measure of disturbance species richness differed among the site categories ranging from 60 taxa in the undisturbed sites to 51 and 39 in the disturbed and moderately disturbed sites respectively the small streams in the forested sites had pristine conditions thereby habiting a diverse number of taxa the diversity indices used were largely in agreement regarding differences in macroinvertebrates diversity and richness among site categories as depicted by abundance data table 2 the low values of the shannon diversity index 2 1 in the disturbed and moderately disturbed sites indicate widespread degradation affecting macroinvertebrate communities in these sites disturbed streams seemed to be more affected by having depauperate communities with high dominance of a few taxa mainly diptera and hemiptera diptera and hemiptera showed an increased abundance and distribution in these sites an indication that these taxa are not highly affected by on going human mediated environmental and ecological changes masese mcclain 2012 raburu masese 2012 hill s number gamma diversity was not able to capture variability in taxa diversity among site categories on the contrary fisher s alpha diversity showed clear differences among categories suggesting that it is less sensitive to numerical dominance of invertebrate communities by a few dominating taxa hence better suited at assessing anthropogenic influences on the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the region although natural conditions influence taxon richness and abundance anthropogenic activities in the moderately disturbed and disturbed sites likely aggravated the effects observed in this study anthropogenic disturbances such as land use activities relating to agriculture farming and livestock husbandry deforestation unpaved road construction and settlements have been found to influence the quantity of runoff and sediments that enter recipient water bodies during the rains wang lyons 2003 donohue irvine 2004 masese et al 2017 and therefore negatively affecting the water quality in these systems which in turn influence the composition of the resident biota 4 3 functional composition of macroinvertebrates the presence of thick riparian canopy in the undisturbed sites created conditions with plenty of feeding material that supported the high abundance and richness of the shredder functional guild which utilizes leaf litter from these riparian zones as an energy source contrastingly this feeding guild recorded the lowest abundance and richness in the disturbed sites which is a function of stripped canopy cover along riparian zones and therein the lack of litterfall and increased temperature it has also been noted that shredders are intimately linked and dependent on to the nature of riparian vegetation because of their reliance on allochthonous food resources and as well contribute nutrient cycling and energy transfer to other trophic groups dobson et al 2002 boyero et al 2011 brasil et al 2014 masese et al 2014a scarpers abundance and richness were higher in the disturbance sites which can be attributed to the increased temperatures due to open canopy and nutrients from agricultural farms and livestock input which supported primary productivity algal production which served as an energy source for scrapers this is in line with an earlier study by barbee 2005 which pointed out that the densities of scrapers are determined by the presence or absence of algal biomass and production collectors had the highest number of individuals across the three site categories the high numbers across the sites can be attributed to the wide array of food resources consumed by this group studies have documented the dependence of collectors on the capacity of shredders to break down cpom to fpom which serves as an energy source for collectors and therefore their abundance is dependent on the availability of shredders in the system a dominance of collectors throughouta river network has been reported inother studies of tropical streams such as those of tomanova et al 2006 and jiang et al 2011 predators abundance and richness increased with increase in disturbance from undisturbed sites to disturbed sites predators such as odonata and hemipterans are more tolerant of pollution boyero et al 2009 favretto et al 2014 and therefore can withstand degraded habitat and water quality conditions the dominance of these taxa in the disturbed sites was made possible by the presence of other tolerant prey taxa such as oligochaeta barbee 2005 an argument that is in line with river continuum concept rcc which proposed that the abundance of predators depend on prey availability and abundance vannote et al 1980 4 4 relationships between macroinvertebrates assemblages and water quality variables the distribution of macroinvertebrate structural and functional assemblages was influenced by physico chemical water quality and nutrients across the site categories canonical correspondence analysis cca indicated that specific site categories correlated with specific water quality variables which in turn affected the distribution of the macroinvertebrates an increase in temperature and do affected lepidostomatidae leptoceridae crambidae baetidae and philopotamidae families which are sensitive to pollution mainly at the undisturbed sites shredders lepidostomatidae leptoceridae and crambidae found in the undisturbed sites forested area were favoured by the low temperatures high do levels and dense canopy studies by dobson et al 2002 minaya et al 2013 and masese et al 2014a reported similar trends increase in tp tn and conductivity levels positively influenced predators at the disturbed sites concurring with other studies such as by bojsen jacobsen 2003 which reported collectors and predators to be more tolerant to pollution hence dominating degraded sites in the moderately disturbed sites tss was established as the main variable affecting the scrapers this is attributed to greater depths and increased turbidity s in these sites which prevent light penetration into the water column thus hindering primary production algae which is the main energy source for scrapers increase in nutrient levels and reduction in water quality negatively impacted the distribution of sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa the deteriorating water quality with an increase in disturbance levels as noted by the increasing levels of tss temperature electrical conductivity and tds from undisturbed to disturbed through moderately disturbed sites also have contributed to the low richness and diversity of macroinvertebrate taxa in the disturbed sites replacement of native vegetation by pasture and intensive agriculture is associated with degradation of water quality and degradation of physical habitat bryce et al 2010 masese et al 2014 these results are consistent with numerous other studies that have also found abiotic factors to significantly explain variation in macroinvertebrate communities coucerio et al 2007 kasangaki et al 2006 2008 masese et al 2009 2014a 5 conclusions the patterns in the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrate assemblages obtained in this study showed how changes in water quality streams and rivers influence the structural and functional compostion of macroinvertebrates specifically this study shows that even in areas under small scale agriculture and rural settlements macroinvertebrates can track even subtle changes in water quality changes in the composition and distribution of macroinvertebrates maily resulted from small scale agriculture livestock grazing and access to streams and rivers for watering these activities led to deterotation in both habitat and water quality in the streams this study contributes to further development of biomonitoring indices in the region by identifying taxa that are responsive to human activities in unurbanized catchments in the afrotropics future efforts for water quality and biodiversity conservation in streams and rivers should therefore prioritize minimizing human impact arising from these activities declaration of competing interest none declared ethics approval the

erosion as well as provide a substantial surface area for microbial attachment tsihrintzis 2017 vymazal 2018 so far several plant species have been employed in a constructed wetland in terms of wastewater treatment including phragmites spp typha spp iris spp juncus eichhornia crassipes lemna minor scirpus spp and hydrilla verticillata gorgoglione and torretta 2018 meanwhile several recent studies have reported on the efficacy of many other cw plants such as heliconia burleana zantedeschia aethiopica canna indica ipomoea aquatica and acorus calamus rahman et al 2020 however the ability of such plants to eliminate pollutants varies depending on a variety of factors including environmental technical as well as species morphological and spatial characteristics leto et al 2013 licata et al 2019 grew three divergent plants in cws under the same agronomic and climatic conditions and found that arundo donax planted units obtained high nutrient removal with maximum biomass yield this was due to the plant s perfect compatibility with its environment and spatial dispersion of roots similarly xu et al 2020 demonstrated that the native floating plant trapa natans showed great potential in nutrient removal as compared to exotic eichhornia crassipes the above statement supports the use of indigenous macrophytes in cw for wastewater treatment because they are more likely to thrive and propagate in a local environment than exotic the substrate or active media is another crucial component of cw that acts as a growing medium for vegetation provides support and stability to plants allows wastewater movement and reduces pollutants through filtration adsorption and sedimentation kadlec and wallace 2009 qomariyah et al 2017 steel slag modified zeolite limestone chitosan clay aggregates activated carbon and blast are some types of substrates that have recently been investigated for the removal of water borne pollutants jiang et al 2019 typically the cw is planted with single species however vymazal 2007 suggested that combined plant species are beneficial than single species calheiros et al 2015 supported the above statement and reported that polyculture was found advantageous rather than monoculture since it could provide a better habitat for biodiversity and effective root biomass distribution similarly using mixed ornamental flowering plants in cws creates an aesthetic look provides economic benefit as well as improves the plant diversity sandoval et al 2019 in contrast few previous studies demonstrated that above ground biomass production and ammonium removal rates in the monoculture system were significantly higher than in the polyculture system zhong et al 2016 such researchers also reveal that fierce competition amongst plant species in the polyculture system may lower the nutrients uptake capacity and growth rate thus there is still a question of whether mixed plant culture is more effective to use or monoculture therefore in order to better understand the functionality of the system further research is required besides wastewater treatment an additional striking feature of cws is the provision of plant biomass which could be utilized for several purposes such as food forage bio fuel medicines and manufacturing of industrial and household goods many studies have debated about the potential and advantages of growing vegetation in cws for example typha species arundo donax cyperus papyrus and phragmites have been served in wastewater treatment as well as in the manufacturing of marketable goods and renewable energy production avellán and gremillion 2019a it was estimated that 1 meter square of cw cultivated with arundo donax can produce up to 1660 l methane via biogas production avellán and gremillion 2019b nevertheless sustainable biomass productivity and treatment capability of plant species in cws are based on their availability local climatic conditions suitability capacity to tolerate influent and harvesting technique wu et al 2015 however some research studies have shown concern about the safety of using wastewater treatment plants for food and pharmacological purposes mateo sagasta et al 2013 stated that the health and environmental risk of wastewater irrigated crops could be reduced by the implementation of guidelines and management framework proposed by the world health organization who some of them are described here in terms of managing wastewater hazard it is restricted to apply fine textured soil or clay that may capture a large number of nutrients reduce microbiological contamination through medication such as anti helminths drug or by maintaining a withholding period between wastewater applications decrease hydraulic loading rate or apply drip irrigation technology in addition select appropriate plants that are less sensitive to metals and toxins and provide profitable yield before using crops for the medicinal and dietary purpose must focus on hygienic practices like washing sterilization and pretreatment who 2006 this multidisciplinary approach compared the performance of hsfcw planted with monoculture and polyculture of four commercial plants collected from different habitat ipomoea aquatica floating macrophyte canna indica garden plant oryza sativa field crop and iris pseudacorus wetland plant for domestic wastewater treatment the mesocosm systems were operated during the summer autumn season according to our study hypothesis different habitat plant species evolve with different morphological and spatial characteristics that define the pollutant uptake capacity and biomass productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and conditions proto type constructed wetland systems were established in the research center at the wuxi campus of southeast university nanjing china wuxi city is located in the north subtropical humid monsoon climatic zone with the highest precipitation 165 mm in the month of july over the course of 30 years 1981 2010 the mean temperature was 16 2 c and the average annual rainfall was 1122 mm zhai yaming et al 2016 there are occasional light intensity thunderstorms which do not affect the treatment performance however the experimental site was completely covered with white polyethylene plastic sheets in order to protect the plants from damage due to thunderstorms and strong winds for this study five hsfcws were installed each hsfcw was rectangular shaped with the same dimensions m of 2 2 0 3 0 4 length width height above the ground surface and having a longitudinal bottom slope of 1 5 towards the outflow the bottom floor was constructed with concrete polyvinyl chloride and coated with epoxy paint to avoid leaching of nutrients all the cw basins were packed similarly with layers of 10 cm coarse gravel 20 40 mm diameter 5 cm fine gravel 15 20 mm diameter 4 cm ceramsite 10 20 mm diameter and 2 cm sand clay 1 3 mm as demonstrated in fig 1 for this experimental setup the hydraulic retention time and hydraulic loading rate of sewage influent were maintained every week at 1 25 days and 0 24 m day 1 respectively the average values of dissolved oxygen do and ph of influent were 6 1 mg l 1 and 6 9 respectively during the experimentation period the minimum and maximum water temperatures ranged from 5 to 25 c 2 2 plantation for experimental treatments seedlings of four divergent plant species were collected from different habitats grown in hsfcws the selection of each plant was made according to their economic significance aesthetic value and purpose of utilization ipomoea aquatica is a vegetable plant and typically growing in water similarly canna indica species are often found in meadows and grown in the garden as an ornamental plant iris pseudacorus is an herbaceous plant and usually found near wetlands ditches and marshes oryza sativa is one of the most cultivated field crops and can be used for many purposes the economic benefits of all experimental plants can be seen in table 1 fifteen seedlings about 12 to 14 cm in height of every plant species were procured from the local market twelve of them were planted 3 cm below the upper surface in treatment hsfcws with a 5 cm m2 equidistant spacing ellis et al 2003 while remaining three seedlings were cultivated equidistantly in a mixed plant wetland cultivation of plants was carried out on 15th july one week before the sewage experiment and later flooded with domestic wastewater to see the effects of wastewater and the environment on plants 2 3 experimental procedure rural sewage was first collected from the university dormitory via a drainage pipe and deposited in the settling tank for the process of sedimentation later pumped into a storage tank and through the inlet chamber supplied to the experimental constructed wetlands for advanced treatment wastewater treatment in each wetland system was continued for the one week duration and then stopped by draining as effluent every week a fresh lot of sewage was introduced into the same cws cultivated with different plant species the inlet and outlet of each cw were kept clear to avoid clogging issues the experiments were continued for over 12 weeks in a natural environment between summer and autumn 23rd july to 22nd october sewage samples from the inlet and outlet points of each cw were drawn for the weekly treatments growth parameters height and weight of each plant species were recorded in the respective cw the average growth rate height and weight of each plant species was based on three sample plant measurements which were selected individually from both monoculture and polyculture wetlands plants shoot height of sample triplicates was noted every month by the meter scale while average weight was determined at the beginning and end of the experiment at the termination of the experiment above ground biomass including withered flowers and leaves of every plant species were harvested separately from monoculture and mp wetlands primarily harvested biomass was thoroughly cleaned with water to remove dust particles air dried for 10 days then weighed to estimate the total biomass yield zhu et al 2010 fresh weight and total biomass yield were measured by electronic balance ohaus 2 4 analytical methods nutrients suspended solids and coliform were determined in the wastewater before and after cws treatment approximately 500 ml of sewage influent and cw treated effluent samples were collected from the inlet and outlet chambers and brought to the lab for analysis all the parameters tp no 3 n cod fc and tss were measured according to the standard methods of water and wastewater treatment apha 2005 while tn and nh4 n analysis procedures follow the guidelines listed in monitoring and analysis method of water and wastewater china 2002 the percentage of efficiency was calculated according to the following equation 1 efficiency c o c i 100 c o where co inflow concentration of pollutants in wastewater ci outflow concentration of pollutants in wastewater the average daily load of pollutants was determined by the multiplication of inflow outflow c with the hydraulic loading rate q according to the equation given below 3 average daily load g day c m 3 s q m day while the total removed rate trr was calculated by subtraction of the average loading rate of outflow lin in sewage by an average daily load of pollutants outflowing lout from hsfcw 4 trr g day lin lout dissolved oxygen do and ph were recorded by the ecosense do200a usa and ecosense ph100a probe usa respectively detailed analytical procedures are given hereunder total nitrogen tn was measured from 3 ml of influent effluent the sample was transferred in a 25 ml colorimetric tube and diluted with 5 ml deionized water then poured 5 ml alkaline persulfate digestion solution sigma aldrich tightly covered and then put into the autoclave at 120 c for 60 minutes later the tube was taken out from the autoclave and retained for some time until it cooled down add 1 ml 1 5m naoh and mixed finally poured into the 10 mm cuvette and determined at 220 275 nm wavelength by spectrophotometer lab tech model 01130201 for data processing a calibration curve was drawn in software ms excel 2010 whereas nitrate nitrogen no3 n was also determined by the spectrophotometer method a 2 ml water sample was pipetted in a 50 ml tube and diluted with 48 ml of deionized water then add 0 1 ml hcl solution and 1 ml nitrate stock solution then mixed thoroughly poured mixed solution in the cuvette and recorded spectrophotometric values at 220 275 nm wavelength ammonium nitrogen nh4 n determination was carried out by nelson s method and spectrophotometric method poured 10 ml influent effluent sample in a colorimetric tube and diluted to the marker an aqueous solution of potassium tartrate knac4h6o6 0 2 ml was mixed in a 10 ml of sample then added 0 2 ml of nessler reagent and retained for 10 minutes after thorough mixing a 3 ml solution was pipetted into a 10 mm quartz cuvette the ammonium content of a mixed solution was recorded at 420 nm wavelength total phosphorus tp was determined by the potassium persulfate digestion method 00665 influent and effluent samples of 25 ml were taken in 50 ml colorimetric tubes individually and added 4 ml potassium persulfate k2s2o8 solution with a 50 g l 1 concentration sigma aldrich wrapped the lid of the colorimetric tube tightly through gauze and digested by putting it into the autoclave at 120 c for 60 minutes after digestion samples were taken out from autoclave cooled at room temperature and diluted with 50 ml deionized water then 1 ml ascorbic acid c6h8o6 with 100 g l 1 conc and 2 ml molybdate solution nh4 6mo7o244h2o was added left the tubes for 15 minutes until the sample s color turned blue later phosphorus contents were measured with a spectrophotometer lab tech model 01130201 at 700 nm wavelength entire data were processed by drawing a calibration curve chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent effluent sample was determined by reflux titrimetric method 5220 c fecal coliform fc was grown on nfc dehydrated medium fisher scientific df0677 17 3 mixed with a rosolic acid solution fisher scientific df3228 09 1 wastewater samples 100 ml were filtered with whatman filter paper 0 2 µm which was placed into the medium loaded petri dish and incubated at 37 c for 24 hours colonies of coliform were recorded on the digital colony counter and mpn was calculated according to the standard procedure total suspended solids tss were determined by the gravimetric method the difference in the initial and final weight of each filter paper was used to calculate tss value by the equation as given below 5 tss mg l w 1 w 2 1000 v ml where w1 initial weight of the filter paper w2 final weight of the filter paper v volume of the wastewater sample average values of data on the removal efficiency of nutrients tn nh4 n no3 n and tp cod tss and fc in different cw treated sewage effluents collected every week were calculated from the original replicate values 2 5 statistical analysis data on plant growth and wastewater parameters were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance anova procedure using statistics 8 1 software statistical differences among treatments of cws with plant species were compared through the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 whereas graphs to compare various plant species treatments for wastewater quality and plant growth parameters recorded during the experiment were drawn by using originlab software 2015 and ms excel correlations r2 were worked out for ph and do against various quality attributes of treatment effluents 3 results 3 1 sewage characteristics characteristics of sewage samples collected weekly from hsfcws influents were determined by measuring ph temperature and fc and analyzing for the contents of do cod tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tss data regarding all these parameters are presented in table 2 throughout the experiment period sewage temperature reduced continuously initially it was higher and declined from 25 to 18 c during the first half 23rd july to 6th september 2017 but remained lower and declined from 18 to 5 c during the second half 7th september to 22nd october 2017 do concentration ranged between 3 0 and 5 0 with an average of 3 9 mg l 1 the ph of rural sewage varied from 6 9 to 7 5 with an average value of 7 2 mean concentrations of pollutants mg l 1 were as tn 27 3 nh 4 n 16 4 no 3 n 6 5 cod 88 2 tp 2 0 and tss 25 while fc was 37 cfu 100 ml concentrations for all the above mentioned pollutant parameters in the effluents were significantly smaller than in the influent due to filtration and uptake by substrate and plants respectively 3 2 nitrogen removal total nitrogen tn concentration in the influent wastewater was 25 5 29 2 mg l 1 among the 12 weeks of sewage loading the amount of tn was significantly reduced by all the plant species within the range of 74 77 the mp and ipomoea aquatica scored the best average tn removal efficiency tnre of 77 and 76 respectively fig 2 while the cws cultivated with other species of plants viz iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa were a slightly low performer with tnre of 74 75 comparatively these results exhibit that ipomoea aquatica and mp had better performance in terms of tn removal efficiency the mean concentration of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in the influent was 14 9 17 9 mg l 1 and after treatment it reduced highly from 85 93 fig 3 the mp appeared as the most resilient cw system achieved the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency anre about 93 whereas ipomoea aquatica iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa results were slightly lower than mp about 91 88 85 and 87 respectively the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the influent sewage ranged between 5 3 10 8 mg l 1 average nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency nnre exhibited by different plant species was within the range of 61 81 fig 4 results suggested that mp and ipomoea aquatica played a significant role in no3 n removal of about 81 and 80 respectively contrastingly iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa were in lower positions around 68 61 and 60 respectively 3 3 chemical oxygen demand removal the average concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in influent was 88 2 mg l 1 and reduced 23 4 37 mg l 1 higher cod removal efficiency codre was obtained by mp and ipomoea aquatica about 73 and 69 whilst iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa achieved 64 63 and 57 respectively average values of cod removal were reported in fig 5 3 4 phosphorus removal the concentration of total phosphorus in the influent wastewater was almost uniform as 1 9 2 2 mg l 1 over the entire study period the highest phosphorus removal efficiency pre was 96 obtained in both mp and ipomoea aquatica fig 6 while the results of other plant species were slightly lower 88 93 as compared to that of ipomea aquatica and mp treatments 3 5 fecal coliform reduction throughout the study period the mean count of fc in the influent sewage was 37 cfu 100 ml fig 7 average fecal coliform removal efficiency fcre achieved by mp iris pseudacorus canna indica oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica were in the descending order of 80 76 69 65 and 62 respectively the mp and iris pseudacorus systems performed relatively better for fc elimination 3 6 suspended solids reduction total suspended solids load in the sewage influents ranged between 19 and 30 mg l 1 after the phytoremediation process of one week the suspended solid removal efficiencies ssre were 78 69 67 67 and 65 through mp canna indica iris pseudacorus oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica respectively fig 8 the mp and canna indica results were relatively better than those given by other plant species cultivated in respective hsfcws 3 7 plants growth attributes tables 3 and 4 display the average growth rate of each plant species during four months from the time of cultivation to harvesting the monocultures of ipomoea aquatica and canna indica exhibited a healthy growth rate similar to the mp wetland in july or at the seedlings transplanting time the monocultures and polyculture of ipomoea aquatica and canna indica reached an average height of 12 14 and 13 15 cm and fresh biomass weight of 20 22 and 32 g respectively similarly in october or at harvesting time the height and weight of both individual and mp increased correspondingly up to 215 and 148 cm and 300 291 and 299 313 g respectively in contrast plants of iris pseudacorus and oryza sativa at the time of their harvesting had approximately 67 70 and 66 70 cm height and around 176 180 and 85 88 g fresh weight comparatively very little difference was observed between the growth rate of the plants either grown individually or in the mixed wetland results suggested that ipomoea aquatica and mp had markedly greater biomass yields of about 3300 and 3200 g m 2 respectively whereas iris pseudacorus and oryza sativa biomass productivity were lower by 2200 and 2000 g m 2 respectively it was also noted that canna indica obtained a maximum height as compared to ipomoea aquatica but produced less biomass yield it might be attributed to the greater vertical growth of thick stems and smaller horizontal distribution characteristics of this species 4 discussion a complete picture of raw sewage influent over time reflects that starting from the summer month of july towards the end of the experiment in the beginning month of winter viz october the contaminants contents increased slightly however the mean daily temperature reduced drastically from 25 to 5 c due to seasonal shift over at the same time the do also decreased from about 5 mg l 1 during the beginning weeks to around 3 mg l 1 towards the end of the experiment the ph did not have a consistent trend although it was slightly higher being 7 5 at the start and 7 3 at the last sampling present data construes that more use of water in summer at the domestic level dilutes the sewage so lowering down the total contents of contaminants as compared to that concentrated during the winter season further at a lower temperature below 6 c during winter the microbial activities slow down resulting in less degradation or removal of nutrients from the sewage zhou et al 2017 in the cw system do is assumed one of the most significant factors for nutrients and organic carbon removal higher values of do in summer could be inferred from the fact that a large amount of water usage creates a high gradient turbulent flow of sewage to dissolve more oxygen with better re aeration potential than does a low gradient in winter xu et al 2017 in this study the ph of sewage effluent rendered negative or no correlation with most of the pollutants removal efficiencies except phosphorus with a very small positive r2 value 0 109 and negative correlation with do 0 336 this negative correlation gives the impression that phosphorus removal is dependent on the concentration of oxygen present in the water it is well known the excess concentration of phosphorus in water bodies may decrease the do level and triggers the eutrophication problem misra and chaturvedi 2016 contrastingly other pollutants r2 values were just the opposite of phosphorus showed a positive correlation with do and negative with ph table 5 it reflects that the residual pollutant load increased as the oxygen consumption is increased predominantly through degradation processes and decreased progressively with the increase of ph level for instance in the case of high organic carbon concentration a greater amount of available oxygen is supplied to the plant s roots where it is used for the organic matter degradation kouki et al 2009 the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle is a complex mechanism where multiple abiotic and biotic factors are involved in the transformation of nh4 no2 n2o and n2 in cws n is typically converted into various chemical forms under aerobic conditions based on the transformation equation nh3 nh4 no2 n no3 n vymazal 2007 however denitrification is an anaerobic process where no3 is ultimately transformed into molecular nitrogen the complete denitrification process can be expressed by this equation no3 no2 no n2o n2 in the current study plants were grown in the hsfcws received an averagely 27 3 mg l 1 concentration of tn from influent and reduced maximally up to 77 in mp followed closely by ipomoea aquatica results indicated that both hsfcws were advantageous in tn reduction may be due to the greater root distribution and high uptake capacity of plant species earlier studies stated that greater n removal rates in planted wetlands could be attributed to the high plant diversity high concentration of do and biomass yield luo et al 2018 additionally a well developed root system provides a large surface area for the establishment of the microbial community and facilitates nitrogen transformation muerdter et al 2020 moreover carbon input and release of root exudates encourage heterotrophic denitrification to support the complete n removal tao 2018 similarly the mixed gravel layer increase mineralization of organic nitrogen and microbial growth in the biofilm together play a leading role in tn removal as well de rozari et al 2018 besides this other important factors which may affect the tn concentration in effluents were do temperature and high salinity which could be decreased by the dehydrogenase activity of nitrite and ammonia oxidizing microbes xu et al 2017 yu et al 2011 stated that more than 90 removal of n was obtained when increased the concentration of do because a high concentration of do may accelerate the ammonification process and nitrifiers activities comparatively mp and ipomoea aquatica attained the highest ammonium removal efficiency which could also be due to the greater adaptability of these plant species in the study area however the present study results were quite better than the other studies where the canna indica and ipomoea aquatica achieved only 52 64 results in nh4 n and tn removal sharma et al 2014 khairalla et al 2016 typically the nitrification process is strongly associated with plant and microorganisms activities several research studies revealed that the excretion of oxygen from plants helps to increase the aerobic niche and soil redox potential boosting the degradation process nitrification and heavy metals sedimentation fahim et al 2020 furthermore leakage of carbon chelating components and antibiotics from roots could increase the denitrification as well as accumulation of phytotoxic elements in vacuoles shelef et al 2013 earlier studies reported that high organic loadings in wastewater may expedite the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria and decrease the available oxygen and nitrification rate saeed and sun 2012 results indicated that mp and ipomoea aquatica presented a relatively higher no3 n removal percentage than iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa the no3 n removal mechanism in cws could be influenced by several factors such as roots density microbial activity fluctuation in temperature carbon source wetland fillers and plant uptake capacity luo et al 2018 sylla 2020 usually no3 n is assimilated through plants and bacterial activity plant roots release organic exudates and oxygen which support the mechanism of nitrification and denitrification han et al 2019 although every plant requires nutrients for its development however their capacity for consumption and growth rate is different from each other in this study influent contained low concentrations of cod ranged between 75 to 99 mg l 1 as compared to the average standard value of domestic wastewater 300 mg l 1 metcalf eddy inc 2003 small cod concentration in influent could be the result of effective primary treatment and low concentration of organic matter in the raw sewage collected from the university dormitory considering the cod removal the roots of plants and microbes are of great significance transferring oxygen from plants arenchymatic tissues to roots may enhance the activities of heterotrophic bacteria to facilitate organic matter degradation it is well documented that cod is primarily removed by anaerobic microbes along with aerobic metabolism at the surface of the gravels and near to the roots kouki et al 2009 another study reported that microbiological indicators such as fungi and bacteria are responsible for organic carbon degradation rashid et al 2016 nonetheless the ability to release greater oxygen varies among species depending on plant physiology anatomy and morphology in the current study mp and ipomoea aquatica had significantly high 73 and 69 cod removal efficiencies that might be positively linked with the high oxygen distribution to the root zone in contrast low cod removal was delivered by oryza sativa probably due to the less supply of do near the rhizosphere previous studies demonstrated that a distinct distribution of do could considerably improve organic carbon degradation ilyas and masih 2017 in the present work cod removal efficiencies were significantly high as compared to previous studies khairalla et al 2016 conducted similar research using ipomoea aquatica for domestic wastewater treatment and obtained 56 of cod removal in the same context cw planted with different ornamental plants reduced up to 40 60 of cod from sewage burgos et al 2017 the cws provide an environment where inter conversion of all forms of phosphorus takes place either organic or inorganic the physicochemical transformation of phosphorus mainly occurs by plant uptake sorption sedimentation precipitation and desorption abou elela and hellal 2012 usually the plant consumes phosphorus through roots and utilizes them for their growth and nourishment in this study we found multiple plantations efficiently reduced tp concentration than a single plant which might occur due to the following reasons described by geng et al 2017 such as a large number of shoots and biomass ipomoea aquatica broadened leaves and fibrous root structure canna indica and sturdy arenchema tissues to support aerobic degradation it indicates the uptake capacity of every plant is different and a combination of different species may improve the p recovery vymazal 2007 reported that plants have a considerable impact on phosphorus removal particularly in tropical countries however it predominantly defines by plants genera alternatively substrates and matrix also have an immense effect on phosphorus removal reduce effectively through the mechanisms of adsorption and sedimentation yu et al 2011 luo et al 2017 total phosphorus is typically divided into organic phosphorus and particulate phosphorus organic phosphorus is converted into mineral phosphorus by microbial activity and assimilated by plants while particulate phosphorus is usually removed by the processes of filtration and sorption through roots and substrate kouki et al 2009 it was evident in this study each hf contained the same substrate but the rate of pollutant reduction was different from each other it could be due to the plant species uptake capacity and adsorption mechanisms during this study mean removal efficiencies for fc were variable compared with other plants mp and iris pseudacorus rendered significantly higher results as compared to the canna indica oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica among them ipomoea aquatica showed the worse results with considerable variations decamp warren 1998 stated that some plant species possess antibacterial properties and secrete chemical substances or metabolites which help to eliminate the microbes furthermore fc concentration could also be affected by shifts in temperature zheng et al 2016 demonstrated that the diminished growth rate and low metabolic activity of coliforms were observed when the weather changed from summer to winter moreover the small grain size of filter media and the presence of active predator microorganisms may boost up the fc inactivation flemming et al 2016 although we didn t determine the substrate s diameter and other microbes existence but mentioned here as a possible reason for fc removal greater tss reduction was achieved by mp and canna indica the removal efficiency of tss principally depends on phytofiltration sedimentation microbial adhesion and extensive rooting biomass mahmood et al 2016 arora et al 2016 sub surface flow constructed wetland ssfcw is a stable biofilm reactor in which sedimentation and filtration mechanisms operate through accumulation and retention of suspended particles between the voids of filter media and plant roots while organic particles are oxidized by the conversion of organic particles into humic substances in both aerobic and anoxic conditions arora et al 2014 moreover filter media holds small pores that may easily trap the organic matter and provide prevention from clogging chen et al 2013b during the whole study period a higher removal load kg 1 d was obtained by ipomoea aquatica particularly in nutrients removal whereas canna indica was good in tss removal although the hsfcw system encouraged all the four plant species to achieve maximum growth rate either grown individually or in the mixed wetland nevertheless ipomoea aquatica and canna indica height were greater than others predominantly due to the species specific growth rate and suitable temperature of 10 25 c accessibility to essential nutrients microbial and organic amendments from wastewater trivedi et al 2017 furthermore mp wetland displayed a little lower growth values than the monoculture system though the difference was very small we hypothesized that the invasive growth of some plants could be a possible hindrance in the way of other plant development according to liang et al 2011 competition amongst plant species in mixed plant wetlands may affect the plant s stability performance and growth generally all the tested plant species were suitable for cw wastewater treatment it was observed that plants in cws quickly produce high biomass yield therefore to avoid the internal loading of nutrients from decaying plants it is recommended to harvest plants before die off geng et al 2017 nevertheless harvested biomass could be utilized for several economical purposes including green fuel medicines fodder or in industries for papermaking avellán and gremillion 2019a thus the current study demonstrates the cw is a reliable treatment method and the system s efficiency could be further increased by the implementation of some strategies such as special attention should be paid in the selection of two crucial components of cw plants and substrate gorgoglione and torretta 2018 choose highly porous filter media plants with a well developed root system and add earthworms to prevent cw clogging maintain hydraulic flow and retention as too much or too little flow can be harmful to plant growth and survival in case of low temperature it is recommended to grow cold resistant terrestrial plants instead of seasonal herbaceous plants effluent quality could be further enhanced by the application of modified cw such as microbial fuel cell cw baffled subsurface flow cw and circular flow corridor cw wu et al 2014 results indicated that both monoculture and polyculture systems have shown efficient pollutant removal as well as good adaptation nevertheless mixed plants cw are more resilient than single plant cws furthermore mp efficiently reduced the average daily pollutant load and achieved the maximum total removed rate table 6 7 it is well known that every plant species preserves different physical and morphological characteristics therefore it could be expected the better removal rates in the polyculture system might be associated with the well developed root system of divergent plant species their redox potential and uptake capacity it has been reported in earlier studies mixed plant cultures may accelerate the release of oxygen which could boost up the uptake of organic matter and nitrogenous compounds canarini et al 2019 furthermore effective roots distribution in mixed plant wetlands may provide shelter for microbial communities and promote the nitrification and denitrification process calheiros et al 2015 besides wastewater treatment the polyculture system also possesses several other benefits such as provides aesthetic looks and high biodiversity marín muñiz et al 2020 4 1 effects of climatic conditions on pollutants removal constructed wetland system is one of the most popular non conventional techniques which is widely used to treat several kinds of wastewater at different climatic conditions over the entire experimental period the air temperature was recorded at 29 5 c fig 9 although both monoculture and mixed plant wetlands showed efficient removal percentages throughout the experiment however slight declination was observed at the beginning of the winter season or during september results indicated that the removal efficiency of all parameters was significantly high in the warmest period albuquerque et al 2009 also conducted a study on climatic conditions in a similar system and reported that during the spring summer season removal efficiencies of tn nh4 n and no3 n was 86 89 and 80 respectively and gradually decreased throughout autumn winter season the highest removal of tn and nh4 n during the summer season might be linked with the high uptake of nutrients additionally high evapotranspiration rates in the summer spring season mediate the changes in water level which contribute to enhance the redox potential values and facilitate the process of nitrification pedescoll et al 2011 in contrast a reduction in efficiency was observed during autumn attributed to the slower activity of nitrifying bacteria or high hydraulic flushing through wetland beds during precipitation silveira et al 2015 therefore in the light of all findings it is proved that low temperature is non conducive for wastewater nitrogen removal seasonal changes may increase or decrease the cod removal efficiency taylor et al 2011 observed the variation in cod removal when the weather shifted from warm to cold season the high temperatures permit the plant to supply more oxygen and carbon exudate near the root zone which may enhance microbial activity within the rhizosphere faulwetter et al 2009 in the present work a slight reduction in cod removal was detected in the mid of october that might be attributed to the greater variability in temperature thus it could be assumed that a high temperature is favorable for organic matter degradation the average tp removal efficiency was higher in the warm season more or less 96 however a decrease in removal rate was observed during the 11th to 12th weeks which may occur probably due to the lower temperature of about 8 5 c in another study gradual declination in tp removal efficiency was detected which might be primarily related to the type of filter media climatic conditions and different vegetation mesquita et al 2017 whereas no obvious tp removal effects were observed at 7 25 c but when the operation temperature increase to 33 c the effluents showed a sharp inclination in tp concentration zhang et al 2011 justified that the soil matrix could be influenced by high temperature and subsequently release the tp climate has a significant impact on microbial growth and removal as can be noted that removal efficiency was rose between 25 18 c most probably in summer and completely declined when the temperature reached 5 c the high fecal streptococcal removal percentage in surface flow wetlands was achieved in summer as compared to winter reinoso et al 2008 moreover another study demonstrated that about 91 98 reduction in fecal coliform concentration was observed during the summer rainy season makvana and sharma 2013 these studies proposed that a constructed wetland system is more suitable for coliform removal in the summer season 5 conclusion this study mainly aimed to reduce the load of nutrients cod tss and coliform from the rural sewage in a sustainable manner through phytoremediation for this purpose four divergent commercial plants were selected and grown in cws as monocultures and polyculture all findings revealed that mp and monoculture of ipomoea aquatica showed high tolerance to sewage treatment particularly for nutrients and cod removal only tss and fc removal efficiencies were influenced by the canna indica and iris pseudacorus in monoculture arrangements a slight decline in the pollutant removal rate was observed when the season shifted from summer to autumn in the present study all plant species exhibited an optimum growth rate throughout the experiment either planted as monocultures or polyculture in cws particularly ipomoea aquatica and mp achieved higher biomass yield about 3300 g m2 and 3200 g m2 respectively the above findings validate the impression that hsfcw cultivated with mixed plantation is the best option for sewage treatment as well as biomass production however the selection of appropriate plants is

991,constructed wetlands are one of the most viable wastewater treatment technologies with an additional aspect of biomass production that could be utilized in the manufacturing of valuable products with this objective four species of divergent commercial plants were grown individually and polyculture in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands hsfcw rural sewage was supplied from a storage tank to each cw through the inlet chamber the experiment was continued for 12 weeks july to october collectively the hsfcw having polyculture of plants was more effective in the removal of all pollutants while monoculture of ipomoea aquatica exhibited better performance for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients viz total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n with a removal efficiency of 69 77 96 90 and 80 respectively whereas iris pseudacorus and canna indica showed significantly better results for fecal coliform and total suspended solids reduction at the last stage of the experiment all plant species achieved the maximum growth rate particularly ipomoea aquatica and polyculture or mixed planting mp had the highest growth rate and larger above ground biomass thus current findings reflect that mp wetland in wastewater treatment coupled with biomass production renders environmental and economic benefits keywords pollutants removal wastewater monoculture wetlands polyculture wetlands commercial crops biomass production 1 introduction the increase in the human population and inadequate treatment of wastewater are accelerating the problem of water pollution and placing a negative impact on the natural environment to control this gruesome situation several centralized and decentralized wastewater treatment systems have been proposed among them a constructed wetland cw system is recognized as the most viable option to produce high quality effluent without entailing convoluted operation and it could be effortlessly employed in low socioeconomic areas and small communities sehar et al 2016 correspondingly this system provides some additional ecosystem benefits such as shelter for wildlife regulates the aquatic environment and biodiversity creates aesthetics and captures nutrients for reuse wang et al 2017 according to wetland hydrology cws are usually classified into the subsurface flow free water surface and floating bed horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland hsfcw is the sand and gravel filled basin where wastewater passes horizontally between the roots of macrophytes and filter media schierano et al 2020 the plant and substrate are the main components of hsfcw and works as an inter medium in the treatment mechanism by enhancing various biological and chemical reactions fahim et al 2019 growing plants in hsfcw create an aerobic zone around the roots and rhizomes and facilitate aerobic metabolism and organic matter degradation additionally promote oxidation of nitrite into nitrate increase porosity prevent clogging provide aesthetics regulate the water flow insulate the bed surface particularly in cold climatic conditions maintain the carbon oxygen balance prevent soil erosion as well as provide a substantial surface area for microbial attachment tsihrintzis 2017 vymazal 2018 so far several plant species have been employed in a constructed wetland in terms of wastewater treatment including phragmites spp typha spp iris spp juncus eichhornia crassipes lemna minor scirpus spp and hydrilla verticillata gorgoglione and torretta 2018 meanwhile several recent studies have reported on the efficacy of many other cw plants such as heliconia burleana zantedeschia aethiopica canna indica ipomoea aquatica and acorus calamus rahman et al 2020 however the ability of such plants to eliminate pollutants varies depending on a variety of factors including environmental technical as well as species morphological and spatial characteristics leto et al 2013 licata et al 2019 grew three divergent plants in cws under the same agronomic and climatic conditions and found that arundo donax planted units obtained high nutrient removal with maximum biomass yield this was due to the plant s perfect compatibility with its environment and spatial dispersion of roots similarly xu et al 2020 demonstrated that the native floating plant trapa natans showed great potential in nutrient removal as compared to exotic eichhornia crassipes the above statement supports the use of indigenous macrophytes in cw for wastewater treatment because they are more likely to thrive and propagate in a local environment than exotic the substrate or active media is another crucial component of cw that acts as a growing medium for vegetation provides support and stability to plants allows wastewater movement and reduces pollutants through filtration adsorption and sedimentation kadlec and wallace 2009 qomariyah et al 2017 steel slag modified zeolite limestone chitosan clay aggregates activated carbon and blast are some types of substrates that have recently been investigated for the removal of water borne pollutants jiang et al 2019 typically the cw is planted with single species however vymazal 2007 suggested that combined plant species are beneficial than single species calheiros et al 2015 supported the above statement and reported that polyculture was found advantageous rather than monoculture since it could provide a better habitat for biodiversity and effective root biomass distribution similarly using mixed ornamental flowering plants in cws creates an aesthetic look provides economic benefit as well as improves the plant diversity sandoval et al 2019 in contrast few previous studies demonstrated that above ground biomass production and ammonium removal rates in the monoculture system were significantly higher than in the polyculture system zhong et al 2016 such researchers also reveal that fierce competition amongst plant species in the polyculture system may lower the nutrients uptake capacity and growth rate thus there is still a question of whether mixed plant culture is more effective to use or monoculture therefore in order to better understand the functionality of the system further research is required besides wastewater treatment an additional striking feature of cws is the provision of plant biomass which could be utilized for several purposes such as food forage bio fuel medicines and manufacturing of industrial and household goods many studies have debated about the potential and advantages of growing vegetation in cws for example typha species arundo donax cyperus papyrus and phragmites have been served in wastewater treatment as well as in the manufacturing of marketable goods and renewable energy production avellán and gremillion 2019a it was estimated that 1 meter square of cw cultivated with arundo donax can produce up to 1660 l methane via biogas production avellán and gremillion 2019b nevertheless sustainable biomass productivity and treatment capability of plant species in cws are based on their availability local climatic conditions suitability capacity to tolerate influent and harvesting technique wu et al 2015 however some research studies have shown concern about the safety of using wastewater treatment plants for food and pharmacological purposes mateo sagasta et al 2013 stated that the health and environmental risk of wastewater irrigated crops could be reduced by the implementation of guidelines and management framework proposed by the world health organization who some of them are described here in terms of managing wastewater hazard it is restricted to apply fine textured soil or clay that may capture a large number of nutrients reduce microbiological contamination through medication such as anti helminths drug or by maintaining a withholding period between wastewater applications decrease hydraulic loading rate or apply drip irrigation technology in addition select appropriate plants that are less sensitive to metals and toxins and provide profitable yield before using crops for the medicinal and dietary purpose must focus on hygienic practices like washing sterilization and pretreatment who 2006 this multidisciplinary approach compared the performance of hsfcw planted with monoculture and polyculture of four commercial plants collected from different habitat ipomoea aquatica floating macrophyte canna indica garden plant oryza sativa field crop and iris pseudacorus wetland plant for domestic wastewater treatment the mesocosm systems were operated during the summer autumn season according to our study hypothesis different habitat plant species evolve with different morphological and spatial characteristics that define the pollutant uptake capacity and biomass productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and conditions proto type constructed wetland systems were established in the research center at the wuxi campus of southeast university nanjing china wuxi city is located in the north subtropical humid monsoon climatic zone with the highest precipitation 165 mm in the month of july over the course of 30 years 1981 2010 the mean temperature was 16 2 c and the average annual rainfall was 1122 mm zhai yaming et al 2016 there are occasional light intensity thunderstorms which do not affect the treatment performance however the experimental site was completely covered with white polyethylene plastic sheets in order to protect the plants from damage due to thunderstorms and strong winds for this study five hsfcws were installed each hsfcw was rectangular shaped with the same dimensions m of 2 2 0 3 0 4 length width height above the ground surface and having a longitudinal bottom slope of 1 5 towards the outflow the bottom floor was constructed with concrete polyvinyl chloride and coated with epoxy paint to avoid leaching of nutrients all the cw basins were packed similarly with layers of 10 cm coarse gravel 20 40 mm diameter 5 cm fine gravel 15 20 mm diameter 4 cm ceramsite 10 20 mm diameter and 2 cm sand clay 1 3 mm as demonstrated in fig 1 for this experimental setup the hydraulic retention time and hydraulic loading rate of sewage influent were maintained every week at 1 25 days and 0 24 m day 1 respectively the average values of dissolved oxygen do and ph of influent were 6 1 mg l 1 and 6 9 respectively during the experimentation period the minimum and maximum water temperatures ranged from 5 to 25 c 2 2 plantation for experimental treatments seedlings of four divergent plant species were collected from different habitats grown in hsfcws the selection of each plant was made according to their economic significance aesthetic value and purpose of utilization ipomoea aquatica is a vegetable plant and typically growing in water similarly canna indica species are often found in meadows and grown in the garden as an ornamental plant iris pseudacorus is an herbaceous plant and usually found near wetlands ditches and marshes oryza sativa is one of the most cultivated field crops and can be used for many purposes the economic benefits of all experimental plants can be seen in table 1 fifteen seedlings about 12 to 14 cm in height of every plant species were procured from the local market twelve of them were planted 3 cm below the upper surface in treatment hsfcws with a 5 cm m2 equidistant spacing ellis et al 2003 while remaining three seedlings were cultivated equidistantly in a mixed plant wetland cultivation of plants was carried out on 15th july one week before the sewage experiment and later flooded with domestic wastewater to see the effects of wastewater and the environment on plants 2 3 experimental procedure rural sewage was first collected from the university dormitory via a drainage pipe and deposited in the settling tank for the process of sedimentation later pumped into a storage tank and through the inlet chamber supplied to the experimental constructed wetlands for advanced treatment wastewater treatment in each wetland system was continued for the one week duration and then stopped by draining as effluent every week a fresh lot of sewage was introduced into the same cws cultivated with different plant species the inlet and outlet of each cw were kept clear to avoid clogging issues the experiments were continued for over 12 weeks in a natural environment between summer and autumn 23rd july to 22nd october sewage samples from the inlet and outlet points of each cw were drawn for the weekly treatments growth parameters height and weight of each plant species were recorded in the respective cw the average growth rate height and weight of each plant species was based on three sample plant measurements which were selected individually from both monoculture and polyculture wetlands plants shoot height of sample triplicates was noted every month by the meter scale while average weight was determined at the beginning and end of the experiment at the termination of the experiment above ground biomass including withered flowers and leaves of every plant species were harvested separately from monoculture and mp wetlands primarily harvested biomass was thoroughly cleaned with water to remove dust particles air dried for 10 days then weighed to estimate the total biomass yield zhu et al 2010 fresh weight and total biomass yield were measured by electronic balance ohaus 2 4 analytical methods nutrients suspended solids and coliform were determined in the wastewater before and after cws treatment approximately 500 ml of sewage influent and cw treated effluent samples were collected from the inlet and outlet chambers and brought to the lab for analysis all the parameters tp no 3 n cod fc and tss were measured according to the standard methods of water and wastewater treatment apha 2005 while tn and nh4 n analysis procedures follow the guidelines listed in monitoring and analysis method of water and wastewater china 2002 the percentage of efficiency was calculated according to the following equation 1 efficiency c o c i 100 c o where co inflow concentration of pollutants in wastewater ci outflow concentration of pollutants in wastewater the average daily load of pollutants was determined by the multiplication of inflow outflow c with the hydraulic loading rate q according to the equation given below 3 average daily load g day c m 3 s q m day while the total removed rate trr was calculated by subtraction of the average loading rate of outflow lin in sewage by an average daily load of pollutants outflowing lout from hsfcw 4 trr g day lin lout dissolved oxygen do and ph were recorded by the ecosense do200a usa and ecosense ph100a probe usa respectively detailed analytical procedures are given hereunder total nitrogen tn was measured from 3 ml of influent effluent the sample was transferred in a 25 ml colorimetric tube and diluted with 5 ml deionized water then poured 5 ml alkaline persulfate digestion solution sigma aldrich tightly covered and then put into the autoclave at 120 c for 60 minutes later the tube was taken out from the autoclave and retained for some time until it cooled down add 1 ml 1 5m naoh and mixed finally poured into the 10 mm cuvette and determined at 220 275 nm wavelength by spectrophotometer lab tech model 01130201 for data processing a calibration curve was drawn in software ms excel 2010 whereas nitrate nitrogen no3 n was also determined by the spectrophotometer method a 2 ml water sample was pipetted in a 50 ml tube and diluted with 48 ml of deionized water then add 0 1 ml hcl solution and 1 ml nitrate stock solution then mixed thoroughly poured mixed solution in the cuvette and recorded spectrophotometric values at 220 275 nm wavelength ammonium nitrogen nh4 n determination was carried out by nelson s method and spectrophotometric method poured 10 ml influent effluent sample in a colorimetric tube and diluted to the marker an aqueous solution of potassium tartrate knac4h6o6 0 2 ml was mixed in a 10 ml of sample then added 0 2 ml of nessler reagent and retained for 10 minutes after thorough mixing a 3 ml solution was pipetted into a 10 mm quartz cuvette the ammonium content of a mixed solution was recorded at 420 nm wavelength total phosphorus tp was determined by the potassium persulfate digestion method 00665 influent and effluent samples of 25 ml were taken in 50 ml colorimetric tubes individually and added 4 ml potassium persulfate k2s2o8 solution with a 50 g l 1 concentration sigma aldrich wrapped the lid of the colorimetric tube tightly through gauze and digested by putting it into the autoclave at 120 c for 60 minutes after digestion samples were taken out from autoclave cooled at room temperature and diluted with 50 ml deionized water then 1 ml ascorbic acid c6h8o6 with 100 g l 1 conc and 2 ml molybdate solution nh4 6mo7o244h2o was added left the tubes for 15 minutes until the sample s color turned blue later phosphorus contents were measured with a spectrophotometer lab tech model 01130201 at 700 nm wavelength entire data were processed by drawing a calibration curve chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent effluent sample was determined by reflux titrimetric method 5220 c fecal coliform fc was grown on nfc dehydrated medium fisher scientific df0677 17 3 mixed with a rosolic acid solution fisher scientific df3228 09 1 wastewater samples 100 ml were filtered with whatman filter paper 0 2 µm which was placed into the medium loaded petri dish and incubated at 37 c for 24 hours colonies of coliform were recorded on the digital colony counter and mpn was calculated according to the standard procedure total suspended solids tss were determined by the gravimetric method the difference in the initial and final weight of each filter paper was used to calculate tss value by the equation as given below 5 tss mg l w 1 w 2 1000 v ml where w1 initial weight of the filter paper w2 final weight of the filter paper v volume of the wastewater sample average values of data on the removal efficiency of nutrients tn nh4 n no3 n and tp cod tss and fc in different cw treated sewage effluents collected every week were calculated from the original replicate values 2 5 statistical analysis data on plant growth and wastewater parameters were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance anova procedure using statistics 8 1 software statistical differences among treatments of cws with plant species were compared through the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 whereas graphs to compare various plant species treatments for wastewater quality and plant growth parameters recorded during the experiment were drawn by using originlab software 2015 and ms excel correlations r2 were worked out for ph and do against various quality attributes of treatment effluents 3 results 3 1 sewage characteristics characteristics of sewage samples collected weekly from hsfcws influents were determined by measuring ph temperature and fc and analyzing for the contents of do cod tn nh4 n no3 n tp and tss data regarding all these parameters are presented in table 2 throughout the experiment period sewage temperature reduced continuously initially it was higher and declined from 25 to 18 c during the first half 23rd july to 6th september 2017 but remained lower and declined from 18 to 5 c during the second half 7th september to 22nd october 2017 do concentration ranged between 3 0 and 5 0 with an average of 3 9 mg l 1 the ph of rural sewage varied from 6 9 to 7 5 with an average value of 7 2 mean concentrations of pollutants mg l 1 were as tn 27 3 nh 4 n 16 4 no 3 n 6 5 cod 88 2 tp 2 0 and tss 25 while fc was 37 cfu 100 ml concentrations for all the above mentioned pollutant parameters in the effluents were significantly smaller than in the influent due to filtration and uptake by substrate and plants respectively 3 2 nitrogen removal total nitrogen tn concentration in the influent wastewater was 25 5 29 2 mg l 1 among the 12 weeks of sewage loading the amount of tn was significantly reduced by all the plant species within the range of 74 77 the mp and ipomoea aquatica scored the best average tn removal efficiency tnre of 77 and 76 respectively fig 2 while the cws cultivated with other species of plants viz iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa were a slightly low performer with tnre of 74 75 comparatively these results exhibit that ipomoea aquatica and mp had better performance in terms of tn removal efficiency the mean concentration of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in the influent was 14 9 17 9 mg l 1 and after treatment it reduced highly from 85 93 fig 3 the mp appeared as the most resilient cw system achieved the highest ammonium nitrogen removal efficiency anre about 93 whereas ipomoea aquatica iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa results were slightly lower than mp about 91 88 85 and 87 respectively the concentration of nitrate nitrogen no3 n in the influent sewage ranged between 5 3 10 8 mg l 1 average nitrate nitrogen removal efficiency nnre exhibited by different plant species was within the range of 61 81 fig 4 results suggested that mp and ipomoea aquatica played a significant role in no3 n removal of about 81 and 80 respectively contrastingly iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa were in lower positions around 68 61 and 60 respectively 3 3 chemical oxygen demand removal the average concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod in influent was 88 2 mg l 1 and reduced 23 4 37 mg l 1 higher cod removal efficiency codre was obtained by mp and ipomoea aquatica about 73 and 69 whilst iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa achieved 64 63 and 57 respectively average values of cod removal were reported in fig 5 3 4 phosphorus removal the concentration of total phosphorus in the influent wastewater was almost uniform as 1 9 2 2 mg l 1 over the entire study period the highest phosphorus removal efficiency pre was 96 obtained in both mp and ipomoea aquatica fig 6 while the results of other plant species were slightly lower 88 93 as compared to that of ipomea aquatica and mp treatments 3 5 fecal coliform reduction throughout the study period the mean count of fc in the influent sewage was 37 cfu 100 ml fig 7 average fecal coliform removal efficiency fcre achieved by mp iris pseudacorus canna indica oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica were in the descending order of 80 76 69 65 and 62 respectively the mp and iris pseudacorus systems performed relatively better for fc elimination 3 6 suspended solids reduction total suspended solids load in the sewage influents ranged between 19 and 30 mg l 1 after the phytoremediation process of one week the suspended solid removal efficiencies ssre were 78 69 67 67 and 65 through mp canna indica iris pseudacorus oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica respectively fig 8 the mp and canna indica results were relatively better than those given by other plant species cultivated in respective hsfcws 3 7 plants growth attributes tables 3 and 4 display the average growth rate of each plant species during four months from the time of cultivation to harvesting the monocultures of ipomoea aquatica and canna indica exhibited a healthy growth rate similar to the mp wetland in july or at the seedlings transplanting time the monocultures and polyculture of ipomoea aquatica and canna indica reached an average height of 12 14 and 13 15 cm and fresh biomass weight of 20 22 and 32 g respectively similarly in october or at harvesting time the height and weight of both individual and mp increased correspondingly up to 215 and 148 cm and 300 291 and 299 313 g respectively in contrast plants of iris pseudacorus and oryza sativa at the time of their harvesting had approximately 67 70 and 66 70 cm height and around 176 180 and 85 88 g fresh weight comparatively very little difference was observed between the growth rate of the plants either grown individually or in the mixed wetland results suggested that ipomoea aquatica and mp had markedly greater biomass yields of about 3300 and 3200 g m 2 respectively whereas iris pseudacorus and oryza sativa biomass productivity were lower by 2200 and 2000 g m 2 respectively it was also noted that canna indica obtained a maximum height as compared to ipomoea aquatica but produced less biomass yield it might be attributed to the greater vertical growth of thick stems and smaller horizontal distribution characteristics of this species 4 discussion a complete picture of raw sewage influent over time reflects that starting from the summer month of july towards the end of the experiment in the beginning month of winter viz october the contaminants contents increased slightly however the mean daily temperature reduced drastically from 25 to 5 c due to seasonal shift over at the same time the do also decreased from about 5 mg l 1 during the beginning weeks to around 3 mg l 1 towards the end of the experiment the ph did not have a consistent trend although it was slightly higher being 7 5 at the start and 7 3 at the last sampling present data construes that more use of water in summer at the domestic level dilutes the sewage so lowering down the total contents of contaminants as compared to that concentrated during the winter season further at a lower temperature below 6 c during winter the microbial activities slow down resulting in less degradation or removal of nutrients from the sewage zhou et al 2017 in the cw system do is assumed one of the most significant factors for nutrients and organic carbon removal higher values of do in summer could be inferred from the fact that a large amount of water usage creates a high gradient turbulent flow of sewage to dissolve more oxygen with better re aeration potential than does a low gradient in winter xu et al 2017 in this study the ph of sewage effluent rendered negative or no correlation with most of the pollutants removal efficiencies except phosphorus with a very small positive r2 value 0 109 and negative correlation with do 0 336 this negative correlation gives the impression that phosphorus removal is dependent on the concentration of oxygen present in the water it is well known the excess concentration of phosphorus in water bodies may decrease the do level and triggers the eutrophication problem misra and chaturvedi 2016 contrastingly other pollutants r2 values were just the opposite of phosphorus showed a positive correlation with do and negative with ph table 5 it reflects that the residual pollutant load increased as the oxygen consumption is increased predominantly through degradation processes and decreased progressively with the increase of ph level for instance in the case of high organic carbon concentration a greater amount of available oxygen is supplied to the plant s roots where it is used for the organic matter degradation kouki et al 2009 the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle is a complex mechanism where multiple abiotic and biotic factors are involved in the transformation of nh4 no2 n2o and n2 in cws n is typically converted into various chemical forms under aerobic conditions based on the transformation equation nh3 nh4 no2 n no3 n vymazal 2007 however denitrification is an anaerobic process where no3 is ultimately transformed into molecular nitrogen the complete denitrification process can be expressed by this equation no3 no2 no n2o n2 in the current study plants were grown in the hsfcws received an averagely 27 3 mg l 1 concentration of tn from influent and reduced maximally up to 77 in mp followed closely by ipomoea aquatica results indicated that both hsfcws were advantageous in tn reduction may be due to the greater root distribution and high uptake capacity of plant species earlier studies stated that greater n removal rates in planted wetlands could be attributed to the high plant diversity high concentration of do and biomass yield luo et al 2018 additionally a well developed root system provides a large surface area for the establishment of the microbial community and facilitates nitrogen transformation muerdter et al 2020 moreover carbon input and release of root exudates encourage heterotrophic denitrification to support the complete n removal tao 2018 similarly the mixed gravel layer increase mineralization of organic nitrogen and microbial growth in the biofilm together play a leading role in tn removal as well de rozari et al 2018 besides this other important factors which may affect the tn concentration in effluents were do temperature and high salinity which could be decreased by the dehydrogenase activity of nitrite and ammonia oxidizing microbes xu et al 2017 yu et al 2011 stated that more than 90 removal of n was obtained when increased the concentration of do because a high concentration of do may accelerate the ammonification process and nitrifiers activities comparatively mp and ipomoea aquatica attained the highest ammonium removal efficiency which could also be due to the greater adaptability of these plant species in the study area however the present study results were quite better than the other studies where the canna indica and ipomoea aquatica achieved only 52 64 results in nh4 n and tn removal sharma et al 2014 khairalla et al 2016 typically the nitrification process is strongly associated with plant and microorganisms activities several research studies revealed that the excretion of oxygen from plants helps to increase the aerobic niche and soil redox potential boosting the degradation process nitrification and heavy metals sedimentation fahim et al 2020 furthermore leakage of carbon chelating components and antibiotics from roots could increase the denitrification as well as accumulation of phytotoxic elements in vacuoles shelef et al 2013 earlier studies reported that high organic loadings in wastewater may expedite the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria and decrease the available oxygen and nitrification rate saeed and sun 2012 results indicated that mp and ipomoea aquatica presented a relatively higher no3 n removal percentage than iris pseudacorus canna indica and oryza sativa the no3 n removal mechanism in cws could be influenced by several factors such as roots density microbial activity fluctuation in temperature carbon source wetland fillers and plant uptake capacity luo et al 2018 sylla 2020 usually no3 n is assimilated through plants and bacterial activity plant roots release organic exudates and oxygen which support the mechanism of nitrification and denitrification han et al 2019 although every plant requires nutrients for its development however their capacity for consumption and growth rate is different from each other in this study influent contained low concentrations of cod ranged between 75 to 99 mg l 1 as compared to the average standard value of domestic wastewater 300 mg l 1 metcalf eddy inc 2003 small cod concentration in influent could be the result of effective primary treatment and low concentration of organic matter in the raw sewage collected from the university dormitory considering the cod removal the roots of plants and microbes are of great significance transferring oxygen from plants arenchymatic tissues to roots may enhance the activities of heterotrophic bacteria to facilitate organic matter degradation it is well documented that cod is primarily removed by anaerobic microbes along with aerobic metabolism at the surface of the gravels and near to the roots kouki et al 2009 another study reported that microbiological indicators such as fungi and bacteria are responsible for organic carbon degradation rashid et al 2016 nonetheless the ability to release greater oxygen varies among species depending on plant physiology anatomy and morphology in the current study mp and ipomoea aquatica had significantly high 73 and 69 cod removal efficiencies that might be positively linked with the high oxygen distribution to the root zone in contrast low cod removal was delivered by oryza sativa probably due to the less supply of do near the rhizosphere previous studies demonstrated that a distinct distribution of do could considerably improve organic carbon degradation ilyas and masih 2017 in the present work cod removal efficiencies were significantly high as compared to previous studies khairalla et al 2016 conducted similar research using ipomoea aquatica for domestic wastewater treatment and obtained 56 of cod removal in the same context cw planted with different ornamental plants reduced up to 40 60 of cod from sewage burgos et al 2017 the cws provide an environment where inter conversion of all forms of phosphorus takes place either organic or inorganic the physicochemical transformation of phosphorus mainly occurs by plant uptake sorption sedimentation precipitation and desorption abou elela and hellal 2012 usually the plant consumes phosphorus through roots and utilizes them for their growth and nourishment in this study we found multiple plantations efficiently reduced tp concentration than a single plant which might occur due to the following reasons described by geng et al 2017 such as a large number of shoots and biomass ipomoea aquatica broadened leaves and fibrous root structure canna indica and sturdy arenchema tissues to support aerobic degradation it indicates the uptake capacity of every plant is different and a combination of different species may improve the p recovery vymazal 2007 reported that plants have a considerable impact on phosphorus removal particularly in tropical countries however it predominantly defines by plants genera alternatively substrates and matrix also have an immense effect on phosphorus removal reduce effectively through the mechanisms of adsorption and sedimentation yu et al 2011 luo et al 2017 total phosphorus is typically divided into organic phosphorus and particulate phosphorus organic phosphorus is converted into mineral phosphorus by microbial activity and assimilated by plants while particulate phosphorus is usually removed by the processes of filtration and sorption through roots and substrate kouki et al 2009 it was evident in this study each hf contained the same substrate but the rate of pollutant reduction was different from each other it could be due to the plant species uptake capacity and adsorption mechanisms during this study mean removal efficiencies for fc were variable compared with other plants mp and iris pseudacorus rendered significantly higher results as compared to the canna indica oryza sativa and ipomoea aquatica among them ipomoea aquatica showed the worse results with considerable variations decamp warren 1998 stated that some plant species possess antibacterial properties and secrete chemical substances or metabolites which help to eliminate the microbes furthermore fc concentration could also be affected by shifts in temperature zheng et al 2016 demonstrated that the diminished growth rate and low metabolic activity of coliforms were observed when the weather changed from summer to winter moreover the small grain size of filter media and the presence of active predator microorganisms may boost up the fc inactivation flemming et al 2016 although we didn t determine the substrate s diameter and other microbes existence but mentioned here as a possible reason for fc removal greater tss reduction was achieved by mp and canna indica the removal efficiency of tss principally depends on phytofiltration sedimentation microbial adhesion and extensive rooting biomass mahmood et al 2016 arora et al 2016 sub surface flow constructed wetland ssfcw is a stable biofilm reactor in which sedimentation and filtration mechanisms operate through accumulation and retention of suspended particles between the voids of filter media and plant roots while organic particles are oxidized by the conversion of organic particles into humic substances in both aerobic and anoxic conditions arora et al 2014 moreover filter media holds small pores that may easily trap the organic matter and provide prevention from clogging chen et al 2013b during the whole study period a higher removal load kg 1 d was obtained by ipomoea aquatica particularly in nutrients removal whereas canna indica was good in tss removal although the hsfcw system encouraged all the four plant species to achieve maximum growth rate either grown individually or in the mixed wetland nevertheless ipomoea aquatica and canna indica height were greater than others predominantly due to the species specific growth rate and suitable temperature of 10 25 c accessibility to essential nutrients microbial and organic amendments from wastewater trivedi et al 2017 furthermore mp wetland displayed a little lower growth values than the monoculture system though the difference was very small we hypothesized that the invasive growth of some plants could be a possible hindrance in the way of other plant development according to liang et al 2011 competition amongst plant species in mixed plant wetlands may affect the plant s stability performance and growth generally all the tested plant species were suitable for cw wastewater treatment it was observed that plants in cws quickly produce high biomass yield therefore to avoid the internal loading of nutrients from decaying plants it is recommended to harvest plants before die off geng et al 2017 nevertheless harvested biomass could be utilized for several economical purposes including green fuel medicines fodder or in industries for papermaking avellán and gremillion 2019a thus the current study demonstrates the cw is a reliable treatment method and the system s efficiency could be further increased by the implementation of some strategies such as special attention should be paid in the selection of two crucial components of cw plants and substrate gorgoglione and torretta 2018 choose highly porous filter media plants with a well developed root system and add earthworms to prevent cw clogging maintain hydraulic flow and retention as too much or too little flow can be harmful to plant growth and survival in case of low temperature it is recommended to grow cold resistant terrestrial plants instead of seasonal herbaceous plants effluent quality could be further enhanced by the application of modified cw such as microbial fuel cell cw baffled subsurface flow cw and circular flow corridor cw wu et al 2014 results indicated that both monoculture and polyculture systems have shown efficient pollutant removal as well as good adaptation nevertheless mixed plants cw are more resilient than single plant cws furthermore mp efficiently reduced the average daily pollutant load and achieved the maximum total removed rate table 6 7 it is well known that every plant species preserves different physical and morphological characteristics therefore it could be expected the better removal rates in the polyculture system might be associated with the well developed root system of divergent plant species their redox potential and uptake capacity it has been reported in earlier studies mixed plant cultures may accelerate the release of oxygen which could boost up the uptake of organic matter and nitrogenous compounds canarini et al 2019 furthermore effective roots distribution in mixed plant wetlands may provide shelter for microbial communities and promote the nitrification and denitrification process calheiros et al 2015 besides wastewater treatment the polyculture system also possesses several other benefits such as provides aesthetic looks and high biodiversity marín muñiz et al 2020 4 1 effects of climatic conditions on pollutants removal constructed wetland system is one of the most popular non conventional techniques which is widely used to treat several kinds of wastewater at different climatic conditions over the entire experimental period the air temperature was recorded at 29 5 c fig 9 although both monoculture and mixed plant wetlands showed efficient removal percentages throughout the experiment however slight declination was observed at the beginning of the winter season or during september results indicated that the removal efficiency of all parameters was significantly high in the warmest period albuquerque et al 2009 also conducted a study on climatic conditions in a similar system and reported that during the spring summer season removal efficiencies of tn nh4 n and no3 n was 86 89 and 80 respectively and gradually decreased throughout autumn winter season the highest removal of tn and nh4 n during the summer season might be linked with the high uptake of nutrients additionally high evapotranspiration rates in the summer spring season mediate the changes in water level which contribute to enhance the redox potential values and facilitate the process of nitrification pedescoll et al 2011 in contrast a reduction in efficiency was observed during autumn attributed to the slower activity of nitrifying bacteria or high hydraulic flushing through wetland beds during precipitation silveira et al 2015 therefore in the light of all findings it is proved that low temperature is non conducive for wastewater nitrogen removal seasonal changes may increase or decrease the cod removal efficiency taylor et al 2011 observed the variation in cod removal when the weather shifted from warm to cold season the high temperatures permit the plant to supply more oxygen and carbon exudate near the root zone which may enhance microbial activity within the rhizosphere faulwetter et al 2009 in the present work a slight reduction in cod removal was detected in the mid of october that might be attributed to the greater variability in temperature thus it could be assumed that a high temperature is favorable for organic matter degradation the average tp removal efficiency was higher in the warm season more or less 96 however a decrease in removal rate was observed during the 11th to 12th weeks which may occur probably due to the lower temperature of about 8 5 c in another study gradual declination in tp removal efficiency was detected which might be primarily related to the type of filter media climatic conditions and different vegetation mesquita et al 2017 whereas no obvious tp removal effects were observed at 7 25 c but when the operation temperature increase to 33 c the effluents showed a sharp inclination in tp concentration zhang et al 2011 justified that the soil matrix could be influenced by high temperature and subsequently release the tp climate has a significant impact on microbial growth and removal as can be noted that removal efficiency was rose between 25 18 c most probably in summer and completely declined when the temperature reached 5 c the high fecal streptococcal removal percentage in surface flow wetlands was achieved in summer as compared to winter reinoso et al 2008 moreover another study demonstrated that about 91 98 reduction in fecal coliform concentration was observed during the summer rainy season makvana and sharma 2013 these studies proposed that a constructed wetland system is more suitable for coliform removal in the summer season 5 conclusion this study mainly aimed to reduce the load of nutrients cod tss and coliform from the rural sewage in a sustainable manner through phytoremediation for this purpose four divergent commercial plants were selected and grown in cws as monocultures and polyculture all findings revealed that mp and monoculture of ipomoea aquatica showed high tolerance to sewage treatment particularly for nutrients and cod removal only tss and fc removal efficiencies were influenced by the canna indica and iris pseudacorus in monoculture arrangements a slight decline in the pollutant removal rate was observed when the season shifted from summer to autumn in the present study all plant species exhibited an optimum growth rate throughout the experiment either planted as monocultures or polyculture in cws particularly ipomoea aquatica and mp achieved higher biomass yield about 3300 g m2 and 3200 g m2 respectively the above findings validate the impression that hsfcw cultivated with mixed plantation is the best option for sewage treatment as well as biomass production however the selection of appropriate plants is

992,the article deals with risk assessment of mass development of a toxic dinoflagellate species prorocentrum cordatum prorocentrales dinophyceae in various regions of the black sea by applying ecological niche modeling niche modeling was developed using the maxent algorithm the maxent model training was based on the data of p cordatum general distribution according to the gbif source along with the data on 8 environmental variables retrieved from the bio oracle database quality evaluation of the obtained model was executed with the values of auc statistics and relative contribution of selected environmental variables to the model was also estimated in order to additionally assess the applicability of the model analyses of literature data from 1886 through 2020 together with original data on the distribution of p cordatum in the black sea from 1986 to 2020 were carried out response curves of environmental variables with the highest permutation importance are given map projections of maxent habitats suitability scores for p cordatum in the black sea area are presented according to our estimates about 16 percents of the whole black sea area are in the high or very high risk zone of p cordatum mass outbreaks maximum values of predicted suitability were obtained for the northwestern part of the black sea while in other regions of the sea they coincided with location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication and further distribution of polluted waters by currents the proposed mathematical model can be used to predict the appearance and mass

with diatoms provide most of the primary productivity of marine ecosystems graham and wilcox 2000 dinoflagellates remove excessive amounts of organic nutrients thus purifying the water and serve as indicators of the ecological status of marine environment the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec and the marine strategy framework directive directive 2008 56 ec of the european union as well as the black sea commission strategic action plan sap 2009 refer to phytoplankton as an important biological component to be addressed in the assessment of the ecological status of the sea moncheva et al 2019 up to date more than 1500 species of marine planktonic dinoflagellates are identified gómez 2005 420 of them 447 including infraspecific taxa are recorded in the black sea so far morozova vodyanitskaya 1948 1954 kiselev 1950 krakhmalnyi 1994 gómez and boicenco 2004 terenko 2007 krakhmalnyi et al 2018 according to modern data more than 80 species of marine dinoflagellates produce toxins that are harmful to animals and humans hallegraeff 2003 twenty three species of toxic and potentially toxic dinoflagellates were found in the black sea ryabushko 2003 vershinin et al

food originated from the regions of the sea where toxic species develop but even exposure to the water or close proximity to the seashore near the zone of harmful bloom could pose a threat to human health anderson et al 2012 in order to prevent habs and minimize their negative consequences on marine ecosystems regular monitoring of marine environment is necessary andersen et al 2003 smayada 2003

ostenfeld dodge a toxic species of dinoflagellates widely distributed in different parts of the world ocean faust and gulledge 2002 taylor et al 2003 was chosen as a model object for the current study while the black sea was selected as a region for modeling 1 1 study area the black sea is an inland sea belonging to the atlantic ocean basin the western and northwestern regions of the sea border europe while the eastern and southern parts with asia the black sea is surrounded by six countries russia georgia turkey bulgaria romania and ukraine in the northeast the black sea is connected with the sea of azov by the shallow kerch strait and in the southwest it communicates through the bosphorus with the sea of marmara and further through the dardanelles with the aegean and mediterranean seas the area of the black sea is 436 402 km2 and its volume is around 555 000 km3 the maximum depth of the sea is 2212 2245 m the salinity in the surface layer of water is minimal in the northwestern part of the sea 5 10 where the main volume of fresh river water flows near the bosphorus at the bottom the salinity can reach 30 at depths below 150 200 m oxygen is absent in the water while dissolved hydrogen sulfide is present instead the shelf borders the sea in the form of a narrow strip in the south and east and only in the northwest the shelf expands to 200 km sorokin 1982 2002 the black sea spans two climatic zones temperate and subtropical while the sea of azov lies in a temperate zone water temperature in the black sea varies in a wide range from water freezing numbers in the coastal zone of the northern part of the sea 0 97 с at the salinity value of 18 psu to 28 29 с during maximum summer heating these seasonal fluctuations are especially prominent in the northwestern part of the sea average surface temperature of the black sea is 14 87 с while in the upper layer 0 300 m it drops to 8 81 с average water temperature over the entire volume of the sea is 8 96 c spatial distribution of nitrates in the black sea is characterized by their smallest concentrations in the central regions of the sea less than 1 μmol l and highest in coastal areas up to 4 5 µmol l maximum values are registered in the regions adjacent to the mouths of the danube river and other rivers of the northwestern shelf where active supply of the nitrogen with coastal runoff is observed elevated concentrations of both phosphates and nitrates are registered in coastal and pre estuarine areas of the northwestern shelf and the kerch area mokievskij et al 2019 the greatest contribution to the eutrophication of the black sea is made by large rivers flowing into the sea the danube the dniester the dnieper and the don through the sea of azov and the kerch strait agricultural and industrial activities and big coastal cities a significant negative impact is exerted by contaminated storm drains shipping fisheries extraction of mineral resources recreation and tourism zaitsev et al 1989 zaitsev 1998 mokievskij et al 2019 introduction of new species with ships ballast water is facilitating the spread of harmful microalgae in the black sea all these unfavorable processes contribute to the emergence and mass development of harmful microalgae in the black sea yasakova 2011a rata et al 2018 wasmund et al 2019 mikaelyan et al 2020 1 2 species characteristics and taxonomic concept prorocentrum cordatum is a cosmopolitan marine species it is distributed in temperate zones tropical and polar regions occurs in all seasons of the year prorocentrum cordatum reaches large abundances in warm eutrophicated waters and sometimes causes habs heil et al 2005 the species is common in coastal areas in river mouths i e areas with low salinity hajdu et al 2000 and high levels of nutrients schiller 1933 dodge 1982 steidinger and tangen 1997 krakhmalnyi 2011 prorocentrum cordatum is an easily identifiable species therefore references of its findings in the literature are fairly reliable which is important for the mathematical model two taxonomic names of this species are still in use prorocentrum cordatum and p minimum pavillard schiller however velikova and larsen 1999 convincingly proved their identity and validity of the first name according to the priority rule p cordatum was described 14 years earlier as exuviaella cordata ostenfeld 1902 134 than p minimum as exuviaella minima pavillard 1916 11 later on this conclusion received additional support krakhmalnyi et al 2004 the morphological features of p cordatum are shown in fig 1 prorocentrum cordatum has a high growth rate which is explained by the autotrophic and mixotrophic strategies of the species this duality gives p cordatum great advantages over other species that do not use organic substances stoecker et al 1997 burkholder et al 2008 prorocentrum cordatum is often described as the causative organism of poisonings occurred after ingesting oysters and short necked clams taylor et al 2003 or so called venerupin shellfish poisonings vsp hégaret et al 2009 venerupin is the name of a toxic substance which had been isolated from shellfish after a mass poisoning event in japan and demonstrated hepatotoxicity akiba and hattori 1949 later the toxicity of shellfish was attributed to the abundance of p cordatum in the seawater nakazima 1968 however the chemical properties of venerupin have not been elucidated and the role of p cordatum in vsp remained under question hashimoto 1979 okaichi and imatomi 1979 extracted two substances from a culture of p cordatum showing toxicity in mice while failing to detect venerupin the study of grzebyk et al 1997 revealed a high neurotoxic activity of extracts from some p cordatum cultures in mice thus it is still important to monitor shellfish toxicity in case a bloom of p cordatum affects areas of shellfish aquaculture and collection taylor et al 2003 in coastal areas p cordatum forms extensive blooming zones which severely aggravates the ecological status ignatiades and gotsis skretas 2010 high concentrations of toxic substances produced during the bloom of p cordatum along with the lack of oxygen due to decomposition of organics are detrimental to aquatic organisms fig 2 1 3 analysis of literature data on the species distribution in the study region the first record of p cordatum in the black sea dates back to 1948 morozova vodyanitskaya 1948 over the course of time the number of findings of this species in the sea has been steadily increasing since the 1970s p cordatum has become one of the most numerous and widely distributed species in the black sea coastal and shelf waters often reaching large numbers and causing habs at present it is the most frequently mentioned dinoflagellate species in publications dealing with the black sea krakhmalnyi et al 2018 the highest number of records of p cordatum was registered for the northwestern part of the sea nesterova 1979 1980 1985 1986 1987 1998 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 derezyuk et al 2017 2018 which is experiencing greater anthropogenic pressure zaytsev 1998 it is the northwestern part of the sea where cases of mass development of p cordatum were registered skolka and gautis 1969 nesterova 1979 1985 nesterova et al 2008 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 derezyuk et al 2017 most frequently p cordatum was found in the coastal waters of ukraine pitsyk 1950 1979 ivanov 1959 1960 1965 nesterova 1979 1980 1985 1986 1987 1998 2001 2003 a b nezlin and zernova 1983 senichkina 1983 eker 1998 zaitsev and alexandrov 1998 terenko and terenko 2000 terenko 2005 2007 nesterova et al 2006 dereziuk 2008 nesterova and terenko 2009 derezyuk et al 2017 multiple records of p cordatum originate from the crimean coast stroikina 1950 morozova vodyanitskaya 1948 1954 prokudina 1952 senicheva 1971 2008 senichkina 1973 polikarpov et al 2003 bryantseva et al 2016 zaremba 2011 2013 which is most likely due to a large number of studies in this part of the black sea a lot of findings were reported from the coasts of romania and bulgaria petrova 1957 1963 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 skolka and roban 1989 bodeanu and ruta 1994 1995 petranu 1997 konsulov 1998 velikova 1998 velikova et al 1999 moncheva et al 2001a 2001b velikova et al 2005 nesterova et al 2008 moncheva 2010 klisarova et al 2015 less frequently p cordatum was found in the southern cost of turkey skolka and bodeanu 1963 georgieva 1969 eker 1998 öztürk 1999 türkoğlu and koray 2002 tas and okus 2006 özdemyr and ak 2012 feyzioğlu and şahin 2017 northeastern and eastern parts of the black sea the caucasian coast of russia vershinin et al 2005 manzhos 2008 yasakova 2011a b 2013 and georgia komakhidze and mazmanidi 1998 nesterova et al 2008 respectively although the total anthropogenic load on the ecosystem of the black sea has decreased over the past decades oguz and velikova 2010 boicenco et al 2019 a steady increase in both species diversity and the abundance of some toxic dinoflagellates is still observed the global distribution of p cordatum is expected to expand given predictions that nutrients flow to water bodies will more than double by 2050 as a result of anthropogenic activities glibert et al 2008 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental variables environmental variables data were gathered from the public database bio oracle ver 2 0 assis et al 2018 the data were available in geotiff format and with global scale coverage at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin approximately 9 2 km at the equator eight variables were selected including indicators of temperature salinity current velocity and nutrients table 1 these were chosen based on their physiological importance for marine species used data covers recent time period 2000 2014 and are based on annual averages environmental layers representing temperature and salinity were accounted for as two separate metrics the annual mean and the annual range range of the minimum and maximum records per year given that the range of environmental variables is important since sometimes amplitudes and minimum values could be limiting the distribution of the species all mentioned variables relate to the surface of the sea 2 2 occurrence data data on the distribution of p cordatum were taken from the open resource the gbif source gbif org 2020 and span the world ocean preparing occurrence data for enm necessarily includes sampling bias correction kramer schadt et al 2013 fourcade et al 2014 derville et al 2018 it represents a set of techniques aimed at reducing the influence of noise factors that are not related to the ecological niche concept on the final model in particular dealing with the unevenness of area coverage filtering suspicious records etc the data were cleaned on two stages firstly the data cleaning was performed at the level of the gbif source by excluding from the downloading process the data that are flagged as fossil specimens or have an unknown basis of record due to the low reliability of such records secondly data cleaning included the geographical thinning of records in order to reduce the impact of uneven spatial area coverage for this purpose within grid sizes of 2 2 degrees only 1 record per cell was left and used in further training as a result the number of points was reduced while maintaining the former overall geographical pattern thus 219 of the total 7171 points were used for further processing 2 3 ecological niche modeling in order to build the current habitat suitability model the maximum entropy method maxent was used phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 among other ecological niche modeling techniques maxent was selected because of its various advantages the input species data can be presence only even with incomplete data prediction accuracy is reliable habitat suitability map can be directly produced the importance of individual variables can be evaluated using built in tests elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 yi et al 2016 when creating maxent probability models train and predict functions available within the sdmtune package in r were used vignali et al 2019 this package is both a wrapper that controls the main maxent jar file as well as a set of functions for post processing the outputs and plotting to train the model sightings of p cordatum were accounted within the entire world ocean and then the model was projected onto the black sea this was motivated by the fact that while creating the model it was necessary to take into account the overall range of the tolerance of p cordatum to the factors involved in the analysis the quality of the resulting model was evaluated by auc statistics area under roc or receiver operating characteristic curve hanley and mcneil 1982 a subset of records 20 was used as testing data and the remaining was used as training data and auc estimates were obtained separately for training and testing data phillips et al 2006 the larger the auc is the better the model performance is the choice of the auc measure was motivated because it is not dependent on the selection of threshold vanagas 2004 in order to make an additional assessment of the obtained mathematical model applicability for the black sea literature data from 1886 through 2020 on the occurrence of p cordatum along with the original data collected by the authors of the present study 1986 2020 were used the original materials were collected in the following regions of the black sea the danube river estuary 1986 the dniester firth area and the odessa coast 1986 1998 2002 2008 2020 the sevastopol coast 1991 2008 2016 and the strait of kerch 2003 2006 2009 generally accepted hydrobiological sampling methods were used fedorov 1979 plankton nets and 1l plastic bottles were used to collect dinoflagellate samples water samples were fixed with 40 solution of neutralized formaldehyde with the final concentration of 4 the identification of dinoflagellates was performed by the means of light and scanning electron microscopy to assess the relative contribution of variables the permutation importance indicator was chosen since it depends only on the final model and does not depend on the path that the algorithm has taken phillips et al 2006 the response of the species to the environment variables involved in the analysis was carried out using the response curves that are a part of maxent s outputs response curves show the relationship between environmental variables and the habitat suitability and they help to better understand the ecological niche of the species hirzel and le lay 2008 elith et al 2011 post processing of maxent outputs was performed in the r statistical environment https cran r project org to build roc curve and response curves we used the package sdmtune vignali et al 2019 for raster manipulation the raster package hijmans 2019 аnd for building maps the tmap package tennekes 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance and variables permutation importance the auc values of training data set and test data sets were 0 83 and 0 79 respectively fig 3 auc closest to a value of 1 would be a perfect model and auc 0 5 would indicate the low performance which is no better than random therefore the model is classified as satisfactory in particular as fair 0 7 0 8 for the test data set and good 0 8 0 9 for the training data set swets 1988 the permutation importance plot of the environmental variables contribution in the maxent model sorted by permutation importance scores indicates the predominant contribution of four variables namely nitrate phosphate temperature mean and temperature range fig 4 nitrate concentration demonstrated the highest permutation importance score with temperature range temperature mean and phosphate concentration following it respectively current velocity salinity and silicates did not show significant effect on the distribution of the species their permutation importance was less than 5 3 2 response curves to environmental variables the relation to temperature curve fig 5 a is bell shaped and waters with a temperature of 10 15 с are optimal for the development of p cordatum which corresponds to ocean waters of temperate latitudes at the same time suitability estimates are maintained at a fairly high level even at higher temperatures up to about 25 c the response curve to temperature amplitude fig 5 b indicates a high tolerance of the species for this variable this gives the species significant competitive advantages since it can spread not only in tropical waters with a stable temperature regime but also in waters where significant temperature fluctuations are observed during the year for example the black sea and the baltic sea with respect to phosphate and nitrate factors there is a general upward trend in predicted suitability with an increase in the concentration of these biogens fig 5 c d this agrees with the notion that mass development of toxic algae is associated with marine pollution and eutrophication hajdu et al 2005 livingston 2007 pednekar et al 2012 sahraoui et al 2013 3 3 maxent probability map the projection of suitability values according to the data of the maxent cloglog output reflects a general relationship with the degree of water pollution in the black sea the highest suitability values are observed in the northwestern part of the sea and in the odessa bay fig 6 large industrial cities that are sources of pollution in particular odessa nikolaev kherson are located here fig 7 the trend continues to the south and includes the west coast especially within ukraine partially bulgaria and to a lesser extent turkey even taking into account relatively smaller number of pollution sources in this region this can be explained by the spread of contaminated waters with the sea currents therefore in this part of the water area there is the highest risk of p cordatum outbreak along the eastern coast one can clearly observe two spots in the area of the large cities of novorossiysk and batumi since the depths along the caucasian coast in this part of the black sea are substantial starting from the coast the high suitability zones for p cordatum are relatively close to the coast while the central part is blue colored which corresponds to low values of the maxent probabilities a spot radiates into the open sea in the area of novorossiysk this is explained by the northern and western directions of currents prevailing in this part of the black sea towards the crimean peninsula as for the turkish coast the predicted suitability values here are much lower mostly less than 0 4 with the exception of the istanbul area this is due to the absence of large industrial and or urban centers that could become sources of substantial pollution along the predominant part of the turkish coast and narrow shelf zone in the bosphorus strait the suitability values slightly increase to approximately 0 6 possibly as a result of the introduction of polluted waters with currents from the west coast in the sea of azov the predicted suitability for p cordatum is relatively low except for a small area near genichesk the lack of a spot in the area of mariupol a large industrial city could be explained in particular by the fact that the smallest salinity values are observed at the mouth of the don optimal conditions for the development of p cordatum are 15 35 grzebyk and berland 1996 salinity in the sea of azov increases towards the center and south in the direction of the kerch strait the map fig 6 also shows p cordatum findings which the authors compiled from the literature see section 1 3 and original data it is important to note that these points were not used at the model training stage i e they can be used to judge the predictive power of the model visually they are in good agreement with the predicted model since most of the findings are concentrated in the northwestern part of the sea where the model showed high suitability values the only exception is the crimean coast where a large number of p cordatum findings in comparison to relatively low levels of nutrients in the marine environment could be explained primarily by a large number of studies carried out by the researchers of the institute of biology of the southern seas sevastopol in general the pattern of predicted suitability values for p cordatum in the black sea correlates well with the location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication further redistribution of polluted waters is affected by the sea currents patterns which is especially noticeable from the odessa bay in the direction of the coast of romania and bulgaria and from novorossiysk in the direction of the crimean peninsula according to the classified habitat suitability raster fig 6 about 16 of the black sea and the sea of azov areas are in the high or very high risk zone of p cordatum outbreaks which is a very significant indicator table 2 the total area of the 4th and 5th class suitability zones is more than 73 thousand km2 which may become unsuitable for fish and other marine organisms due to a mass development of p cordatum 4 conclusions the ecological niche modeling method is promising for predicting areas of possible mass development of toxic dinoflagellates species the obtained mathematical model demonstrated that suitability zones for p cordatum in the black sea turned out to be much larger than it could have been concluded based solely on the registered findings a significant influence of biogenes especially nitrates on the distribution of this species was confirmed which is in a good agreement with the concept of p cordatum as an indicator of polluted seawater the maximum predicted suitability value for the black sea is observed in its northwestern part and in other parts it coincides with the location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication and further distribution of polluted waters by the sea currents the experience of using the maxent algorithm in the case of p cordatum for predicting areas of possible mass development of this toxic species has demonstrated a high predictive power and the proposed model is supported by literature and original data gathered by the authors of the current research in addition this approach is of a particular importance in terms of assessing those toxic species that have not been found in the black sea yet but whose risk of invasion is high due to suitable environment conditions the disadvantages of the current approach include the inability to take into account the abundance and biomass population factors and interspecific interactions seasonal dynamics etc but even despite this the ecological niche modeling method is very promising with regard to forecasting which is extremely relevant for toxic species where preventive measures are of particular importance moreover given a relative simplicity and low labor costs compared to more expensive and time consuming methods including qpcr it also allows to analyze factors that contribute to or limit the development of certain toxic species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

992,the article deals with risk assessment of mass development of a toxic dinoflagellate species prorocentrum cordatum prorocentrales dinophyceae in various regions of the black sea by applying ecological niche modeling niche modeling was developed using the maxent algorithm the maxent model training was based on the data of p cordatum general distribution according to the gbif source along with the data on 8 environmental variables retrieved from the bio oracle database quality evaluation of the obtained model was executed with the values of auc statistics and relative contribution of selected environmental variables to the model was also estimated in order to additionally assess the applicability of the model analyses of literature data from 1886 through 2020 together with original data on the distribution of p cordatum in the black sea from 1986 to 2020 were carried out response curves of environmental variables with the highest permutation importance are given map projections of maxent habitats suitability scores for p cordatum in the black sea area are presented according to our estimates about 16 percents of the whole black sea area are in the high or very high risk zone of p cordatum mass outbreaks maximum values of predicted suitability were obtained for the northwestern part of the black sea while in other regions of the sea they coincided with location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication and further distribution of polluted waters by currents the proposed mathematical model can be used to predict the appearance and mass development of other toxic species keywords ecological niche modeling maxent dinoflagellata algal blooms prorocentrum cordatum the black sea 1 introduction it is well known that dinoflagellates along with diatoms provide most of the primary productivity of marine ecosystems graham and wilcox 2000 dinoflagellates remove excessive amounts of organic nutrients thus purifying the water and serve as indicators of the ecological status of marine environment the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec and the marine strategy framework directive directive 2008 56 ec of the european union as well as the black sea commission strategic action plan sap 2009 refer to phytoplankton as an important biological component to be addressed in the assessment of the ecological status of the sea moncheva et al 2019 up to date more than 1500 species of marine planktonic dinoflagellates are identified gómez 2005 420 of them 447 including infraspecific taxa are recorded in the black sea so far

produce toxins that are harmful to animals and humans hallegraeff 2003 twenty three species of toxic and potentially toxic dinoflagellates were found in the black sea ryabushko 2003 vershinin et al 2005 krakhmalnyi et al 2018 mass development of toxic species of dinoflagellates is particularly dangerous causing the death of animals in the zone of harmful algal bloom hab orlova 2005 not only the food originated from the regions of the sea where toxic species develop but even exposure to the water or close proximity to the seashore near the zone of harmful bloom could pose a threat to human health anderson et al 2012 in order to prevent habs and minimize their negative consequences on marine ecosystems regular monitoring of marine environment is necessary andersen et al 2003 smayada 2003

causes harmful algal blooms as well as forecasting areas where mass development of such species would most likely take place along with detection of factors contributing to this prorocentrum cordatum ostenfeld dodge a toxic species of dinoflagellates widely distributed in different parts of the world ocean faust and gulledge 2002 taylor et al 2003 was chosen as a model object for the current study while the black sea was selected as a region for modeling 1 1 study area the black sea is an inland sea belonging to the atlantic ocean basin the western and northwestern regions of the sea border europe while the eastern and southern parts with asia the black sea is surrounded by six countries russia georgia turkey bulgaria romania and ukraine in the northeast the black sea is connected with the sea of azov by the shallow kerch strait and in the southwest it communicates through the bosphorus with the sea of marmara and further through the dardanelles with the aegean and mediterranean seas the area of the black sea is 436 402 km2 and its volume is around 555 000 km3 the maximum depth of the sea is 2212 2245 m the salinity in the surface layer of water is minimal in the northwestern part of the sea 5 10 where the main volume of fresh river water flows near the bosphorus at the bottom the salinity can reach 30 at depths below 150 200 m oxygen is absent in the water while dissolved hydrogen sulfide is present instead the shelf borders the sea in the form of a narrow strip in the south and east and only in the northwest the shelf expands to 200 km sorokin 1982 2002 the black sea spans two climatic zones temperate and subtropical while the sea of azov lies in a temperate zone water temperature in the black sea varies in a wide range from water freezing numbers in the coastal zone of the northern part of the sea 0 97 с at the salinity value of 18 psu to 28 29 с during maximum summer heating these seasonal fluctuations are especially prominent in the northwestern part of the sea average surface temperature of the black sea is 14 87 с while in the upper layer 0 300 m it drops to 8 81 с average water temperature over the entire volume of the sea is 8 96 c spatial distribution of nitrates in the black sea is characterized by their smallest concentrations in the central regions of the sea less than 1 μmol l and highest in coastal areas up to 4 5 µmol l maximum values are registered in the regions adjacent to the mouths of the danube river and other rivers of the northwestern shelf where active supply of the nitrogen with coastal runoff is observed elevated concentrations of both phosphates and nitrates are registered in coastal and pre estuarine areas of the northwestern shelf and the kerch area mokievskij et al 2019 the greatest contribution to the eutrophication of the black sea is made by large rivers flowing into the sea the danube the dniester the dnieper and the don through the sea of azov and the kerch strait agricultural and industrial activities and big coastal cities a significant negative impact is exerted by contaminated storm drains shipping fisheries extraction of mineral resources recreation and tourism zaitsev et al 1989 zaitsev 1998 mokievskij et al 2019 introduction of new species with ships ballast water is facilitating the spread of harmful microalgae in the black sea all these unfavorable processes contribute to the emergence and mass development of harmful microalgae in the black sea yasakova 2011a rata et al 2018 wasmund et al 2019 mikaelyan et al 2020 1 2 species characteristics and taxonomic concept prorocentrum cordatum is a cosmopolitan marine species it is distributed in temperate zones tropical and polar regions occurs in all seasons of the year prorocentrum cordatum reaches large abundances in warm eutrophicated waters and sometimes causes habs heil et al 2005 the species is common in coastal areas in river mouths i e areas with low salinity hajdu et al 2000 and high levels of nutrients schiller 1933 dodge 1982 steidinger and tangen 1997 krakhmalnyi 2011 prorocentrum cordatum is an easily identifiable species therefore references of its findings in the literature are fairly reliable which is important for the mathematical model two taxonomic names of this species are still in use prorocentrum cordatum and p minimum pavillard schiller however velikova and larsen 1999 convincingly proved their identity and validity of the first name according to the priority rule p cordatum was described 14 years earlier as exuviaella cordata ostenfeld 1902 134 than p minimum as exuviaella minima pavillard 1916 11 later on this conclusion received additional support krakhmalnyi et al 2004 the morphological features of p cordatum are shown in fig 1 prorocentrum cordatum has a high growth rate which is explained by the autotrophic and mixotrophic strategies of the species this duality gives p cordatum great advantages over other species that do not use organic substances stoecker et al 1997 burkholder et al 2008 prorocentrum cordatum is often described as the causative organism of poisonings occurred after ingesting oysters and short necked clams taylor et al 2003 or so called venerupin shellfish poisonings vsp hégaret et al 2009 venerupin is the name of a toxic substance which had been isolated from shellfish after a mass poisoning event in japan and demonstrated hepatotoxicity akiba and hattori 1949 later the toxicity of shellfish was attributed to the abundance of p cordatum in the seawater nakazima 1968 however the chemical properties of venerupin have not been elucidated and the role of p cordatum in vsp remained under question hashimoto 1979 okaichi and imatomi 1979 extracted two substances from a culture of p cordatum showing toxicity in mice while failing to detect venerupin the study of grzebyk et al 1997 revealed a high neurotoxic activity of extracts from some p cordatum cultures in mice thus it is still important to monitor shellfish toxicity in case a bloom of p cordatum affects areas of shellfish aquaculture and collection taylor et al 2003 in coastal areas p cordatum forms extensive blooming zones which severely aggravates the ecological status ignatiades and gotsis skretas 2010 high concentrations of toxic substances produced during the bloom of p cordatum along with the lack of oxygen due to decomposition of organics are detrimental to aquatic organisms fig 2 1 3 analysis of literature data on the species distribution in the study region the first record of p cordatum in the black sea dates back to 1948 morozova vodyanitskaya 1948 over the course of time the number of findings of this species in the sea has been steadily increasing since the 1970s p cordatum has become one of the most numerous and widely distributed species in the black sea coastal and shelf waters often reaching large numbers and causing habs at present it is the most frequently mentioned dinoflagellate species in publications dealing with the black sea krakhmalnyi et al 2018 the highest number of records of p cordatum was registered for the northwestern part of the sea nesterova 1979 1980 1985 1986 1987 1998 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 derezyuk et al 2017 2018 which is experiencing greater anthropogenic pressure zaytsev 1998 it is the northwestern part of the sea where cases of mass development of p cordatum were registered skolka and gautis 1969 nesterova 1979 1985 nesterova et al 2008 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 derezyuk et al 2017 most frequently p cordatum was found in the coastal waters of ukraine pitsyk 1950 1979 ivanov 1959 1960 1965 nesterova 1979 1980 1985 1986 1987 1998 2001 2003 a b nezlin and zernova 1983 senichkina 1983 eker 1998 zaitsev and alexandrov 1998 terenko and terenko 2000 terenko 2005 2007 nesterova et al 2006 dereziuk 2008 nesterova and terenko 2009 derezyuk et al 2017 multiple records of p cordatum originate from the crimean coast stroikina 1950 morozova vodyanitskaya 1948 1954 prokudina 1952 senicheva 1971 2008 senichkina 1973 polikarpov et al 2003 bryantseva et al 2016 zaremba 2011 2013 which is most likely due to a large number of studies in this part of the black sea a lot of findings were reported from the coasts of romania and bulgaria petrova 1957 1963 bologa et al 1984 bodeanu 1987 1988 skolka and roban 1989 bodeanu and ruta 1994 1995 petranu 1997 konsulov 1998 velikova 1998 velikova et al 1999 moncheva et al 2001a 2001b velikova et al 2005 nesterova et al 2008 moncheva 2010 klisarova et al 2015 less frequently p cordatum was found in the southern cost of turkey skolka and bodeanu 1963 georgieva 1969 eker 1998 öztürk 1999 türkoğlu and koray 2002 tas and okus 2006 özdemyr and ak 2012 feyzioğlu and şahin 2017 northeastern and eastern parts of the black sea the caucasian coast of russia vershinin et al 2005 manzhos 2008 yasakova 2011a b 2013 and georgia komakhidze and mazmanidi 1998 nesterova et al 2008 respectively although the total anthropogenic load on the ecosystem of the black sea has decreased over the past decades oguz and velikova 2010 boicenco et al 2019 a steady increase in both species diversity and the abundance of some toxic dinoflagellates is still observed the global distribution of p cordatum is expected to expand given predictions that nutrients flow to water bodies will more than double by 2050 as a result of anthropogenic activities glibert et al 2008 2 materials and methods 2 1 environmental variables environmental variables data were gathered from the public database bio oracle ver 2 0 assis et al 2018 the data were available in geotiff format and with global scale coverage at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin approximately 9 2 km at the equator eight variables were selected including indicators of temperature salinity current velocity and nutrients table 1 these were chosen based on their physiological importance for marine species used data covers recent time period 2000 2014 and are based on annual averages environmental layers representing temperature and salinity were accounted for as two separate metrics the annual mean and the annual range range of the minimum and maximum records per year given that the range of environmental variables is important since sometimes amplitudes and minimum values could be limiting the distribution of the species all mentioned variables relate to the surface of the sea 2 2 occurrence data data on the distribution of p cordatum were taken from the open resource the gbif source gbif org 2020 and span the world ocean preparing occurrence data for enm necessarily includes sampling bias correction kramer schadt et al 2013 fourcade et al 2014 derville et al 2018 it represents a set of techniques aimed at reducing the influence of noise factors that are not related to the ecological niche concept on the final model in particular dealing with the unevenness of area coverage filtering suspicious records etc the data were cleaned on two stages firstly the data cleaning was performed at the level of the gbif source by excluding from the downloading process the data that are flagged as fossil specimens or have an unknown basis of record due to the low reliability of such records secondly data cleaning included the geographical thinning of records in order to reduce the impact of uneven spatial area coverage for this purpose within grid sizes of 2 2 degrees only 1 record per cell was left and used in further training as a result the number of points was reduced while maintaining the former overall geographical pattern thus 219 of the total 7171 points were used for further processing 2 3 ecological niche modeling in order to build the current habitat suitability model the maximum entropy method maxent was used phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 among other ecological niche modeling techniques maxent was selected because of its various advantages the input species data can be presence only even with incomplete data prediction accuracy is reliable habitat suitability map can be directly produced the importance of individual variables can be evaluated using built in tests elith et al 2006 merow et al 2013 yi et al 2016 when creating maxent probability models train and predict functions available within the sdmtune package in r were used vignali et al 2019 this package is both a wrapper that controls the main maxent jar file as well as a set of functions for post processing the outputs and plotting to train the model sightings of p cordatum were accounted within the entire world ocean and then the model was projected onto the black sea this was motivated by the fact that while creating the model it was necessary to take into account the overall range of the tolerance of p cordatum to the factors involved in the analysis the quality of the resulting model was evaluated by auc statistics area under roc or receiver operating characteristic curve hanley and mcneil 1982 a subset of records 20 was used as testing data and the remaining was used as training data and auc estimates were obtained separately for training and testing data phillips et al 2006 the larger the auc is the better the model performance is the choice of the auc measure was motivated because it is not dependent on the selection of threshold vanagas 2004 in order to make an additional assessment of the obtained mathematical model applicability for the black sea literature data from 1886 through 2020 on the occurrence of p cordatum along with the original data collected by the authors of the present study 1986 2020 were used the original materials were collected in the following regions of the black sea the danube river estuary 1986 the dniester firth area and the odessa coast 1986 1998 2002 2008 2020 the sevastopol coast 1991 2008 2016 and the strait of kerch 2003 2006 2009 generally accepted hydrobiological sampling methods were used fedorov 1979 plankton nets and 1l plastic bottles were used to collect dinoflagellate samples water samples were fixed with 40 solution of neutralized formaldehyde with the final concentration of 4 the identification of dinoflagellates was performed by the means of light and scanning electron microscopy to assess the relative contribution of variables the permutation importance indicator was chosen since it depends only on the final model and does not depend on the path that the algorithm has taken phillips et al 2006 the response of the species to the environment variables involved in the analysis was carried out using the response curves that are a part of maxent s outputs response curves show the relationship between environmental variables and the habitat suitability and they help to better understand the ecological niche of the species hirzel and le lay 2008 elith et al 2011 post processing of maxent outputs was performed in the r statistical environment https cran r project org to build roc curve and response curves we used the package sdmtune vignali et al 2019 for raster manipulation the raster package hijmans 2019 аnd for building maps the tmap package tennekes 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 model performance and variables permutation importance the auc values of training data set and test data sets were 0 83 and 0 79 respectively fig 3 auc closest to a value of 1 would be a perfect model and auc 0 5 would indicate the low performance which is no better than random therefore the model is classified as satisfactory in particular as fair 0 7 0 8 for the test data set and good 0 8 0 9 for the training data set swets 1988 the permutation importance plot of the environmental variables contribution in the maxent model sorted by permutation importance scores indicates the predominant contribution of four variables namely nitrate phosphate temperature mean and temperature range fig 4 nitrate concentration demonstrated the highest permutation importance score with temperature range temperature mean and phosphate concentration following it respectively current velocity salinity and silicates did not show significant effect on the distribution of the species their permutation importance was less than 5 3 2 response curves to environmental variables the relation to temperature curve fig 5 a is bell shaped and waters with a temperature of 10 15 с are optimal for the development of p cordatum which corresponds to ocean waters of temperate latitudes at the same time suitability estimates are maintained at a fairly high level even at higher temperatures up to about 25 c the response curve to temperature amplitude fig 5 b indicates a high tolerance of the species for this variable this gives the species significant competitive advantages since it can spread not only in tropical waters with a stable temperature regime but also in waters where significant temperature fluctuations are observed during the year for example the black sea and the baltic sea with respect to phosphate and nitrate factors there is a general upward trend in predicted suitability with an increase in the concentration of these biogens fig 5 c d this agrees with the notion that mass development of toxic algae is associated with marine pollution and eutrophication hajdu et al 2005 livingston 2007 pednekar et al 2012 sahraoui et al 2013 3 3 maxent probability map the projection of suitability values according to the data of the maxent cloglog output reflects a general relationship with the degree of water pollution in the black sea the highest suitability values are observed in the northwestern part of the sea and in the odessa bay fig 6 large industrial cities that are sources of pollution in particular odessa nikolaev kherson are located here fig 7 the trend continues to the south and includes the west coast especially within ukraine partially bulgaria and to a lesser extent turkey even taking into account relatively smaller number of pollution sources in this region this can be explained by the spread of contaminated waters with the sea currents therefore in this part of the water area there is the highest risk of p cordatum outbreak along the eastern coast one can clearly observe two spots in the area of the large cities of novorossiysk and batumi since the depths along the caucasian coast in this part of the black sea are substantial starting from the coast the high suitability zones for p cordatum are relatively close to the coast while the central part is blue colored which corresponds to low values of the maxent probabilities a spot radiates into the open sea in the area of novorossiysk this is explained by the northern and western directions of currents prevailing in this part of the black sea towards the crimean peninsula as for the turkish coast the predicted suitability values here are much lower mostly less than 0 4 with the exception of the istanbul area this is due to the absence of large industrial and or urban centers that could become sources of substantial pollution along the predominant part of the turkish coast and narrow shelf zone in the bosphorus strait the suitability values slightly increase to approximately 0 6 possibly as a result of the introduction of polluted waters with currents from the west coast in the sea of azov the predicted suitability for p cordatum is relatively low except for a small area near genichesk the lack of a spot in the area of mariupol a large industrial city could be explained in particular by the fact that the smallest salinity values are observed at the mouth of the don optimal conditions for the development of p cordatum are 15 35 grzebyk and berland 1996 salinity in the sea of azov increases towards the center and south in the direction of the kerch strait the map fig 6 also shows p cordatum findings which the authors compiled from the literature see section 1 3 and original data it is important to note that these points were not used at the model training stage i e they can be used to judge the predictive power of the model visually they are in good agreement with the predicted model since most of the findings are concentrated in the northwestern part of the sea where the model showed high suitability values the only exception is the crimean coast where a large number of p cordatum findings in comparison to relatively low levels of nutrients in the marine environment could be explained primarily by a large number of studies carried out by the researchers of the institute of biology of the southern seas sevastopol in general the pattern of predicted suitability values for p cordatum in the black sea correlates well with the location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication further redistribution of polluted waters is affected by the sea currents patterns which is especially noticeable from the odessa bay in the direction of the coast of romania and bulgaria and from novorossiysk in the direction of the crimean peninsula according to the classified habitat suitability raster fig 6 about 16 of the black sea and the sea of azov areas are in the high or very high risk zone of p cordatum outbreaks which is a very significant indicator table 2 the total area of the 4th and 5th class suitability zones is more than 73 thousand km2 which may become unsuitable for fish and other marine organisms due to a mass development of p cordatum 4 conclusions the ecological niche modeling method is promising for predicting areas of possible mass development of toxic dinoflagellates species the obtained mathematical model demonstrated that suitability zones for p cordatum in the black sea turned out to be much larger than it could have been concluded based solely on the registered findings a significant influence of biogenes especially nitrates on the distribution of this species was confirmed which is in a good agreement with the concept of p cordatum as an indicator of polluted seawater the maximum predicted suitability value for the black sea is observed in its northwestern part and in other parts it coincides with the location of large sources of anthropogenic eutrophication and further distribution of polluted waters by the sea currents the experience of using the maxent algorithm in the case of p cordatum for predicting areas of possible mass development of this toxic species has demonstrated a high predictive power and the proposed model is supported by literature and original data gathered by the authors of the current research in addition this approach is of a particular importance in terms of assessing those toxic species that have not been found in the black sea yet but whose risk of invasion is high due to suitable environment conditions the disadvantages of the current approach include the inability to take into account the abundance and biomass population factors and interspecific interactions seasonal dynamics etc but even despite this the ecological niche modeling method is very promising with regard to forecasting which is extremely relevant for toxic species where preventive measures are of particular importance moreover given a relative simplicity and low labor costs compared to more expensive and time consuming methods including qpcr it also allows to analyze factors that contribute to or limit the development of certain toxic species declaration of

993,our study explores the variability of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin as well as the taxonomic and functional structure of phytoplankton in epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata regarding the main environmental features of the water column the maximum phytoplankton pigment concentrations are located differently depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability in general there were three situations observed during the summer stratification the euphotic zone did not extend to the thermocline and the highest chlorophyll concentration developed above the thermocline level at the bottom of the euphotic zone type i the euphotic zone reached beyond the thermocline and the maximum chlorophyll concentration occurred above the thermocline type ii or the euphotic zone was much greater than the thermocline depth and the peak phytoplankton density was located below the thermocline type iii in metalimnetic samples the most dominant cyanobacteria belonged to the reynolds functional groups rfg h1 s1 and lo their occurrence differed depending on the types of light and thermal regimes it was assumed that vertical heterogeneity affects the ecological status assessment based on phytoplankton calculating the two applied indices ti index and q index based on metalimnetic and epilimnetic data as opposed to only epilimnetic data yielded worse ecological status in 70 of cases keywords lake stratification vertical distribution of phytoplankton reynolds functional groups 1 introduction a characteristic feature of a lake in the temperate zone is periodic seasonal variability of the water temperature for the entire water column in the pelagic zone during the summer months there is significant vertical variation in the water temperature in the open water zone of deep lakes this phenomenon is known as simple thermal stratification the stability of water column is one of the most important factors for regulating phytoplankton composition and abundance during the summer it is decisive for temperature oxygenation and indirectly nutrient availability yang et al 2016 during stable summer stratification the varied temperature and oxygen saturation combined with the gradient of light intensity and nutrient availability shape specific niches for the biocoenoses of plankton phytoplankton usually find favorable conditions for development in the upper layer if the surface water is rich in nutrients and light penetration is still possible however in less fertile water bodies where light can penetrate deeper the peak of phytoplankton biomass often occurs in the metalimnion or even upper hypolimnion bramburger and reavie 2016 cullen 1982 leach et al 2018 reynolds 1992 yoshiyama et al 2009 many studies have revealed deep chlorophyll layers in stratified lakes in central europe e g karpowicz and ejsmont karabin 2017 wojciechowska et al 2004 the number of recent publications involving deeper layers and phytoplankton analysis has increased which could be connected with the application of phytoplankton pigment mainly chlorophyll a and phycocyanin fluorescence probes these reports have shown that the presence of deep phytoplankton maxima is rather the rule than an exception if only considering the light conditions leach et al 2018 the mechanisms of their formation and maintenance described in the literature are complicated and include passive mechanisms such as decreased sinking speed of settling phytoplankton particles remnants of the algal community that was present during a thermally homogenous spring season bramburger and reavie 2016 and active processes such as light and or predation avoidance by motile taxa and the buoyancy mechanism of some cyanobacteria camacho 2006 the primary production in deeper layers of the lake water column can influence the functioning of the entire ecosystem and modify its trophic status leach et al 2018 the issue of the influence of stratification on lake phytoplankton is gaining attention due to climatic changes and their possible effects on the functioning of inland waters e g dokulil et al 2010 kasprzak et al 2017 there has been a large scale increase in lake surface water temperature in central european lakes during the past 50 100 years with potential consequences for a host of physical chemical and biological processes in lakes woolway et al 2017 temperature increases both at the surface and at deeper levels result in changes in physical properties including a decrease in water density viscosity and oxygen concentration this is of great importance for aquatic ecosystems because of the increase in the rate of plankton sedimentation and the modification of the development cycle of aquatic organisms adrian et al 2006 the observed effects of climate warming manifested by the lack of winter ice cover earlier thermocline formation greater thickness of the epilimnion a longer period of thermal stratification and more severe and frequent extreme weather events may be important factors intensifying the eutrophication of lakes dokulil et al 2010 kasprzak et al 2017 research on the thermal regime of lakes indicates a strong relationship between air and surface water temperatures boehrer and schultze 2008 studies conducted in poland lowlands since the 1960s have shown an average air temperature increase of 0 02 0 025 c year 1 lake water temperatures have varied more but also increased by 0 005 0 028 c year 1 dąbrowski et al 2004 the correlation coefficients r vary depending on the studied region and reach up to 0 74 detailed analysis has shown that in the period from 1961 to 2014 the highest mean monthly water temperature increase in lakes from 3 1 to 3 9 c depending on the lake occurred in may marszelewski and pius 2019 the above mentioned results of climate warming influence phytoplankton communities which in turn affects the entire ecosystem prolonged stratification influences hypolimnetic oxygen conditions and dissolved nutrient concentrations oxygen depletion and higher temperatures increase nutrient release at the sediment water interface dokulil et al 2010 in addition extreme weather events intensified by global climate change disrupt lake stratification and may influence the deep chlorophyll layers a phenomenon that can lead to surging eutrophication kasprzak et al 2017 the goal of this paper is to explore the taxonomic composition and functional structure of phytoplankton communities in epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata within lowland mesotrophic lakes of northeastern poland in particular we addressed the following research questions 1 how the range of euphotic zone and the thermocline depth modify the variability of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations 2 does the composition of phytoplankton and trophic preferences of phytoplankton taxa and functional groups rfgs differ between the epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata and 3 how hydromorphological characteristics and environmental features of the water column influence phytoplankton abundance and composition 4 we hypothesized that including metalimnetic samples in analyses affects the values of phytoplankton indices and ecological status classification 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area studies were carried out in nine lakes brożane busznica buwełno długie augustowskie garbaś jegocin kuc majcz wielki and zdrężno situated in the masurian lake district and in the polish part of the lithuanian lake district in northeastern poland fig 1 all studied lakes are lowland ecosystems 200 m above sea level a s l with the surface area exceeding 0 5 km2 or close to it and with high alkalinity 1 0 meq l and non colored water 30 mg pt l they are mostly ribbon shaped water bodies except for the rounded brożane busznica and kuc all dimictic but diverse in morphometric characteristics affecting the thermal structure with a mean depth from 4 7 m to 20 9 m a maximum depth from only 12 0 m to nearly 50 m a fetch length from 838 to 4 800 m and an index of exposure the ratio of lake surface area to its mean depth between 7 3 and 34 table 1 the studied lakes have a mesotrophic status according to carlson trophic state index tsi calculated on the basis of the formulas by carlson 1977 and kratzer and brezonik 1981 table 1 the lakes are mostly under low anthropogenic pressure based on corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 the catchments of six lakes brożane busznica długie augustowskie garbaś jegocin and majcz wielki are more than 80 covered by forests while three water bodies buwełno kuc and zdrężno have catchments dominated by agricultural areas 50 70 of arable lands and pastures 2 2 data collection during the summer stratification period between july 25 and august 15 in 2012 2013 and 2015 eight lakes were sampled twice in different years while lake jegocin was studied three times once in each year water samples were collected separately from the epilimnion and metalimnion layers we used the term epilimnion for an upper stratum of more or less uniformly warm circulating and fairly turbulent water well mixed zone according to wetzel 2001 the depth at which the temperature drop reached 1 c m 1 was adopted as the boundary between epilimnion and metalimnion after lampert and sommer 1996 vertically the metalimnion reached the boundary with isothermal hypolimnion waters continuous strata in which the change in temperature was less than 1 c m 1 however the term thermocline was also applied according to hutchinson 1957 it refers to the depth at which the relatively greatest temperature drop takes place this last definition was applied in the analysis included in this paper according to the approach of nõges et al 2010 following nõges et al 2010 we used the term metalimnion as described above for the relatively thick 3 7 m transitional zone and the term thermocline for just the thin layer of the maximum temperature gradient samples for the chemical and phytoplankton analyses were taken using a limnos sampler 2 dm3 capacity limnos pl komorów poland at the deepest part of each lake and at every 1 m depth within each sampled layer these samples were pooled together to obtain integrated representative and separate samples for the epilimnion and metalimnion simultaneously secchi disc visibility sd was measured the euphotic depth was estimated by multiplying sd by 2 5 the most typical ratio of euphotic zone depth to sd for lakes of northern poland borowiak and borowiak 2016 other field measurements including water temperature t ph conductivity chlorophyll a phycocyanin and oxygen concentration do were measured along the water column every 1 m using a multi parametric probe ysi 650 mds yellow springs oh usa the chemical analysis of soluble nutrients p po4 n no3 and n nh4 and total fractions of phosphorus tp and nitrogen tn were measured in a laboratory using standard methods water for chemical analyses was filtered through whatman gf f glass fibre filter the filter was then ground and extracted with acetone to determine chlorophyll concentration golterman 1969 in filtrate concentration of ammonium ions was analysed with phenylhypochlorite method after solórzano 1969 soluble reactive phosphorus was determined with standard molybdenum blue method golterman 1969 and nitrates with phenyldisulphonic acid standard methods 1960 total kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus were determined after mineralization of unfiltered water with concentrated sulphuric acid golterman 1969 followed by spectrophotometric analyses of resulting ammonium ions and phosphates respectively total nitrogen was a sum of total kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrates concentration besides in situ chlorophyll a fluorescence a traditional measurement of chlorophyll a concentrations from epilimnion and metalimnion samples was done in the laboratory the process involves filtering water through whatman gf c filters on the day of sampling extraction in 90 acetone goltherman 1969 and determination by a spectrophotometric method nusch 1980 chlorophyll a was measured to estimate the absolute concentrations and to assess the trophic state of the lake phytoplankton samples were fixed with lugol s solution and preserved with 4 formalin microscopic analysis of phytoplankton abundance and biomass was done following the utermöhl method 1958 for counting the samples were transferred to a settling chamber and at least 100 individuals i e the so called units which were single cells cenobia colonies and filaments of the most numerous algae were counted per sample as described by lund 1958 the units were calculated for different magnification levels large taxa were calculated for 100 fold magnification inspecting the whole bottom of the chamber and so were medium sized ones under 200 fold magnification in 2 4 slant belts and nanoplankton under 400 fold magnification in 100 fields biovolumes mm3 l 1 were determined according to hillebrand et al 1999 and converted to biomass mg fresh weight l 1 for taxonomic analysis additional samples were obtained with a 20 µm plankton net for these samples the phytoplankton species were determined under a light microscope zeiss axio imager a2 zeiss oberkochen germany using 200 fold 400 fold and 1000 fold magnification levels with immersion oil from living and formalin glycerin mixture fixed samples phytoplankton taxa were determined on the basis of identification keys e g john et al 2005 komárek 2013 komárek and agnostidis 1999 2005 hindák 2008 picińska fałtynowicz and błachuta 2012 2 3 data analysis a total of 38 samples for physicochemical and phytoplankton analysis were collected the influence of morphometric and trophic factors on the position of the epilimnion thermocline and chlorophyll a in the water column was tested by multiple regression analysis using statistica 10 0 pl software the phytoplankton composition was analyzed at the level of the main taxonomic groups individual genera and reynolds functional groups rfgs the classical and the most widely used system of functional classification of phytoplankton by reynolds et al 2002 and its update by padisák et al 2009 was used to classify phytoplankton taxa into rfgs the rfgs contributing more than 5 to the total biomass were used for subsequent analysis the functional approach explains well the variability of phytoplankton under different environmental conditions moreover it reduces the structural complexity from a wide range of species to a few rfgs cellamare et al 2013 to decide which ordination method linear or unimodal is appropriate the gradient lengths was established by detrended correspondence analysis dca the longest gradient represented by the first axis was 3 173 standard deviations which enabled unimodal analysis of these dataset to reveal the relationships between environmental variables and rfgs canonical correspondence analysis cca with the monte carlo permutation test was performed in the next step the cca and permutation test were performed using canoco v 4 5 ter braak and smilauer 2002 a principal components analysis pca on the correlation matrix was performed to choose the environmental variables which were most strongly associated with each of the principal axes to avoid multicollinearity the following variables were used temperature the index of exposure and the fetch length as morphology indicators the euphotic zone depth to reflect light conditions and tp and tp concentrations as trophic parameters 2 4 phytoplankton indices we assumed that the taxonomic structure of phytoplankton settled in the deeper layers of the water column is important for the ecological functioning of water bodies and can influence their ecological status thus to test the effect of the sampling design on the result of bioassessment several indices regarding phytoplankton taxonomy in summer stratification period were chosen the ti index pasztaleniec 2016 based on trophic optima and the q index padisák et al 2006 based on rfgs defined by reynolds et al 2002 were used for ecological status estimations of the studied lakes the ti index eq 1 value presented in this paper is the average of normalized ecological quality ratios eqrs of two trophic indices namely titp eq 2 and titn eq 3 supplementary material those are calculated based on sets of optima for tp and for tn separately for each sample using the ln optima sjtp or sjtn respectively of all taxa in a given sample with their square root transformed proportional biomass as weights a j trophic index values were converted to normalized eqrs according to eq 4 and eq 5 which are recommended for stratified lakes pasztaleniec 2016 1 ti e q r t i t p e q r t i t n 2 2 t i t p j 1 n a j s

follows 0 0 32 bad 0 32 0 39 poor 0 39 0 47 moderate 0 47 0 59 good and 0 59 1 00 high the q index eq 6 is based on the relative share of rfgs in the total biomass pi multiplied by a numerical factor f defined for each codon considering the phytoplankton assemblage likely to occur in a reference type factor number changes from 0 to 5 lower f values are assigned to groups preferring a lower trophy higher values characterize groups in high trophy conditions pre determining the f factor which defines the q index is the crucial step following the steps recommended by padisák et al 2006 for applying the q index the f factor was adopted for each rfg occurring in the studied lakes because none of the lake typologies described by padisák et al 2006 corresponded exactly to the studied lakes the f factor was determined on the basis of expert knowledge reported in table 3 6 q i 1 n p i f the index number that results from the equation given above ranges between 0 and 5 of which according classification system can be understood at 0 1 bad 1 2 poor 2 3 moderate 3 4 good 4 5 high 3 results 3 1 environmental features of the water column in all lakes including the relatively shallow lake długie augustowskie maximum depth 12 m typical stratification developed during the study with an upper well heated and oxygenated epilimnion layer a metalimnion layer and a zone of cold hypolimnetic water the lakes showed variation in the depth of the epilimnion and the depth of the thermocline the thickness of the epilimnion was between 4 and 8 m while the depth of the thermocline location ranged from 5 to 9 m from the surface however the vertical temperature profiles were variable and changed from year to year in the same lake table 1 the surface layer temperatures in all the lakes exceeded 20 c at the depth of 4 8 m there was a rapid decrease in temperature 1 c m 1 and in the metalimnion the temperature ranged from 10 to 15 c table 2 the surface layer was always saturated with oxygen the mean metalimnetic oxygen concentration was usually lower than in the epilimnion but a positive heterograde curve was often observed especially in lake jegocin table 2 fig 2 as a result of declining intensities of photosynthesis and organic matter decomposition with depth a slight lake specific decrease in ph and an increase in specific conductance between the epilimnion and metalimnion appeared the average water ph varied from 7 1 to 7 9 the lowest average conductivity of 157 μs cm 1 was in the epilimnion of lake busznica the maximum value was found in the metalimnion of lake buwełno 389 μs cm 1 and the difference within the same lake did not exceed several dozen units comparing the mean values of chemical and biological trophic parameters tp tn chlorophyll a and total biomass there was an increase in their concentrations in the metalimnion in most of the studied lakes table 2 the in situ profile measurements of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin fluorescence enabled more detailed depiction of changes in algal abundance along the water column depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability the maximum values of phytoplankton pigments can be located differently generally in four lakes buwełno długie augustowskie majcz wielki and zdrężno the euphotic zone did not reach the thermocline and the highest phytoplankton density developed above the thermocline level at the bottom of the euphotic zone type i fig 2 and 3 the second combination of vertical thermal and light profiles was characterized by a euphotic zone reaching beyond the thermocline and the maximum chlorophyll a concentration occurred above the thermocline busznica kuc and garbaś in 2012 moreover the highest concentration of algae at the thermocline was often accompanied by an almost equal algal density in the epilimnion type ii fig 2 and 3 in the third category the euphotic zone was much greater than the epilimnion and the peak of chlorophyll a was located considerably below from 2 to 6 m the thermocline brożane jegocin garbaś in 2015 type iii fig 2 and 3 the multiple regression considering the significance of the effects of morphometric and trophic factors independent variables on the vertical position of the maximum chlorophyll a concentration dependent variable in the water column indicated that only the euphotic zone range was significant f1 34 24 5 p 0 00002 and explained r2 adj 67 of the variability of the chlorophyll a peak position however the index of exposure and the thermocline depth had the greatest influence on metalimnetic phytoplankton development measured as the difference between the relative chlorophyll a concentration in the epilimnion and metalimnion together these two parameters significantly f2 35 9

distribution of phytoplankton the analyzed lakes were dominated by algae belonging to five taxonomic classes cyanophyceae cryptophyceae dinophyceae bacillariophyceae and chlorophyceae less numerous were taxa belonging to chrysophyceae euglenophyceae or xanthophyceae fig 4 cyanobacteria were a permanent component of phytoplankton communities their percentage share ranged from 20 to 90 among them the most abundant species were filamentous cyanobacteria planktothrix agardhii gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 planktolyngbya limnetica lemmermann komárková legnerová cronberg 1992 pseudanabaena

komárek 2009 chroococcales were represented by aphanothece clathrata west g s west 1906 snowella lacustris chodat komárek hindák 1988 snowella litoralis häyrén komárek hindák 1988 and different members of the chroococcus nägeli 1849 and aphanocapsa nägeli 1849 genera the second most abundant taxonomic group with regard to the total biomass were chlorophytes reaching a maximum contribution of 70 the chlorophytes with the highest relative share in the total biomass were colony forming species namely botryococcus braunii kützing 1849 eudorina elegans ehrenberg 1832 coenococcus planctonicus korshikov 1953 and oocystis lacustris chodat 1897 while the most common chlorophyta were small unicellular chlorococcales taxa such as desmodesmus communis e hegewald e hegewald 2000 monoraphidium tortile west g s west komárková legnerová 1969 tetraëdron minimum a braun hansgirg 1889 and desmids from the genera closterium nitzsch ex ralfs 1848 and cosmarium corda ex ralfs 1848 the widespread planktonic algae identified in all lakes or in the vast majority of them were the cryptophytes of the cryptomonas ehrenberg 1831 and rhodomonas karsten 1898 genera usually constituting over 12 of the total biomass and dinophytes such as ceratium hirundinella o f müller dujardin 1841 and peridinium ehrenberg 1830 with a percentage share from 10 to 40 the contribution of bacillariophyta was diverse in many samples they were present only in small amount a few percent but in some cases diatoms reached nearly 40 of the total biomass in general both in the epilimnetic and metalimnetic layers of all the studied lakes the main taxonomic groups mentioned above were most abundant however the phytoplankton community structure quite often differed between the strata within the same lake fig 4 more accurate analyses of phytoplankton community structure following reynolds functional classification revealed functional differentiation of the community between the epilimnion and metalimnion in diverse assemblages along vertical temperature and light gradients fig 5 table 3 commonly occurring functional assemblages included the rfgs lo f and y species of lo were a persistent element of phytoplankton occurring in almost all the studied lakes in the epilimnion and the metalimnion only in the metalimnetic phytoplankton of three lakes długie augustowskie majcz wielki and zdrężno in 2012 did the share of the lo rfg not exceed 5 of the total biomass this codon included dinophyceae taxa among them peridinium spp and or c hirundinella and also gyrodinium helveticum penard y takano t horiguchi 2004 in the metalimnion of lake brożane and lake garbaś along with colonial chroococcales species such as s lacustris and s litoralis aphanocapsa planctonica g m smith komárek anagnostidis

example from the aphanothece and chroococcus genera as well as c pusillum were more abundant in the epilimnion while a conferta a holsatica and m tenuissima were more abundant in metalimnetic phytoplankton table 3 the f rfg was higher 5 in the epilimnion of nine water bodies and in the metalimnion of six while the y rfg was higher in the epilimnion of seven water bodies and the metalimnion of four water bodies fig 4 there were three main representatives of f b braunii o lacustris and in one lake westella botryoides west de wildeman 1897 metalimnion of lake busznica the considerable percentage share of b braunii up to 60 70 and o lacustris a maximum of a few percent was observed both in the epilimnion and metalimnion regardless of the type of the noticed chlorophyll vertical profile the distribution of the y rfg cryptomonas spp and small gymnodinium species was rather uniform along the lakes and the water column but the relative biomass of taxa relevant to this group usually did not exceed a few percent fig 5 table 3 the j rfg was observed only in the surface layer and mainly in lakes characterized by type i stratification where the thermocline depth overruns the euphotic zone the biomass of the j rfg reached a considerable percentage share 43 in one water body lake majcz wielki another rfg that achieved a 5 biomass level in this type of lakes was lm dominated by c hirundinella and ceratium furcoides levander langhans 1925 together with microcystis lemmermann 1907 species just like the j rfg the lm rfg was observed almost exclusively in the epilimnion of lakes with type i thermo light stratification buwełno majcz wielki and zdrężno however its amount was rather low between 6 and 12 the b rfg centric diatoms appeared in most of surface samples from type i lakes but its share of 12 was also sporadically noted in other water bodies both in the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 5 the association that typically characterized metalimnetic layers of stratified lakes especially with a type i vertical profile was the s1 rfg the metalimnetic codon r according to padisák et al 2009 this group was mainly composed of three species planktothrix agardhii p limnetica and p limnetica and in one lake lake długie augustowskie leptolyngbya fragilis gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 the s1 r codon reached from about 10 to more than 90 of the total biomass in the metalimnion among other lakes this group was recognized in considerable amounts 36 only in lake brożane with the representative p aghardii and a small amount 5 4 in lake jegocin in 2012 due to romeria m koczwara 1932 the taxa of this group were almost absent in the epilimnion except for lake długie augustowskie in which p limnetica constituted about 10 of the total phytoplankton biomass in 2012 fig 4 table 3 the h1 rfg reached relatively great abundance 6 54 in the metalimnetic phytoplankton community mainly in type ii lakes this rfg was represented primarily by different dolichospermum species table 3 the only lake in which h1 prevailed in the epilimnion up to 75 was lake kuc fig 5 among the rarest rfgs noted in summer samples of the studied lakes was n tabellaria fenestrata lyngbye kützing 1844 and small desmids this group occurred in the epilimnion and metalimnion of lake busznica lake brożane and lake jegocin and in the metalimnion of lake buwełno and lake kuc a few rfgs noted only in one or two lakes were not included in individual analysis although their biomass slightly exceeded 5 of the total phytoplankton biomass this refers to w2 observed in both studied strata of lake długie augustowskie representatives euglena texta dujardin hübner 1886 and phacus dujardin 1841 and in the metalimnion of lake majcz wielki trachelomonas volvocinopsis svirenko 1914 p closterium acutum brébisson 1848 in the epilimnion of lake długie augustowskie and also x2 rhodomonas spp in the epilimnion and metalimnion of lake buwełno 3 3 phytoplankton functional environmental relationships the cca results based on the rfg approach indicated that all the applied environmental factors explained 27 of phytoplankton functional variability the monte carlo permutation test of conditional effects indicated that the most important factor for phytoplankton groups distribution was the euphotic depth f 2 73 λ 0 16 p 0 020 followed by temperature f 2 56 λ 0 14 p 0 018 other parameters did not reach the 0 05 threshold of statistical significance the considered parameters differentiated epilimnetic and metalimnetic samples the variable crucial for this distribution was temperature negatively correlated with the first axis r 0 36 and positively correlated with the second axis r 0 31 the longest vector characterized the exposure index that was the main determinant separating the samples on axis 2 r 0 46 the exposure index together with nutrient concentrations tn and tp and fetch length positively correlated with axis 1 r 0 47 r 0 32 and r 0 24 respectively and differentiated lakes with a euphotic to thermocline depth zeu zthc ratio below and not much above 1 among all samples those representing the type i thermo light profile are distinguished while samples from types ii and iii water bodies are mixed fig 6 a the latter ones represent lakes of lower a trophy and with a deeper euphotic zone the euphotic depth was negatively correlated with the tn and tp concentration its correlation coefficient with the first axis was r 0 43 the first cca axis related to nutrient increase was positively associated with the s1 rfg and negatively with the f rfg fig 6b the positive end of axis 2 related mainly to temperature increase included the j b and lm rfgs characterizing epilimnetic samples two groups j and lm were close to type i stratification samples the lo n and h1 rfgs exhibited a relationship with metalimnetic samples of types ii and iii stratification 3 4 ecological status assessment and phytoplankton distribution in the water column in most cases the values of the applied indices ti index and q index decreased when they were calculated based on epilimnetic and metalimnetic data and not only epilimnetic data fig 7 supplementary material this tendency was particularly apparent in lakes characterized by type i vertical thermal and light profiles where the r rfg with high trophic preferences predominated in metalimnion communities fig 5 table 3 depending on the location of the index value within the class boundaries its increase or decrease had an impact on the final classification result or the change in the value was not reflected in the change of the ecological status due to the fact that both indices decrease with ecological status deterioration including data from deeper metalimnetic layers of the water column in the most cases yielded worse ecological status assessment the exceptions are lake majcz wielki in 2012 and lake kuc in 2013 where the f rfg typical for mesotrophic conditions occurred in greater abundance in the metalimnetic compared with the epilimnetic phytoplankton community 4 discussion in mesotrophic lakes of considerable depth phytoplankton distribution and composition are differentiated through the water column in summer due to the development of stratification and at the same time good light conditions in deeper water strata in these lakes the highest concentration of algae may appear primarily in the metalimnetic zone where it may be a reflection of the epilimnetic community structure or may present a rebuilt different phytoplankton assemblage bramburger and reavie 2016 cullen 1982 leach et al 2018 reynolds 1992 yoshiyama et al 2009 the accumulation of phytoplankton in the metalimnion appears especially when cyanobacteria tolerating dim light for the sake of better nutrient availability find habitat conditions favorable for development lenard 2009 padisák et al 2003 wojciechowska et al 2004 the crucial factor for deep phytoplankton formation especially its thickness and depth is water transparency leach et al 2018 nevertheless as leach et al 2018 demonstrated based on research of 100 lakes located in different regions of the world the relative importance of light and thermal stratification for the development of phytoplankton in deeper layers is not uniform across diverse lake types in the investigated polish lakes the maximum chlorophyll a concentration in the water column was significantly explained by the depth of the euphotic zone and the maximum depth of the lake nõges et al 2010 developed a model of prediction of a deep chlorophyll maximum occurrence for european lakes according to this model there is a clear relationship between the maximum effective length mel of the lake and the zeu zthc ratio in very large lakes mel 100 km the euphotic depth always remains smaller than the thermocline depth independent of the sd depth in medium sized water bodies mel 10 km if the sd is 5 m the euphotic depth should mostly remain above the thermocline but in transparent lakes its depth exceeds the mixed layer a deep chlorophyll layer appears mainly when sufficient light levels for photosynthesis reach deeper strata than the thermocline depth so if the zeu zthc ratio is 1 there is a high probability of the existence of chlorophyll peaks nõges et al 2010 the studied polish lakes were mostly small with the maximum lake length of a few kilometers and the exposure index appeared to be a better morphometric predictor for the deep chlorophyll peaks occurrence spearman rank coefficient 0 58 p 0 0001 than the zeu zthc ratio in general all lakes characterized by a exposure index value 25 had a relatively thinner euphotic zone that did not reach the thermocline level type i vertical profile fig 2 unlike the italian lakes investigated by nõges et al 2010 in the studied polish lakes chlorophyll maxima were noted even when the euphotic depth was smaller than the thermocline depth and sd ranged between 1 8 and 3 5 m fig 8 their location relative to the thermocline could be different as is common in water bodies with good water transparency the metalimnetic maximum of algae was usually placed just above the thermocline where there is the largest barrier of water density and the best supply of nutrients type i and ii thermal and light vertical profiles fig 2 however with high water transparency the thickness of the euphotic layer may even reach the hypolimnion and the chlorophyll peak will appear significantly below the thermocline as it was observed in lake jegocin representing the type iii stratification fig 2 the taxonomic composition of the planktonic algae in the epilimnion and metalimnion may be similar in the same water body but more often the phytoplankton species and functional structure differ between thermal layers the changes in phytoplankton community become well visible using the functional approach as the taxa belonging to the same rfg respond in a similar way to environmental variables such as the light regime mixing depth and nutrient concentrations cellamare et al 2013 in the studied lakes two rfgs j and lm were primarily associated with the epilimnetic waters j consisting of non gelatinous and non motile chlorococcales was identified as 5 share of the total biomass in the upper layer of four lakes while lm appeared in only three lakes and the biomass did not exceed 0 6 mg l 1 both mentioned rfgs prefer warm waters and are typical for eutrophic or even hypertrophic lakes in the summer reynolds et al 2002 salmaso et al 2015 the absence of common occurrence of the j and lm rfgs is associated with the rather low trophic status of the studied lakes while j and lm have higher trophic requirements the tp optima for these rfgs representatives are usually well over 30 µg l 1 and the tn optima range from 0 88 to 1 12 mg l 1 pasztaleniec 2016 a dominant characteristic in the metalimnion of lakes with a low euphotic to mixing zone zeu zthc ratio was the s1 rfg this codon was originally characterized as typical for shallow enriched lakes reynolds et al 2002 according to padisák et al 2009 if the s1 occurs in deeper layers of water column these species should be grouped in the r rfg like planktothrix rubescens de candolle ex gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 the typical r habitat template is during the stratification in the metalimnion or upper hypolimnion of deep oligo mesotrophic lakes in the studied water bodies representing the type i vertical profile with zeu zthc 1 the planktothrix genus was the most common actually achieving high percentages up to 92 in the metalimnetic biomass considerable abundance of the s1 rfg in the metalimnion 36 share of planktothrix also appeared once in the lake characterized by type iii stratification lake brożane in 2015 however besides p aghardii there were significant numbers of other filamentous cyanobacteria representatives of the s1 rfg such as planktolyngbya leptolyngbya and pseudanabaena s1 species are tolerant of low light and can create a dense population near the boundary of the euphotic zone where only about 1 of light is available wojciechowska et al 2004 the second typical cyanobacterial rfg that reached a great share in the metalimnion from 5 5 to 54 was h1 consisting of species belonging to the order nostocales these species are tolerant of low nitrogen but sensitive to poor light conditions reynolds et al 2002 so they are more common as a metalimnetic community component in lakes with types ii and iii stratification where the chlorophyll maxima occurred much above the lower boundary of the euphotic zone although the h1 rfg is described as characteristic of more eutrophic waters the identified species dominated phytoplankton at rather low nutrients concentrations it should perhaps be considered whether the identified species belong to the h2 rfg which represents mesotrophic water bodies padisák et al 2009 reynolds et al 2002 nonetheless it is questionable because among the identified species there are no typical h2 representatives dolichospermum lemmermannii and or gloeotrichia echinulata mentioned by other authors padisák et al 2009 the representatives of the lo rfg include motile dinoflagellates tolerant to nutrient deficiency padisák et al 2009 and occur preferably in stable conditions usually in the summer epilimnia and metalimnia of temperate lakes miracle et al 1992 reynolds et al 2002 they were most often identified in all the studied lakes regardless of the water column layer the f and b rfgs also had notably high abundances the f rfg generally has substantially higher light requirement than planktonic cyanobacteria or many chlorophyte taxa thus it can develop better in clear waters huszar et al 2003 indeed there was a correlation between f and water transparency in addition f had a negative correlation with tp and tn and a positive correlation with water temperature this group appeared mainly in the epilimnion of the studied lakes but in a few cases it also reached a considerable share in the metalimnetic biomass if the light was sufficient small sized diatoms from the b rfg appeared occasionally in the phytoplankton community throughout the water column this rfg has high nutrient use efficiency and low light requirements so they are fast growing species but they need constant mixing and are susceptible to sedimentation padisák et al 2009 reynolds et al 2002 however due to passive sinking from the spring community centric diatoms may also occur in deeper layers for example in the laurentian great lakes bramburger and reave 2016 in lakes involved in the research none of the metalimnia were dominated emphatically by taxa belonging to cryptophytes y a phenomenon that had been reported by other authors e g camacho 2006 the complicated mechanisms of phytoplankton of deeper layers formation and maintenance and the multipronged processes that underlie their occurrence cause differentiation of the metalimnetic phytoplankton community structure the are some advantages that favor algal development in deep water layers such as the ability to cope with low light availability due to the presence of phycoerythrocyanin an important component of the light harvesting complex the ability to fine tune their buoyancy and or the ability to fix n2 in addition the high surface volume ratio allows efficient light harvesting dokulil and teubner 2000 cyanobacteria maxima in the metalimnion have been noted in other polish lakes even at very low oxygen content lenard 2009 wojciechowska et al 2004 the phytoplankton communities of deep layers may represent a large portion of the water column chlorophyll and can be responsible for much of the primary production of a lake bramburger and reave 2016 scofield et al 2020 moreover the photo acclimation of the phytoplankton living in deep layers occurs by which phototrophs can increase the chlorophyll content per cell cullen 1982 this phenomenon may result in vertical separation of biomass and chlorophyll maxima e g felip and catalán 2000 thus as noted by bramburger and rave 2016 chlorophyll a concentrations estimated by in situ fluorescence are not necessarily reliable indicators of phytoplankton biomass 5 conclusions our findings demonstrate the importance of the vertical thermal and light profile on summer phytoplankton communities the maximum values of phytoplankton pigments can be located differently depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability the highest algal concentration may appear primarily in the metalimnetic zone where it may be a reflection of the epilimnetic community composition or may present a rebuilt different phytoplankton assemblage it can be assumed that vertical heterogeneity is one of the sources of uncertainty that affects the reliability of the ecological status assessment based on phytoplankton the methodological implication of our findings is that the vertical distribution of phytoplankton can influence the lake ecological status and a reliable sampling strategy should be designed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

993,our study explores the variability of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin as well as the taxonomic and functional structure of phytoplankton in epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata regarding the main environmental features of the water column the maximum phytoplankton pigment concentrations are located differently depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability in general there were three situations observed during the summer stratification the euphotic zone did not extend to the thermocline and the highest chlorophyll concentration developed above the thermocline level at the bottom of the euphotic zone type i the euphotic zone reached beyond the thermocline and the maximum chlorophyll concentration occurred above the thermocline type ii or the euphotic zone was much greater than the thermocline depth and the peak phytoplankton density was located below the thermocline type iii in metalimnetic samples the most dominant cyanobacteria belonged to the reynolds functional groups rfg h1 s1 and lo their occurrence differed depending on the types of light and thermal regimes it was assumed that vertical heterogeneity affects the ecological status assessment based on phytoplankton calculating the two applied indices ti index and q index based on metalimnetic and epilimnetic data as opposed to only epilimnetic data yielded worse ecological status in 70 of cases keywords lake stratification vertical distribution of phytoplankton reynolds functional groups 1 introduction a characteristic feature of a lake in the temperate zone is periodic seasonal variability of the water temperature for the entire water column in the pelagic zone during the summer months there is significant vertical variation in the water temperature in the open water zone of deep lakes this phenomenon is known as simple thermal stratification the stability of water column is one of the most important factors for regulating phytoplankton composition and abundance during the summer it is decisive for temperature oxygenation and indirectly nutrient availability yang et al 2016 during stable summer stratification the varied temperature and oxygen saturation combined with the gradient of light intensity and nutrient availability shape specific niches for the biocoenoses of plankton phytoplankton usually find favorable conditions for development in the upper layer if the surface water is rich in nutrients and light penetration is still possible however in less fertile water bodies where light can penetrate deeper the peak of phytoplankton biomass often occurs in the metalimnion or even upper hypolimnion bramburger and reavie 2016 cullen 1982 leach et al 2018 reynolds 1992 yoshiyama et al 2009 many studies have revealed deep chlorophyll layers in stratified lakes in central europe e g karpowicz and ejsmont karabin 2017 wojciechowska et al 2004 the number of recent publications involving deeper layers and phytoplankton analysis has increased which could be connected with the application of phytoplankton pigment mainly chlorophyll a and phycocyanin fluorescence probes these reports have shown that the presence of deep phytoplankton maxima is rather the rule than an exception if only considering the light conditions leach et al 2018 the mechanisms of their formation and maintenance described in the literature are complicated and include passive mechanisms such as decreased sinking speed of settling phytoplankton particles remnants of the algal community that was present during a thermally homogenous spring season bramburger and reavie 2016 and active processes such as light and or predation avoidance by motile taxa and the buoyancy mechanism of some cyanobacteria camacho 2006 the primary production in deeper layers of the lake water column can influence the functioning of the entire ecosystem and modify its trophic status leach et al 2018 the issue of the influence of stratification on lake phytoplankton is gaining attention due to climatic changes and their possible effects on the functioning of inland waters e g dokulil et al 2010 kasprzak et al 2017 there has been a large scale increase in lake surface water temperature in central european lakes during the past 50 100 years with potential consequences for a host of physical chemical and biological processes in lakes woolway et al 2017 temperature increases both at the surface and at deeper levels result in changes in physical properties including a decrease in water density viscosity and oxygen concentration this is of great importance for aquatic ecosystems because of the increase in the rate of plankton sedimentation and the modification of the development cycle of aquatic organisms adrian et al 2006 the observed effects of climate warming manifested by the lack of winter ice cover earlier thermocline formation greater thickness of the epilimnion a longer period of thermal stratification and more severe and frequent extreme weather events may be important factors intensifying the eutrophication of lakes dokulil et al 2010 kasprzak et al 2017 research on the thermal regime of lakes indicates a strong relationship between air and surface water temperatures boehrer and schultze 2008 studies conducted in poland lowlands since the 1960s have shown an average air temperature increase of 0 02 0 025 c year 1 lake water temperatures have varied more but also increased by 0 005 0 028 c year 1 dąbrowski et al 2004 the correlation coefficients r vary depending on the studied region and reach up to 0 74 detailed analysis has shown that in the period from 1961 to 2014 the highest mean monthly water temperature increase in lakes from 3 1 to 3 9 c depending on the lake occurred in may marszelewski and pius 2019 the above mentioned results of climate warming influence phytoplankton communities which in turn affects the entire ecosystem prolonged stratification influences hypolimnetic oxygen conditions and dissolved nutrient concentrations oxygen depletion and higher temperatures increase nutrient release at the sediment water interface dokulil et al 2010 in addition extreme weather events intensified by global climate change disrupt lake stratification and may influence the deep chlorophyll layers a phenomenon that can lead to surging eutrophication kasprzak et al 2017 the goal of this paper is to explore the taxonomic composition and functional structure of phytoplankton communities in epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata within lowland mesotrophic lakes of northeastern poland in particular we addressed the following research questions 1 how the range of euphotic zone and the thermocline depth modify the variability of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations 2 does the composition of phytoplankton and trophic preferences of phytoplankton taxa and functional groups rfgs differ between the epilimnetic and metalimnetic strata and 3 how hydromorphological characteristics and environmental features of the water column influence phytoplankton abundance and composition 4 we hypothesized that including metalimnetic samples in analyses affects the values of phytoplankton indices and ecological status classification 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area studies were carried out in nine lakes brożane busznica buwełno długie augustowskie garbaś jegocin kuc majcz wielki and zdrężno situated in the masurian lake district and in the polish part of the lithuanian lake district in northeastern poland fig 1 all studied lakes are lowland ecosystems 200 m above sea level a s l with the surface area exceeding 0 5 km2 or close to it and with high alkalinity 1 0 meq l and non colored water 30 mg pt l they are mostly ribbon shaped water bodies except for the rounded brożane busznica and kuc all dimictic but diverse in morphometric characteristics affecting the thermal structure with a mean depth from 4 7 m to 20 9 m a maximum depth from only 12 0 m to nearly 50 m a fetch length from 838 to 4 800 m and an index of exposure the ratio of lake surface area to its mean depth between 7 3 and 34 table 1 the studied lakes have a mesotrophic status according to carlson trophic state index tsi calculated on the basis of the formulas by carlson 1977 and kratzer and brezonik 1981 table 1 the lakes are mostly under low anthropogenic pressure based on corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 the catchments of six lakes brożane busznica długie augustowskie garbaś jegocin and majcz wielki are more than 80 covered by forests while three water bodies buwełno kuc and zdrężno have catchments dominated by agricultural areas 50 70 of arable lands and pastures 2 2 data collection during the summer stratification period between july 25 and august 15 in 2012 2013 and 2015 eight lakes were sampled twice in different years while lake jegocin was studied three times once in each year water samples were collected separately from the epilimnion and metalimnion layers we used the term epilimnion for an upper stratum of more or less uniformly warm circulating and fairly turbulent water well mixed zone according to wetzel 2001 the depth at which the temperature drop reached 1 c m 1 was adopted as the boundary between epilimnion and metalimnion after lampert and sommer 1996 vertically the metalimnion reached the boundary with isothermal hypolimnion waters continuous strata in which the change in temperature was less than 1 c m 1 however the term thermocline was also applied according to hutchinson 1957 it refers to the depth at which the relatively greatest temperature drop takes place this last definition was applied in the analysis included in this paper according to the approach of nõges et al 2010 following nõges et al 2010 we used the term metalimnion as described above for the relatively thick 3 7 m transitional zone and the term thermocline for just the thin layer of the maximum temperature gradient samples for the chemical and phytoplankton analyses were taken using a limnos sampler 2 dm3 capacity limnos pl komorów poland at the deepest part of each lake and at every 1 m depth within each sampled layer these samples were pooled together to obtain integrated representative and separate samples for the epilimnion and metalimnion simultaneously secchi disc visibility sd was measured the euphotic depth was estimated by multiplying sd by 2 5 the most typical ratio of euphotic zone depth to sd for lakes of northern poland borowiak and borowiak 2016 other field measurements including water temperature t ph conductivity chlorophyll a phycocyanin and oxygen concentration do were measured along the water column every 1 m using a multi parametric probe ysi 650 mds yellow springs oh usa the chemical analysis of soluble nutrients p po4 n no3 and n nh4 and total fractions of phosphorus tp and nitrogen tn were measured in a laboratory using standard methods water for chemical analyses was filtered through whatman gf f glass fibre filter the filter was then ground and extracted with acetone to determine chlorophyll concentration golterman 1969 in filtrate concentration of ammonium ions was analysed with phenylhypochlorite method after solórzano 1969 soluble reactive phosphorus was determined with standard molybdenum blue method golterman 1969 and nitrates with phenyldisulphonic acid standard methods 1960 total kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus were determined after mineralization of unfiltered water with concentrated sulphuric acid golterman 1969 followed by spectrophotometric analyses of resulting ammonium ions and phosphates respectively total nitrogen was a sum of total kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrates concentration besides in situ chlorophyll a fluorescence a traditional measurement of chlorophyll a concentrations from epilimnion and metalimnion samples was done in the laboratory the process involves filtering water through whatman gf c filters on the day of sampling extraction in 90 acetone goltherman 1969 and determination by a spectrophotometric method nusch 1980 chlorophyll a was measured to estimate the absolute concentrations and to assess the trophic state of the lake phytoplankton samples were fixed with lugol s solution and preserved with 4 formalin microscopic analysis of phytoplankton abundance and biomass was done following the utermöhl method 1958 for counting the samples were transferred to a settling chamber and at least 100 individuals i e the so called units which were single cells cenobia colonies and filaments of the most numerous algae were counted per sample as described by lund 1958 the units were calculated for different magnification levels large taxa were calculated for 100 fold magnification inspecting the whole bottom of the chamber and so were medium sized ones under 200 fold magnification in 2 4 slant belts and nanoplankton under 400 fold magnification in 100 fields biovolumes mm3 l 1 were determined according to hillebrand et al 1999 and converted to biomass mg fresh weight l 1 for taxonomic analysis additional samples were obtained with a 20 µm plankton net for these samples the phytoplankton species were determined under a light microscope zeiss axio imager a2 zeiss oberkochen germany using 200 fold 400 fold and 1000 fold magnification levels with immersion oil from living and formalin glycerin mixture fixed samples phytoplankton taxa were determined on the basis of identification keys e g john et al 2005 komárek 2013 komárek and agnostidis 1999 2005 hindák 2008 picińska fałtynowicz and błachuta 2012 2 3 data analysis a total of 38 samples for physicochemical and phytoplankton analysis were collected the influence of morphometric and trophic factors on the position of the epilimnion thermocline and chlorophyll a in the water column was tested by multiple regression analysis using statistica 10 0 pl software the phytoplankton composition was analyzed at the level of the main taxonomic groups individual genera and reynolds functional groups rfgs the classical and the most widely used system of functional classification of phytoplankton by reynolds et al 2002 and its update by padisák et al 2009 was used to classify phytoplankton taxa into rfgs the rfgs contributing more than 5 to the total biomass were used for subsequent analysis the functional approach explains well the variability of phytoplankton under different environmental conditions moreover it reduces the structural complexity from a wide range of species to a few rfgs cellamare et al 2013 to decide which ordination method linear or unimodal is appropriate the gradient lengths was established by detrended correspondence analysis dca the longest gradient represented by the first axis was 3 173 standard deviations which enabled unimodal analysis of these dataset to reveal the relationships between environmental variables and rfgs canonical correspondence analysis cca with the monte carlo permutation test was performed in the next step the cca and permutation test were performed using canoco v 4 5 ter braak and smilauer 2002 a principal components analysis pca on the correlation matrix was performed to choose the environmental variables which were most strongly associated with each of the principal axes to avoid multicollinearity the following variables were used temperature the index of exposure and the fetch length as morphology indicators the euphotic zone depth to reflect light conditions and tp and tp concentrations as trophic parameters 2 4 phytoplankton indices we assumed that the taxonomic structure of phytoplankton settled in the deeper layers of the water column is important for the ecological functioning of water bodies and can influence their ecological status thus to test the effect of the sampling design on the result of bioassessment several indices regarding phytoplankton taxonomy in summer stratification period were chosen the ti index pasztaleniec 2016 based on trophic optima and the q index padisák et al 2006 based on rfgs defined by reynolds et al 2002 were used for ecological status estimations of the studied lakes the ti index eq 1 value presented in this paper is the average of normalized ecological quality ratios eqrs of two trophic indices namely titp eq 2 and titn eq 3 supplementary material those are calculated based on sets of optima for tp and for tn separately for each sample using the ln optima sjtp or sjtn respectively of all taxa in a given sample with their square root transformed proportional biomass as weights a j trophic index values were converted to normalized eqrs according to eq 4 and eq 5 which are recommended for stratified lakes pasztaleniec 2016 1 ti e q r t i t p e q r t i t n 2 2 t i t p j 1 n a j s

follows 0 0 32 bad 0 32 0 39 poor 0 39 0 47 moderate 0 47 0 59 good and 0 59 1 00 high the q index eq 6 is based on the relative share of rfgs in the total biomass pi multiplied by a numerical factor f defined for each codon considering the phytoplankton assemblage likely to occur in a reference type factor number changes from 0 to 5 lower f values are assigned to groups preferring a lower trophy higher values characterize groups in high trophy conditions pre determining the f factor which defines the q index is the crucial step following the steps recommended by padisák et al 2006 for applying the q index the f factor was adopted for each rfg occurring in the studied lakes because none of the lake typologies described by padisák et al 2006 corresponded exactly to the studied lakes the f factor was determined on the basis of expert knowledge reported in table 3 6 q i 1 n p i f the index number that results from the equation given above ranges between 0 and 5 of which according classification system can be understood at 0 1 bad 1 2 poor 2 3 moderate 3 4 good 4 5 high 3 results 3 1 environmental features of the water column in all lakes including the relatively shallow lake długie augustowskie maximum depth 12 m typical stratification developed during the study with an upper well heated and oxygenated epilimnion layer a metalimnion layer and a zone of cold hypolimnetic water the lakes showed variation in the depth of the epilimnion and the depth of the thermocline the thickness of the epilimnion was between 4 and 8 m while the depth of the thermocline location ranged from 5 to 9 m from the surface however the vertical temperature profiles were variable and changed from year to year in the same lake table 1 the surface layer temperatures in all the lakes exceeded 20 c at the depth of 4 8 m there was a rapid decrease in temperature 1 c m 1 and in the metalimnion the temperature ranged from 10 to 15 c table 2 the surface layer was always saturated with oxygen the mean metalimnetic oxygen concentration was usually lower than in the epilimnion but a positive heterograde curve was often observed especially in lake jegocin table 2 fig 2 as a result of declining intensities of photosynthesis and organic matter decomposition with depth a slight lake specific decrease in ph and an increase in specific conductance between the epilimnion and metalimnion appeared the average water ph varied from 7 1 to 7 9 the lowest average conductivity of 157 μs cm 1 was in the epilimnion of lake busznica the maximum value was found in the metalimnion of lake buwełno 389 μs cm 1 and the difference within the same lake did not exceed several dozen units comparing the mean values of chemical and biological trophic parameters tp tn chlorophyll a and total biomass there was an increase in their concentrations in the metalimnion in most of the studied lakes table 2 the in situ profile measurements of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin fluorescence enabled more detailed depiction of changes in algal abundance along the water column depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability the maximum values of phytoplankton pigments can be located differently generally in four lakes buwełno długie augustowskie majcz wielki and zdrężno the euphotic zone did not reach the thermocline and the highest phytoplankton density developed above the thermocline level at the bottom of the euphotic zone type i fig 2 and 3 the second combination of vertical thermal and light profiles was characterized by a euphotic zone reaching beyond the thermocline and the maximum chlorophyll a concentration occurred above the thermocline busznica kuc and garbaś in 2012 moreover the highest concentration of algae at the thermocline was often accompanied by an almost equal algal density in the epilimnion type ii fig 2 and 3 in the third category the euphotic zone was much greater than the epilimnion and the peak of chlorophyll a was located considerably below from 2 to 6 m the thermocline brożane jegocin garbaś in 2015 type iii fig 2 and 3 the multiple regression considering the significance of the effects of morphometric and trophic factors independent variables on the vertical position of the maximum chlorophyll a concentration dependent variable in the water column indicated that only the euphotic zone range was significant f1 34 24 5 p 0 00002 and explained r2 adj 67 of the variability of the chlorophyll a peak position however the index of exposure and the thermocline depth had the greatest influence on

were taxa belonging to chrysophyceae euglenophyceae or xanthophyceae fig 4 cyanobacteria were a permanent component of phytoplankton communities their percentage share ranged from 20 to 90 among them the most abundant species were filamentous cyanobacteria planktothrix agardhii gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 planktolyngbya limnetica lemmermann komárková legnerová cronberg 1992 pseudanabaena

members of the chroococcus nägeli 1849 and aphanocapsa nägeli 1849 genera the second most abundant taxonomic group with regard to the total biomass were chlorophytes reaching a maximum contribution of 70 the chlorophytes with the highest relative share in the total biomass were colony forming species namely botryococcus braunii kützing 1849 eudorina elegans ehrenberg 1832 coenococcus planctonicus korshikov 1953 and oocystis lacustris chodat 1897 while the most common chlorophyta were small unicellular chlorococcales taxa such as desmodesmus communis e hegewald e hegewald 2000 monoraphidium tortile west g s west komárková legnerová 1969 tetraëdron minimum a braun hansgirg 1889 and desmids from the genera closterium nitzsch ex ralfs 1848 and cosmarium corda ex ralfs 1848 the widespread planktonic algae identified in all lakes or in the vast majority of them were the cryptophytes of the cryptomonas ehrenberg 1831 and rhodomonas karsten 1898 genera usually constituting over 12 of the total biomass and dinophytes such as ceratium hirundinella o f müller dujardin 1841 and peridinium ehrenberg 1830 with a percentage share from 10 to 40 the contribution of bacillariophyta was diverse in many samples they were present only in small amount a few percent but in some cases diatoms reached nearly 40 of the total biomass in general both in the epilimnetic and metalimnetic layers of all the studied lakes the main taxonomic groups mentioned above were most abundant however the phytoplankton community structure quite often differed between the strata within the same lake fig 4 more accurate analyses of phytoplankton community structure following reynolds functional classification revealed functional differentiation of the community between the epilimnion and metalimnion in diverse assemblages along vertical temperature and light gradients fig 5 table 3 commonly occurring functional assemblages included the rfgs lo f and y species of lo were a persistent element of phytoplankton occurring in almost all the studied lakes in the epilimnion and the metalimnion only in the metalimnetic phytoplankton of three lakes długie augustowskie majcz wielki and zdrężno in 2012 did the share of the lo rfg not exceed 5 of the total biomass this codon included dinophyceae taxa among them peridinium spp and or c hirundinella and also gyrodinium helveticum penard y takano t

example from the aphanothece and chroococcus genera as well as c pusillum were more abundant in the epilimnion while a conferta a holsatica and m tenuissima were more abundant in metalimnetic phytoplankton table 3 the f rfg was higher 5 in the epilimnion of nine water bodies and in the metalimnion of six while the y rfg was higher in the epilimnion of seven water bodies and the metalimnion of four water bodies fig 4 there were three main representatives of f b braunii o lacustris and in one lake westella botryoides west de wildeman 1897 metalimnion of lake busznica the considerable percentage share of b braunii up to 60 70 and o lacustris a maximum of a few percent was observed both in the epilimnion and metalimnion regardless of the type of the noticed chlorophyll vertical profile the distribution of the y rfg cryptomonas spp and small gymnodinium species was rather uniform along the lakes and the water column but the relative biomass of taxa relevant to this group usually did not exceed a few percent fig 5 table 3 the j rfg was observed only in the surface layer and mainly in lakes characterized by type i stratification where the thermocline depth overruns the euphotic zone the biomass of the j rfg reached a considerable percentage share 43 in one water body lake majcz wielki another rfg that achieved a 5 biomass level in this type of lakes was lm dominated by c hirundinella and ceratium furcoides levander langhans 1925 together with microcystis lemmermann 1907 species just like the j rfg the lm rfg was observed almost exclusively in the epilimnion of lakes with type i thermo light stratification buwełno majcz wielki and zdrężno however its amount was rather low between 6 and 12 the b rfg centric diatoms appeared in most of surface samples from type i lakes but its share of 12 was also sporadically noted in other water bodies both in the epilimnion and metalimnion fig 5 the association that typically characterized metalimnetic layers of stratified lakes especially with a type i vertical profile was the s1 rfg the metalimnetic codon r according to padisák et al 2009 this group was mainly composed of three species planktothrix agardhii p limnetica and p limnetica and in one lake lake długie augustowskie leptolyngbya fragilis gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 the s1 r codon reached from about 10 to more than 90 of the total biomass in the metalimnion among other lakes this group was recognized in considerable amounts 36 only in lake brożane with the representative p aghardii and a small amount 5 4 in lake jegocin in 2012 due to romeria m koczwara 1932 the taxa of this group were almost absent in the epilimnion except for lake długie augustowskie in which p limnetica constituted about 10 of the total phytoplankton biomass in 2012 fig 4 table 3 the h1 rfg reached relatively great abundance 6 54 in the metalimnetic phytoplankton community mainly in type ii lakes this rfg was represented primarily by different dolichospermum species table 3 the only lake in which h1 prevailed in the epilimnion up to 75 was lake kuc fig 5 among the rarest rfgs noted in summer samples of the studied lakes was n tabellaria fenestrata lyngbye kützing 1844 and small desmids this group occurred in the epilimnion and metalimnion of lake busznica lake brożane and lake jegocin and in the metalimnion of lake buwełno and lake kuc a few rfgs noted only in one or two lakes were not included in individual analysis although their biomass slightly exceeded 5 of the total phytoplankton biomass this refers to w2 observed in both studied strata of lake długie augustowskie representatives euglena texta dujardin hübner 1886 and phacus dujardin 1841 and in the metalimnion of lake majcz wielki trachelomonas volvocinopsis svirenko 1914 p closterium acutum brébisson 1848 in the epilimnion of lake długie augustowskie and also x2 rhodomonas spp in the epilimnion and metalimnion of lake buwełno 3 3 phytoplankton functional environmental relationships the cca results based on the rfg approach indicated that all the applied environmental factors explained 27 of phytoplankton functional variability the monte carlo permutation test of conditional effects indicated that the most important factor for phytoplankton groups distribution was the euphotic depth f 2 73 λ 0 16 p 0 020 followed by temperature f 2 56 λ 0 14 p 0 018 other parameters did not reach the 0 05 threshold of statistical significance the considered parameters differentiated epilimnetic and metalimnetic samples the variable crucial for this distribution was temperature negatively correlated with the first axis r 0 36 and positively correlated with the second axis r 0 31 the longest vector characterized the exposure index that was the main determinant separating the samples on axis 2 r 0 46 the exposure index together with nutrient concentrations tn and tp and fetch length positively correlated with axis 1 r 0 47 r 0 32 and r 0 24 respectively and differentiated lakes with a euphotic to thermocline depth zeu zthc ratio below and not much above 1 among all samples those representing the type i thermo light profile are distinguished while samples from types ii and iii water bodies are mixed fig 6 a the latter ones represent lakes of lower a trophy and with a deeper euphotic zone the euphotic depth was negatively correlated with the tn and tp concentration its correlation coefficient with the first axis was r 0 43 the first cca axis related to nutrient increase was positively associated with the s1 rfg and negatively with the f rfg fig 6b the positive end of axis 2 related mainly to temperature increase included the j b and lm rfgs characterizing epilimnetic samples two groups j and lm were close to type i stratification samples the lo n and h1 rfgs exhibited a relationship with metalimnetic samples of types ii and iii stratification 3 4 ecological status assessment and phytoplankton distribution in the water column in most cases the values of the applied indices ti index and q index decreased when they were calculated based on epilimnetic and metalimnetic data and not only epilimnetic data fig 7 supplementary material this tendency was particularly apparent in lakes characterized by type i vertical thermal and light profiles where the r rfg with high trophic preferences predominated in metalimnion communities fig 5 table 3 depending on the location of the index value within the class boundaries its increase or decrease had an impact on the final classification result or the change in the value was not reflected in the change of the ecological status due to the fact that both indices decrease with ecological status deterioration including data from deeper metalimnetic layers of the water column in the most cases yielded worse ecological status assessment the exceptions are lake majcz wielki in 2012 and lake kuc in 2013 where the f rfg typical for mesotrophic conditions occurred in greater abundance in the metalimnetic compared with the epilimnetic phytoplankton community 4 discussion in mesotrophic lakes of considerable depth phytoplankton distribution and composition are differentiated through the water column in summer due to the development of stratification and at the same time good light conditions in deeper water strata in these lakes the highest concentration of algae may appear primarily in the metalimnetic zone where it may be a reflection of the epilimnetic community structure or may present a rebuilt different phytoplankton assemblage bramburger and reavie 2016 cullen 1982 leach et al 2018 reynolds 1992 yoshiyama et al 2009 the accumulation of phytoplankton in the metalimnion appears especially when cyanobacteria tolerating dim light for the sake of better nutrient availability find habitat conditions favorable for development lenard 2009 padisák et al 2003 wojciechowska et al 2004 the crucial factor for deep phytoplankton formation especially its thickness and depth is water transparency leach et al 2018 nevertheless as leach et al 2018 demonstrated based on research of 100 lakes located in different regions of the world the relative importance of light and thermal stratification for the development of phytoplankton in deeper layers is not uniform across diverse lake types in the investigated polish lakes the maximum chlorophyll a concentration in the water column was significantly explained by the depth of the euphotic zone and the maximum depth of the lake nõges et al 2010 developed a model of prediction of a deep chlorophyll maximum occurrence for european lakes according to this model there is a clear relationship between the maximum effective length mel of the lake and the zeu zthc ratio in very large lakes mel 100 km the euphotic depth always remains smaller than the thermocline depth independent of the sd depth in medium sized water bodies mel 10 km if the sd is 5 m the euphotic depth should mostly remain above the thermocline but in transparent lakes its depth exceeds the mixed layer a deep chlorophyll layer appears mainly when sufficient light levels for photosynthesis reach deeper strata than the thermocline depth so if the zeu zthc ratio is 1 there is a high probability of the existence of chlorophyll peaks nõges et al 2010 the studied polish lakes were mostly small with the maximum lake length of a few kilometers and the exposure index appeared to be a better morphometric predictor for the deep chlorophyll peaks occurrence spearman rank coefficient 0 58 p 0 0001 than the zeu zthc ratio in general all lakes characterized by a exposure index value 25 had a relatively thinner euphotic zone that did not reach the thermocline level type i vertical profile fig 2 unlike the italian lakes investigated by nõges et al 2010 in the studied polish lakes chlorophyll maxima were noted even when the euphotic depth was smaller than the thermocline depth and sd ranged between 1 8 and 3 5 m fig 8 their location relative to the thermocline could be different as is common in water bodies with good water transparency the metalimnetic maximum of algae was usually placed just above the thermocline where there is the largest barrier of water density and the best supply of nutrients type i and ii thermal and light vertical profiles fig 2 however with high water transparency the thickness of the euphotic layer may even reach the hypolimnion and the chlorophyll peak will appear significantly below the thermocline as it was observed in lake jegocin representing the type iii stratification fig 2 the taxonomic composition of the planktonic algae in the epilimnion and metalimnion may be similar in the same water body but more often the phytoplankton species and functional structure differ between thermal layers the changes in phytoplankton community become well visible using the functional approach as the taxa belonging to the same rfg respond in a similar way to environmental variables such as the light regime mixing depth and nutrient concentrations cellamare et al 2013 in the studied lakes two rfgs j and lm were primarily associated with the epilimnetic waters j consisting of non gelatinous and non motile chlorococcales was identified as 5 share of the total biomass in the upper layer of four lakes while lm appeared in only three lakes and the biomass did not exceed 0 6 mg l 1 both mentioned rfgs prefer warm waters and are typical for eutrophic or even hypertrophic lakes in the summer reynolds et al 2002 salmaso et al 2015 the absence of common occurrence of the j and lm rfgs is associated with the rather low trophic status of the studied lakes while j and lm have higher trophic requirements the tp optima for these rfgs representatives are usually well over 30 µg l 1 and the tn optima range from 0 88 to 1 12 mg l 1 pasztaleniec 2016 a dominant characteristic in the metalimnion of lakes with a low euphotic to mixing zone zeu zthc ratio was the s1 rfg this codon was originally characterized as typical for shallow enriched lakes reynolds et al 2002 according to padisák et al 2009 if the s1 occurs in deeper layers of water column these species should be grouped in the r rfg like planktothrix rubescens de candolle ex gomont anagnostidis komárek 1988 the typical r habitat template is during the stratification in the metalimnion or upper hypolimnion of deep oligo mesotrophic lakes in the studied water bodies representing the type i vertical profile with zeu zthc 1 the planktothrix genus was the most common actually achieving high percentages up to 92 in the metalimnetic biomass considerable abundance of the s1 rfg in the metalimnion 36 share of planktothrix also appeared once in the lake characterized by type iii stratification lake brożane in 2015 however besides p aghardii there were significant numbers of other filamentous cyanobacteria representatives of the s1 rfg such as planktolyngbya leptolyngbya and pseudanabaena s1 species are tolerant of low light and can create a dense population near the boundary of the euphotic zone where only about 1 of light is available wojciechowska et al 2004 the second typical cyanobacterial rfg that reached a great share in the metalimnion from 5 5 to 54 was h1 consisting of species belonging to the order nostocales these species are tolerant of low nitrogen but sensitive to poor light conditions reynolds et al 2002 so they are more common as a metalimnetic community component in lakes with types ii and iii stratification where the chlorophyll maxima occurred much above the lower boundary of the euphotic zone although the h1 rfg is described as characteristic of more eutrophic waters the identified species dominated phytoplankton at rather low nutrients concentrations it should perhaps be considered whether the identified species belong to the h2 rfg which represents mesotrophic water bodies padisák et al 2009 reynolds et al 2002 nonetheless it is questionable because among the identified species there are no typical h2 representatives dolichospermum lemmermannii and or gloeotrichia echinulata mentioned by other authors padisák et al 2009 the representatives of the lo rfg include motile dinoflagellates tolerant to nutrient deficiency padisák et al 2009 and occur preferably in stable conditions usually in the summer epilimnia and metalimnia of temperate lakes miracle et al 1992 reynolds et al 2002 they were most often identified in all the studied lakes regardless of the water column layer the f and b rfgs also had notably high abundances the f rfg generally has substantially higher light requirement than planktonic cyanobacteria or many chlorophyte taxa thus it can develop better in clear waters huszar et al 2003 indeed there was a correlation between f and water transparency in addition f had a negative correlation with tp and tn and a positive correlation with water temperature this group appeared mainly in the epilimnion of the studied lakes but in a few cases it also reached a considerable share in the metalimnetic biomass if the light was sufficient small sized diatoms from the b rfg appeared occasionally in the phytoplankton community throughout the water column this rfg has high nutrient use efficiency and low light requirements so they are fast growing species but they need constant mixing and are susceptible to sedimentation padisák et al 2009 reynolds et al 2002 however due to passive sinking from the spring community centric diatoms may also occur in deeper layers for example in the laurentian great lakes bramburger and reave 2016 in lakes involved in the research none of the metalimnia were dominated emphatically by taxa belonging to cryptophytes y a phenomenon that had been reported by other authors e g camacho 2006 the complicated mechanisms of phytoplankton of deeper layers formation and maintenance and the multipronged processes that underlie their occurrence cause differentiation of the metalimnetic phytoplankton community structure the are some advantages that favor algal development in deep water layers such as the ability to cope with low light availability due to the presence of phycoerythrocyanin an important component of the light harvesting complex the ability to fine tune their buoyancy and or the ability to fix n2 in addition the high surface volume ratio allows efficient light harvesting dokulil and teubner 2000 cyanobacteria maxima in the metalimnion have been noted in other polish lakes even at very low oxygen content lenard 2009 wojciechowska et al 2004 the phytoplankton communities of deep layers may represent a large portion of the water column chlorophyll and can be responsible for much of the primary production of a lake bramburger and reave 2016 scofield et al 2020 moreover the photo acclimation of the phytoplankton living in deep layers occurs by which phototrophs can increase the chlorophyll content per cell cullen 1982 this phenomenon may result in vertical separation of biomass and chlorophyll maxima e g felip and catalán 2000 thus as noted by bramburger and rave 2016 chlorophyll a concentrations estimated by in situ fluorescence are not necessarily reliable indicators of phytoplankton biomass 5 conclusions our findings demonstrate the importance of the vertical thermal and light profile on summer phytoplankton communities the maximum values of phytoplankton pigments can be located differently depending on the type of thermal stratification and light availability the highest algal concentration may appear primarily in the metalimnetic zone where it may be a reflection of the epilimnetic community composition or may present a rebuilt different phytoplankton assemblage it can be assumed that vertical heterogeneity is one of the sources of uncertainty that affects the reliability of the ecological status assessment based on phytoplankton the methodological implication of our findings is that the vertical distribution of phytoplankton can influence the lake ecological status and a reliable sampling strategy should be designed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

994,this paper summarises the evolution of unesco s ecohydrology programme during the last 25 years within the different phases of the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp but focuses particularly on its implementation during ihp viii phase from 2014 to 2021 the ecohydrology programme is steered by a scientific advisory committee composed of internationally well known scientists from all over the world which promote strategic directions and new scientific dimensions design activities to be undertaken as well as program execution and communication of scientific advances and lessons learnt within the programme it also especially takes advantage of the considerable and essential contribution of members of the unesco water family in particular from water centres and chairs dedicated to ecohydrology the paper also describes the major milestones obtained during the eight years of implementation going through the major activities organized in the framework of the dissemination of the concept within different scientific networks international conferences trainings workshop publications as well as major innovative trends the programme accounted for the covid 19 outbreak greatly impacted the execution of the programme during 2020 and 2021 as major international events and activities were cancelled or postponed one of the programme s responses was the organization of the ecohydrology online open courses eh ooc on a dedicated platform 1 introduction the ecohydrology programme entered into the plan of the former international hydrological programme ihp in 1996 during its fifth phase ihp v named hydrology and water resources development in a vulnerable environment from 1996 to 2001 theme 2 of ihp v was dedicated to ecohydrological processes in the surficial environment which main aim was the conservation of the natural resources especially land and water to assist in sustainable development to achieve this objective two major areas in need of exploration were defined which would lead to a better understanding of the vulnerability of the land water system to human activities such as a land use erosion and sedimentation b preservation and restoration of rivers and wetlands four strategic projects were proposed within theme 2 namely 2 1 vegetation land use and erosion processes 2 2 sedimentation processes in reservoirs and deltas 2 3 interactions between river systems flood plains and wetlands and 2 4 comprehensive assessment of the surficial eco hydrological processes while projects 2 1 and 2 2 were mainly dedicated to sedimentation and erosion processes projects 2 3 and 2 4 were focusing on the understanding of the role of the hydrological cycle in different ecosystems to identify links between abiotic and biotic indicators in order to maintain the filtering capacities of flood plains and wetlands with respect to sediment nutrients and pollutants and the buffering capacity against extreme hydrological events they were also used to develop an integrated approach for managing the surficial eco hydrological environment including the consideration of non structural measures and improve the methodology for water ecosystem vulnerability assessment important publications in the unesco technical documents in hydrology series have shown the trans disciplinary character of ecohydrology and the idea of enhancement of catchment sustainability potential by dual regulation of water biota interplay this is using as a reference point the theoretical models which integrate hydrological and ecological processes such as the abiotic biotic regulatory continuum concept zalewski and naiman 1985 the enhancement of monitoring and control of hydrological processes towards enhancement of resistance and resilience of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic stress by restoration of their homeostasis hydrology as the most important regulatory tool and moderation of nutrient loads and catastrophic flood peaks by biotic communities zalewski et al 1997 while the fifth phase ihp v 1996 2001 was set out to stimulate a stronger interrelation between scientific research application and education the sixth phase ihp vi 2002 2007 water interaction systems at risks and social challenges was based on the fundamental principle that freshwater is as essential to sustainable development as it is to life and that water beyond its geophysical chemical biological function in the hydrological cycle has social economic and environmental values that are inter linked and mutually supportive in the transition from ihp v and vi phases the notion of dual regulation was conceptualised and started to take place in the application of solutions to provide responses to the already occurring challenging on ecosystems zalewski 2000 chícharo et al 2006 the dual regulation is based on the interaction between hydrology and biota and on the understanding of the hydrological and biological processes interplay at scales from the catchment to molecular processes therefore improving knowledge has been fundamental to using ecosystem properties as management tools for improving water resources and maintaining biodiversity zalewski 1999 in ihp vi the ecohydrology programme was embedded in theme 3 land habitat hydrology composed of 5 focal areas namely drylands wetlands mountains small islands and coastal zones urban areas and rural settlements aimed to further develop ecohydrology as an interdisciplinary approach at landform land use scale further development of ecohydrology in this framework was initiated in africa harper zalewski 2001 harper and mavuti 2004 asia hehanussa 2002 and latin america zalewski mcclain 1998 in 2006 ten demonstration sites were established in different parts of the globe asia pacific latin america africa and europe where the ecohydrology approach showed that ecosystem properties and water dynamics can be managed to maximise their synergistic interactions and optimize ecosystem s resilience to human induced stress with the use of nature based solutions for publication related to ihp vi see references the seventh phase ihp vii 2008 2013 water dependencies systems under stress and societal responses was designed to make a seamless transition from phase vi s water interactions to water dependencies there is good scientific evidence that within the natural as well as the built systems there are interdependencies connected by water un wwdr 2018 further there is a direct causal link between the quantity and quality of the water delivered to an ecosystem that may be undergoing stress theme 3 of ihp vii ecohydrology for sustainability was completely dedicated to ecohydrology with four focal areas namely 3 1 ecological measures to protect and remediate catchment processes 3 2 improving ecosystem quality and services by combining structural solutions with ecological biotechnologies 3 3 risk based environmental management and accounting and 3 4 groundwater dependent ecosystem identification inventory and assessment the overall objectives of the theme were to contribute to a better understanding of water as both an abiotic resource and a service delivered by ecosystem processes which will help to identify quantify and improve the critical interrelationships between water and biota necessary for sustainability particularly in critical ecosystems arid and semi arid zones coastal areas and estuaries and urbanized areas in 2011 32 demonstration site projects were presented grouped into four different categories global reference projects operational projects evolving projects and emerging project the current eight phase ihp viii 2014 2021 addresses the overarching theme water security responses to local regional and global challenges this phase was designed to be implemented through a progressive transition from phase vii and by capitalizing on the lessons learned from phase vi and the results achieved during previous phases of the programme within the context of water security the themes of ihp viii address managing water scarcity water quality and pollution control adaptation to the impacts of global change and natural disasters on water resources management and protection policy of groundwater resources for sustainable living and poverty reduction in developing countries and in arid and semi arid regions and small islands integration of catchment scale ecohydrological concepts and processes in advanced water management models management of water resources for human settlements of the future and water education as a key element to attain water security in addition to the themes this phase has considered certain cross cutting issues including iwrm transboundary or shared waters global change and the human dimension and governance of water theme 5 of ihp viii ecohydrology engineering harmony for a sustainable world is subdivided into 5 focal areas the first 3 aligned with the three ecohydrology principles quantification of hydrological processes quantification of ecological processes and ecological engineering or harmonization between hydrotechnical and ecological infrastructures focal areas 4 and 5 refer to urban ecohydrology and restoring continental to coastal connectivity respectively the concept is based on the theory to regulate hydrological and nutrients cycles in novel ecosystems agricultural and urban catchments towards the enhancement of carrying capacity of global ecosystems carrying capacity enhancement is understood as the improvement of ecosystem properties such as water resources biodiversity ecosystem services for societies the resilience to increasing various forms of impact including climate change culture and education wbsr ce kiedrzyńska et al 2021 zalewski 2014 2015 as a follow up of the publication of the world water development report 2018 nature based solution for water nbs ecohydrology has considerably experienced a higher interest at all levels due to the long time use of ecohydrological nbs in solving complex issues related to the regulation of aquatic ecosystems and the use of ecosystem properties as management tools for water resources management and sustainability zalewski 2000 have gained particular interest studying linked ecosystem properties and understanding actual stress situations gives the opportunity to delineate predictive potential for their rehabilitation and consequent provision of those services needed by both nature and humans understanding of processes from molecular to catchment scale is a bedrock of the holistic ecohydrological solutions during ihp viii innovative molecular tools based on dna sequencing were introduced for the study of microbial processes in ecohydrology microbial biofilms are crucial elements in carbon and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems fazi et al 2016 by studying their structural and functional characteristics their activity state and metabolism and relating these characteristics with the hydrological characteristic of the basin i e water retention time one can better understand the interplay between water flow and ecological processes this is crucial not only to better understand ecosystem functioning but also to set up ecohydrological applications i e reconstructed wetlands buffer zones sequential biofiltration systems or river revitalization where one can play with the water retention time in order to enhance the carrying capacity of the system and to speed up specific ecological processes 2 scientific advisory committee of unesco s ecohydrology

apply ecohydrology solutions in watersheds at all scales integrating the concept of enhanced ecosystem potential with ecohydrological strategies to achieve sustainability of ecosystems closely related with water to improve both integrated water resource management iwrm and the ecosystems potential on specific areas ihp s work on ecohydrology through the demonstration sites promotes the use of the interactions between biota and hydrology and humans to regulate remediate and conserve ecosystems to stabilize and improve the quality of water resources implementation of ecohydrology is undertaken through harmonization with existing and planned hydrotechnical hydroengineering infrastructures and focuses on opportunities to harness the natural processes that regulate various elements of the water cycle which have become collectively known as nature based solutions nbs for water new guidelines for ecohydrology demosites were developed in 2015 and have been adopted by 19 countries in 28 demonstration sites established worldwide to validate and quantify the effectiveness of ecohydrological solutions ecohydrology ihp org the results obtained by the demonstration sites are also seen as key milestones for the monitoring of indicators to comply with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development with regard to sdg 6 on water with particular reference to targets 6 5 water resource management iwrm and 6 6 ecosystems these sites are there to take advantage of the potential of nature based solutions to ensure adequate water supplies to support food production and to help minimize the risk of water related disasters the goal of ecohydrology as it is practiced at unesco is emphasizing that nature is not necessarily a threat but the solution to many of our challenges major issues addressed by the demonstration sites are pollutants and nutrients water abstraction water management intensive land use floods droughts habitat loss invasive species loss of retention capacity of vegetation in the application of ecohydrology there are 4 ecohydrology engineering solutions faunatechnology phytotechnology hydrological flow and ecohydrological hydrotechnical hydroengineering

education and dissemination 4 1 ecohydrology online open courses one of the programme s responses to covid 19 was the organization of the ecohydrology online open courses eh ooc on a dedicated platform ecohydrology ihp org and cih moodle platform these were launched on 5 november 2020 and consist of an introduction to the ecohydrology programme and 3 modules fundamental of ecohydrology application of ecohydrology and trans disciplinarity for ecohydrology for a total of 11 lectures in english as of june 2021 the 3 modules and 11 related lectures were translated in spanish and french and a certification process was put in place to acknowledge the course participants 4 2 ecohydrology web platform a ecohydrology web platform ecohydrology ihp org was established in 2015 together with the international centre for hydroinformatics cih brazil and paraguay and entered into operation in the middle of 2016 the ecohydrology web platform contains a demosite card for each of the 28 sites a harmonized normalised and simplified visualisation of the main characteristics achievements and results obtained by each site presented on a single page it has different functions and among others the

994,this paper summarises the evolution of unesco s ecohydrology programme during the last 25 years within the different phases of the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp but focuses particularly on its implementation during ihp viii phase from 2014 to 2021 the ecohydrology programme is steered by a scientific advisory committee composed of internationally well known scientists from all over the world which promote strategic directions and new scientific dimensions design activities to be undertaken as well as program execution and communication of scientific advances and lessons learnt within the programme it also especially takes advantage of the considerable and essential contribution of members of the unesco water family in particular from water centres and chairs dedicated to ecohydrology the paper also describes the major milestones obtained during the eight years of implementation going through the major activities organized in the framework of the dissemination of the concept within different scientific networks international conferences trainings workshop publications as well as major innovative trends the programme accounted for the covid 19 outbreak greatly impacted the execution of the programme during 2020 and 2021 as major international events and activities were cancelled or postponed one of the programme s responses was the organization of the ecohydrology online open courses eh ooc on a dedicated platform 1 introduction the ecohydrology programme entered into the plan of the former international hydrological programme ihp in 1996 during its fifth phase ihp v named hydrology and water resources development in a vulnerable environment from 1996 to 2001 theme 2 of ihp v was dedicated to ecohydrological processes in the surficial environment which main aim was the conservation of the natural resources especially land and water to assist in sustainable development to achieve this objective two major areas in need of exploration were defined which would lead to a better understanding of the vulnerability of the land water system to human activities such as a land use erosion and sedimentation b preservation and restoration of rivers and wetlands four strategic projects were proposed within theme 2 namely 2 1 vegetation land use and erosion processes 2 2 sedimentation processes in reservoirs and deltas 2 3 interactions between river systems flood plains and wetlands and 2 4 comprehensive assessment of the surficial eco hydrological processes while projects 2 1 and 2 2 were mainly dedicated to sedimentation and erosion processes projects 2 3 and 2 4 were focusing on the understanding of the role of the hydrological cycle in different ecosystems to identify links between abiotic and biotic indicators in order to maintain the filtering capacities of flood plains and wetlands with respect to sediment nutrients and pollutants and the buffering capacity against extreme hydrological events they were also used to develop an integrated approach for managing the surficial eco hydrological environment including the consideration of non structural measures and improve the methodology for water ecosystem vulnerability assessment important publications in the unesco technical documents in hydrology series have shown the trans disciplinary character of ecohydrology and the idea of enhancement of catchment sustainability potential by dual regulation of water biota interplay this is using as a reference point the theoretical models which integrate hydrological and ecological processes such as the abiotic biotic regulatory continuum concept zalewski and naiman 1985 the enhancement of monitoring and control of hydrological processes towards enhancement of resistance and resilience of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic stress by restoration of their homeostasis hydrology as the most important regulatory tool and moderation of nutrient loads and catastrophic flood peaks by biotic communities zalewski et al 1997 while the fifth phase ihp v 1996 2001 was set out to stimulate a stronger interrelation between scientific research application and education the sixth phase ihp vi 2002 2007 water interaction systems at risks and social challenges was based on the fundamental principle that freshwater is as essential to sustainable development as it is to life and that water beyond its geophysical chemical biological function in the hydrological cycle has social economic and environmental values that are inter linked and mutually supportive in the transition from ihp v and vi phases the notion of dual regulation was conceptualised and started to take place in the application of solutions to provide responses to the already occurring challenging on ecosystems zalewski 2000 chícharo et al 2006 the dual regulation is based on the interaction between hydrology and biota and on the understanding of the hydrological and biological processes interplay at scales from the catchment to molecular processes therefore improving knowledge has been fundamental to using ecosystem properties as management tools for improving water resources and maintaining biodiversity zalewski 1999 in ihp vi the ecohydrology programme was embedded in theme 3 land habitat hydrology composed of 5 focal areas namely drylands wetlands mountains small islands and coastal zones urban areas and rural settlements aimed to further develop ecohydrology as an interdisciplinary approach at landform land use scale further development of ecohydrology in this framework was initiated in africa harper zalewski 2001 harper and mavuti 2004 asia hehanussa 2002 and latin america zalewski mcclain 1998 in 2006 ten demonstration sites were established in different parts of the globe asia pacific latin america africa and europe where the ecohydrology approach showed that ecosystem properties and water dynamics can be managed to maximise their synergistic interactions and optimize ecosystem s resilience to human induced stress with the use of nature based solutions for publication related to ihp vi see references the seventh phase ihp vii 2008 2013 water dependencies systems under stress and societal responses was designed to make a seamless transition from phase vi s water interactions to water dependencies there is good scientific evidence that within the natural as well as the built systems there are interdependencies connected by water un wwdr 2018 further there is a direct causal link between the quantity and quality of the water delivered to an ecosystem that may be undergoing stress theme 3 of ihp vii ecohydrology for sustainability was completely dedicated to ecohydrology with four focal areas namely 3 1 ecological measures to protect and remediate catchment processes 3 2 improving ecosystem quality and services by combining structural solutions with ecological biotechnologies 3 3 risk based environmental management and accounting and 3 4 groundwater dependent ecosystem identification inventory and assessment the overall objectives of the theme were to contribute to a better understanding of water as both an abiotic resource and a service delivered by ecosystem processes which will help to identify quantify and improve the critical interrelationships between water and biota necessary for sustainability particularly in critical ecosystems arid and semi arid zones coastal areas and estuaries and urbanized areas in 2011 32 demonstration site projects were presented grouped into four different categories global reference projects operational projects evolving projects and emerging project the current eight phase ihp viii 2014 2021 addresses the overarching theme water security responses to local regional and global challenges this phase was designed to be implemented through a progressive transition from phase vii and by capitalizing on the lessons learned from phase vi and the results achieved during previous phases of the programme within the context of water security the themes of ihp viii address managing water scarcity water quality and pollution control adaptation to the impacts of global change and natural disasters on water resources management and protection policy of groundwater resources for sustainable living and poverty reduction in developing countries and in arid and semi arid regions and small islands integration of catchment scale ecohydrological concepts and processes in advanced water management models management of water resources for human settlements of the future and water education as a key element to attain water security in addition to the themes this phase has considered certain cross cutting issues including iwrm transboundary or shared waters global change and the human dimension and governance of water theme 5 of ihp viii ecohydrology engineering harmony for a sustainable world is subdivided into 5 focal areas the first 3 aligned with the three ecohydrology principles quantification of hydrological processes quantification of ecological processes and ecological engineering or harmonization between hydrotechnical and ecological infrastructures focal areas 4 and 5 refer to urban ecohydrology and restoring continental to coastal connectivity respectively the concept is based on the theory to regulate hydrological and nutrients cycles in novel ecosystems agricultural and urban catchments towards the enhancement of carrying capacity of global ecosystems carrying capacity enhancement is understood as the improvement of ecosystem properties such as water resources biodiversity ecosystem services for societies the resilience to increasing various forms of impact including climate change culture and education wbsr ce kiedrzyńska et al 2021 zalewski 2014 2015 as a follow up of the publication of the world water development report 2018 nature based solution for water nbs ecohydrology has considerably experienced a higher interest at all levels due to the long time use of ecohydrological nbs in solving complex issues related to the regulation of aquatic ecosystems and the use of ecosystem properties as management tools for water resources management and sustainability zalewski 2000 have gained particular interest studying linked ecosystem properties and understanding actual stress situations gives the opportunity to delineate predictive potential for their rehabilitation and consequent provision of those services needed by both nature and humans understanding of processes from molecular to catchment scale is a bedrock of the holistic ecohydrological solutions during ihp viii innovative molecular tools based on dna sequencing were introduced for the study of microbial processes in ecohydrology microbial biofilms are crucial elements in carbon and nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems fazi et al 2016 by studying their structural and functional characteristics their activity state and metabolism and relating these characteristics with the hydrological characteristic of the basin i e water retention time one can better understand the interplay between water flow and ecological processes this is crucial not only to better understand ecosystem functioning but also to set up ecohydrological applications i e reconstructed wetlands buffer zones sequential biofiltration systems or river revitalization where one can play with the water retention time in order to enhance the carrying capacity of the system and to speed up specific ecological processes 2 scientific advisory committee of unesco s ecohydrology

apply ecohydrology solutions in watersheds at all scales integrating the concept of enhanced ecosystem potential with ecohydrological strategies to achieve sustainability of ecosystems closely related with water to improve both integrated water resource management iwrm and the ecosystems potential on specific areas ihp s work on ecohydrology through the demonstration sites promotes the use of the interactions between biota and hydrology and humans to regulate remediate and conserve ecosystems to stabilize and improve the quality of water resources implementation of ecohydrology is undertaken through harmonization with existing and planned hydrotechnical hydroengineering infrastructures and focuses on opportunities to harness the natural processes that regulate various elements of the water cycle which have become collectively known as nature based solutions nbs for water new guidelines for ecohydrology demosites were developed in 2015 and have been adopted by 19 countries in 28 demonstration sites established worldwide to validate and quantify the effectiveness of ecohydrological solutions ecohydrology ihp org the results obtained by the demonstration sites are also seen as key milestones for the monitoring of indicators to comply with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development with regard to sdg 6 on water with particular reference to targets 6 5 water resource management iwrm and 6 6 ecosystems these sites are there to take advantage of the potential of nature based solutions to ensure adequate water supplies to support food production and to help minimize the risk of water related disasters the goal of ecohydrology as it is practiced at unesco is emphasizing that nature is not necessarily a threat but the solution to many of our challenges major issues addressed by the demonstration sites are pollutants and nutrients water abstraction water management intensive land use floods droughts habitat loss invasive species loss of retention capacity of vegetation in the application of ecohydrology there are 4 ecohydrology engineering solutions faunatechnology phytotechnology hydrological flow and ecohydrological hydrotechnical hydroengineering
