17500,a significant number of emerging pollutants resulting from point source and diffuse pollution are present in the aquatic environment these are chemicals that are not commonly monitored but have the potential to cause adverse effects on human and ecological health one form of emerging pollutants pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are becoming a serious problem in the discharge of domestic wastewater therefore the aim of this study was to determine their occurrence in wastewater and surface waters and to evaluate the efficiency of subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands planted in polyculture and unplanted in removing two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and sildenafil sil and a personal care product methylparaben mp present in domestic wastewater the mixed ppcps were added to wetlands at nominal concentrations of 200 μg l for each compound the working flow of the reactors was 15 ml min and the hydraulic retention time was three days the physicochemical parameters evaluated were organic load dissolved oxygen temperature conductivity redox potential dissolved solids ph and ppcps concentration the presence of the three compounds became evident in all sampled sites with concentrations of up to 10 66 μg l 7 24 μg l and 2 64 μg l for cbz mp and sil respectively in planted wetlands removal efficiencies of up to 97 were achieved for sil while in the unplanted these were 30 lower removal efficiencies greater than 97 were achieved for mp however for cbz they were less than 10 evaluated in both treatments the average removal efficiency for organic load was 95 it was determined that constructed wetlands can efficiently remove simple molecular structure compounds such as mp and complex structures such as sil however cbz remained as a recalcitrant contaminant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodegradation emerging pollutants removal efficiency macrophytes domestic wastewater biofilm 1 introduction human life has been revolutionized by the consumption of thousands of synthetic organic compounds these include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps management of these has become an indispensable component of a healthy consumer society duca and boldescu 2009 ortiz de garcía et al 2013 the proliferation of these compounds and their ease of access have significantly increased their load in natural environments gorito et al 2017 their presence in the aquatic environment has been related to negative effects which are not yet fully understood farré et al 2008 afonso olivares et al 2017 some authors have suggested that up to six million ppcps are commercially available worldwide and their use is growing from 3 to 4 by weight per year cizmas et al 2015 ebele et al 2017 these compounds are only slightly removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and then enter the aquatic environment bu et al 2013 many have been reported as persistent environmental compounds that are bioactive bioaccumulative and endocrine disruptive cruz and barceló 2015 hontela and habibi 2013 niemuth and klaper 2015 their environmental concentration changes from one region to another and according to the season of the year in addition their environmental fate depends on physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient kow to represent the hydrophobicity of neutral molecules the octanol water distribution coefficient dow if the compounds are ionizable the degradation rate and the sediment water partition coefficient koc as well as other characteristics related to their discharge the flow rate of ppcps also determines their destination montes grajales et al 2017 a fact that which has generated numerous basic and technological research studies to mitigate their environmental impact arrubla et al 2016 it has been shown that natural wetlands can eliminate contaminants present in the water that flows through them for this reason artificial systems have been designed and built to replicate these natural processes gorito et al 2017 complex simultaneous processes can occur in wetlands such as volatilization sorption sedimentation photodegradation absorption by plants and microbial degradation contributing to removing or transforming different compounds matamoros and bayona 2008 the physicochemical properties of the compounds such as the dow distribution coefficient the kow and koc partition coefficient as well as the ionization constant pka also affect their sorption in soil plants mineral surfaces and biofilms wells 2006 zhao et al 2014 the removal of these contaminants can also be affected by the operational and design factors of wetlands such as their configuration soil substrate matrix substrate depth and operation type gorito et al 2017 plant species selection is another important parameter since they have a variable capacity to absorb nutrients and oxygenate the wetland and also interfere with the functioning and structure of the microbial communities involved in the elimination of pollutants gorito et al 2017 the most evaluated species are typha ssp y phragmites ssp li et al 2014 hydraulic retention time hrt is another transcendental factor in general hrt is variable and depends on the type of treatment required for example in tropical climates hrt has been reported between 2 4 days zhang et al 2012 while in europe times between 4 15 days have been reported li et al 2014 özengin and elmaci 2016 such systems have been commonly used to treat wastewater from isolated populations since they do not require external energy and sludge production is low however the information available on their efficiency is limited to common pollution parameters such as total suspended solids soluble organic matter nutrients bacteria heavy metals and pesticides hijosa valsero et al 2011 matamoros and bayona 2008 due to their great potential in recent years they have emerged as an alternative technology for the removal of emerging pollutants ávila et al 2013 verlicchi and zambello 2014 thus in the present work the efficiency removal from domestic wastewater using subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands cwhsf of two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and sildenafil and a personal care product methylparaben was evaluated the systems used were studied at pilot scale planted in polyculture with two macrophytes heliconea zingiberales and cyperus haspan to our knowledge this is the first time that these two macrophytes have been used to treat ppcps compounds in the same way it is the first study that removal efficiency of sildenafil in constructed wetlands had been evaluated furthermore in latin american countries like colombia only a few studies about the occurrence of a reduced numbe of ppcps have been reported therefore it is really interesting the collection of new data about the occurrence of ppcps in this area and also the investigation of the better treatment systems to avoid the pollution due to this kind of contaminants thus the results obtained under these work conditions are novel and of interest to the scientific and technological field 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products studied the chemical compounds selected as emerging pollutants were two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and sildenafil sil and a personal care product methylparaben mp of pharmaceutical quality parafarm brand provided by saporiti argentina these compounds were chosen for their representativeness in surface waters and their wide prescription aristizabal et al 2017 elorriaga et al 2013a gracia lor et al 2012 a stock solution of 5 000 mg l was prepared in methanol for calibration and dilution experiments table 1 shows the main physicochemical characteristics of the three compounds evaluated 2 2 sampling locations the cauca river is one of the most important surface water bodies in colombia it flows for 1 350 km passing through more than 180 municipalities it has an area of 63300 km2 and an average flow of 3000 m3 s this river originates from the cauca department capital city popayán and crosses the valle del cauca capital city cali where it has approximate average flow rate of 200 m3 s gutiérrez et al 2016 the molino and the ejido rivers are tributaries of this water source and have an average flow of approximately 1 m3 s and an approximate length of 25 km and 1 km respectively all domestic wastewater from city of popayán discharged into these three rivers without any prior treatment approximately 260000 inhabitants in addition the cauca river is the source of supply for 60 of the inhabitants of the city of cali approximately 2400000 inhabitants returning its treated wastewater to this river however it should be noted that about 10 of the inhabitants discharge their wastewater without any prior treatment espinel and valencia 2007 therefore sampling sites in the cauca department included a first point called p1 where hospital wastewaters are discharged without treatment three additional points called p2 p4 and p6 were sampled on wastewater discharges approximately 90000 inhabitants for each one points located one kilometer after each discharge were also evaluated to determine the ppcps dilution capacity these points were called p3 p5 and p7 each of the sampled points can be seen in fig s1 supplementary material another site called c1 and located 190 km downstream from point p7 was sampled to assess the persistence or pseudo persistence of ppcps sampling sites in the valle del cauca department included other point c2 on the untreated wastewater discharge approximately 240000 inhabitants in addition samples were taken from the affluent and effluent of the water treatment plant dwtp c3 and the wastewater treatment plant wwtp c4 finally a final point was evaluated located 2 5 km downstream from the wwtp c5 to determine the ppcps dilution capacity sampling was carried out in november 2018 the location of each of these points can be seen in supplementary information fig s2 2 3 cwhsf experimental pilot plant system four constructed wetlands of subsurface horizontal flow at pilot scale were evaluated as secondary domestic wastewater treatments each system consisted of a 0 60 m long fiberglass tank 0 55 m wide and 0 55 m high with a slope of 1 gravel of size 3 4 1 2 was used as a support medium up to a height of 0 3 m two of the systems were planted in polyculture with macrophytes typical of the study area heliconea zingiberales and cyperus haspan every 0 06 m2 and two were left unplanted in order to determine the effect of the plants at the tank exit located at the base a 1 2 perforated pipe was placed for the collection of treated water connected to an adjustable pipe which maintained the subsurface flow at a height of 0 20 m two 1 piezometers were placed at 0 15 m from the internal edges of the reactor in order to monitor biofilm development and the evaporated water mass finally the mariotte bottle method in the feed tanks was adapted in order to maintain a constant gravity flow for each system as detailed in fig 1 the water used in this study was synthetic wastewater which was prepared to simulate domestic wastewater its characteristics were modified from iso 11733 as proposed by ho and sung 2010 this solution was prepared with dechlorinated water adding nonfat dry milk powder 169 mg l soluble starch 81 mg l sodium acetate 50 mg l yeast extract 12 mg l ammonium chloride 48 mg l urea 27 mg l and monobasic potassium phosphate 28 mg l to obtain an organic load of approximately 250 mg l this being similar to that of a secondary treatment the tightness test of each wetland was evaluated in batch for two weeks then filtered domestic wastewater sieve no 35 according to the tylor series was added every five days to develop a bacterial consortium on the gravel bed maintaining the batch operation the biofilm development was determined by the formation of a thin bacterial film on the surface of the piezometers after 30 days according to what was reported by casas et al 2013 with this stage concluded the macrophyte plants were sown leaving the system in batch for 30 more days with domestic wastewater feed after this time the reactors were operated continuously with synthetic wastewater for 30 days the hydraulic retention time hrt was 72 h li et al 2014 özengin and elmaci 2016 operating a flow rate of approximately 15 ml min finally the three ppcps were incorporated into their mix in the feed tanks containing synthetic wastewater at nominal concentrations of 200 μg l this being similar to those reported in wastewater česen et al 2019 pérez et al 2018 williams et al 2019 the operation of each reactor was evaluated by measuring physicochemical parameters such as ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids redox potential and chemical oxygen demand in the affluent and effluent in addition to the determination of the concentrations of each ppcps sampling was carried out every 20 days over a period of six months with each sampling denominated as m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 unplanted systems were denominated as h1 and h2 and planted wetlands such as h3 and h4 based on their respective replica 2 4 determination of ppcps and physicochemical parameters chemical analyzes for ppcps detection in environmental matrices were performed on the soluble fraction ramos 2018 the samples were separated into two amber glass bottles to one of which 200 μg l of the compounds studied was added in order to determine loss of the interest compounds during their transport and handling the samples were filtered using 47 mm diameter fiberglass membranes with 0 45 micron pore size 0 01 nan3 and edta was added to them and they were immediately taken to the laboratory where they were kept at 4 c for analysis within the following 24 hours solid phase extraction spe was carried out using waters brand oasis hlb type c18 cartridges which were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of nanopure water the same sample volume was diluted in nanopure water 100 ml and this solution was circulated through spe cartridges then the compounds of interest were desorbed with 5 ml of methanol a procedure taken from elorriaga et al 2013b the extracts were under a nitrogen stream and resuspended in 0 50 ml methanol nanopure water 1 1 the selective quantifications of the selected compounds the environmental samples and of those evaluated in the constructed wetlands were carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry aristizabal et al 2017 using 0 1 formic acid and 99 9 purity methanol as solvents for the mobile phase each characteristic ion was selected according to what was posed by elorriaga et al 2013a prior to characterization in scanning mode scan under the same chromatographic conditions studied method detection limits mdl and method quantification limits mql for cbz sil and mp were determined in spiked samples of the three ppcps considered as the minimum detectable amount of analyte with signal to noise ratio of 3 for mdl and 10 for mql according to the criteria established by sante 11945 2015 mql and mdl were of 0 50 μg l and 0 15 μg l for cbz 2 29 μg l and 0 69 μg l for sil and 5 0 μg l and 1 5 μg l for mp respectively to determine the ppcps absorption capacity of the plants a plant of each species and each wetland was taken the macrophytes were washed dried in the environment and kept at 20 c until the moment of analysis the aoac method was used for the plant material analysis 9 mg from the filter bed between the rhizosphere of the biofilm coated plants was taken together with the plants in order to determine the microbial degradation of the compounds and was maintained in methanol at 4 c until analysis this sampling was performed only at the end of the entire study to avoid alterations in the systems the same procedure mentioned above by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was performed for the analysis of ppcps in the substrate and in the plant material the dissolved oxygen ph conductivity total dissolved solids redox potential and temperature of the medium were determined in situ in the affluent and the effluent using a hi98194 hanna multiparameter the cod evaluation was performed in the laboratory according to method 5220 of the standard methods apha 1998 2 5 ppcps mass balance in the cwhsf taking into account the total mass of the incorporated ppcps the total mass detected in the effluent the total mass absorbed by the plants and the amount detected by adsorption on the substrate a mass balance was made for the ppcps in the constructed wetlands the remaining difference of the compounds was attributed to the removal by other mechanisms such as biodegradation or biotransformation the mass balance was calculated according to what was proposed by tejeda et al 2017 using the eq one 1 m a s s ppcps affluent m a s s ppcps effluent m a s s ppcps in macrophytes mass ppcps in substrate elimination by other mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and occurrence of pharmaceuticals the impact of ppcps is an environmental science and engineering area in development it is also a study field that has recently emerged in different parts of the world archer et al 2017b bu et al 2013 in countries like colombia it is necessary to generate a greater volume of information in order to enhance knowledge about its presence and distribution in water bodies as well as to evaluate technologies for its elimination in the table 2 and the fig 2 some physicochemical parameters and the concentrations of the ppcps are presented respectively measured at the sampled sites the samples taken were analyzed only on the soluble fraction since these compounds are mainly mobilized on this fraction ramos 2018 the presence of ppcps was evident in all the sampled sites with concentrations between lc and 10 66 μg l for cbz between 0 8 and 7 24 μg l for mp and between 0 13 and 2 64 μg l for sil the highest concentrations of cbz were presented at points p2 and p4 which have the lowest flow rates and the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen its concentration decreased by approximately 80 in the samples evaluated 1 km downstream at points p3 and p5 mp presented the same behavior at points p4 and p5 however its concentration remained stable at points p2 p3 p6 and p7 meanwhile sil did not show major variations in any of the sites studied although the cauca river has a length of approximately 200 km from point p7 to point c3a the presence of ppcps became evident even at concentrations higher than those determined at point p7 thus according to reports by other authors archer et al 2017a ramos 2018 a persistent pseudo behavior of these pollutants in surface waters could be determined similarly the three compounds were detected in the conventional dwtp and wwtp effluents c3e and c4e showing a behavior similar to that previously reported for the removal of emerging contaminants bu et al 2013 gavrilescu et al 2015 rodriguez et al 2017 removals below 30 have been found for mp matamoros et al 2015 while cbz is reported as a recalcitrant contaminant zhang et al 2012 compared with the conventional treatments similarly afonso olivares et al 2017 reported its high resistance with removal efficiencies of less than 40 in activated sludge treatment plants therefore as expected its presence was also evident 2 5 km downstream at point c5 higher concentrations were evidenced in the effluent from the treatment plants however it is important to highlight that direct injections were made at point c4a so the results may have been altered although similar behavior has been reported onesios et al 2009 shaver 2011 verlicchi and zambello 2014 determined removals of up to 316 for cbz in biological treatments the presence in the environment of several emerging pollutants has been evident for about a decade this includes cbz with maximum concentrations of 6 μg l ternes 1998 recently in countries such as slovenia croatia argentina and india concentrations similar to those found in the present study have been reported with values of up to 18 μg l for cbz and 2 μg l for mp česen et al 2019 pérez et al 2018 williams et al 2019 consequently the detection of these emerging pollutants in the environment is becoming a growing concern due to their potential effects on aquatic biota and human health through indirect contact as is the case with their detection in treated wastewater and drinking water geissen et al 2015 it has been reported that the acute effects of pharmaceutical products are related to concentrations generally 100 1000 times higher than those found in the aquatic environment however chronic adverse effects have been observed in the range found in wastewater concentrations petrie et al 2015 vieira et al 2016 afonso olivares et al 2017 pérez et al 2018 on the other hand it is interesting to evaluate this same information detection of ppcps in surface and residual water using a different interpretation based on molars as can be seen in fig s3 in the supplementary material this interpretation is done since moles are used to normalize data and cancel out molecular weight differences between multi residue compounds according to this interpretation a higher concentration of mp was determined for the different points evaluated compared with the mass based data μg l as can be seen in fig 2 and fig s3 see supplementary information under this new context the mp presented the highest concentration for the evaluated samples with a value of 4 76 μm analyzed for point 4 on the contrary in the mass based data the cbz presented the highest concentration 10 66 μg l however the highest concentrations detected at this point both for cbz and mp are consistent for the two methodologies analyzed finally unlike the mp the molar concentrations of cbz and sil did not show significant variability this is an interesting point of view considering that variability in the results was determined using mass based and molar based data therefore according to unit conversions for a low molecular weight a high molar concentration is obtained in aqueous solutions thus an example for the conversion of mass based and molar based units is presented in eq s1 and eq s2 of the supplementary material 3 2 ppcps removal using cwhsf according to the studies carried out there is a need to develop and implement alternative technologies for wastewater treatment that are able to remove both emerging and traditional pollutants in order to mitigate adverse effects on aquatic biota and human health therefore constructed wetlands have arisen as an alternative technology for ppcps treatment given that they have proven efficient in removing some emerging pollutants matamoros et al 2017 consequently in this investigation cwhsfs were evaluated for the removal of ppcps from domestic wastewater the systems affluent concentrations for ppcps mixtures were 170 40 μg l for cbz 110 70 μg l for sil and 180 50 μg l for mp 3 2 1 cbz particular analysis the results obtained for cbz treatment using cwhsf are presented in fig 3 a in the first sampling an apparent removal efficiency of approximately 60 was achieved both in planted and non planted systems however when evaluating the following samples it was found that the efficiency previously determined decreased considerably when the affluent and effluent concentrations of each system were evaluated by means of a paired t test with a significance level of 0 05 p value results of 0 497 0 369 0 687 and 0 710 were obtained for the h1 h2 h3 and h4 system respectively therefore no statistically significant differences were found between the input and output concentrations when comparing the values obtained in the effluents of the reactors by means of a unifactorial analysis of variance a p value of 0 809 was obtained for the same level of significance of the paired t test this showed that there was also no statistically significant difference between the planted and unplanted reactors concluding that after the stabilization time which was reached at approximately forty days removal efficiencies less than 10 were obtained different configurations of constructed wetlands have been reported in order to assess the removal efficiency of recalcitrant contaminants such as cbz however removals have rarely exceeded 50 kahl et al 2017 tejeda et al 2017 verlicchi and zambello 2014 hydraulic retention times have also been modified between 2 and 15 days to improve elimination but efficiency also did not vary significantly as a result li et al 2014 removals of up to 90 have been obtained using leca as a support bed over 6 days of operation dordio et al 2010 özengin and elmaci 2016 however it is important to evaluate longer times to determine if there is a saturation point as observed in this research özengin and elmaci 2016 the stability of cbz can be attributed to its remarkable resistance to biodegradation to its complex molecular structure and to its toxic effect on microorganisms matamoros and bayona 2008 matamoros et al 2017 delgado et al 2018 3 2 2 sil particular analysis based on the results obtained by delgado et al 2018 in biological treatments sil was gradually incorporated into the affluent in order to counteract the negative effects on the developed microorganisms the initial concentrations for the m1 m2 m3 and m4 samples were 44 6 μg l and those for the m5 m6 m7 and m8 samples were 168 40 μg l the results obtained for sil are presented in fig 3b a statistical analysis similar to the one previously proposed for cbz was performed using paired t tests and a significance level of 0 05 the results obtained from the p value to determine the variability between the affluent and effluent concentrations of each reactor were between 0 001 0 0003 for both concentrations in both cases the variability in the mean values of the two groups evaluated was greater than would be expected due to random errors indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between the input and output concentrations when comparing the effluent concentrations of wetlands h1 and h2 with those of wetlands h3 and h4 a p value lower than 0 001 was obtained showing statistically significant differences between planted and unplanted systems on the other hand no statistically significant differences were observed between the effluent concentrations of each wetland with its control with p values of 0 158 and 0 619 for the h1 h2 and h3 h4 wetlands respectively verifying that each treatment behaved as a replica and not as an individual system the time required to achieve operational stability in each reactor was approximately 60 days removal efficiencies greater than 97 were obtained for the lowest concentrations in planted wetlands while in unplanted wetlands these concentrations were reduced by approximately 40 when evaluating higher concentrations average removal efficiencies of 91 were achieved with a maximum of 97 in planted systems on the other hand in unplanted systems the average removals were 65 similar results have been reported for planted and unplanted systems for some pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen hijosa valsero et al 2011 hijosa valsero et al 2016 it is therefore concluded that plants have an important role in the removal of sil which has been reported as a recalcitrant contaminant in previous works delgado et al 2016 grossberger et al 2014 reaching removal efficiencies below 20 in conventional treatment plants and in fixed film biological treatments delgado et al 2018 rivera utrilla et al 2013 however no papers were found that evaluate the elimination of this compound using constructed wetlands 3 2 3 mp particular analysis the results obtained for mp removal using cwhsf are shown in fig 3c the mp effluent concentrations using wetlands h1 h2 h3 and h4 were below the quantification limit of the technique so it can be asserted that removal efficiencies greater than 97 were obtained there were no statistically significant differences in the removal efficiency of planted and unplanted systems nor was there a difference between their replicas with p values greater than 0 05 the stabilization time required to remove this contaminant was less than twenty days similar behavior was observed in the degradation of organic matter as shown in fig 3d reaching an elimination efficiency of 95 in the different systems evaluated little information is available on mp removal efficiency using natural methods in previous studies in climatic conditions where the four seasons are presented elimination of mp was evaluated using real scale constructed wetlands reaching an average efficiency of 42 matamoros et al 2016 in contrast the wetlands evaluated in the present study showed a 55 increase the better results are probably due to the different climatic conditions with average temperatures of 22 c throughout the year as these systems function well in tropical climates tejeda et al 2017 the high removal efficiency of mp may be due to its simple molecular structure the molecular composition of mp presents essential chemical elements c h o which are easily degraded by microorganisms reddy and delaune 2008 in addition having a single aromatic ring attached to a hydroxyl group and a methyl chain both in para position gives it a favorable stoichiometry flat molecule for moderate adsorption on the substrate log koc 2 4 and easy dispersion in wastewater log dow 1 66 and log kow 1 96 previous studies have reached the same conclusion reporting that organic compounds with simple molecular structure which have high water solubility and moderate adsorption capacity are easily degraded by microorganisms matamoros et al 2017 according to the results obtained and the studies reported it can be concluded that the main process of mp removal is bacterial degradation naipal 2014 delgado et al 2018 on the contrary it has been reported that those recalcitrant organic compounds such as cbz which have chemical elements and structures very different from those of natural compounds are slowly degraded by microorganisms li et al 2014 however for sil which has a complex molecular structure high elimination efficiencies 90 were achieved in the systems evaluated in the present work therefore there are factors other than the molecular structure that may influence the removal of this emerging contaminant however it is important to keep in mind that cbz has three aromatic rings attached see table 1 which may be a characteristic that makes removal difficult given that microorganisms cannot break this bond type thus although the constructed wetlands are very efficient and low cost natural technology to remove emergent contaminants such as mp and sil it is important to consider polishing tertiary treatments for recalcitrant contaminants such as cbz for instance advanced chemical and biological treatment systems have been assessed ozonation ozone ultraviolet irradiation ozone hydrogen peroxide ultrafiltration reverse osmosis granular activated carbon contact and membrane biological reactors modern wwtps could be equipped with these technologies for a polishing step as these technologies are proven to be effective in many cases however their capital and operational costs are very high which highlights the need for cost effective sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment technologies more details regarding the treatment of emerging pollutants by various conventional and advanced treatment technologies can be found in literature for instance in the review article published by ilyas and hullebusch 2020 3 3 the impact of macrophytes in the removal of ppcps at the end of this study the species with the lowest standing biomass was heliconea zingiberales with an average of 12 plants per wetland and an average weight of 135 g per plant the total biomass weight was 1400 g the cyperus haspan presented good conditions of development and population with an average of 230 plants per wetland and an average weight of 12 g per plant with a total biomass of 3000 g during the first three months of acclimatization heliconea zingiberales presented good development however after two months of continuous ppcp incorporation it was clearly the species that exhibited the greatest signs of stress competition between the plants could also have been a source of additional stress the average absorption levels of cbz sil and mp in cyperus haspan were 0 51 μg g 0 14 μg g and 0 03 μg g respectively the average absorption values in heliconea zingiberales were 0 29 μg g 0 05 μg g and 0 03 μg g respectively the most highly absorbed compound was cbz followed by sil and mp it was determined that cyperus haspan has a greater capacity to absorb pharmaceuticals than heliconea zingiberales table 3 these results suggest that the removal absorption efficiency of macrophytes which are exposed to ppcps varies by species tejeda et al 2017 there are few studies that evaluate macrophyte polyculture in wetlands however tejada et al 2017 found similar behaviors for ornamental plants exposed to cbz other studies have reported higher levels of cbz absorption in species such as scirpus validus with concentrations between 3 6 19 7 μg g zhang et al 2013 and 1 17 μg g in typha spp dordio et al 2011 it is important to keep in mind that the low levels of sil and mp detected in the cwhsf effluents may be due to their metabolism by macrophytes on the contrary the higher concentration of cbz detected and its low removal efficiency indicate the stability of the molecule which was also not easily metabolized by the macrophytes 3 4 the impact of substrate on the removal of ppcps the substrate is an important component in constructed wetlands especially in subsurface flow wetlands it also offers support for plant growth and it provides a means of adhesion for biofilm the total weight of the substrate in the wetlands was approximately 144000 g the compound with the highest affinity for the substrate was sil followed by cbz and finally mp with values of 1 95 μg g 0 23 μg g and 0 18 μg g respectively as seen in table 4 a positive linear trend was determined between the organic water carbon partition coefficient log koc and the concentration of the ppcps detected with a correlation coefficient of 0 971 and a significance level of 0 1 this correlation did not correspond to ppcps removal efficiency since the compound with the lowest adsorption level was mp but this presented the greatest removal efficiency 97 followed by sil 90 and finally cbz 10 currently very few data are available on the adsorption levels of ppcps on the support bed however cbz adsorption concentrations of 0 09 μg g have been reported on gravel matamoros et al 2005 3 5 mass balance for ppcps a general mass balance was made for the planted wetlands applying eq 1 in order to determine in a global way the removal mechanisms for pollutants and identify which was of greatest importance according to the average affluent concentration of cbz 168 μg l the effluent concentration 157 μg l and the amount absorbed by the macrophytes 0 51 μg g and 0 29 μg g and on the substrate 0 23 μg g during the study time the mass balance for cbz was determined as shown in eq 2 a detailed analysis of the equation can be observed in the supplementary material mass balance for cbz 2 518 m g cbz affluent 483 m g effluent 1 9 m g macrophytes 33 1 m g substrate according to the results obtained it was determined that only about 7 of cbz was retained in planted wetlands of which approximately 6 6 was detected in gravel 0 3 was retained by cyperus haspan and a 0 1 by heliconea zingiberales on the other hand of the total cbz adhered on the gravel 22 was retained during the first 20 days of study generating an apparent removal as seen in graph a of fig 3 the same procedure as described above was performed to determine the global removal efficiency of sil with the corresponding mass balance as shown in eq 3 the average values determined were 170 μg l in the affluent and 13 μg l in the effluent meanwhile the absorption by the macrophytes was 0 14 μg g and 0 05 μg g for cyperus haspan and heliconea zingiberaes respectively see table 3 and the adsorption on the substrate was 1 95 μg g see table 4 a detailed calculation can be observed in the supplementary material mass balance for sil 3 524 m g sil affluent 40 m g effluent 0 47 m g macropytes 281 m g substrate 202 53 other mechanisms according to the calculations obtained it was determined that 93 of sil was retained in planted wetlands 0 08 was detected in cyperus haspan and 0 01 in heliconea zingiberales the value found in the substrate was 52 the elimination by other mechanisms was 41 the adhesion of sil on the bed could contribute to its biodegradation since the levels determined in the effluent were less than 7 for mp the average values were affluent concentration 177 μg l effluent concentration 2 5 μg l absorption on the macrophytes 0 03 μg g for both species see table 3 and adsorption on the substrate 0 18 μg g see table 4 99 of mp was retained in the cwhsf less than 0 01 was detected in macrophytes and 4 6 was detected on the substrate therefore the biodegradation removal was 94 see mass balance for mp in the supplementary material 4 545 m g mp affluent 8 m g effluent 0 13 m g macrophytes 26 m g substrate 510 87 other mechanisms it is therefore possible to confirm that the main mechanism of removal for this molecule was bacterial degradation which suggests mp metabolism by microorganisms delgado et al 2018 it is widely accepted that organic compounds with log kow between 0 5 3 can pass through cell membranes and enter the transpiration currents of plants dordio et al 2011 reyes contreras et al 2012 therefore it is likely that the macrophytes played an active role in the elimination of sil through direct absorption since their octanol water partition coefficient is 2 75 however cbz which has a similar log kow 2 77 did not present the same elimination efficiency therefore the sil degradation capacity may be due to the adaptation speed and the metabolism of the evaluated macrophytes petrie et al 2017 in addition microorganisms that develop in the rhizosphere can play an important role in the degradation of this compound since the use of a polyculture promotes a greater microorganism diversity which can adapt to break down organic molecules into simple intermediates and in many cases degrade them completely li et al 2014 mp has a log kow 1 96 within the range established above however studies have shown that its main mechanism of removal is bacterial degradation since no significant difference have been observed between planted and unplanted wetlands elimination by photodegradation was not taken into account since it is not a relevant factor in subsurface flow wetlands previous studies show the stability of ppcps against this factor delgado et al 2016 delgado et al 2019 elimination by volatilization was not considered because these pollutants have very low values of henry s constant with values of 7 2 10 21 and 2 23 10 9 for sil y mp respectively as can be seen in table 1 3 6 the impact of the ppcps on treated water quality the values of the physicochemical parameters determined in the affluent were 5 0 0 4 mg l for dissolved oxygen 6 9 0 1 for ph 21 1 c for temperature 105 8 mg l for total dissolved solids 0 22 0 03 ms cm for the conductivity and 195 31 mv for the oxide reduction potential the concentration of the organic load was 198 25 mg l reaching removal efficiencies greater than 95 after each treatment the average values of dissolved oxygen d o in the effluents of each system were 0 2 0 1 mg l showing a drastic reduction with respect to the affluent values its low concentration is due to the predominantly anoxic conditions in the cwhsf saeed and sun 2012 the ph values for the planted and unplanted systems were 5 9 0 3 and 7 0 0 1 respectively it is important to highlight that the average levels of this parameter in all systems were within the accepted limits 4 8 for the good development of microorganisms hijosa valsero et al 2016 the treated water temperatures were 19 1 c for the different cases studied results consistent with the cbz removal from this study were obtained by matamoros et al 2017 as well as by anjos et al 2018 for mp however there are authors who have reported efficiencies of up to 40 for cbz under these study conditions dordio et al 2010 temperature can be an important factor in the removal of ppcps since lower efficiencies have been reported for mp with lower temperatures verlicchi et al 2015 the average effluent values for total dissolved solids in planted and unplanted wetlands were 65 19 mg l and 132 14 mg l respectively therefore the greater efficiency of sil removal in planted wetlands could be related to their greater adsorption capacity on solids and their subsequent absorption and assimilation by macrophytes similar conclusions were having been in other studies verlicchi and zambello 2014 however more specific research on these interactions is necessary conductivity in the planted and unplanted systems showed values of 0 13 0 04 ms cm and 0 26 0 03 ms cm respectively lower values of redox potential were detected compared to the affluent values with average results of 61 47 mv and 36 57 mv for planted and unplanted wetlands respectively it has been reported that redox potential is one of the most interesting parameters to take into account when evaluating the removal capacity of a specific compound in a constructed wetland verlicchi and zambello 2014 thus sil presented better removal efficiencies under oxidizing conditions but no comparative studies have been found the values obtained in each system evaluated can be seen in fig s3 of the supplementary material 4 conclusions all surface water samples evidenced the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products as did the affluents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants demonstrating the need to take efficient measures to mitigate contamination of rivers with these compounds through anthropogenic activities high elimination efficiencies for methylparaben were obtained in all systems evaluated with values greater than 97 similar levels for sildenafil were achieved in planted wetlands while in the unplanted wetlands the efficiency was reduced by approximately 30 carbamazepine behaved as a recalcitrant contaminant against different treatments with removals below 10 thus it is concluded that evaluated systems are capable of efficiently removing compounds of simple molecular structure such as mp and also compounds of more complex structures such as sil the most detected compound in the macrophytes was cbz followed by sil and finally mp on the other hand sil showed greatest affinity for the substrate followed by cbz and mp the levels detected by absorption in the macrophytes and gravel did not follow the same order of removal efficiencies for each wetland evaluated since mp the compound with the lowest concentrations detected in both processes was the most efficiently removed evidencing its biodegradation in these systems after analyzing the mass balance it is concluded that cbz does not biodegrade since the total affluent mass corresponded to the combined total of the effluent mass the mass absorbed by the plants and that adhered to the substrate for sil one of the main mechanisms that contributed to its degradation is adsorption on the support bed which apparently allows this compound to be retained long enough to be degraded by plants or microorganisms it is confirmed that the main mechanism of removal for mp is bacterial degradation because this was not detected in the effluent the support bed or in the macrophytes and no significant differences were shown in the efficiency of removal of the planted and

17500,a significant number of emerging pollutants resulting from point source and diffuse pollution are present in the aquatic environment these are chemicals that are not commonly monitored but have the potential to cause adverse effects on human and ecological health one form of emerging pollutants pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps are becoming a serious problem in the discharge of domestic wastewater therefore the aim of this study was to determine their occurrence in wastewater and surface waters and to evaluate the efficiency of subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands planted in polyculture and unplanted in removing two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and sildenafil sil and a personal care product methylparaben mp present in domestic wastewater the mixed ppcps were added to wetlands at nominal concentrations of 200 μg l for each compound the working flow of the reactors was 15 ml min and the hydraulic retention time was three days the physicochemical parameters evaluated were organic load dissolved oxygen temperature conductivity redox potential dissolved solids ph and ppcps concentration the presence of the three compounds became evident in all sampled sites with concentrations of up to 10 66 μg l 7 24 μg l and 2 64 μg l for cbz mp and sil respectively in planted wetlands removal efficiencies of up to 97 were achieved for sil while in the unplanted these were 30 lower removal efficiencies greater than 97 were achieved for mp however for cbz they were less than 10 evaluated in both treatments the average removal efficiency for organic load was 95 it was determined that constructed wetlands can efficiently remove simple molecular structure compounds such as mp and complex structures such as sil however cbz remained as a recalcitrant contaminant graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodegradation emerging pollutants removal efficiency macrophytes domestic wastewater biofilm 1 introduction human life has been revolutionized by the consumption of thousands of synthetic organic compounds these include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps management of these has become an indispensable component of a healthy consumer society duca and boldescu 2009 ortiz de garcía et al 2013 the proliferation of these compounds and their ease of access have significantly increased their load in natural environments gorito et al 2017 their presence in the aquatic environment has been related to negative effects which are not yet fully understood farré et al 2008 afonso olivares et al 2017 some authors have suggested that up to six million ppcps are commercially available worldwide and their use is growing from 3 to 4 by weight per year cizmas et al 2015 ebele et al 2017 these compounds are only slightly removed in wastewater treatment plants wwtp and then enter the aquatic environment bu et al 2013 many have been reported as persistent environmental compounds that are bioactive bioaccumulative and endocrine disruptive cruz and barceló 2015 hontela and habibi 2013 niemuth and klaper 2015 their environmental concentration changes from one region to another and according to the season of the year in addition their environmental fate depends on physicochemical properties such as the octanol water partition coefficient kow to represent the hydrophobicity of neutral molecules the octanol water distribution coefficient dow if the compounds are ionizable the degradation rate and the sediment water partition coefficient koc as well as other characteristics related to their discharge the flow rate of ppcps also determines their destination montes grajales et al 2017 a fact that which has generated numerous basic and technological research studies to mitigate their environmental impact arrubla et al 2016 it has been shown that natural wetlands can eliminate contaminants present in the water that flows through them for this reason artificial systems have been designed and built to replicate these natural processes gorito et al 2017 complex simultaneous processes can occur in wetlands such as volatilization sorption sedimentation photodegradation absorption by plants and microbial degradation contributing to removing or transforming different compounds matamoros and bayona 2008 the physicochemical properties of the compounds such as the dow distribution coefficient the kow and koc partition coefficient as well as the ionization constant pka also affect their sorption in soil plants mineral surfaces and biofilms wells 2006 zhao et al 2014 the removal of these contaminants can also be affected by the operational and design factors of wetlands such as their configuration soil substrate matrix substrate depth and operation type gorito et al 2017 plant species selection is another important parameter since they have a variable capacity to absorb nutrients and oxygenate the wetland and also interfere with the functioning and structure of the microbial communities involved in the elimination of pollutants gorito et al 2017 the most evaluated species are typha ssp y phragmites ssp li et al 2014 hydraulic retention time hrt is another transcendental factor in general hrt is variable and depends on the type of treatment required for example in tropical climates hrt has been reported between 2 4 days zhang et al 2012 while in europe times between 4 15 days have been reported li et al 2014 özengin and elmaci 2016 such systems have been commonly used to treat wastewater from isolated populations since they do not require external energy and sludge production is low however the information available on their efficiency is limited to common pollution parameters such as total suspended solids soluble organic matter nutrients bacteria heavy metals and pesticides hijosa valsero et al 2011 matamoros and bayona 2008 due to their great potential in recent years they have emerged as an alternative technology for the removal of emerging pollutants ávila et al 2013 verlicchi and zambello 2014 thus in the present work the efficiency removal from domestic wastewater using subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetlands cwhsf of two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and sildenafil and a personal care product methylparaben was evaluated the systems used were studied at pilot scale planted in polyculture with two macrophytes heliconea zingiberales and cyperus haspan to our knowledge this is the first time that these two macrophytes have been used to treat ppcps compounds in the same way it is the first study that removal efficiency of sildenafil in constructed wetlands had been evaluated furthermore in latin american countries like colombia only a few studies about the occurrence of a reduced numbe of ppcps have been reported therefore it is really interesting the collection of new data about the occurrence of ppcps in this area and also the investigation of the better treatment systems to avoid the pollution due to this kind of contaminants thus the results obtained under these work conditions are novel and of interest to the scientific and technological field 2 materials and methods 2 1 pharmaceuticals and personal care products studied the chemical compounds selected as emerging pollutants were two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine cbz and sildenafil sil and a personal care product methylparaben mp of pharmaceutical quality parafarm brand provided by saporiti argentina these compounds were chosen for their representativeness in surface waters and their wide prescription aristizabal et al 2017 elorriaga et al 2013a gracia lor et al 2012 a stock solution of 5 000 mg l was prepared in methanol for calibration and dilution experiments table 1 shows the main physicochemical characteristics of the three compounds evaluated 2 2 sampling locations the cauca river is one of the most important surface water bodies in colombia it flows for 1 350 km passing through more than 180 municipalities it has an area of 63300 km2 and an average flow of 3000 m3 s this river originates from the cauca department capital city popayán and crosses the valle del cauca capital city cali where it has approximate average flow rate of 200 m3 s gutiérrez et al 2016 the molino and the ejido rivers are tributaries of this water source and have an average flow of approximately 1 m3 s and an approximate length of 25 km and 1 km respectively all domestic wastewater from city of popayán discharged into these three rivers without any prior treatment approximately 260000 inhabitants in addition the cauca river is the source of supply for 60 of the inhabitants of the city of cali approximately 2400000 inhabitants returning its treated wastewater to this river however it should be noted that about 10 of the inhabitants discharge their wastewater without any prior treatment espinel and valencia 2007 therefore sampling sites in the cauca department included a first point called p1 where hospital wastewaters are discharged without treatment three additional points called p2 p4 and p6 were sampled on wastewater discharges approximately 90000 inhabitants for each one points located one kilometer after each discharge were also evaluated to determine the ppcps dilution capacity these points were called p3 p5 and p7 each of the sampled points can be seen in fig s1 supplementary material another site called c1 and located 190 km downstream from point p7 was sampled to assess the persistence or pseudo persistence of ppcps sampling sites in the valle del cauca department included other point c2 on the untreated wastewater discharge approximately 240000 inhabitants in addition samples were taken from the affluent and effluent of the water treatment plant dwtp c3 and the wastewater treatment plant wwtp c4 finally a final point was evaluated located 2 5 km downstream from the wwtp c5 to determine the ppcps dilution capacity sampling was carried out in november 2018 the location of each of these points can be seen in supplementary information fig s2 2 3 cwhsf experimental pilot plant system four constructed wetlands of subsurface horizontal flow at pilot scale were evaluated as secondary domestic wastewater treatments each system consisted of a 0 60 m long fiberglass tank 0 55 m wide and 0 55 m high with a slope of 1 gravel of size 3 4 1 2 was used as a support medium up to a height of 0 3 m two of the systems were planted in polyculture with macrophytes typical of the study area heliconea zingiberales and cyperus haspan every 0 06 m2 and two were left unplanted in order to determine the effect of the plants at the tank exit located at the base a 1 2 perforated pipe was placed for the collection of treated water connected to an adjustable pipe which maintained the subsurface flow at a height of 0 20 m two 1 piezometers were placed at 0 15 m from the internal edges of the reactor in order to monitor biofilm development and the evaporated water mass finally the mariotte bottle method in the feed tanks was adapted in order to maintain a constant gravity flow for each system as detailed in fig 1 the water used in this study was synthetic wastewater which was prepared to simulate domestic wastewater its characteristics were modified from iso 11733 as proposed by ho and sung 2010 this solution was prepared with dechlorinated water adding nonfat dry milk powder 169 mg l soluble starch 81 mg l sodium acetate 50 mg l yeast extract 12 mg l ammonium chloride 48 mg l urea 27 mg l and monobasic potassium phosphate 28 mg l to obtain an organic load of approximately 250 mg l this being similar to that of a secondary treatment the tightness test of each wetland was evaluated in batch for two weeks then filtered domestic wastewater sieve no 35 according to the tylor series was added every five days to develop a bacterial consortium on the gravel bed maintaining the batch operation the biofilm development was determined by the formation of a thin bacterial film on the surface of the piezometers after 30 days according to what was reported by casas et al 2013 with this stage concluded the macrophyte plants were sown leaving the system in batch for 30 more days with domestic wastewater feed after this time the reactors were operated continuously with synthetic wastewater for 30 days the hydraulic retention time hrt was 72 h li et al 2014 özengin and elmaci 2016 operating a flow rate of approximately 15 ml min finally the three ppcps were incorporated into their mix in the feed tanks containing synthetic wastewater at nominal concentrations of 200 μg l this being similar to those reported in wastewater česen et al 2019 pérez et al 2018 williams et al 2019 the operation of each reactor was evaluated by measuring physicochemical parameters such as ph temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids redox potential and chemical oxygen demand in the affluent and effluent in addition to the determination of the concentrations of each ppcps sampling was carried out every 20 days over a period of six months with each sampling denominated as m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 and m8 unplanted systems were denominated as h1 and h2 and planted wetlands such as h3 and h4 based on their respective replica 2 4 determination of ppcps and physicochemical parameters chemical analyzes for ppcps detection in environmental matrices were performed on the soluble fraction ramos 2018 the samples were separated into two amber glass bottles to one of which 200 μg l of the compounds studied was added in order to determine loss of the interest compounds during their transport and handling the samples were filtered using 47 mm diameter fiberglass membranes with 0 45 micron pore size 0 01 nan3 and edta was added to them and they were immediately taken to the laboratory where they were kept at 4 c for analysis within the following 24 hours solid phase extraction spe was carried out using waters brand oasis hlb type c18 cartridges which were conditioned with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of nanopure water the same sample volume was diluted in nanopure water 100 ml and this solution was circulated through spe cartridges then the compounds of interest were desorbed with 5 ml of methanol a procedure taken from elorriaga et al 2013b the extracts were under a nitrogen stream and resuspended in 0 50 ml methanol nanopure water 1 1 the selective quantifications of the selected compounds the environmental samples and of those evaluated in the constructed wetlands were carried out by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry aristizabal et al 2017 using 0 1 formic acid and 99 9 purity methanol as solvents for the mobile phase each characteristic ion was selected according to what was posed by elorriaga et al 2013a prior to characterization in scanning mode scan under the same chromatographic conditions studied method detection limits mdl and method quantification limits mql for cbz sil and mp were determined in spiked samples of the three ppcps considered as the minimum detectable amount of analyte with signal to noise ratio of 3 for mdl and 10 for mql according to the criteria established by sante 11945 2015 mql and mdl were of 0 50 μg l and 0 15 μg l for cbz 2 29 μg l and 0 69 μg l for sil and 5 0 μg l and 1 5 μg l for mp respectively to determine the ppcps absorption capacity of the plants a plant of each species and each wetland was taken the macrophytes were washed dried in the environment and kept at 20 c until the moment of analysis the aoac method was used for the plant material analysis 9 mg from the filter bed between the rhizosphere of the biofilm coated plants was taken together with the plants in order to determine the microbial degradation of the compounds and was maintained in methanol at 4 c until analysis this sampling was performed only at the end of the entire study to avoid alterations in the systems the same procedure mentioned above by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was performed for the analysis of ppcps in the substrate and in the plant material the dissolved oxygen ph conductivity total dissolved solids redox potential and temperature of the medium were determined in situ in the affluent and the effluent using a hi98194 hanna multiparameter the cod evaluation was performed in the laboratory according to method 5220 of the standard methods apha 1998 2 5 ppcps mass balance in the cwhsf taking into account the total mass of the incorporated ppcps the total mass detected in the effluent the total mass absorbed by the plants and the amount detected by adsorption on the substrate a mass balance was made for the ppcps in the constructed wetlands the remaining difference of the compounds was attributed to the removal by other mechanisms such as biodegradation or biotransformation the mass balance was calculated according to what was proposed by tejeda et al 2017 using the eq one 1 m a s s ppcps affluent m a s s ppcps effluent m a s s ppcps in macrophytes mass ppcps in substrate elimination by other mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality and occurrence of pharmaceuticals the impact of ppcps is an environmental science and engineering area in development it is also a study field that has recently emerged in different parts of the world archer et al 2017b bu et al 2013 in countries like colombia it is necessary to generate a greater volume of information in order to enhance knowledge about its presence and distribution in water bodies as well as to evaluate technologies for its elimination in the table 2 and the fig 2 some physicochemical parameters and the concentrations of the ppcps are presented respectively measured at the sampled sites the samples taken were analyzed only on the soluble fraction since these compounds are mainly mobilized on this fraction ramos 2018 the presence of ppcps was evident in all the sampled sites with concentrations between lc and 10 66 μg l for cbz between 0 8 and 7 24 μg l for mp and between 0 13 and 2 64 μg l for sil the highest concentrations of cbz were presented at points p2 and p4 which have the lowest flow rates and the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen its concentration decreased by approximately 80 in the samples evaluated 1 km downstream at points p3 and p5 mp presented the same behavior at points p4 and p5 however its concentration remained stable at points p2 p3 p6 and p7 meanwhile sil did not show major variations in any of the sites studied although the cauca river has a length of approximately 200 km from point p7 to point c3a the presence of ppcps became evident even at concentrations higher than those determined at point p7 thus according to reports by other authors archer et al 2017a ramos 2018 a persistent pseudo behavior of these pollutants in surface waters could be determined similarly the three compounds were detected in the conventional dwtp and wwtp effluents c3e and c4e showing a behavior similar to that previously reported for the removal of emerging contaminants bu et al 2013 gavrilescu et al 2015 rodriguez et al 2017 removals below 30 have been found for mp matamoros et al 2015 while cbz is reported as a recalcitrant contaminant zhang et al 2012 compared with the conventional treatments similarly afonso olivares et al 2017 reported its high resistance with removal efficiencies of less than 40 in activated sludge treatment plants therefore as expected its presence was also evident 2 5 km downstream at point c5 higher concentrations were evidenced in the effluent from the treatment plants however it is important to highlight that direct injections were made at point c4a so the results may have been altered although similar behavior has been reported onesios et al 2009 shaver 2011 verlicchi and zambello 2014 determined removals of up to 316 for cbz in biological treatments the presence in the environment of several emerging pollutants has been evident for about a decade this includes cbz with maximum concentrations of 6 μg l ternes 1998 recently in countries such as slovenia croatia argentina and india concentrations similar to those found in the present study have been reported with values of up to 18 μg l for cbz and 2 μg l for mp česen et al 2019 pérez et al 2018 williams et al 2019 consequently the detection of these emerging pollutants in the environment is becoming a growing concern due to their potential effects on aquatic biota and human health through indirect contact as is the case with their detection in treated wastewater and drinking water geissen et al 2015 it has been reported that the acute effects of pharmaceutical products are related to concentrations generally 100 1000 times higher than those found in the aquatic environment however chronic adverse effects have been observed in the range found in wastewater concentrations petrie et al 2015 vieira et al 2016 afonso olivares et al 2017 pérez et al 2018 on the other hand it is interesting to evaluate this same information detection of ppcps in surface and residual water using a different interpretation based on molars as can be seen in fig s3 in the supplementary material this interpretation is done since moles are used to normalize data and cancel out molecular weight differences between multi residue compounds according to this interpretation a higher concentration of mp was determined for the different points evaluated compared with the mass based data μg l as can be seen in fig 2 and fig s3 see supplementary information under this new context the mp presented the highest concentration for the evaluated samples with a value of 4 76 μm analyzed for point 4 on the contrary in the mass based data the cbz presented the highest concentration 10 66 μg l however the highest concentrations detected at this point both for cbz and mp are consistent for the two methodologies analyzed finally unlike the mp the molar concentrations of cbz and sil did not show significant variability this is an interesting point of view considering that variability in the results was determined using mass based and molar based data therefore according to unit conversions for a low molecular weight a high molar concentration is obtained in aqueous solutions thus an example for the conversion of mass based and molar based units is presented in eq s1 and eq s2 of the supplementary material 3 2 ppcps removal using cwhsf according to the studies carried out there is a need to develop and implement alternative technologies for wastewater treatment that are able to remove both emerging and traditional pollutants in order to mitigate adverse effects on aquatic biota and human health therefore constructed wetlands have arisen as an alternative technology for ppcps treatment given that they have proven efficient in removing some emerging pollutants matamoros et al 2017 consequently in this investigation cwhsfs were evaluated for the removal of ppcps from domestic wastewater the systems affluent concentrations for ppcps mixtures were 170 40 μg l for cbz 110 70 μg l for sil and 180 50 μg l for mp 3 2 1 cbz particular analysis the results obtained for cbz treatment using cwhsf are presented in fig 3 a in the first sampling an apparent removal efficiency of approximately 60 was achieved both in planted and non planted systems however when evaluating the following samples it was found that the efficiency previously determined decreased considerably when the affluent and effluent concentrations of each system were evaluated by means of a paired t test with a significance level of 0 05 p value results of 0 497 0 369 0 687 and 0 710 were obtained for the h1 h2 h3 and h4 system respectively therefore no statistically significant differences were found between the input and output concentrations when comparing the values obtained in the effluents of the reactors by means of a unifactorial analysis of variance a p value of 0 809 was obtained for the same level of significance of the paired t test this showed that there was also no statistically significant difference between the planted and unplanted reactors concluding that after the stabilization time which was reached at approximately forty days removal efficiencies less than 10 were obtained different configurations of constructed wetlands have been reported in order to assess the removal efficiency of recalcitrant contaminants such as cbz however removals have rarely exceeded 50 kahl et al 2017 tejeda et al 2017 verlicchi and zambello 2014 hydraulic retention times have also been modified between 2 and 15 days to improve elimination but efficiency also did not vary significantly as a result li et al 2014 removals of up to 90 have been obtained using leca as a support bed over 6 days of operation dordio et al 2010 özengin and elmaci 2016 however it is important to evaluate longer times to determine if there is a saturation point as observed in this research özengin and elmaci 2016 the stability of cbz can be attributed to its remarkable resistance to biodegradation to its complex molecular structure and to its toxic effect on microorganisms matamoros and bayona 2008 matamoros et al 2017 delgado et al 2018 3 2 2 sil particular analysis based on the results obtained by delgado et al 2018 in biological treatments sil was gradually incorporated into the affluent in order to counteract the negative effects on the developed microorganisms the initial concentrations for the m1 m2 m3 and m4 samples were 44 6 μg l and those for the m5 m6 m7 and m8 samples were 168 40 μg l the results obtained for sil are presented in fig 3b a statistical analysis similar to the one previously proposed for cbz was performed using paired t tests and a significance level of 0 05 the results obtained from the p value to determine the variability between the affluent and effluent concentrations of each reactor were between 0 001 0 0003 for both concentrations in both cases the variability in the mean values of the two groups evaluated was greater than would be expected due to random errors indicating that there was a statistically significant difference between the input and output concentrations when comparing the effluent concentrations of wetlands h1 and h2 with those of wetlands h3 and h4 a p value lower than 0 001 was obtained showing statistically significant differences between planted and unplanted systems on the other hand no statistically significant differences were observed between the effluent concentrations of each wetland with its control with p values of 0 158 and 0 619 for the h1 h2 and h3 h4 wetlands respectively verifying that each treatment behaved as a replica and not as an individual system the time required to achieve operational stability in each reactor was approximately 60 days removal efficiencies greater than 97 were obtained for the lowest concentrations in planted wetlands while in unplanted wetlands these concentrations were reduced by approximately 40 when evaluating higher concentrations average removal efficiencies of 91 were achieved with a maximum of 97 in planted systems on the other hand in unplanted systems the average removals were 65 similar results have been reported for planted and unplanted systems for some pharmaceuticals such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen hijosa valsero et al 2011 hijosa valsero et al 2016 it is therefore concluded that plants have an important role in the removal of sil which has been reported as a recalcitrant contaminant in previous works delgado et al 2016 grossberger et al 2014 reaching removal efficiencies below 20 in conventional treatment plants and in fixed film biological treatments delgado et al 2018 rivera utrilla et al 2013 however no papers were found that evaluate the elimination of this compound using constructed wetlands 3 2 3 mp particular analysis the results obtained for mp removal using cwhsf are shown in fig 3c the mp effluent concentrations using wetlands h1 h2 h3 and h4 were below the quantification limit of the technique so it can be asserted that removal efficiencies greater than 97 were obtained there were no statistically significant differences in the removal efficiency of planted and unplanted systems nor was there a difference between their replicas with p values greater than 0 05 the stabilization time required to remove this contaminant was less than twenty days similar behavior was observed in the degradation of organic matter as shown in fig 3d reaching an elimination efficiency of 95 in the different systems evaluated little information is available on mp removal efficiency using natural methods in previous studies in climatic conditions where the four seasons are presented elimination of mp was evaluated using real scale constructed wetlands reaching an average efficiency of 42 matamoros et al 2016 in contrast the wetlands evaluated in the present study showed a 55 increase the better results are probably due to the different climatic conditions with average temperatures of 22 c throughout the year as these systems function well in tropical climates tejeda et al 2017 the high removal efficiency of mp may be due to its simple molecular structure the molecular composition of mp presents essential chemical elements c h o which are easily degraded by microorganisms reddy and delaune 2008 in addition having a single aromatic ring attached to a hydroxyl group and a methyl chain both in para position gives it a favorable stoichiometry flat molecule for moderate adsorption on the substrate log koc 2 4 and easy dispersion in wastewater log dow 1 66 and log kow 1 96 previous studies have reached the same conclusion reporting that organic compounds with simple molecular structure which have high water solubility and moderate adsorption capacity are easily degraded by microorganisms matamoros et al 2017 according to the results obtained and the studies reported it can be concluded that the main process of mp removal is bacterial degradation naipal 2014 delgado et al 2018 on the contrary it has been reported that those recalcitrant organic compounds such as cbz which have chemical elements and structures very different from those of natural compounds are slowly degraded by microorganisms li et al 2014 however for sil which has a complex molecular structure high elimination efficiencies 90 were achieved in the systems evaluated in the present work therefore there are factors other than the molecular structure that may influence the removal of this emerging contaminant however it is important to keep in mind that cbz has three aromatic rings attached see table 1 which may be a characteristic that makes removal difficult given that microorganisms cannot break this bond type thus although the constructed wetlands are very efficient and low cost natural technology to remove emergent contaminants such as mp and sil it is important to consider polishing tertiary treatments for recalcitrant contaminants such as cbz for instance advanced chemical and biological treatment systems have been assessed ozonation ozone ultraviolet irradiation ozone hydrogen peroxide ultrafiltration reverse osmosis granular activated carbon contact and membrane biological reactors modern wwtps could be equipped with these technologies for a polishing step as these technologies are proven to be effective in many cases however their capital and operational costs are very high which highlights the need for cost effective sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment technologies more details regarding the treatment of emerging pollutants by various conventional and advanced treatment technologies can be found in literature for instance in the review article published by ilyas and hullebusch 2020 3 3 the impact of macrophytes in the removal of ppcps at the end of this study the species with the lowest standing biomass was heliconea zingiberales with an average of 12 plants per wetland and an average weight of 135 g per plant the total biomass weight was 1400 g the cyperus haspan presented good conditions of development and population with an average of 230 plants per wetland and an average weight of 12 g per plant with a total biomass of 3000 g during the first three months of acclimatization heliconea zingiberales presented good development however after two months of continuous ppcp incorporation it was clearly the species that exhibited the greatest signs of stress competition between the plants could also have been a source of additional stress the average absorption levels of cbz sil and mp in cyperus haspan were 0 51 μg g 0 14 μg g and 0 03 μg g respectively the average absorption values in heliconea zingiberales were 0 29 μg g 0 05 μg g and 0 03 μg g respectively the most highly absorbed compound was cbz followed by sil and mp it was determined that cyperus haspan has a greater capacity to absorb pharmaceuticals than heliconea zingiberales table 3 these results suggest that the removal absorption efficiency of macrophytes which are exposed to ppcps varies by species tejeda et al 2017 there are few studies that evaluate macrophyte polyculture in wetlands however tejada et al 2017 found similar behaviors for ornamental plants exposed to cbz other studies have reported higher levels of cbz absorption in species such as scirpus validus with concentrations between 3 6 19 7 μg g zhang et al 2013 and 1 17 μg g in typha spp dordio et al 2011 it is important to keep in mind that the low levels of sil and mp detected in the cwhsf effluents may be due to their metabolism by macrophytes on the contrary the higher concentration of cbz detected and its low removal efficiency indicate the stability of the molecule which was also not easily metabolized by the macrophytes 3 4 the impact of substrate on the removal of ppcps the substrate is an important component in constructed wetlands especially in subsurface flow wetlands it also offers support for plant growth and it provides a means of adhesion for biofilm the total weight of the substrate in the wetlands was approximately 144000 g the compound with the highest affinity for the substrate was sil followed by cbz and finally mp with values of 1 95 μg g 0 23 μg g and 0 18 μg g respectively as seen in table 4 a positive linear trend was determined between the organic water carbon partition coefficient log koc and the concentration of the ppcps detected with a correlation coefficient of 0 971 and a significance level of 0 1 this correlation did not correspond to ppcps removal efficiency since the compound with the lowest adsorption level was mp but this presented the greatest removal efficiency 97 followed by sil 90 and finally cbz 10 currently very few data are available on the adsorption levels of ppcps on the support bed however cbz adsorption concentrations of 0 09 μg g have been reported on gravel matamoros et al 2005 3 5 mass balance for ppcps a general mass balance was made for the planted wetlands applying eq 1 in order to determine in a global way the removal mechanisms for pollutants and identify which was of greatest importance according to the average affluent concentration of cbz 168 μg l the effluent concentration 157 μg l and the amount absorbed by the macrophytes 0 51 μg g and 0 29 μg g and on the substrate 0 23 μg g during the study time the mass balance for cbz was determined as shown in eq 2 a detailed analysis of the equation can be observed in the supplementary material mass balance for cbz 2 518 m g cbz affluent 483 m g effluent 1 9 m g macrophytes 33 1 m g substrate according to the results obtained it was determined that only about 7 of cbz was retained in planted wetlands of which approximately 6 6 was detected in gravel 0 3 was retained by cyperus haspan and a 0 1 by heliconea zingiberales on the other hand of the total cbz adhered on the gravel 22 was retained during the first 20 days of study generating an apparent removal as seen in graph a of fig 3 the same procedure as described above was performed to determine the global removal efficiency of sil with the corresponding mass balance as shown in eq 3 the average values determined were 170 μg l in the affluent and 13 μg l in the effluent meanwhile the absorption by the macrophytes was 0 14 μg g and 0 05 μg g for cyperus haspan and heliconea zingiberaes respectively see table 3 and the adsorption on the substrate was 1 95 μg g see table 4 a detailed calculation can be observed in the supplementary material mass balance for sil 3 524 m g sil affluent 40 m g effluent 0 47 m g macropytes 281 m g substrate 202 53 other mechanisms according to the calculations obtained it was determined that 93 of sil was retained in planted wetlands 0 08 was detected in cyperus haspan and 0 01 in heliconea zingiberales the value found in the substrate was 52 the elimination by other mechanisms was 41 the adhesion of sil on the bed could contribute to its biodegradation since the levels determined in the effluent were less than 7 for mp the average values were affluent concentration 177 μg l effluent concentration 2 5 μg l absorption on the macrophytes 0 03 μg g for both species see table 3 and adsorption on the substrate 0 18 μg g see table 4 99 of mp was retained in the cwhsf less than 0 01 was detected in macrophytes and 4 6 was detected on the substrate therefore the biodegradation removal was 94 see mass balance for mp in the supplementary material 4 545 m g mp affluent 8 m g effluent 0 13 m g macrophytes 26 m g substrate 510 87 other mechanisms it is therefore possible to confirm that the main mechanism of removal for this molecule was bacterial degradation which suggests mp metabolism by microorganisms delgado et al 2018 it is widely accepted that organic compounds with log kow between 0 5 3 can pass through cell membranes and enter the transpiration currents of plants dordio et al 2011 reyes contreras et al 2012 therefore it is likely that the macrophytes played an active role in the elimination of sil through direct absorption since their octanol water partition coefficient is 2 75 however cbz which has a similar log kow 2 77 did not present the same elimination efficiency therefore the sil degradation capacity may be due to the adaptation speed and the metabolism of the evaluated macrophytes petrie et al 2017 in addition microorganisms that develop in the rhizosphere can play an important role in the degradation of this compound since the use of a polyculture promotes a greater microorganism diversity which can adapt to break down organic molecules into simple intermediates and in many cases degrade them completely li et al 2014 mp has a log kow 1 96 within the range established above however studies have shown that its main mechanism of removal is bacterial degradation since no significant difference have been observed between planted and unplanted wetlands elimination by photodegradation was not taken into account since it is not a relevant factor in subsurface flow wetlands previous studies show the stability of ppcps against this factor delgado et al 2016 delgado et al 2019 elimination by volatilization was not considered because these pollutants have very low values of henry s constant with values of 7 2 10 21 and 2 23 10 9 for sil y mp respectively as can be seen in table 1 3 6 the impact of the ppcps on treated water quality the values of the physicochemical parameters determined in the affluent were 5 0 0 4 mg l for dissolved oxygen 6 9 0 1 for ph 21 1 c for temperature 105 8 mg l for total dissolved solids 0 22 0 03 ms cm for the conductivity and 195 31 mv for the oxide reduction potential the concentration of the organic load was 198 25 mg l reaching removal efficiencies greater than 95 after each treatment the average values of dissolved oxygen d o in the effluents of each system were 0 2 0 1 mg l showing a drastic reduction with respect to the affluent values its low concentration is due to the predominantly anoxic conditions in the cwhsf saeed and sun 2012 the ph values for the planted and unplanted systems were 5 9 0 3 and 7 0 0 1 respectively it is important to highlight that the average levels of this parameter in all systems were within the accepted limits 4 8 for the good development of microorganisms hijosa valsero et al 2016 the treated water temperatures were 19 1 c for the different cases studied results consistent with the cbz removal from this study were obtained by matamoros et al 2017 as well as by anjos et al 2018 for mp however there are authors who have reported efficiencies of up to 40 for cbz under these study conditions dordio et al 2010 temperature can be an important factor in the removal of ppcps since lower efficiencies have been reported for mp with lower temperatures verlicchi et al 2015 the average effluent values for total dissolved solids in planted and unplanted wetlands were 65 19 mg l and 132 14 mg l respectively therefore the greater efficiency of sil removal in planted wetlands could be related to their greater adsorption capacity on solids and their subsequent absorption and assimilation by macrophytes similar conclusions were having been in other studies verlicchi and zambello 2014 however more specific research on these interactions is necessary conductivity in the planted and unplanted systems showed values of 0 13 0 04 ms cm and 0 26 0 03 ms cm respectively lower values of redox potential were detected compared to the affluent values with average results of 61 47 mv and 36 57 mv for planted and unplanted wetlands respectively it has been reported that redox potential is one of the most interesting parameters to take into account when evaluating the removal capacity of a specific compound in a constructed wetland verlicchi and zambello 2014 thus sil presented better removal efficiencies under oxidizing conditions but no comparative studies have been found the values obtained in each system evaluated can be seen in fig s3 of the supplementary material 4 conclusions all surface water samples evidenced the presence of pharmaceuticals and personal care products as did the affluents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants demonstrating the need to take efficient measures to mitigate contamination of rivers with these compounds through anthropogenic activities high elimination efficiencies for methylparaben were obtained in all systems evaluated with values greater than 97 similar levels for sildenafil were achieved in planted wetlands while in the unplanted wetlands the efficiency was reduced by approximately 30 carbamazepine behaved as a recalcitrant contaminant against different treatments with removals below 10 thus it is concluded that evaluated systems are capable of efficiently removing compounds of simple molecular structure such as mp and also compounds of more complex structures such as sil the most detected compound in the macrophytes was cbz followed by sil and finally mp on the other hand sil showed greatest affinity for the substrate followed by cbz and mp the levels detected by absorption in the macrophytes and gravel did not follow the same order of removal efficiencies for each wetland evaluated since mp the compound with the lowest concentrations detected in both processes was the most efficiently removed evidencing its biodegradation in these systems after analyzing the mass balance it is concluded that cbz does not biodegrade since the total affluent mass corresponded to the combined total of the effluent mass the mass absorbed by the plants and that adhered to the substrate for sil one of the main mechanisms that contributed to its degradation is adsorption on the support bed which apparently allows this compound to be retained long enough to be degraded by plants or microorganisms it is confirmed that the main mechanism of removal for mp is bacterial degradation because this was not detected in the effluent the support bed or in the macrophytes and no significant differences were shown in the efficiency of removal of the planted and

17501,expansion in the size is an indispensable stage in the granular sludge life cycle but little attention has been payed to the enlargement mechanism of granular sludge here we propose a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism by the self assembly of heterogenous granules two different colors of anammox granules dark red granules dr granules and bright red granules br granules were found in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor these two heterogenous granules were not isolated but were assembled into granules with a larger dr granule in the center and many smaller br granules aggregated on the surface increasing the overall granular size their physiochemical characteristics in terms of eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions were identified and compared to elucidate the interaction between the different colors of granules the br granules created 92 more extracellular polymeric substances than the dr granules this material blocked the passage of gas and substrate leading to br granules smaller size and a yield stress approximately 48 lower than that of the dr granules nevertheless the br granules had compact extracellular protein secondary structures and a high adherence rate to the surface of the dr granules upon which they formed a compact adhered layer these unique features enabled them to directionally adhere to dr granules in the core that is two heterogenous colors of granules self assembled into large anammox granules the enlargement mechanism was further supported by the abundance of k strategy ca kuenenia in the dr granules inner layer being higher than in the br granules outer layer 2 9 0 4 vs 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 and by visualized confirmation that the larger br granules wrapped around smaller dr granules inside this demonstrates that heterogenous anammox granules actively self assemble into large granules which is an important step in the lifecycle of anammox granules graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox color enlargement mechanism granular sludge granulation heterogeneity 1 introduction sludge granules are compact and dense aggregates diameter larger than 200 μm and formed through self immobilization of microorganisms barr et al 2010 liu et al 2009 granular sludge technology has several advantages over dispersed sludge technology for sustainable wastewater treatment these include excellent settleability high biomass concentration small footprint great capacity to withstand high loadings and high nutrient removal efficiency lemaire et al 2008 liu et al 2009 wilén et al 2018 zhang and okabe 2020 granular reactor is a promising and important form of high rate reactor and the various types of sludge granules used in wastewater treatment systems can be broadly divided into three categories aerobic granules liu et al 2010 anaerobic granules sudmalis et al 2018 and photogranules abouhend et al 2020 trebuch et al 2020 since it was first developed more than 40 years ago lettinga et al 1980 granular sludge technology has been widely studied in terms of process stability manavi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 microbial community distribution vázquez padín et al 2010 and granulation mechanisms barr et al 2010 granule formation mechanisms have been proposed for aerobic and anaerobic granules that function in the removal of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus studies on the formation of aerobic granules are at the forefront of this field barr et al 2010 liu and tay 2004 sarma et al 2017 although the properties of granules vary depending on the different operational conditions or bioreactors in which they are formed their formation mechanisms may be similar and involve several steps for example the four steps in aerobic granule formation have been described as 1 initial bacterium to bacterium adhesion 2 microaggregate formation 3 synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps and 4 maturation liu and tay 2004 two other granulation mechanisms for aerobic granules have been suggested microaggregate outgrowth and microaggregates aggregation barr et al 2010 although great efforts have been made to investigate granulation mechanisms no consensus has as yet been achieved and the exact formation mechanism is still a mystery specifically the process of granular size evolution is rarely mentioned or simply referred to as granule formation even though it is an important part of the granule life cycle granular sludge is a compact broadly spherical aggregate with different diameters 0 2 25 mm barr et al 2010 zhu et al 2018 and there are no two identical granules inside a reactor in terms of size color shape etc the heterogeneity among granules is very useful for investigation of some properties of granules for example in an aerobic granule system treating saline wastewater granules were grouped into two groups light brown granules and black granules that looked fluffy taheri et al 2012 the black fluffy granules which were resistant to salt were thought to be a variation of the light brown granules color segregation of aerobic granules was also reported in other systems and it was deemed to be a common phenomenon barr et al 2010 wu et al 2018 anammox granules are anaerobic granules for autotrophic nitrogen removal which are dominated by anammox bacteria that are capable of oxidizing ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as electron acceptors anammox granules have been extensively studied since their discovery over 20 years ago because of their numerous economic advantages e g no need for the addition of external organic carbon and low operational cost lin and wang 2017 tang et al 2011 van de graaf et al 1995 although there have been some studies on their superior aggregation properties hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020a 2020b the formation mechanisms of anammox granules especially the enlargement mechanisms are still poorly understood like in other granule systems the heterogeneity among granules also exists in anammox granule systems for example color difference among three different reactors was observed and determined to be due to cytochrome c and fe s compounds kang et al 2018 moreover tests of the size differences between anammox granules in the same reactor showed that ca brocadia and ca kuenenia preferred to grow in large granules 0 4 mm whereas ca jettenia dominated in small and moderate sized sludge 0 4 mm liu et al 2017 anammox granules of 0 5 0 9 mm were selected as optimal in low strength ammonium wastewater treatment for a high nitrogen removal rate zhu et al 2018 although there have been some studies on the differences among anammox granules relevant to nitrogen removal performance in the same or different reactors kang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 heterogeneity among anammox granules in the same reactor needs further investigation to elucidate how they interact and aggregate structurally the control mechanism for anammox granule evolution and the key parameters impacting granule evolution understanding the mechanisms of anammox granular size evolution is the key to develop effective control strategies maintaining robust autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater in the expanded granular sludge bed reactor egsb used in this study two colors of heterogenous anammox granules were found dark red granules dr granules and bright red granules br granules these two types of heterogenous granules did not exist in isolation but were rather assembled in structures characterized by a larger dr granule in the center with many smaller br granules aggregated on the surface to understand the formation of these special anammox granules the differences in eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions between the two heterogenous colors of anammox granules were analyzed and compared finally a heterogenous anammox granule self assembly mechanism was proposed to explain the enlargement of these anammox granules to the best of our knowledge the color segregation of anammox granules in the same reactor and the self assembly of heterogenous anammox granules to enlarge granular size have not been reported previously understanding anammox granule heterogeneity and the self assembly mechanism by which the granular size increases will augment existing knowledge of granular size evolution aid in understanding of the granulation process and provide theoretical and engineering bases for the practical application of anammox granular techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox granule cultivation and collection anammox granules were successfully enriched in a lab scale egsb reactor with a working volume of 2 2 l wang et al 2019 the reactor was operated anoxically in a continuous flow mode inorganic synthetic wastewater was fed to the reactor with a nitrogen loading rate of 2 3 kg n m3 d the composition of synthetic wastewater is given in si s1 the temperature was controlled at 35 c using a water bath and the upflow velocity was controlled at 2 6 m h the reactor had been stably operated in the above conditions for 400 days anammox granules taken from the reactor were first sieved using a 0 35 mm sieve and then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline pbs the collected granules were then artificially divided into two colors dr granules and br granules based on visual analysis fig 1 2 2 eps extraction and characterization the concentration and chemical composition of eps play an important role in sludge aggregation in this study a heat method was used for eps extraction yin et al 2015 briefly 2 ml of anammox granules were mixed with 6 ml 0 05 nacl solution the mixture was then heated at 60 c for 30 min and centrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and collected as eps solution the protein and humic acid contents in eps were determined using a modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin and humic acids as standards respectively bo et al 1995 the polysaccharide content was measured by the anthrone method with glucose as the standard wu et al 2009 the dna content in eps was tested by the diphenylamine colorimetric method with dna from calf thymus as the standard liu et al 2016 total organic carbon toc was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l japan the total concentration of eps was determined as the sum of the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of eps were performed using a fluoromax 4 spectrophotometer horiba japan and an ftir spectrometer nicolet 5700 usa respectively the detailed methods are described in a previous study wang et al 2020b for collection of eem spectra the toc in eps samples was diluted to 20 mg l using a 0 05 nacl solution for protein secondary structure analysis the amide i region of the ftir spectra 1700 1600 cm 1 was first deconvoluted and then fitted using peakfit software version 4 12 yin et al 2015 2 3 adhesion properties revealed using a quartz crystal microbalance technique with dissipation monitoring qcm d qcm d q sense analyzer sweden was used to investigate the adhesion properties of anammox sludge samples and extracted eps samples with gold coated sensor chips to disperse the anammox consortia the anammox granules were first gently ground and then ultrasonicated at 50 w for 15 min 3 s ultrasound 7 s interval the sludge was washed three times with pbs and resuspended in 0 9 nacl solution sludge samples were homogenized by adjusting the od600 to 0 1 using 0 9 nacl solution while the toc of the eps samples was diluted to 20 mg l using 0 05 nacl solution qcm d experiments were conducted at 25 c with a constant flow rate of 0 1 ml min before each experiment the baseline was measured using background solution 0 9 or 0 05 nacl solution the variations in frequency δf hz and dissipation energy δd were measured for six overtones n 3 5 7 9 11 and 13 and representative results for the third overtone are presented 2 4 granule intensity analyzed by rheological measurements the granule intensity was analyzed directly by rheological tests which were performed on an mcr 102 rheometer anton paar austria a fixed frequency of ω 5 rad s was used for strain sweep measurements the strain γ was measured from 0 1 to 150 the storage modulus g loss modulus g and complex viscosity η were recorded automatically all measurements were performed at 25 c 2 5 quantitative pcr qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing the absolute and relative abundances of anammox bacteria were analyzed using qpcr and high throughput sequencing respectively genomic dna was extracted from anammox granular samples using a fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s instructions real time pcr was used to quantify the abundance of anammox bacteria using an abi7300 qpcr system applied biosystems usa the primer pairs for determination of total anammox bacteria were amx 808f 5 arcygtaaacgatgggcactaa 3 and amx 1040r 5

the qpcr program consisted of a 5 min denaturation at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 c 30 s at 58 c and 40 s at 72 c plasmid dna was serially diluted 10 fold to obtain standard curves for

ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 microbial community composition was determined using the illumina miseq platform majorbio china wang et al 2019 the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units using 97 identity thresholds 2 6 other analytical procedures the morphology and surface structure of anammox granules were examined with an szx16 stereoscopic microscope olympus japan and an s4800 scanning electron microscope hitachi japan respectively suspended solids and volatile suspended solids vss were measured using the standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of heterogenous anammox granules in the egsb reactor studied two colors of heterogenous anammox granules dr granules and br granules were found in high concentrations fig 1 numerous special anammox granules were also observed in which many smaller br granules adhered to the surface of a bigger dr granule that formed a core this combination displayed a cauliflower like surface fig 2 a c and 2g i therefore the two different colors of anammox granules were not present in isolation but assembled in granules in which the dr granule acted as a nucleus to which the small br granules adhered in other words anammox granules became larger by the automatic arrangement of a dr granule on the inside and many br granules on the outer layer through collision information exchange and adherence furthermore some large br granules were observed which broke easily when touched and contained small dr core inside fig 2d f we deemed that the inner core are dr granules rather than inert particulates the ash content of br granules was 14 6 1 9 table 1 but the volume of the dark core of br granules seemed to be approximately 30 of the total granule volume as shown in fig 2e and f accordingly if the dark core of the br granules is inert particulate the ash content of the br granules should be over 30 because the density of the ash content is much greater than the microbes we also speculate that the inherent features of the two distinct colors of anammox granules determined this aggregation pattern therefore the physical characteristics eps contents adherence and intensity properties and microbial compositions of the two heterogenous granules were analyzed which are related to granule formation or the color segregation 3 2 physical characteristics of two distinct colors of anammox granules table 1 presents the physical characteristics of the two colors of anammox granules most of the dr granules had a compact structure with a lower ash content 12 9 4 1 while most of the br granules had a fluffy structure and a higher ash content 14 6 1 9 p 0 46 the dr granules had a specific gravity and settling velocity of 1 13 0 15 and 2 23 0 14 cm s respectively compared with the dr granules the br granules had a higher specific gravity and settling velocity 1 29 0 22 and 2 27 0 13 cm s respectively p 0 49 and 0 38 respectively consistent with their higher ash contents table 1 the differences in specific gravity could lead to the stratification of two colors of heterogenous anammox granules in the up flow egsb reactor br granules with high specific gravity could be in the bottom of the egsb which would obtain more substrate the influent enters the egsb from the bottom and flows upwards and further lead to higher abundance of anammox bacteria than that of dr granules details in section 3 6 while the average granular size was not measured visual inspection of br granules and dr granules over a long period of time suggests that br granules are generally larger in size than dr granules which could support the enlargement assumption 3 3 characterization of eps in distinct colors of anammox granules eps is a general term for a class of biomacromolecules released by bacteria sheng et al 2010 and their properties are closely related to granule structure maintenance and aggregation jia et al 2017 yin et al 2015 accordingly the differences in eps composition and protein secondary structure in the two distinct colors of anammox granule were determined and compared 3 3 1 chemical composition of the anammox granular eps fig 3 a shows that the concentration of total eps and of each component proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna in the bright red anammox granular eps br eps was almost twice that of the dark red anammox granular eps dr eps in dr eps the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna were 72 8 12 8 30 7 1 7 23 3 9 0 and 10 4 1 4 mg g vss respectively while those in br eps were 129 8 15 1 74 1 14 0 53 7 5 0 and 20 3 1 9 mg g vss respectively fig 3a thus the total eps concentration was 92 higher in br eps than in dr eps 263 8 12 6 vs 137 2 13 1 mg g vss p 0 0002 the toc content in br eps was 138 2 8 8 mg g vss approximately 83 higher than that in dr eps 75 6 4 7 mg g vss p 0 0004 an eps concentration in excess of 200 mg g vss is known to cause the occlusion of granule porosity corsino et al 2016 truong et al 2018 the high eps concentration in the br granules likely obstructs their gas tunnels leading to the accumulation of gas n2 inside the granules and their eventual breakage fig 2d f substrates would also be blocked by the high level of eps causing the starvation of internal microbes therefore the higher dna concentration in br eps than in dr eps may be attributed to greater starvation in the br granules the extracellular protein polysaccharide ratio strongly influences the granule properties and a higher protein polysaccharide ratio generally results in poorer settling performance tang et al 2011 and a less negatively charged surface zhang et al 2007 the protein polysaccharide ratio in dr eps was indeed found to be higher than that in br eps 2 47 0 21 vs 1 83 0 03 p 0 006 which corresponded well with the lower settling velocity table 1 and more compact structure of dr granules compared with br granules fig 1b the different eps concentrations between the dr granules and br granules may cause other differences in the granules adherence properties and the intensities this is discussed in detail in sections 3 4 and 3 5 3 3 2 eem and ftir spectra of the anammox granular eps eem and ftir spectroscopy are sensitive methods to identify the fluorescent components and functional groups in eps eem spectra of dr eps and br eps are summarized in fig s1 and table s1 and no obvious difference was observed in the fluorescent contents between dr eps and br eps the peak at excitation ex emission em wavelengths of 275 300 nm was related to tyrosine and protein like substances while the peak at ex em of 275 280 340 350 nm was ascribed to tryptophan and protein like substances chen et al 2003 both peaks were found in both eps samples and the fluorescence intensity of each peak in the two eps samples was almost the same table s1 ftir spectra of dr eps and br eps are shown in fig 3b the bands were attributed to characteristic bands of proteins c o and c c stretching 1643 1637 cm 1 amide iii deformation vibration of c o 1268 1253 cm 1 hou et al 2015 lotti et al 2019 wu et al 2019 polysaccharides c oh stretching 1080 1079 cm 1 wu et al 2019 carbohydrates and lipids c h stretching 2963 2962 cm 1 lotti et al 2019 carboxylic acids symmetric stretching of c o 1407 1402 cm 1 hou et al 2015 and hydroxyl groups stretching vibrations of o h 3428 3420 cm 1 wu et al 2019 the position and number of characteristic bands were similar between the samples suggesting the presence of similar functional groups in dr eps and br eps however the transmittance rates of br eps were lower than those for dr eps indicating higher quantities of functional groups in br eps this result agreed well with the higher concentration of br eps than dr eps fig 3a the eps in dr granules and br granules had similar compositions but different concentrations the difference in the dr eps and br eps concentrations makes it probable that functional groups such as hydroxyls and carboxylic acids are also present in different concentrations in the two types of granules this leads to the granules having different adherence properties details in section 3 4 3 3 3 secondary structure of extracellular proteins the secondary structure of extracellular proteins is closely related to the hydrophobicity aggregation and adsorption properties of microbes hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 the secondary structures of the extracellular proteins were assessed by analysis of the second derivative spectra and subsequent curve fitting of deconvoluted ftir spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 the amide i band fig 3c and d table s2 shows the relative content of protein secondary structural elements although the eem and ftir spectra showed that the chemical compositions of dr eps and br eps were similar the secondary structures of the extracellular proteins were remarkably different in the two eps samples β sheet was the dominant protein secondary structure element in both dr eps and br eps with percentages 38 9 2 4 and 47 7 3 3 respectively however br eps had a higher content of α helix β sheet and β turn than dr eps and random coil was only found in dr eps 24 6 3 1 the α helix β sheet and random coil value of dr eps was 0 32 0 03 which was lower than that of br eps 0 62 0 12 table s2 p 0 015 a lower α helix β sheet and random coil ratio corresponds to a looser protein structure hou et al 2015 the proteins in dr eps thus had a looser structure that exposed the inner hydrophobic functional groups and thus intensified the interactions between functional groups and promoted aggregation the proteins in br eps had a more compact structure but the quantity of functional groups in br eps was higher which also intensified the interactions between functional groups the quantities of both exposed functional groups number and total functional groups synergistically affected the adherence properties of the microbes details in section 3 4 3 4 adherence properties of two distinct colors of anammox granules 3 4 1 adherence properties of sludge samples to directly analyze the adherence properties of the two distinct colors of anammox granular sludge the novel qcm d technique was employed to investigate microbial adhesion on gold coated sensor chips fig 4 a c anammox consortia were first dispersed and then homogenized by adjusting od600 to 0 1 the anammox consortia from br granules were more viscous than those from dr granules and formed a more rigid and compact adhered layer on the gold coated sensor surface the frequency and dissipation signals during a 1200 s interaction of anammox consortia with the gold coated sensor surface are summarized in fig 4a and b the value of δf reflects the adherence properties of the sludge samples the decrease rate and value of δf positively correlated with the adherence rate and adsorbed mass respectively the greater the decrease rate of δf the greater the adherence rate of the sludge sample the greater the decrease in the absolute value of δf the higher the adsorbed sludge mass gutman et al 2013 sweity et al 2011 when δf reached a plateau the decrease in absolute value of δf of the br granules was 21 8 0 1 hz significantly higher than that for the dr granules 17 8 0 1 hz p 0 001 the br granules had an obviously higher rate of decrease of δf than the dr granules δf of the br granules reached equilibrium after about 200 s of interaction but δf of the dr granules was still decreasing slightly after 900 s of interaction therefore the br granules had a higher adherence rate and adsorbed mass on the goad coated surface than the dr granules the value of δd determines whether the structure of the adhered layer is viscous or elastic fig 4b the ratio δd δf is the slope of the data shown in fig 4c a higher absolute value of the slope indicates higher increased dissipation for the same decrease in frequency which means a more viscous adhered layer a lower absolute value of the slope means a more elastic adhered layer leino et al 2011 the values of δd δf were 0 0278 0 000 and 0 0495 0 0007 respectively for br granules and dr granules indicating that the br granules had formed a more elastic and compact adhered layer on the gold coated surface than the dr granules 3 4 2 adherence properties of eps samples the adherence properties of eps for br granules and dr granules were also investigated and compared fig s2 br eps had a higher decrease rate and value of δf and a higher adherence rate and adsorbed mass than dr eps fig s2a the δd δf slope of br eps was slightly higher than that of dr eps 0 0407 0 0004 and 0 0351 0 0004 respectively indicating that the adhered layers of br eps and dr eps had similar structures fig s2c there is a competition between the adhesion of biomolecules to the sensor chip surface and to the biomolecules in the liquid phase br eps with a more compact protein secondary structure to wrap the higher concentration of inner functional groups than dr eps fig 3c and d adhered more easily on the sensor surface fig s2a and hardly adhered at all to the biomolecules in solution the structures of extracellular proteins had a greater influence than the concentrations of functional groups on the adherence properties accordingly a more compact protein secondary structure in br eps explains the higher adherence rate of br granules compared with dr granules this also explains why so many small br granules adhered to the surfaces of large dr granules and then self assembled into larger granules fig 2a c 3 5 granule intensity in distinct colors of anammox granules the br granules broke easily when touched which might have been caused by their low granule intensity the granule intensity refers to the mechanical strength when considering anammox granule as a material seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2019 rheological tests confirmed that the br granules had a lower intensity than the dr granules fig 4d f 3 5 1 anammox granules as hydrogels the strain γ dependence of the storage modulus g loss modulus g and complex viscosity η of the two distinct colors of anammox granule is presented in fig 4d and e at a low strain γ 3 the values of g g and η were relatively constant not changing with γ indicating that γ 3 was the linear viscoelastic region in the linear viscoelastic region g was approximately ten times higher than g however g exceeded g when γ was greater than the yield point γc approximately 20 values of g greater than g mean that the granules resemble elastic gels while values of g less than g mean that the granules resemble viscous sols seviour et al 2009 these characteristics were analogous to those of hydrogels composed of an extracellular polysaccharide interacting with peptides yamaguchi et al 2005 hydrogels are a kind of gels that can reversibly absorb and exude water or biological fluids and to be a hydrogel means a network of cross linked polymers has been formed seviour et al 2009 therefore understanding granules as hydrogels is important for investigating the formation mechanism of cross linked extracellular polymers which is vital for granule formation seviour et al 2009 immobilization of anammox bacteria in hydrogels is also an effective method to rapidly start up of anammox process ali et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 3 5 2 granule intensity revealed by g and τc the yield stress τc g cγc of granules was determined according to the yield point both g in the linear viscoelastic region and τc reflect the mechanical intensity of the tested material lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 higher values of g and τc mean a stronger material structure as shown in fig 4f the g value of dr granules was 23 1 0 7 kpa which was much higher than that of br granules 10 2 0 6 kpa p 0 001 the τc of dr granules was also significantly higher than that of br granules 932 5 37 7 and 488 6 72 3 pa respectively p 0 001 therefore the dr granules had higher mechanical intensity than the br granules in other words the br granules were prone to breakage with lower deformation energy input than the dr granules the lower granule intensity of the br granules corresponded well with their fluffy structure while the dr granules had higher granule intensity because of their compact structure fig 2a f because dr granules and br granules were cultured together in the same egsb reactor at the same hydraulic shear force the br granules tended to disintegrate because of their much lower yield stress τc leading to their fluffy structure while the dr granules which had a higher τc maintained a compact structure br granules with low intensity tended to be small and dr granules with high intensity tended to be large which explains our observation that the adhered br granules were mostly smaller than dr granules fig 2a c 3 6 microbial composition of distinct colors of anammox granules differences in the relative abundances of anammox bacteria could result in the presence of different amounts of cytochrome c containing proteins which can in turn lead to color differences in their aggregates i e granules to gain insight into the microbial community structure of the two distinct colors of anammox granules high throughput sequencing was conducted as shown in figs 5 and s3 the br granules had a higher relative abundance of total anammox bacteria than the dr granules 81 8 5 3 vs 71 2 4 3 p 0 056 while the dr granules had a higher relative abundance of ca kuenenia 2 9 0 4 vs 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 which are nitrite k strategy bacteria and dominate at low substrate concentration at the phylum level four phyla planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for more than 98 of the total bacterial abundance in the two colors of granules fig s3a anammox related planctomycetes were dominant in both dr granules and br granules with relative abundances of 72 7 3 7 and 82 0 5 2 respectively filamentous chloroflexi formed the backbone of granular sludge and maintain the granular integrity caroline et al 2011 the abundance of chloroflexi in the dr granules was 15 4 1 7 higher than that in the br granules 7 0 0 5 p 0 001 this result is in accordance with the high granule intensity of the dr granules as determined by rheological tests fig 4f the relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were similar in the two colors of granules proteobacteria the phylum to which most aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and some nitrite oxidizing bacteria belong consume oxygen and favor an anoxic environment in the egsb bacteroidetes were found to be highly adaptable and prefer to grow on granular surfaces fernández gómez et al 2013 at the genus level two genera of anammox bacteria unclassified brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia figs 5 and s3b were identified in the two colors of anammox granule unclassified brocadiaceae was the most abundant genus in both dr granules 68 3 4 6 and br granules 81 4 5 4 p 0 033 and ca kuenenia was more abundant in dr granules 2 9 0 4 than in br granules 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 ca kuenenia are relative k strategy bacteria with high affinity for nitrite 0 05 mg n l and become a dominant genus at low substrate concentration azari et al 2017 van der star et al 2008 in the following proposed anammox granule enlargement mechanism the dr granules act as nuclei for the formation of bigger granules and broken br granules release inner dr granules therefore the relatively high abundance of ca kuenenia in dr granules provides strong support for this enlargement mechanism the high eps concentration in the br granules fig 3a blocks the transport of substrate thus limiting the internal substrate availability this subsequently favors the growth of nitrite k strategy ca kuenenia in the inner dr granules while unclassified brocadiaceae r strategy occupied the outer bright red layer of the granules details in section 3 7 note that the relative abundance of total anammox bacteria was 81 8 5 3 in the br granules which was higher than their abundance of 71 2 4 3 in the dr granules p 0 056 qpcr results further confirmed that the absolute abundance of total anammox bacteria in the br granules was 4 0 0 4 1011 copies g vss approximately 57 higher than that in the dr granules 2 6 0 3 1011 copies g vss p 0 009 fig s4 the higher concentration of extracellular dna in br granules than in dr granules 10 4 1 4 vs 20 3 1 9 mg g vss p 0 002 might also be a reason for the higher abundance of anammox bacteria in br granules fig 3a as the presence of extracellular dna is beneficial to biofilm formation vilain et al 2009 whitchurch et al 2002 the higher abundance of total anammox bacteria in the br granules likely means that they contained more cytochrome c containing proteins than in the dr granules which contributed to the brighter red color of the br granules moreover the loose structure and high eps concentration of the br granules made it easier for light to pass through which also contributed to the brighter red color 3 7 proposed anammox granule enlargement mechanism by heterogenous granule self assembly in this study two heterogenous colors anammox granules were observed for the first time fig 6 a these granules were not isolated but instead self assembled into new granules based on visual observation and analysis of the different properties of heterogenous granules a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism by heterogenous granule self assembly is proposed fig 6 specifically at the same hydraulic shear force in the same reactor the dr granules with high granule intensity were bigger and the br granules with low granule intensity tended to be smaller fig 6b and c the smaller br granules had a higher eps concentration more compact protein secondary structure and higher adherence rate to the surface of the bigger dr granules figs 3a and 4a c the initial adhesion of two anammox granules could also be the adhesion of one granule to an inert site on the surface of the other granule similar to that happened in the inert nuclei model for anaerobic granulation lettinga et al 1980 ni et al 2010 the surfaces of the dr granules have many adhesion sites like the abiotic gold coated sensor surface such as calcium and magnesium deposits to which the smaller br granules adhere fig s5 through frequent collision and information exchange a large number of br granules tightly adhere to the surface of a bigger dr granule figs 2a c 6b and c and then grow along the dr granule surface forming larger new granules that appear bright red fig 6d however as these granules grow their substrate diffusion resistance increases leading to lower substrate availability in the granular core such a starvation scenario stimulates anammox bacteria to secrete more eps which further prevents substrate from spreading inward thus favoring the growth of nitrite k strategy ca kuenenia in the inner dark red part of the granule figs 5 and s3b the higher eps concentration in br granules causes their lower intensity fig 4f the self assembled anammox granules with low intensity easily disintegrate under the shear force in the water figs 2d f and 6e releasing their inner dark red cores of larger anammox granules and the outer bright red layer reforms as smaller br granules it should be noted that the anammox granular size is not the larger the better from the perspective of anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate zhu et al 2018 anammox granules need inert adherence sites to adhere two anammox granules according to our proposed enlargement mechanism so we can manipulate anammox granular size by controlling influent concentration of calcium magnesium ion to achieve higher nitrogen removal performance the influent calcium and magnesium concentrations should be flexibly adjusted according to the granular structure and reactor nitrogen removal performance from a cost saving point of view one feasible solution for controlling influent calcium magnesium concentration is adding wastewater containing high calcium magnesium concentration e g oily saline wastewater when it is low or diluting with a low calcium magnesium concentration wastewater when it is high in addition to self assembling granules with different colors it is likely that anammox granules can grow by the self assembly of other heterogenous granules including granules with different sizes and shapes however because of the hydraulic shear force in the bioreactor only tightly adhered self assembling granules can maintain their structure the granules observed in this study which have a large core granule surrounded by many small granules are one example of such a structure further this heterogenous granule self assembly enlargement mechanism might also apply to other kinds of sludge granules but this needs further verification 4 conclusions in this work anammox granules cultured in an egsb reactor were found with two different colors more importantly these two different colors of anammox granules were self assembled into granules with a large dr granule as an inner core and many smaller br granules as a surface layer increasing the overall granular size the biological mechanism for the enlargement of anammox granules was elucidated by analyzing the eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions of the two colors of anammox granules to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the color heterogeneity of anammox granules in the same reactor and the self assembly of these heterogenous anammox granules into large granules understanding this self assembling growth mechanism improves our knowledge of granulation processes and provides a theoretical basis for applications involving granular sludge the obtained results lead to the main outcomes as follows anammox granules were grouped into two different colors dr granules and br granules dr granules could act as nuclei for small br granules adhering and forming larger granules that appear bright red the tested higher eps concentration 263 8 12 6 vs 137 2 13 1 mg g vss p 0 0002 and adherence rate more compact protein secondary structure and lower intensity yield stress 488 6 72 3 vs 932 5 37 7 pa p 0 001 of br granules than dr granules could well explain why so many small br granules adhered to the surfaces of large dr granules and then self assembled into larger granules the relative and absolute abundances of anammox bacteria in br granules were 81 8 5 3 and 4 0 0 4 1011 copies g vss respectively both respectively higher than those in dr granules of 71 2 4 3 and 2 6 0 3 1011 copies g vss p 0 056 and 0 009 respectively the high abundance of anammox bacteria in br granules might cause their brighter red color than dr granules a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism was proposed by heterogenous anammox granules self assembly based on observations and physiochemical characteristics analysis declaration

17501,expansion in the size is an indispensable stage in the granular sludge life cycle but little attention has been payed to the enlargement mechanism of granular sludge here we propose a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism by the self assembly of heterogenous granules two different colors of anammox granules dark red granules dr granules and bright red granules br granules were found in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor these two heterogenous granules were not isolated but were assembled into granules with a larger dr granule in the center and many smaller br granules aggregated on the surface increasing the overall granular size their physiochemical characteristics in terms of eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions were identified and compared to elucidate the interaction between the different colors of granules the br granules created 92 more extracellular polymeric substances than the dr granules this material blocked the passage of gas and substrate leading to br granules smaller size and a yield stress approximately 48 lower than that of the dr granules nevertheless the br granules had compact extracellular protein secondary structures and a high adherence rate to the surface of the dr granules upon which they formed a compact adhered layer these unique features enabled them to directionally adhere to dr granules in the core that is two heterogenous colors of granules self assembled into large anammox granules the enlargement mechanism was further supported by the abundance of k strategy ca kuenenia in the dr granules inner layer being higher than in the br granules outer layer 2 9 0 4 vs 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 and by visualized confirmation that the larger br granules wrapped around smaller dr granules inside this demonstrates that heterogenous anammox granules actively self assemble into large granules which is an important step in the lifecycle of anammox granules graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox color enlargement mechanism granular sludge granulation heterogeneity 1 introduction sludge granules are compact and dense aggregates diameter larger than 200 μm and formed through self immobilization of microorganisms barr et al 2010 liu et al 2009 granular sludge technology has several advantages over dispersed sludge technology for sustainable wastewater treatment these include excellent settleability high biomass concentration small footprint great capacity to withstand high loadings and high nutrient removal efficiency lemaire et al 2008 liu et al 2009 wilén et al 2018 zhang and okabe 2020 granular reactor is a promising and important form of high rate reactor and the various types of sludge granules used in wastewater treatment systems can be broadly divided into three categories aerobic granules liu et al 2010 anaerobic granules sudmalis et al 2018 and photogranules abouhend et al 2020 trebuch et al 2020 since it was first developed more than 40 years ago lettinga et al 1980 granular sludge technology has been widely studied in terms of process stability manavi et al 2017 wang et al 2017 microbial community distribution vázquez padín et al 2010 and granulation mechanisms barr et al 2010 granule formation mechanisms have been proposed for aerobic and anaerobic granules that function in the removal of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus studies on the formation of aerobic granules are at the forefront of this field barr et al 2010 liu and tay 2004 sarma et al 2017 although the properties of granules vary depending on the different operational conditions or bioreactors in which they are formed their formation mechanisms may be similar and involve several steps for example the four steps in aerobic granule formation have been described as 1 initial bacterium to bacterium adhesion 2 microaggregate formation 3 synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps and 4 maturation liu and tay 2004 two other granulation mechanisms for aerobic granules have been suggested microaggregate outgrowth and microaggregates aggregation barr et al 2010 although great efforts have been made to investigate granulation mechanisms no consensus has as yet been achieved and the exact formation mechanism is still a mystery specifically the process of granular size evolution is rarely mentioned or simply referred to as granule formation even though it is an important part of the granule life cycle granular sludge is a compact broadly spherical aggregate with different diameters 0 2 25 mm barr et al 2010 zhu et al 2018 and there are no two identical granules inside a reactor in terms of size color shape etc the heterogeneity among granules is very useful for investigation of some properties of granules for example in an aerobic granule system treating saline wastewater granules were grouped into two groups light brown granules and black granules that looked fluffy taheri et al 2012 the black fluffy granules which were resistant to salt were thought to be a variation of the light brown granules color segregation of aerobic granules was also reported in other systems and it was deemed to be a common phenomenon barr et al 2010 wu et al 2018 anammox granules are anaerobic granules for autotrophic nitrogen removal which are dominated by anammox bacteria that are capable of oxidizing ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as electron acceptors anammox granules have been extensively studied since their discovery over 20 years ago because of their numerous economic advantages e g no need for the addition of external organic carbon and low operational cost lin and wang 2017 tang et al 2011 van de graaf et al 1995 although there have been some studies on their superior aggregation properties hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020a 2020b the formation mechanisms of anammox granules especially the enlargement mechanisms are still poorly understood like in other granule systems the heterogeneity among granules also exists in anammox granule systems for example color difference among three different reactors was observed and determined to be due to cytochrome c and fe s compounds kang et al 2018 moreover tests of the size differences between anammox granules in the same reactor showed that ca brocadia and ca kuenenia preferred to grow in large granules 0 4 mm whereas ca jettenia dominated in small and moderate sized sludge 0 4 mm liu et al 2017 anammox granules of 0 5 0 9 mm were selected as optimal in low strength ammonium wastewater treatment for a high nitrogen removal rate zhu et al 2018 although there have been some studies on the differences among anammox granules relevant to nitrogen removal performance in the same or different reactors kang et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 heterogeneity among anammox granules in the same reactor needs further investigation to elucidate how they interact and aggregate structurally the control mechanism for anammox granule evolution and the key parameters impacting granule evolution understanding the mechanisms of anammox granular size evolution is the key to develop effective control strategies maintaining robust autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater in the expanded granular sludge bed reactor egsb used in this study two colors of heterogenous anammox granules were found dark red granules dr granules and bright red granules br granules these two types of heterogenous granules did not exist in isolation but were rather assembled in structures characterized by a larger dr granule in the center with many smaller br granules aggregated on the surface to understand the formation of these special anammox granules the differences in eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions between the two heterogenous colors of anammox granules were analyzed and compared finally a heterogenous anammox granule self assembly mechanism was proposed to explain the enlargement of these anammox granules to the best of our knowledge the color segregation of anammox granules in the same reactor and the self assembly of heterogenous anammox granules to enlarge granular size have not been reported previously understanding anammox granule heterogeneity and the self assembly mechanism by which the granular size increases will augment existing knowledge of granular size evolution aid in understanding of the granulation process and provide theoretical and engineering bases for the practical application of anammox granular techniques 2 materials and

from the reactor were first sieved using a 0 35 mm sieve and then washed three times with phosphate buffered saline pbs the collected granules were then artificially divided into two colors dr granules and br granules based on visual analysis fig 1 2 2 eps extraction and characterization the concentration and chemical composition of eps play an important role in sludge aggregation in this

using 97 identity thresholds 2 6 other analytical procedures the morphology and surface structure of anammox granules were examined with an szx16 stereoscopic microscope olympus japan and an s4800 scanning electron microscope hitachi japan respectively suspended solids and volatile suspended solids vss were measured using the standard methods apha 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of heterogenous anammox granules in the egsb reactor studied two colors of heterogenous anammox granules dr granules and br granules were found in high concentrations fig 1 numerous special anammox granules were also observed in which many smaller br granules adhered to the surface of a bigger dr granule that formed a core this combination displayed a cauliflower like surface fig 2 a c and 2g i therefore the two different colors of anammox granules were not present in isolation but assembled in granules in which the dr granule acted as a nucleus to which the small br granules adhered in other words anammox granules became larger by the automatic arrangement of a dr granule on the inside and many br granules on the outer layer through collision information exchange and adherence furthermore some large br granules were observed which broke easily when touched and contained small dr core inside fig 2d f we deemed that the inner core are dr granules rather than inert particulates the ash content of br granules was 14 6 1 9 table 1 but the volume of the dark core of br granules seemed to be approximately 30 of the total granule volume as shown in fig 2e and f accordingly if the dark core of the br granules is inert particulate the ash content of the br granules should be over 30 because the density of the ash content is much greater than the microbes we also speculate that the inherent features of the two distinct colors of anammox granules determined this aggregation pattern therefore the physical characteristics eps contents adherence and intensity properties and microbial compositions of the two heterogenous granules were analyzed which are related to granule formation or the color segregation 3 2 physical characteristics of two distinct colors of anammox granules table 1 presents the physical characteristics of the two colors of anammox granules most of the dr granules had a compact structure with a lower ash content 12 9 4 1 while most of the br granules had a fluffy structure and a higher ash content 14 6 1 9 p 0 46 the dr granules had a specific gravity and settling velocity of 1 13 0 15 and 2 23 0 14 cm s respectively compared with the dr granules the br granules had a higher specific gravity and settling velocity 1 29 0 22 and 2 27 0 13 cm s respectively p 0 49 and 0 38 respectively consistent with their higher ash contents table 1 the differences in specific gravity could lead to the stratification of two colors of heterogenous anammox granules in the up flow egsb reactor br granules with high specific gravity could be in the bottom of the egsb which would obtain more substrate the influent enters the egsb from the bottom and flows upwards and further lead to higher abundance of anammox bacteria than that of dr granules details in section 3 6 while the average granular size was not measured visual inspection of br granules and dr granules over a long period of time suggests that br granules are generally larger in size than dr granules which could support the enlargement assumption 3 3 characterization of eps in distinct colors of anammox granules eps is a general term for a class of biomacromolecules released by bacteria sheng et al 2010 and their properties are closely related to granule structure maintenance and aggregation jia et al 2017 yin et al 2015 accordingly the differences in eps composition and protein secondary structure in the two distinct colors of anammox granule were determined and compared 3 3 1 chemical composition of the anammox granular eps fig 3 a shows that the concentration of total eps and of each component proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna in the bright red anammox granular eps br eps was almost twice that of the dark red anammox granular eps dr eps in dr eps the concentrations of proteins polysaccharides humic acids and dna were 72 8 12 8 30 7 1 7 23 3 9 0 and 10 4 1 4 mg g vss respectively while those in br eps were 129 8 15 1 74 1 14 0 53 7 5 0 and 20 3 1 9 mg g vss respectively fig 3a thus the total eps concentration was 92 higher in br eps than in dr eps 263 8 12 6 vs 137 2 13 1 mg g vss p 0 0002 the toc content in br eps was 138 2 8 8 mg g vss approximately 83 higher than that in dr eps 75 6 4 7 mg g vss p 0 0004 an eps concentration in excess of 200 mg g vss is known to cause the occlusion of granule porosity corsino et al 2016 truong et al 2018 the high eps concentration in the br granules likely obstructs their gas tunnels leading to the accumulation of gas n2 inside the granules and their eventual breakage fig 2d f substrates would also be blocked by the high level of eps causing the starvation of internal microbes therefore the higher dna concentration in br eps than in dr eps may be attributed to greater starvation in the br granules the extracellular protein polysaccharide ratio strongly influences the granule properties and a higher protein polysaccharide ratio generally results in poorer settling performance tang et al 2011 and a less negatively charged surface zhang et al 2007 the protein polysaccharide ratio in dr eps was indeed found to be higher than that in br eps 2 47 0 21 vs 1 83 0 03 p 0 006 which corresponded well with the lower settling velocity table 1 and more compact structure of dr granules compared with br granules fig 1b the different eps concentrations between the dr granules and br granules may cause other differences in the granules adherence properties and the intensities this is discussed in detail in sections 3 4 and 3 5 3 3 2 eem and ftir spectra of the anammox granular eps eem and ftir spectroscopy are sensitive methods to identify the fluorescent components and functional groups in eps eem spectra of dr eps and br eps are summarized in fig s1 and table s1 and no obvious difference was observed in the fluorescent contents between dr eps and br eps the peak at excitation ex emission em wavelengths of 275 300 nm was related to tyrosine and protein like substances while the peak at ex em of 275 280 340 350 nm was ascribed to tryptophan and protein like substances chen et al 2003 both peaks were found in both eps samples and the fluorescence intensity of each peak in the two eps samples was almost the same table s1 ftir spectra of dr eps and br eps are shown in fig 3b the bands were attributed to characteristic bands of proteins c o and c c stretching 1643 1637 cm 1 amide iii deformation vibration of c o 1268 1253 cm 1 hou et al 2015 lotti et al 2019 wu et al 2019 polysaccharides c oh stretching 1080 1079 cm 1 wu et al 2019 carbohydrates and lipids c h stretching 2963 2962 cm 1 lotti et al 2019 carboxylic acids symmetric stretching of c o 1407 1402 cm 1 hou et al 2015 and hydroxyl groups stretching vibrations of o h 3428 3420 cm 1 wu et al 2019 the position and number of characteristic bands were similar between the samples suggesting the presence of similar functional groups in dr eps and br eps however the transmittance rates of br eps were lower than those for dr eps indicating higher quantities of functional groups in br eps this result agreed well with the higher concentration of br eps than dr eps fig 3a the eps in dr granules and br granules had similar compositions but different concentrations the difference in the dr eps and br eps concentrations makes it probable that functional groups such as hydroxyls and carboxylic acids are also present in different concentrations in the two types of granules this leads to the granules having different adherence properties details in section 3 4 3 3 3 secondary structure of extracellular proteins the secondary structure of extracellular proteins is closely related to the hydrophobicity aggregation and adsorption properties of microbes hou et al 2015 yin et al 2015 the secondary structures of the extracellular proteins were assessed by analysis of the second derivative spectra and subsequent curve fitting of deconvoluted ftir spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 the amide i band fig 3c and d table s2 shows the relative content of protein secondary structural elements although the eem and ftir spectra showed that the chemical compositions of dr eps and br eps were similar the secondary structures of the extracellular proteins were remarkably different in the two eps samples β sheet was the dominant protein secondary structure element in both dr eps and br eps with percentages 38 9 2 4 and 47 7 3 3 respectively however br eps had a higher content of α helix β sheet and β turn than dr eps and random coil was only found in dr eps 24 6 3 1 the α helix β sheet and random coil value of dr eps was 0 32 0 03 which was lower than that of br eps 0 62 0 12 table s2 p 0 015 a lower α helix β sheet and random coil ratio corresponds to a looser protein structure hou et al 2015 the proteins in dr eps thus had a looser structure that exposed the inner hydrophobic functional groups and thus intensified the interactions between functional groups and promoted aggregation the proteins in br eps had a more compact structure but the quantity of functional groups in br eps was higher which also intensified the interactions between functional groups the quantities of both exposed functional groups number and total functional groups synergistically affected the adherence properties of the microbes details in section 3 4 3 4 adherence properties of two distinct colors of anammox granules 3 4 1 adherence properties of sludge samples to directly analyze the adherence properties of the two distinct colors of anammox granular sludge the novel qcm d technique was employed to investigate microbial adhesion on gold coated sensor chips fig 4 a c anammox consortia were first dispersed and then homogenized by adjusting od600 to 0 1 the anammox consortia from br granules were more viscous than those from dr granules and formed a more rigid and compact adhered layer on the gold coated sensor surface the frequency and dissipation signals during a 1200 s interaction of anammox consortia with the gold coated sensor surface are summarized in fig 4a and b the value of δf reflects the adherence properties of the sludge samples the decrease rate and value of δf positively correlated with the adherence rate and adsorbed mass respectively the greater the decrease rate of δf the greater the adherence rate of the sludge sample the greater the decrease in the absolute value of δf the higher the adsorbed sludge mass gutman et al 2013 sweity et al 2011 when δf reached a plateau the decrease in absolute value of δf of the br granules was 21 8 0 1 hz significantly higher than that for the dr granules 17 8 0 1 hz p 0 001 the br granules had an obviously higher rate of decrease of δf than the dr granules δf of the br granules reached equilibrium after about 200 s of interaction but δf of the dr granules was still decreasing slightly after 900 s of interaction therefore the br granules had a higher adherence rate and adsorbed mass on the goad coated surface than the dr granules the value of δd determines whether the structure of the adhered layer is viscous or elastic fig 4b the ratio δd δf is the slope of the data shown in fig 4c a higher absolute value of the slope indicates higher increased dissipation for the same decrease in frequency which means a more viscous adhered layer a lower absolute value of the slope means a more elastic adhered layer leino et al 2011 the values of δd δf were 0 0278 0 000 and 0 0495 0 0007 respectively for br granules and dr granules indicating that the br granules had formed a more elastic and compact adhered layer on the gold coated surface than the dr granules 3 4 2 adherence properties of eps samples the adherence properties of eps for br granules and dr granules were also investigated and compared fig s2 br eps had a higher decrease rate and value of δf and a higher adherence rate and adsorbed mass than dr eps fig s2a the δd δf slope of br eps was slightly higher than that of dr eps 0 0407 0 0004 and 0 0351 0 0004 respectively indicating that the adhered layers of br eps and dr eps had similar structures fig s2c there is a competition between the adhesion of biomolecules to the sensor chip surface and to the biomolecules in the liquid phase br eps with a more compact protein secondary structure to wrap the higher concentration of inner functional groups than dr eps fig 3c and d adhered more easily on the sensor surface fig s2a and hardly adhered at all to the biomolecules in solution the structures of extracellular proteins had a greater influence than the concentrations of functional groups on the adherence properties accordingly a more compact protein secondary structure in br eps explains the higher adherence rate of br granules compared with dr granules this also explains why so many small br granules adhered to the surfaces of large dr granules and then self assembled into larger granules fig 2a c 3 5 granule intensity in distinct colors of anammox granules the br granules broke easily when touched which might have been caused by their low granule intensity the granule intensity refers to the mechanical strength when considering anammox granule as a material seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2019 rheological tests confirmed that the br granules had a lower intensity than the dr granules fig 4d f 3 5 1 anammox granules as hydrogels the strain γ dependence of the storage modulus g loss modulus g and complex viscosity η of the two distinct colors of anammox granule is presented in fig 4d and e at a low strain γ 3 the values of g g and η were relatively constant not changing with γ indicating that γ 3 was the linear viscoelastic region in the linear viscoelastic region g was approximately ten times higher than g however g exceeded g when γ was greater than the yield point γc approximately 20 values of g greater than g mean that the granules resemble elastic gels while values of g less than g mean that the granules resemble viscous sols seviour et al 2009 these characteristics were analogous to those of hydrogels composed of an extracellular polysaccharide interacting with peptides yamaguchi et al 2005 hydrogels are a kind of gels that can reversibly absorb and exude water or biological fluids and to be a hydrogel means a network of cross linked polymers has been formed seviour et al 2009 therefore understanding granules as hydrogels is important for investigating the formation mechanism of cross linked extracellular polymers which is vital for granule formation seviour et al 2009 immobilization of anammox bacteria in hydrogels is also an effective method to rapidly start up of anammox process ali et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 3 5 2 granule intensity revealed by g and τc the yield stress τc g cγc of granules was determined according to the yield point both g in the linear viscoelastic region and τc reflect the mechanical intensity of the tested material lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 higher values of g and τc mean a stronger material structure as shown in fig 4f the g value of dr granules was 23 1 0 7 kpa which was much higher than that of br granules 10 2 0 6 kpa p 0 001 the τc of dr granules was also significantly higher than that of br granules 932 5 37 7 and 488 6 72 3 pa respectively p 0 001 therefore the dr granules had higher mechanical intensity than the br granules in other words the br granules were prone to breakage with lower deformation energy input than the dr granules the lower granule intensity of the br granules corresponded well with their fluffy structure while the dr granules had higher granule intensity because of their compact structure fig 2a f because dr granules and br granules were cultured together in the same egsb reactor at the same hydraulic shear force the br granules tended to disintegrate because of their much lower yield stress τc leading to their fluffy structure while the dr granules which had a higher τc maintained a compact structure br granules with low intensity tended to be small and dr granules with high intensity tended to be large which explains our observation that the adhered br granules were mostly smaller than dr granules fig 2a c 3 6 microbial composition of distinct colors of anammox granules differences in the relative abundances of anammox bacteria could result in the presence of different amounts of cytochrome c containing proteins which can in turn lead to color differences in their aggregates i e granules to gain insight into the microbial community structure of the two distinct colors of anammox granules high throughput sequencing was conducted as shown in figs 5 and s3 the br granules had a higher relative abundance of total anammox bacteria than the dr granules 81 8 5 3 vs 71 2 4 3 p 0 056 while the dr granules had a higher relative abundance of ca kuenenia 2 9 0 4 vs 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 which are nitrite k strategy bacteria and dominate at low substrate concentration at the phylum level four phyla planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes accounted for more than 98 of the total bacterial abundance in the two colors of granules fig s3a anammox related planctomycetes were dominant in both dr granules and br granules with relative abundances of 72 7 3 7 and 82 0 5 2 respectively filamentous chloroflexi formed the backbone of granular sludge and maintain the granular integrity caroline et al 2011 the abundance of chloroflexi in the dr granules was 15 4 1 7 higher than that in the br granules 7 0 0 5 p 0 001 this result is in accordance with the high granule intensity of the dr granules as determined by rheological tests fig 4f the relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were similar in the two colors of granules proteobacteria the phylum to which most aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and some nitrite oxidizing bacteria belong consume oxygen and favor an anoxic environment in the egsb bacteroidetes were found to be highly adaptable and prefer to grow on granular surfaces fernández gómez et al 2013 at the genus level two genera of anammox bacteria unclassified brocadiaceae and ca kuenenia figs 5 and s3b were identified in the two colors of anammox granule unclassified brocadiaceae was the most abundant genus in both dr granules 68 3 4 6 and br granules 81 4 5 4 p 0 033 and ca kuenenia was more abundant in dr granules 2 9 0 4 than in br granules 0 4 0 1 p 0 0003 ca kuenenia are relative k strategy bacteria with high affinity for nitrite 0 05 mg n l and become a dominant genus at low substrate concentration azari et al 2017 van der star et al 2008 in the following proposed anammox granule enlargement mechanism the dr granules act as nuclei for the formation of bigger granules and broken br granules release inner dr granules therefore the relatively high abundance of ca kuenenia in dr granules provides strong support for this enlargement mechanism the high eps concentration in the br granules fig 3a blocks the transport of substrate thus limiting the internal substrate availability this subsequently favors the growth of nitrite k strategy ca kuenenia in the inner dr granules while unclassified brocadiaceae r strategy occupied the outer bright red layer of the granules details in section 3 7 note that the relative abundance of total anammox bacteria was 81 8 5 3 in the br granules which was higher than their abundance of 71 2 4 3 in the dr granules p 0 056 qpcr results further confirmed that the absolute abundance of total anammox bacteria in the br granules was 4 0 0 4 1011 copies g vss approximately 57 higher than that in the dr granules 2 6 0 3 1011 copies g vss p 0 009 fig s4 the higher concentration of extracellular dna in br granules than in dr granules 10 4 1 4 vs 20 3 1 9 mg g vss p 0 002 might also be a reason for the higher abundance of anammox bacteria in br granules fig 3a as the presence of extracellular dna is beneficial to biofilm formation vilain et al 2009 whitchurch et al 2002 the higher abundance of total anammox bacteria in the br granules likely means that they contained more cytochrome c containing proteins than in the dr granules which contributed to the brighter red color of the br granules moreover the loose structure and high eps concentration of the br granules made it easier for light to pass through which also contributed to the brighter red color 3 7 proposed anammox granule enlargement mechanism by heterogenous granule self assembly in this study two heterogenous colors anammox granules were observed for the first time fig 6 a these granules were not isolated but instead self assembled into new granules based on visual observation and analysis of the different properties of heterogenous granules a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism by heterogenous granule self assembly is proposed fig 6 specifically at the same hydraulic shear force in the same reactor the dr granules with high granule intensity were bigger and the br granules with low granule intensity tended to be smaller fig 6b and c the smaller br granules had a higher eps concentration more compact protein secondary structure and higher adherence rate to the surface of the bigger dr granules figs 3a and 4a c the initial adhesion of two anammox granules could also be the adhesion of one granule to an inert site on the surface of the other granule similar to that happened in the inert nuclei model for anaerobic granulation lettinga et al 1980 ni et al 2010 the surfaces of the dr granules have many adhesion sites like the abiotic gold coated sensor surface such as calcium and magnesium deposits to which the smaller br granules adhere fig s5 through frequent collision and information exchange a large number of br granules tightly adhere to the surface of a bigger dr granule figs 2a c 6b and c and then grow along the dr granule surface forming larger new granules that appear bright red fig 6d however as these granules grow their substrate diffusion resistance increases leading to lower substrate availability in the granular core such a starvation scenario stimulates anammox bacteria to secrete more eps which further prevents substrate from spreading inward thus favoring the growth of nitrite k strategy ca kuenenia in the inner dark red part of the granule figs 5 and s3b the higher eps concentration in br granules causes their lower intensity fig 4f the self assembled anammox granules with low intensity easily disintegrate under the shear force in the water figs 2d f and 6e releasing their inner dark red cores of larger anammox granules and the outer bright red layer reforms as smaller br granules it should be noted that the anammox granular size is not the larger the better from the perspective of anammox bacterial abundance activity and specific anammox rate zhu et al 2018 anammox granules need inert adherence sites to adhere two anammox granules according to our proposed enlargement mechanism so we can manipulate anammox granular size by controlling influent concentration of calcium magnesium ion to achieve higher nitrogen removal performance the influent calcium and magnesium concentrations should be flexibly adjusted according to the granular structure and reactor nitrogen removal performance from a cost saving point of view one feasible solution for controlling influent calcium magnesium concentration is adding wastewater containing high calcium magnesium concentration e g oily saline wastewater when it is low or diluting with a low calcium magnesium concentration wastewater when it is high in addition to self assembling granules with different colors it is likely that anammox granules can grow by the self assembly of other heterogenous granules including granules with different sizes and shapes however because of the hydraulic shear force in the bioreactor only tightly adhered self assembling granules can maintain their structure the granules observed in this study which have a large core granule surrounded by many small granules are one example of such a structure further this heterogenous granule self assembly enlargement mechanism might also apply to other kinds of sludge granules but this needs further verification 4 conclusions in this work anammox granules cultured in an egsb reactor were found with two different colors more importantly these two different colors of anammox granules were self assembled into granules with a large dr granule as an inner core and many smaller br granules as a surface layer increasing the overall granular size the biological mechanism for the enlargement of anammox granules was elucidated by analyzing the eps adherence rheological properties and microbial compositions of the two colors of anammox granules to the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the color heterogeneity of anammox granules in the same reactor and the self assembly of these heterogenous anammox granules into large granules understanding this self assembling growth mechanism improves our knowledge of granulation processes and provides a theoretical basis for applications involving granular sludge the obtained results lead to the main outcomes as follows anammox granules were grouped into two different colors dr granules and br granules dr granules could act as nuclei for small br granules adhering and forming larger granules that appear bright red the tested higher eps concentration 263 8 12 6 vs 137 2 13 1 mg g vss p 0 0002 and adherence rate more compact protein secondary structure and lower intensity yield stress 488 6 72 3 vs 932 5 37 7 pa p 0 001 of br granules than dr granules could well explain why so many small br granules adhered to the surfaces of large dr granules and then self assembled into larger granules the relative and absolute abundances of anammox bacteria in br granules were 81 8 5 3 and 4 0 0 4 1011 copies g vss respectively both respectively higher than those in dr granules of 71 2 4 3 and 2 6 0 3 1011 copies g vss p 0 056 and 0 009 respectively the high abundance of anammox bacteria in br granules might cause their brighter red color than dr granules a novel anammox granule enlargement mechanism was proposed by heterogenous anammox granules self assembly based on observations and physiochemical characteristics analysis declaration

17502,pyridine a highly toxic nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound is recalcitrant in the conventional biodegradation process in this study bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface was developed for enhanced visible light driven biodegradation of pyridine where the efficiencies of pyridine removal 100 total organic carbon toc removal 88 06 3 76 and nh4 n formation 84 51 8 95 were remarkably improved compared to the biodegradation system and photodegradation system the electron transport system activity and photoelectrochemical analysis implied the significant improvement of photogenerated carriers transfer between microbes and semiconductors high throughput sequencing analysis suggested functional species related to pyridine biodegradation shewanella bacillus and lysinibacillus and electron transfer shewanella and tissierella were enriched at the semiconductor microbe interface the light excited holes played a crucial role in promoting pyridine mineralization this study demonstrated that this bio photodegradation system would be a potential alternative for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutant such as pyridine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyridine semiconductor microbe interface photoelectron transfer photohole electron acceptor 1 introduction various nitrogen heterocyclic compounds nhcs often pose a severe threat to the environment once the wastewater containing nhcs is discharged into the water environment it will cause dangerous environmental pollution mathur et al 2008 as a typical representative of nhcs pyridine is widely used as solvent and intermediate in pharmaceuticals insecticides paints dyes explosives and petrochemicals huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zong et al 2018 pyridine which has adverse effects on human health and environmental quality due to its toxicity and teratogenicity mudliar et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 has been listed as a priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency sun et al 2011 liang et al 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and economical treatment method to remove pyridine from wastewater biological treatment as the most common and widespread technique used in wastewater treatment is often the most economical alternative when compared with other physical and chemical processes it has been proven that pyridine could be biodegraded under aerobic conditions with their metabolic pathways revealed bai et al 2009 qiao et al 2010 liu et al 2015 for the most part aerobic biodegradation involves mono oxygenation reactions in which molecular oxygen is served as the electron acceptor padoley et al 2006 unfortunately conventional aerobic treatment would not only increase energy consumption due to a high aeration rate but also cause disgusting odors due to the volatility of pyridine hou et al 2018 as an attractive alternative for aerobic treatment anoxic biodegradation is considered to be a practical and inexpensive technique for recalcitrant contaminant removal lu et al 2012a some recalcitrant contaminants such as sulphonamides bílková et al 2019 btex carvajal et al 2018 and n methylpyrrolidone wang et al 2019 were found to be biodegradable under denitrifying conditions organic carbon tends to be oxidized preferentially at the presence of electron acceptor through which most energy required could be supplied to microorganisms our previous studies indicated that enhanced pyridine biodegradation could be achieved in the anoxic biodegradation systems supplemented with nitrate shen et al 2015 hou et al 2018 recently it has been proven that the solid electrode could act as a continuous electron sink for recalcitrant contaminants oxidation chen et al 2019 in our recent study with the increase of applied current to 0 3 ma the anode potential increased to around 150 mv resulting in enhanced pyridine removal jiang et al 2018 however the biofilm on the anode might be destroyed when a higher current was applied in the anaerobic system in order to further increase the capacity of the anode to accept electrons in addition it was reported that the initial mono oxygenation reaction during pyridine biodegradation required readily biodegradable electron donors to yield intracellular electron carriers nadh or e which could accelerate the initial reactions for pyridine biodegradation xu et al 2017 our previous work also documented that an appropriate amount of extra electron donors would promote pyridine removal when using anode as the electron acceptor jiang et al 2018 considering the fact that some semiconductor materials can produce sustainable photogenerated holes or electrons under illumination to catalyze a series of oxidation reduction reactions it is feasible for semiconductor materials to act as electron acceptors donors to accelerate electron transfer from to microbes ding et al 2018 dong et al 2016 therefore integrating light absorbing semiconductors with microorganisms would offer an avenue to create semiconductor microbe interfaces that elegantly maximize the transduction of solar energy for chemical conversion and contaminant degradation particularly the light excited semiconductors could drive the microbial reduction of various recalcitrant pollutants such as methyl orange huang et al 2019 β apo oxytetracycline ding et al 2018 and rhodamine b xiao et al 2019 throughout the microbial extracellular respiratory electron transfer chain moreover li et al 2014 discovered that dissimilatory metal reducing microorganisms were able to pump electrons from organic carbon oxidation to light excited semiconductors which enabled electrons transport from the intracellular electron pool to the outer membrane coupling semiconductors and microbial extracellular electron transfer processes provide prospects to fulfill specialized environmental remediation applications dong et al 2020 it was envisaged that the biodegradation and mineralization efficiency of recalcitrant contaminants could be strengthened by using semiconductor materials as the electron acceptors as well as electron donors yu et al 2020 however the feasibility of enhancing pyridine biodegradation by light excited semiconductor materials has not been well documented the interaction among light excited semiconductors microorganisms and contaminants at the semiconductor microbe interfaces have not been clarified considering that most microbes cannot survive under the irradiation of uv light the semiconductor material used in the semiconductor microbe interface must have the characteristics of the visible light response due to the excellent degradability performance under visible light irradiation and high biocompatibility bivo4 feooh nanocomposites were synthesized and used as the semiconductor in the biohybrid system the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the semiconductor microbe interface to enhance the degradation of pyridine comparative studies were carried out among the biohybrid system and other control experiments and the effects of various key factors on the reactor performance were discussed based on the reactive species trapping experiments and high throughput sequencing analysis the possible mechanism for enhanced pyridine degradation at the semiconductor microbe interface was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials carbon paper cp was purchased from toray co japan before use the carbon paper was cleaned sonicated and then dried to

electrochemical studies then 1 ml vo acac 2 dmso solution was spread onto bioi cp and annealed at 450 c for two hours at heating rate of 2 c min 1 bivo4 cp was obtained after treating with 10 m naoh for 30 mins to remove the excess v2o5 in order to obtain bivo4 feooh cp the as prepared bivo4 cp was further immersed in 5 mm fecl3 6h2o solution for 12 h before washing by deionized water for three times 2 3 set up of bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface in order to verify the feasibility of the light driven pyridine biodegradation five quartz reactors 4 5 4 5 7 5 cm 150 ml was operated in parallel at 35 2 c in a greenhouse the reactor operated with blank cp under light but without semiconductor and biomass was named after rcon the reactor operated with biomass and blank cp under light but without semiconductor was named after rbio the reactor operated with bivo4 feooh cp semiconductor under light but without biomass was named after rpho the reactor operated with bivo4 feooh cp semiconductor and biomass but in dark was named after rpho bio dark the reactor operated with bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface under light conditions was named after rpho bio during operation led lamps qpdp 1 langlang china were installed outside the quartz reactors to provide light for rcon rbio rpho and rpho bio the light intensity was measured and adjusted to be 5 10 and 15 mw cm 2 respectively by using a light density meter 1919 r newport usa bivo4 feooh cp or blank cp was vertically fixed in the reactors the composition of synthetic wastewater was as follows phosphate buffer 7 mm ph 7 0 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 0 05 g l 1 pyridine at desired concentration and trace element solution 1 ml l 1 jiang et al 2018 the five reactors were operated in batch mode to evaluate the performance of the five reactors for comparison before start up the sludge taken from a bioelectrochemical reactor treating pyridine containing wastewater was inoculated into the quartz reactors at mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration of about 6 0 g l 1 two days later the supernatant was drained off before 125 ml fresh synthetic wastewater containing 150 mg l 1 pyridine was added into the reactors to begin the new batch after 30 days accumulation the biofilm could be observed on the surface of bivo4 feooh cp and the suspended sludge in the reactors was discarded thereafter the effect of several operational parameters including initial pyridine concentration initial ph acetate dosage and light intensity on pyridine removal total organic carbon toc removal and nh4 n formation was investigated table 1 in order to reveal the reactive species responsible for enhanced pyridine removal different scavengers were used in rpho bio system purging with nitrogen gas n2 for 15 mins and 0 1 m isopropanol ipa was used in rpho bio system to eliminate o2 and oh respectively xiao et al 2019 wang et al 2012 0 1 m methanol met was added into rpho bio system to act as the oh scavenger as well as the photohole scavenger xiao et al 2019 2 4 analytic methods the obtained bivo4 feooh cp was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem quant 250feg

environmental protection agency nepa standard methods 1997 ammonia formation efficiency was calculated according to our previous study jiang et al 2018 three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis was performed on a fluorescence luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan to better understand the eem fluorescence characteristics of the soluble organics five ex em regions were analyzed using the fluorescence region integration fri method as described by chen et al 2003 pyridine degradation intermediates were identified with hplc ms equipped with a dionex u3000 hplc system an ion trap mass spectrometer and an electrospray ionization source esi according to our previous study wang et al 2018 in order to assess the biological activity and electron transfer at the semiconductor microbe interface electron transport system ets activity was performed using the 2 para iodo phenyl 3 nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int method wang et al 2016 the microbial community structure in rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio after operation for 30 days as well as the inocula sludge was analyzed through high throughput sequencing the extraction of the genomic dna and pcr amplification was performed according to jiang et al 2018 pcr amplification of the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna was performed using primers 383f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 according to standard protocols pcr products were sequenced on an illumina miseq sequencing platform majorbio co china the establishment of dna library and data analysis were performed in accordance to liang et al 2014 sem observation of the biofilms on bivo4 feooh cp was carried out according to ho et al 2009 before sem observation the biofilms on bivo4 feooh cp were treated with glutaraldehyde washed with phosphate buffer fixed in osmium tetraoxide and finally dehydrated with ethanol 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of bivo4 feooh cp from xrd pattern of bivo4 feooh cp fig 1 a two relatively weak diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 11 84 and 16 79 could be observed which corresponded to 110 and 200 diffraction planes the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with β feooh jcpds no 34 1266 was consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018 however other peaks corresponding to β feooh could not be observed in xrd pattern probably due to the ultrathin β feooh nanolayers the main diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 18 67 18 99 28 95 30 55 34 49 35 22 39 78 42 34 46 03 46 71 47 31 49 96 50 31 53 31 57 91 and 58 53 could be ascribed to 101 011 121 040 200 002 211 150 132 240 042 202 202 161 170 and 321 crystal planes of monoclinic bivo4 jcpds no 14 0668 kim and choi 2014 in addition two diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 26 53 and 54 55 could be ascribed to 002 and 004 reflections of graphite jcpds no 41 1487 li et al 2007 from xrd pattern it could be inferred that both bivo4 and feooh was successfully fabricated onto cp through facile electrodeposition and solution impregnation method used in this study as indicated by zhang et al 2018 bivo4 feooh nanocomposites were fabricated by covering the ultrathin feooh nanolayers over nanoporous bivo4 nanofilms from fe sem shown in fig 1b it could be observed that nanoporous bivo4 feooh nanofilms grew well on the surface of cp which was helpful in improving the surface roughness the rough surface was not only beneficial for the increase of reactive sites but also beneficial for the attachment of microbes on it chen et al 2017 from elemental mapping analysis it could be observed that bi v o and fe elements was evenly distributed onto cp surface confirming the uniform dispersion of both feooh and bivo4 as shown in fig s1 the atomic percentages of bi v o and fe elements were calculated to be 9 80 9 05 79 18 and 1 97 respectively the atomic percentages of bi and v element were well consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of bivo4 the low content of iron element was consistent with xrd results where weak diffraction peaks of β feooh was observed which could be attributed to the low content of β feooh in bivo4 feooh cp however due to the contribution of o atom from cp the atomic percentage of o detected was higher than the total theoretical values in bivo4 and feooh 3 2 pyridine degradation performances in order to verify the feasibility of the light driven pyridine biodegradation the performance of the five reactors in terms of pyridine removal was compared as displayed in fig 2 a pyridine concentration in rcon and rbio was slightly decreased from initial 150 mg l 1 to 133 08 2 59 mg l 1 and 137 03 7 15 mg l 1 within 48 h probably due to the volatilization and the adsorption of pyridine the negligible pyridine removal in both rcon and rbio indicated that pyridine could not be effectively removed through the sole photolysis or biodegradation in contrast pyridine removal performance of rpho was better than rcon and rbio as indicated by the decrease of pyridine concentration from the initial 150 mg l 1 to 126 77 10 54 mg l 1 at 24 h and to 100 23 9 85 mg l 1 at 48 h this result indicated that pyridine degradation could be catalyzed by bivo4 feooh cp under visible light although the degradation efficiency was relatively poor however pyridine concentration in rpho bio under visible light decreased rapidly from initial 150 mg l 1 to 117 56 5 52 mg l 1 within 12 h and to 4 67 2 22 mg l 1 within 36 h complete pyridine removal was achieved in rpho bio within 48 h indicating the excellent pyridine removal performance at the semiconductor microbe interface under visible light it was worth noting that pyridine degradation performance in rpho bio dark without visible light was only comparable with that in rbio with pyridine concentration deceased slightly from initial 150 mg l 1 to 137 81 7 16 mg l 1 within 48 h indicating that the presence of bivo4 feooh cp could not contribute to the removal of pyridine without light irradiation in addition pyridine removal in rpho bio obviously exceeded the sum of those in rpho and rbio demonstrating the synergistic promotion towards pyridine removal with the help of the semiconductor microbe interface similar result was also observed in previous study where methyl orange degradation rate in bio photodegradation system was much higher than biodegradation only system and photolysis only system huang et al 2019 correspondingly toc concentration profile showed similar trend with pyridine removal as indicated in fig 2b toc concentration in rpho bio decreased rapidly from initial 110 mg l 1 to 43 38 5 56 mg l 1 at 24 h with residual toc concentration as low as 12 88 1 39 mg l 1 at 48 h in rpho toc concentration decreased slightly from initial 110 mg l 1 to 79 97 8 30 mg l 1 at 48 h implying that pyridine ring could be destroyed by semiconductor however the variation of toc concentration in rcon rbio and rpho bio dark were rather weak indicating that pyridine was highly refractory to microorganisms the efficient toc removal in rpho bio implied that pyridine mineralization could be achieved through the synergy between microorganisms and visible light at the presence of bivo4 feooh cp ding et al 2018 also found that β apo oxytetracycline mineralization in bio photodegradation system was obviously higher than that in photodegradation system according to our previous study wang et al 2018 nitrogen in pyridine ring was often transformed to nh4 during pyridine mineralization therefore the release of nh4 during pyridine degradation would provide a solid evidence for the cleavage of pyridine ring as indicated in fig 2c nh4 n concentration in rpho bio increased rapidly to 23 01 2 01 mg l 1 within 48 h resulting into nh4 n formation efficiency as high as 84 51 8 95 however nh4 n was always undetectable within 48 h in rcon rbio rpho and rpho bio dark which was content with the poor pyridine and toc removal considering the slight pyridine removal in rpho the absence of nh4 n in rpho indicated that the cleavage of pyridine ring by semiconductor alone resulted in the formation of n containing organic intermediates but not complete mineralization according to our previous study nh4 released from pyridine ring could be further oxidized into no3 or no2 under aerobic condition shen et al 2015 however the concentrations of no3 or no2 in rpho bio was well below 0 1 mg l there might be two reasons responsible for this situation on one hand the organic intermediates produced in pyridine degradation process could act as a sacrificial reagent for semiconductors huang et al 2019 which would compete with nh4 for electron transfer on the other hand no extra oxygen was provided in our bio photodegradation system to ensure abundant oxygen required for the efficient photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous ammonia shibuya et al 2013 the excellent performance in terms of pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation in rpho bio indicated that rpho bio system developed in this study was rather effective in pyridine mineralization 3 3 effects of operation parameters 3 3 1 initial pyridine concentration for the degradation of recalcitrant substrate such as pyridine in biological systems substrate concentration plays a key role in reactor performance jiang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of pyridine concentration from 150 to 300 mg l 1 pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio were reduced slightly form 100 88 06 3 76 and 84 51 8 95 to 90 06 6 64 80 91 4 23 and 75 37 3 15 respectively with the further increase of pyridine concentration to 450 mg l 1 the efficiencies of pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation in rpho bio were further reduced to 82 43 8 84 70 20 2 65 and 64 02 6 47 this phenomenon could be attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity by highly toxic pyridine especially at high concentration mathur et al 2008 bai et al 2008 due to the short hydraulic retention time hrt the calculated maximum pyridine removal rate in rpho bio system was as high as 2 34 mol m 3 d 1 which was significantly higher than the conventional biological systems for example pyridine removal rate in anoxic denitrification system developed in our previous study where no3 was used as the electron acceptor was only 0 76 mol m 3 d 1 shen et al 2015 li et al 2001 found that pyridine removal rate in the anoxic system inoculated with the acclimated activated sludge was as low as 1 26 mol m 3 d 1 3 3 2 initial ph the operation ph had a significant effect on pyridine degradation as pyridine degradation was always accompanied by ph variation wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b with the increase of initial ph from 6 0 to 7 0 toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio increased from 73 23 0 85 and 54 09 9 18 to 88 06 3 76 and 84 51 8 95 respectively with the further increase of initial ph to 8 0 toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio decreased to 80 53 5 25 and 69 74 4 72 respectively however with the variation of initial ph from 6 0 to 8 0 pyridine removal efficiency in rpho bio system remained constant as 100 indicating excellent pyridine removal performance of rpho bio system within a wide ph range the noticeable deterioration of the toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies at initial ph of 6 0 could be attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity in the acidic environment wu et al 2018 3 3 3 acetate dosage the dosage of co substrates such as acetate would have a significant effect on pyridine degradation because initial mono oxygenation reaction during pyridine biodegradation required readily biodegradable electron donors to yield intracellular electron carriers xu et al 2017 as indicated in fig 3c with the increase of acetate dosage from 0 to 200 mg l 1 although pyridine removal efficiencies in rpho bio system were well as 100 nh4 n formation efficiencies decreased obviously from 84 51 8 95 to 39 42 3 96 when acetate dosage was further increased to 400 mg l 1 pyridine removal efficiencies were remarkably reduced to 55 71 4 95 however it was quite interesting to observe that nh4 n was undetectable at this acetate dosage indicating pyridine mineralization was completely inhibited by high strength acetate this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that biodegradable acetate could be more readily used as carbon source than recalcitrant pyridine in rpho bio system in fact acetate could be removed completely despite of the acetate dosage confirming that acetate could be consumed entirely in rpho bio system in addition acetate could act as the scavenger of the photoholes or free radical produced by semiconductor similar phenomenon was observed by xiong et al 2018 where tetracycline degradation was seriously inhibited by acetate in the photocatalysis system 3 3 4 light intensity light intensity is an important parameter that regulates the performance of the bio photodegradation system cheng et al 2017 as shown in fig 3d with the increase of light intensity from 5 to 15 mw cm 2 pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio system were significantly increased form 33 82 4 82 21 53 1 75 and 0 to 82 43 8 84 70 20 2 65 and 64 02 6 47 respectively at low light intensity of 5 mw cm 2 the undetectable nh4 n formation could be attributed to the inhibition of photoelectron hole pairs generation at high light intensity the high pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies indicated the excellent mineralization performance of rpho bio system zhou et al 2015 found that microbial activity could be severely inhibited when ultraviolet light was used due to the cell membrane disruption and cell death caused by the absorption of uv photons by proteins and nucleotides in the microbes in this study the utilization of visible light provided a great way to solve the puzzle regarding the biological inhibition exerted by ultraviolet light moreover taking the established rpho bio system treating wastewater containing 450 mg l 1 pyridine as an example the power of led lamp could be estimated to be 225 mw at the light intensity of 15 mw cm 2 if the area of semiconductor microbe interface was 15 cm2 considering that pyridine removal efficiency and the reaction time was 82 43 and 48 h respectively the increased energy consumption due to led illumination could be estimated to be 2 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine in rpho bio system which was much less than the energy consumption in a pure electrochemical system 96 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine li et al 2016 furthermore led lights could be replaced by sunlight in the future practical application which would substantially reduce energy consumption 3 4 degradation intermediates and possible pathway the main pyridine degradation intermediates in rpho rbio and rpho bio were compared based on the hplc ms analysis table 2 and fig s2 in rpho five intermediates were identified as piperidine m1 piperidin 2 one m2 butylamino methanol m3 z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 and carbamic acid m5 in rbio the main intermediates were identified as 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 1 hydroxymethyl amino butane 1 2 3 4 tetraol m7 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroxybutyl glycine m8 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 and carbamic acid m5 more intermediates were identified in rpho bio i e piperidine m1 piperidin 2 one m2 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 4 carboxyamino 3 hydroxybutanoic acid m11 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 piperidine 2 3 5 6 tetraone m13 1 aminopentane 1 2 3 4 5 pentaol m14 1 aminopentan 3 ol m15 and 3 oxopentanedial m16 both piperidine m1 and piperidin 2 one m2 were detected in rpho and rpho bio indicating that m1 and m2 were generated through the photocatalytic reaction it should be noted that carbamic acid m5 was identified in both rpho and rbio as the main intermediate but not in rpho bio system moreover all intermediates detected in rpho and rbio contained n element indicating that nh4 release and mineralization was limited in both rpho and rbio which was consistent with the low toc removal efficiency and low nh4 n formation efficiency fig 2b and 2c however two n free intermediates namely 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 and 3 oxopentanedial m16 was found in rpho bio system which was well consistent with high toc removal and high nh4 release most of the intermediates observed in rbio and rpho bio were generated through hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation which was also observed in the previous studies wang et al 2018 bai et al 2008 based on the analysis of pyridine degradation intermediates possible pyridine degradation pathways in rpho rbio and rpho bio were proposed fig 4 in rpho pyridine was firstly converted to piperidine m1 through hydrogenation reaction then piperidine m1 was further oxidized to form piperidine 2 one m2 piperidine 2 one m2 was oxidized into butylamino methanol m3 and z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 by the cleavage of c c bond and carboxylation z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 could be further oxidized with carbamic acid m5 observed as the end products similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies zhang et al 2014 tang et al 2015 where pyridine was degraded by uv photolysis however mineralization efficiency under uv photolysis was relatively low indicating the formation of recalcitrant end products in rbio pyridine was firstly oxidized into 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 which was further oxidized to 1 hydroxymethyl amino butane 1 2 3 4 tetraol m7 through the ring cleavage then 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroxybutyl glycine m8 and 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 was formed through oxidation finally carbamic acid m5 was generated as the main product 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 and carbamic acid m5 was also observed in our previous study wang et al 2018 where pyridine was efficiently biodegraded by paracoccus sp njust30 at the presence of oxygen however succinic acid which was observed as the main intermediates by wang et al 2018 was undetectable in rbio probably due to the lack of electron acceptor i e oxygen the initial two steps involved in pyridine degradation in rpho bio were consistent with those in rpho with piperidine m1 and piperidine 2 one m2 observed however piperidine 2 one m2 was then oxidized into 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 consequently two subsequent degradation pathways were observed namely pathway i and pathway ii in pathway i the ring cleavage of 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 occurred with the following formation of 4 carboxyamino 3 hydroxybutanoic acid m11 and 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 observed 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 could be further oxidized to produce 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 with nh4 released simultaneously in pathway ii intermediate piperidine 2 3 5 6 tetraone m13 was formed through the oxidation of 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 then ring cleavage occurred to produce 1 aminopentane 1 2 3 4 5 pentaol m14 which was further transformed to 1 aminopentan 3 ol m15 subsequently 3 oxopentanedial m16 was produced accompanied by the release of nh4 finally the intermediates namely 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 in pathway i and 3 oxopentanedial m16 in pathway ii could be easily mineralized into co2 and h2o based on the above analysis it could be inferred that pyridine degradation pathway in rpho bio was quite different from those in rpho and rbio which could be contributed to the synergistic effect between the semiconductors and microbes eem fluorescence spectrum fig s3 of the effluent from rpho bio rbio and rpho showed substantial difference confirming the different pyridine degradation pathways in these three systems an apparent fluorophore the perk with the position at ex 280 nm em 300 310 nm recognized in region iv at the initial stage was related to pyridine in rpho this fluorophore still appeared in the effluent sampled after 48 h which was consistent with the poor performance of pyridine removal in rpho however higher intensity fluorescence was recognized in region i and iv for the effluent taken from rpho bio and rbio similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies lu et al 2012b wu et al 2018 where the contents of aromatic proteins such as tyrosine and dissolved organic matters related microbial by products increased due to the biodegradation of organic matter the two perks in region i and iv remained high intensity fluorescence after 48 h because their corresponding dissolved organic matters were resistant to further biodegradation it was worth mentioning that rpho bio showed lower strength of fluorescence intensity in regions iv and v as compared to rbio indicating enhanced removal of intermediates in rpho bio which was consistent with significant toc removal in rpho bio 3 5 microbial community structure the diversity of microbial community on the semiconductor microbe interface in rpho bio was relatively low as compared to rbio and rpho bio dark probably due to the inhibition of specific microbial community by various reactive species such as superoxide radical anion o2 hydroxyl radical oh and photoholes h generated on semiconductor table s1 and text s1 in addition the selection of specific functional species in the specific environment would be another reason for the low diversity on the semiconductor microbe interface the microbial community structure in inocula sludge rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio was further analyzed at the phylum level text s2 and fig s4 and genus level fig 5 through high throughput sequencing as displayed in fig 5 rhodopseudomonas 17 04 paracoccus 16 16 and methyloversatilis 4 02 were dominant in inocula sludge in rbio rhodococcus 26 73 hydrogenophaga 6 04 and paracoccus 5 48 were found to be the dominant species in rpho bio dark species namely paracoccus 29 45 dokdonella 5 25 and desulfovibrio 5 22 were most dominant paracoccus has been reported to be an excellent pyridine degrader as well as a typical denitrifying bacterium bai et al 2008 sun et al 2011 found that rhodococcus was capable of degrading pyridine and phenol at the same time dokdonella was found to be the dominant species in granular activated carbon filters treating wastewater containing chlorinated hydrocarbons munro et al 2013 desulfovibrio was responsible for the reductive transformation of various oxidative contaminants such as coiiiedta blessing et al 2001 hydrogenophaga was also observed in an electricity assisted anaerobic system treating pyridine containing wastewater jiang et al 2018 however these species were not dominant in rpho bio demonstrating the substantial difference of community structure instead shewanella 29 81 bacillus 13 18 lysinibacillus 8 03 and tissierella 7 61 were found to be most dominant in rpho bio shewanella which was the most abundant in rpho bio was a well known electrochemically active species capable of utilizing various extracellular respiratory electron acceptors such as metal oxides and dimethyl sulfoxide heidelberg et al 2002 in addition shewanella could growth using pyridine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source mathur et al 2008 according to yao et al 2011 and uma and sandhya 1997 both bacillus and lysinibacillus were excellent pyridine degraders bacillus has also been reported to play an essential role in ammonia release during the biodegradation of nitrogen containing organic matter choi et al 2014 tissierella was reported to be capable of producing riboflavin as an extracellular electron shuttling compound which was rather beneficial for extracellular electron transfer eet fuller et al 2015 therefore it can be inferred that the species involved in pyridine biodegradation shewanella bacillus and lysinibacillus and electron transfer shewanella and tissierella could be efficiently enriched in rpho bio as compared to inocula sludge rbio and rpho bio dark system 3 6 importance of light excited photoholes various reactive species such as superoxide radical anion o2 hydroxyl radical oh and photoholes h could be produced by semiconductor under light irradiation after removing dissolved oxygen in rpho bio system pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency remained almost unchanged indicating that o2 was not the main reaction species responsible for pyridine degradation in rpho bio system fig 6 a besides this result also indicated that pyridine could be degraded in rpho bio system under strict anaerobic conditions very weak suppression on pyridine removal was observed after the addition of ipa as indicated by the slight decrease of pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency from 100 and 84 51 8 95 to 95 46 3 14 and 79 41 2 54 respectively indicating that limited oh was participated in pyridine degradation it was quite interesting that when met was added into rpho bio system pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency decreased significantly from 100 and 84 51 8 95 to 78 85 15 84 and 0 respectively this result indicated that the photoholes rather than oh were the main reactive species responsible for pyridine bio photodegradation ets activity was found to be an effective indicator for microorganism respiration and substrate removal potential in biological process yin et al 2018 in order to investigate the effect of photoholes on biological activity and electron transfer ets activity in rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio system was assessed as shown in fig 6b ets activity of rpho bio was as high as 36 7 1 2 mg intf g tss h 1 which was significantly higher than those in rpho bio dark 19 4 1 3 mg intf g tss h 1 and rbio 16 5 0 3 mg intf g tss h 1 probably due to the enrichment of specific functional species involved in rpho bio as well as the relatively weak inhibition of reactive species such as photoholes the low ets activity in rbio and rpho bio dark could be attributed to the high toxicity and recalcitrance of pyridine which was consistent with the poor pyridine removal fig 2 as indicated in fig 5 the functional species related to both pyridine biodegradation and electron transfer increased significantly in rpho bio system which could be the main reason for the high ets activity in rpho bio system the efficient utilization of pyridine and its degradation intermediates in the microbial respiration chain under visible light irradiation catalyzed by bivo4 feooh cp would result in the improvement of ets activity in rpho bio system the low ets activity observed in rpho bio dark system confirmed that bivo4 feooh cp could not work for microorganisms without light therefore it could be inferred that the semiconductor microbe interface could accelerate the electron transfer and improve pyridine degradation electron transfer dynamics and the photogenerated charge separation was closely related to the degradation of various contaminants in photocatalysis system ding et al 2018 as indicated in fig 6c in both rpho and rpho bio photocurrent was immediately induced after illumination of visible light and the photocurrent declined when the illumination was stopped indicating the effectiveness of bivo4 feooh cp in visible light catalysis however the peak photocurrent density in rpho bio was around 23 µa cm 2 which was obviously higher than that in rpho about 15 µa cm 2 indicating the key role of microorganisms in electron generation and transfer it could be inferred that additional photogenerated carriers transfer pathway between the semiconductors and biofilms existed in rpho bio from eis analysis fig 6d it could be observed that the charge transfer resistances rct in rpho bio with and without visible light irradiation were 1 80 kω and 17 36 kω respectively which were obviously lower than those in rpho 4 77 kω and 23 32 kω indicating the effective separation of the photoelectron hole pairs and rapid transmission of photogenerated carriers at the semiconductor microbe interface the biofilm formed on bivo4 feooh cp would play an important role in both photogenerated carriers transfer and pyridine biodegradation as indicated in fig 1b the rough surface of bivo4 feooh cp could provide abundant space for the growth of microorganisms as shown in fig s5 after operation for 30 days dense biofilm could be observed on the surface of bivo4 feooh cp which was mainly consisted of micrococcus and rod shaped species the successful formation of biofilm on the semiconductor microbe interface demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility of bivo4 feooh nanocomposites the close combination of biofilm and bivo4 feooh nanocomposites would contribute to the accelerated photogenerated carriers transport the significantly improved ets activity and photoelectrochemical property at the semiconductor microbe interface in addition the biofilm could act as a protective barrier against the toxicity of pyridine for the microorganisms inside biomass retention especially for the slow growing species could be improved through the formation of biofilm at the semiconductor microbe interface 3 7 possible mechanism for enhanced pyridine bio photodegradation based on the above analysis a possible mechanism responsible for enhanced pyridine bio photodegradation was proposed fig 7 firstly the led lamp acted as an excitation source that could effectively excite bivo4 feooh nanocomposites resulting in the generation of photoelectron hole pairs secondly pyridine was firstly reduced to piperidine by photoelectrons generated at the semiconductor microbe interface which was revealed by pyridine degradation pathway thirdly the photoholes which were found to be the main reactive species in rpho bio could directly react with pyridine degradation intermediates such as piperidine to promote the degradation of pyridine similar phenomenon was also observed in a light driven geobacter sulfurreducens cds biohybrid system by huang et al 2019 where the intermediates produced in methyl orange degradation process could be oxidized as the sacrificial reagent by the photoholes from fig 6a it could be observed that photoholes was rather effective in nh4 n formation as compared to pyridine removal probably due to the fact that photoholes could not react directly with pyridine in our previous study it was also proven that electron acceptors such as nitrate played a vital role in pyridine biodegradation process shen et al 2015 based on the analysis of microbial community structure the species related to pyridine biodegradation and electron transfer were obviously enriched in rpho bio system the electrons produced in pyridine biodegradation process could be easily delivered to the electron acceptors such as photoholes by electron transfer related species qian et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 moreover the consumption of photoelectrons and photoholes at the semiconductor microbe interface suppressed the recombination of photoelectron and hole which was rather beneficial for pyridine degradation as a consequence significant improvement in pyridine removal was achieved at the semiconductor microbe interface showing great potential to be a cost effective technology for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing pyridine 4 conclusions pyridine removal performance at the bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface under visible light was far more efficient than biodegradation only system and photolysis only system pyridine was firstly reduced by photoelectrons and then oxidized in the bio photodegradation process it was worth noting that photoholes played a crucial role in promoting pyridine mineralization on the semiconductor microbe interface the ets activity and electron transfer efficiency could be significantly improved due to the combination of the biofilms and semiconductors this study demonstrated that the bio photodegradation system would provide a promising and feasible alternative for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant

17502,pyridine a highly toxic nitrogen containing heterocyclic compound is recalcitrant in the conventional biodegradation process in this study bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface was developed for enhanced visible light driven biodegradation of pyridine where the efficiencies of pyridine removal 100 total organic carbon toc removal 88 06 3 76 and nh4 n formation 84 51 8 95 were remarkably improved compared to the biodegradation system and photodegradation system the electron transport system activity and photoelectrochemical analysis implied the significant improvement of photogenerated carriers transfer between microbes and semiconductors high throughput sequencing analysis suggested functional species related to pyridine biodegradation shewanella bacillus and lysinibacillus and electron transfer shewanella and tissierella were enriched at the semiconductor microbe interface the light excited holes played a crucial role in promoting pyridine mineralization this study demonstrated that this bio photodegradation system would be a potential alternative for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutant such as pyridine graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyridine semiconductor microbe interface photoelectron transfer photohole electron acceptor 1 introduction various nitrogen heterocyclic compounds nhcs often pose a severe threat to the environment once the wastewater containing nhcs is discharged into the water environment it will cause dangerous environmental pollution mathur et al 2008 as a typical representative of nhcs pyridine is widely used as solvent and intermediate in pharmaceuticals insecticides paints dyes explosives and petrochemicals huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zong et al 2018 pyridine which has adverse effects on human health and environmental quality due to its toxicity and teratogenicity mudliar et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 has been listed as a priority pollutant by the us environmental protection agency sun et al 2011 liang et al 2018 therefore there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and economical treatment method to remove pyridine from wastewater biological treatment as the most common and widespread technique used in wastewater treatment is often the most economical alternative when compared with other physical and chemical processes it has been proven that pyridine could be biodegraded under aerobic conditions with their metabolic pathways revealed bai et al 2009 qiao et al 2010 liu et al 2015 for the most part aerobic biodegradation involves mono oxygenation reactions in which molecular oxygen is served as the electron acceptor padoley et al 2006 unfortunately conventional aerobic treatment would not only increase energy consumption due to a high aeration rate but also cause disgusting odors due to the volatility of pyridine hou et al 2018 as an attractive alternative for aerobic treatment anoxic biodegradation is considered to be a practical and inexpensive technique for recalcitrant contaminant removal lu et al 2012a some recalcitrant contaminants such as sulphonamides bílková et al 2019 btex carvajal et al 2018 and n methylpyrrolidone wang et al 2019 were found to be biodegradable under denitrifying conditions organic carbon tends to be oxidized preferentially at the presence of electron acceptor through which most energy required could be supplied to microorganisms our previous studies indicated that enhanced pyridine biodegradation could be achieved in the anoxic biodegradation systems supplemented with nitrate shen et al 2015 hou et al 2018 recently it has been proven that the solid electrode could act as a continuous electron sink for recalcitrant contaminants oxidation chen et al 2019 in our recent study with the increase of applied current to 0 3 ma the anode potential increased to around 150 mv resulting in enhanced pyridine removal jiang et al 2018 however the biofilm on the anode might be destroyed when a higher current was applied in the anaerobic system in order to further increase the capacity of the anode to accept electrons in addition it was reported that the initial mono oxygenation reaction during pyridine biodegradation required readily biodegradable electron donors to yield intracellular electron carriers nadh or e which could accelerate the initial reactions for pyridine biodegradation xu et al 2017 our previous work also documented that an appropriate amount of extra electron donors would promote pyridine removal when using anode as the electron acceptor jiang et al 2018 considering the fact that some semiconductor materials can produce sustainable photogenerated holes or electrons under illumination to catalyze a series of oxidation reduction reactions it is feasible for semiconductor materials to act as electron acceptors donors to accelerate electron transfer from to microbes ding et al 2018 dong et al 2016 therefore integrating light absorbing semiconductors with microorganisms would offer an avenue to create semiconductor microbe interfaces that elegantly maximize the transduction of solar energy for chemical conversion and contaminant degradation particularly the light excited semiconductors could drive the microbial reduction of various recalcitrant pollutants such as methyl orange huang et al 2019 β apo oxytetracycline ding et al 2018 and rhodamine b xiao et al 2019 throughout the microbial extracellular respiratory electron transfer chain moreover li et al 2014 discovered that dissimilatory metal reducing microorganisms were able to pump electrons from organic carbon oxidation to light excited semiconductors which enabled electrons transport from the intracellular electron pool to the outer membrane coupling semiconductors and microbial extracellular electron transfer processes provide prospects to fulfill specialized environmental remediation applications dong et al 2020 it was envisaged that the biodegradation and mineralization efficiency of recalcitrant contaminants could be strengthened by using semiconductor materials as the electron acceptors as well as electron donors yu et al 2020 however the feasibility of enhancing pyridine biodegradation by light excited semiconductor materials has not been well documented the interaction among light excited semiconductors microorganisms and contaminants at the semiconductor microbe interfaces have not been clarified considering that most microbes cannot survive under the irradiation of uv light the semiconductor material used in the semiconductor microbe interface must have the characteristics of the visible light response due to the excellent degradability performance under visible light irradiation and high biocompatibility bivo4 feooh nanocomposites were synthesized and used as the semiconductor in the biohybrid system the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the semiconductor microbe interface to enhance the degradation of pyridine comparative studies were carried out among the biohybrid system and other control experiments and the effects of various key factors on the reactor performance were discussed based on the reactive species trapping experiments and high throughput sequencing analysis the possible mechanism for enhanced pyridine degradation at the semiconductor microbe interface was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials carbon paper cp was purchased from toray co japan before use the carbon paper was cleaned sonicated and then dried to

electrochemical studies then 1 ml vo acac 2 dmso solution was spread onto bioi cp and annealed at 450 c for two hours at heating rate of 2 c min 1 bivo4 cp was obtained after treating with 10 m naoh for 30 mins to remove the excess v2o5 in order to obtain bivo4 feooh cp the as prepared bivo4 cp was further immersed in 5 mm fecl3 6h2o solution for 12 h before washing by deionized water for three times 2 3 set up of bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface in order to verify the feasibility of the light driven pyridine biodegradation five quartz reactors 4 5 4 5 7 5 cm 150 ml was operated

buffer 7 mm ph 7 0 mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 0 05 g l 1 pyridine at desired concentration and trace element solution 1 ml l 1 jiang et al 2018 the five reactors were operated in batch mode to evaluate the performance of the five reactors for comparison before start up the sludge taken from a bioelectrochemical reactor treating pyridine containing wastewater was inoculated into the quartz reactors at mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentration of about 6 0 g l 1 two days later the supernatant was drained off before 125 ml fresh synthetic wastewater containing 150 mg l 1 pyridine was added into the reactors to begin the new batch after 30 days accumulation the biofilm could be observed on the surface of bivo4 feooh cp and the suspended sludge in the reactors was discarded thereafter the effect of several operational parameters including initial pyridine concentration initial ph acetate dosage and light intensity on pyridine removal total organic carbon toc removal and nh4 n formation was investigated table 1 in order to reveal the reactive species responsible for enhanced pyridine removal different scavengers were used in rpho bio system purging with nitrogen gas

environmental protection agency nepa standard methods 1997 ammonia formation efficiency was calculated according to our previous study jiang et al 2018 three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis was performed on a fluorescence luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan to better understand the eem fluorescence characteristics of the soluble organics five ex em regions were analyzed using the fluorescence region integration fri method as described by chen et al 2003 pyridine degradation intermediates were identified with hplc ms equipped with a dionex u3000 hplc system an ion trap mass spectrometer and an electrospray ionization source esi according to our previous study wang et al 2018 in order to assess the biological activity and electron transfer at the semiconductor microbe interface electron transport system ets activity was performed using the 2 para iodo phenyl 3 nitrophenyl 5 phenyl tetrazolium chloride int method wang et al 2016 the microbial community structure in rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio after operation for 30 days as well as the inocula sludge was analyzed through high throughput sequencing the extraction of the genomic dna and pcr amplification was performed according to jiang et al 2018 pcr amplification of the v3 v4 regions of bacterial 16s rrna was performed using primers 383f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and

were performed in accordance to liang et al 2014 sem observation of the biofilms on bivo4 feooh cp was carried out according to ho et al 2009 before sem observation the biofilms on bivo4 feooh cp were treated with glutaraldehyde washed with phosphate buffer fixed in osmium tetraoxide and finally dehydrated with ethanol 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of bivo4 feooh cp from xrd pattern of bivo4 feooh cp fig 1 a two relatively weak diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 11 84 and 16 79 could be observed which corresponded to 110 and 200 diffraction planes the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with β feooh jcpds no 34 1266 was consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018 however other peaks corresponding to β feooh could not be observed in xrd pattern probably due to the ultrathin β feooh nanolayers the main diffraction peaks observed at 2θ values of 18 67 18 99 28 95 30 55 34 49 35 22 39 78 42 34 46 03 46 71 47 31 49 96 50 31 53 31 57 91 and 58 53 could be ascribed to 101 011 121 040 200 002 211 150 132 240 042 202 202 161 170 and 321 crystal planes of monoclinic bivo4 jcpds no 14 0668 kim and choi 2014 in addition two diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 26 53 and 54 55 could be ascribed to 002 and 004 reflections of graphite jcpds no 41 1487 li et al 2007 from xrd pattern it could be inferred that both bivo4 and feooh was successfully fabricated onto cp through facile electrodeposition and solution impregnation method used in this study as indicated by zhang et al 2018 bivo4 feooh nanocomposites were fabricated by covering the ultrathin feooh nanolayers over nanoporous bivo4 nanofilms from fe sem shown in fig 1b it could be observed that nanoporous bivo4 feooh nanofilms grew well on the surface of cp which was helpful in improving the surface roughness the rough surface was not only beneficial for the increase of reactive sites but also beneficial for the attachment of microbes on it chen et al 2017 from elemental mapping analysis it could be observed that bi v o and fe elements was evenly distributed onto cp surface confirming the uniform dispersion of both feooh and bivo4 as shown in fig s1 the atomic percentages of bi v o and fe elements were calculated to be 9 80 9 05 79 18 and 1 97 respectively the atomic percentages of bi and v element were well consistent with the stoichiometric ratio of bivo4 the low content of iron element was consistent with xrd results where weak diffraction peaks of β feooh was observed which could be attributed to the low content of β feooh in bivo4 feooh cp however due to the contribution of o atom from cp the atomic percentage of o detected was higher than the total theoretical values in bivo4 and feooh 3 2 pyridine degradation performances in order to verify the feasibility of the light driven pyridine biodegradation the performance of the five reactors in terms of pyridine removal was compared as displayed in fig 2 a pyridine concentration in rcon and rbio was slightly decreased from initial 150 mg l 1 to 133 08 2 59 mg l 1 and 137 03 7 15 mg l 1 within 48 h probably due to the volatilization and the adsorption of pyridine the negligible pyridine removal in both rcon and rbio indicated that pyridine could not be effectively removed through the sole photolysis or biodegradation in contrast pyridine removal performance of rpho was better than rcon and rbio as indicated by the decrease of pyridine concentration from the initial 150 mg l 1 to 126 77 10 54 mg l 1 at 24 h and to 100 23 9 85 mg l 1 at 48 h this result indicated that pyridine degradation could be catalyzed by bivo4 feooh cp under visible light although the degradation efficiency was relatively poor however pyridine concentration in rpho bio under visible light decreased rapidly from initial 150 mg l 1 to 117 56 5 52 mg l 1 within 12 h and to 4 67 2 22 mg l 1 within 36 h complete pyridine removal was achieved in rpho bio within 48 h indicating the excellent pyridine removal performance at the semiconductor microbe interface under visible light it was worth noting that pyridine degradation performance in rpho bio dark without visible light was only comparable with that in rbio with pyridine concentration deceased slightly from initial 150 mg l 1 to 137 81 7 16 mg l 1 within 48 h indicating that the presence of bivo4 feooh cp could not contribute to the removal of pyridine without light irradiation in addition pyridine removal in rpho bio obviously exceeded the sum of those in rpho and rbio demonstrating the synergistic promotion towards pyridine removal with the help of the semiconductor microbe interface similar result was also observed in previous study where methyl orange degradation rate in bio photodegradation system was much higher than biodegradation only system and photolysis only system huang et al 2019 correspondingly toc concentration profile showed similar trend with pyridine removal as indicated in fig 2b toc concentration in rpho bio decreased rapidly from initial 110 mg l 1 to 43 38 5 56 mg l 1 at 24 h with residual toc concentration as low as 12 88 1 39 mg l 1 at 48 h in rpho toc concentration decreased slightly from initial 110 mg l 1 to 79 97 8 30 mg l 1 at 48 h implying that pyridine ring could be destroyed by semiconductor however the variation of toc concentration in rcon rbio and rpho bio dark were rather weak indicating that pyridine was highly refractory to microorganisms the efficient toc removal in rpho bio implied that pyridine mineralization could be achieved through the synergy between microorganisms and visible light at the presence of bivo4 feooh cp ding et al 2018 also found that β apo oxytetracycline mineralization in bio photodegradation system was obviously higher than that in photodegradation system according to our previous study wang et al 2018 nitrogen in pyridine ring was often transformed to nh4 during pyridine mineralization therefore the release of nh4 during pyridine degradation would provide a solid evidence for the cleavage of pyridine ring as indicated in fig 2c nh4 n concentration in rpho bio increased rapidly to 23 01 2 01 mg l 1 within 48 h resulting into nh4 n formation efficiency as high as 84 51 8 95 however nh4 n was always undetectable within 48 h in rcon rbio rpho and rpho bio dark which was content with the poor pyridine and toc removal considering the slight pyridine removal in rpho the absence of nh4 n in rpho indicated that the cleavage of pyridine ring by semiconductor alone resulted in the formation of n containing organic intermediates but not complete mineralization according to our previous study nh4 released from pyridine ring could be further oxidized into no3 or no2 under aerobic condition shen et al 2015 however the concentrations of no3 or no2 in rpho bio was well below 0 1 mg l there might be two reasons responsible for this situation on one hand the organic intermediates produced in pyridine degradation process could act as a sacrificial reagent for semiconductors huang et al 2019 which would compete with nh4 for electron transfer on the other hand no extra oxygen was provided in our bio photodegradation system to ensure abundant oxygen required for the efficient photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous ammonia shibuya et al 2013 the excellent performance in terms of pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation in rpho bio indicated that rpho bio system developed in this study was rather effective in pyridine mineralization 3 3 effects of operation parameters 3 3 1 initial pyridine concentration for the degradation of recalcitrant substrate such as pyridine in biological systems substrate concentration plays a key role in reactor performance jiang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3 a with the increase of pyridine concentration from 150 to 300 mg l 1 pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio were reduced slightly form 100 88 06 3 76 and 84 51 8 95 to 90 06 6 64 80 91 4 23 and 75 37 3 15 respectively with the further increase of pyridine concentration to 450 mg l 1 the efficiencies of pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation in rpho bio were further reduced to 82 43 8 84 70 20 2 65 and 64 02 6 47 this phenomenon could be attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity by highly toxic pyridine especially at high concentration mathur et al 2008 bai et al 2008 due to the short hydraulic retention time hrt the calculated maximum pyridine removal rate in rpho bio system was as high as 2 34 mol m 3 d 1 which was significantly higher than the conventional biological systems for example pyridine removal rate in anoxic denitrification system developed in our previous study where no3 was used as the electron acceptor was only 0 76 mol m 3 d 1 shen et al 2015 li et al 2001 found that pyridine removal rate in the anoxic system inoculated with the acclimated activated sludge was as low as 1 26 mol m 3 d 1 3 3 2 initial ph the operation ph had a significant effect on pyridine degradation as pyridine degradation was always accompanied by ph variation wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 3b with the increase of initial ph from 6 0 to 7 0 toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio increased from 73 23 0 85 and 54 09 9 18 to 88 06 3 76 and 84 51 8 95 respectively with the further increase of initial ph to 8 0 toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio decreased to 80 53 5 25 and 69 74 4 72 respectively however with the variation of initial ph from 6 0 to 8 0 pyridine removal efficiency in rpho bio system remained constant as 100 indicating excellent pyridine removal performance of rpho bio system within a wide ph range the noticeable deterioration of the toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies at initial ph of 6 0 could be attributed to the inhibition of microbial activity in the acidic environment wu et al 2018 3 3 3 acetate dosage the dosage of co substrates such as acetate would have a significant effect on pyridine degradation because initial mono oxygenation reaction during pyridine biodegradation required readily biodegradable electron donors to yield intracellular electron carriers xu et al 2017 as indicated in fig 3c with the increase of acetate dosage from 0 to 200 mg l 1 although pyridine removal efficiencies in rpho bio system were well as 100 nh4 n formation efficiencies decreased obviously from 84 51 8 95 to 39 42 3 96 when acetate dosage was further increased to 400 mg l 1 pyridine removal efficiencies were remarkably reduced to 55 71 4 95 however it was quite interesting to observe that nh4 n was undetectable at this acetate dosage indicating pyridine mineralization was completely inhibited by high strength acetate this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that biodegradable acetate could be more readily used as carbon source than recalcitrant pyridine in rpho bio system in fact acetate could be removed completely despite of the acetate dosage confirming that acetate could be consumed entirely in rpho bio system in addition acetate could act as the scavenger of the photoholes or free radical produced by semiconductor similar phenomenon was observed by xiong et al 2018 where tetracycline degradation was seriously inhibited by acetate in the photocatalysis system 3 3 4 light intensity light intensity is an important parameter that regulates the performance of the bio photodegradation system cheng et al 2017 as shown in fig 3d with the increase of light intensity from 5 to 15 mw cm 2 pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies in rpho bio system were significantly increased form 33 82 4 82 21 53 1 75 and 0 to 82 43 8 84 70 20 2 65 and 64 02 6 47 respectively at low light intensity of 5 mw cm 2 the undetectable nh4 n formation could be attributed to the inhibition of photoelectron hole pairs generation at high light intensity the high pyridine removal toc removal and nh4 n formation efficiencies indicated the excellent mineralization performance of rpho bio system zhou et al 2015 found that microbial activity could be severely inhibited when ultraviolet light was used due to the cell membrane disruption and cell death caused by the absorption of uv photons by proteins and nucleotides in the microbes in this study the utilization of visible light provided a great way to solve the puzzle regarding the biological inhibition exerted by ultraviolet light moreover taking the established rpho bio system treating wastewater containing 450 mg l 1 pyridine as an example the power of led lamp could be estimated to be 225 mw at the light intensity of 15 mw cm 2 if the area of semiconductor microbe interface was 15 cm2 considering that pyridine removal efficiency and the reaction time was 82 43 and 48 h respectively the increased energy consumption due to led illumination could be estimated to be 2 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine in rpho bio system which was much less than the energy consumption in a pure electrochemical system 96 3 kwh mol 1 pyridine li et al 2016 furthermore led lights could be replaced by sunlight in the future practical application which would substantially reduce energy consumption 3 4 degradation intermediates and possible pathway the main pyridine degradation intermediates in rpho rbio and rpho bio were compared based on the hplc ms analysis table 2 and fig s2 in rpho five intermediates were identified as piperidine m1 piperidin 2 one m2 butylamino methanol m3 z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 and carbamic acid m5 in rbio the main intermediates were identified as 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 1 hydroxymethyl amino butane 1 2 3 4 tetraol m7 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroxybutyl glycine m8 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 and carbamic acid m5 more intermediates were identified in rpho bio i e piperidine m1 piperidin 2 one m2 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 4 carboxyamino 3 hydroxybutanoic acid m11 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 piperidine 2 3 5 6 tetraone m13 1 aminopentane 1 2 3 4 5 pentaol m14 1 aminopentan 3 ol m15 and 3 oxopentanedial m16 both piperidine m1 and piperidin 2 one m2 were detected in rpho and rpho bio indicating that m1 and m2 were generated through the photocatalytic reaction it should be noted that carbamic acid m5 was identified in both rpho and rbio as the main intermediate but not in rpho bio system moreover all intermediates detected in rpho and rbio contained n element indicating that nh4 release and mineralization was limited in both rpho and rbio which was consistent with the low toc removal efficiency and low nh4 n formation efficiency fig 2b and 2c however two n free intermediates namely 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 and 3 oxopentanedial m16 was found in rpho bio system which was well consistent with high toc removal and high nh4 release most of the intermediates observed in rbio and rpho bio were generated through hydroxylation carbonylation and carboxylation which was also observed in the previous studies wang et al 2018 bai et al 2008 based on the analysis of pyridine degradation intermediates possible pyridine degradation pathways in rpho rbio and rpho bio were proposed fig 4 in rpho pyridine was firstly converted to piperidine m1 through hydrogenation reaction then piperidine m1 was further oxidized to form piperidine 2 one m2 piperidine 2 one m2 was oxidized into butylamino methanol m3 and z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 by the cleavage of c c bond and carboxylation z but 1 en 1 ylcarbamic acid m4 could be further oxidized with carbamic acid m5 observed as the end products similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies zhang et al 2014 tang et al 2015 where pyridine was degraded by uv photolysis however mineralization efficiency under uv photolysis was relatively low indicating the formation of recalcitrant end products in rbio pyridine was firstly oxidized into 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 which was further oxidized to 1 hydroxymethyl amino butane 1 2 3 4 tetraol m7 through the ring cleavage then 1 2 3 4 tetrahydroxybutyl glycine m8 and 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 was formed through oxidation finally carbamic acid m5 was generated as the main product 1 2 dihydropyridin 2 ol m6 and carbamic acid m5 was also observed in our previous study wang et al 2018 where pyridine was efficiently biodegraded by paracoccus sp njust30 at the presence of oxygen however succinic acid which was observed as the main intermediates by wang et al 2018 was undetectable in rbio probably due to the lack of electron acceptor i e oxygen the initial two steps involved in pyridine degradation in rpho bio were consistent with those in rpho with piperidine m1 and piperidine 2 one m2 observed however piperidine 2 one m2 was then oxidized into 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 consequently two subsequent degradation pathways were observed namely pathway i and pathway ii in pathway i the ring cleavage of 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 occurred with the following formation of 4 carboxyamino 3 hydroxybutanoic acid m11 and 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 observed 4 carboxyamino butanoic acid m9 could be further oxidized to produce 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 with nh4 released simultaneously in pathway ii intermediate piperidine 2 3 5 6 tetraone m13 was formed through the oxidation of 5 hydroxypiperidine 2 3 dione m10 then ring cleavage occurred to produce 1 aminopentane 1 2 3 4 5 pentaol m14 which was further transformed to 1 aminopentan 3 ol m15 subsequently 3 oxopentanedial m16 was produced accompanied by the release of nh4 finally the intermediates namely 2 3 4 trioxobutanoic acid m12 in pathway i and 3 oxopentanedial m16 in pathway ii could be easily mineralized into co2 and h2o based on the above analysis it could be inferred that pyridine degradation pathway in rpho bio was quite different from those in rpho and rbio which could be contributed to the synergistic effect between the semiconductors and microbes eem fluorescence spectrum fig s3 of the effluent from rpho bio rbio and rpho showed substantial difference confirming the different pyridine degradation pathways in these three systems an apparent fluorophore the perk with the position at ex 280 nm em 300 310 nm recognized in region iv at the initial stage was related to pyridine in rpho this fluorophore still appeared in the effluent sampled after 48 h which was consistent with the poor performance of pyridine removal in rpho however higher intensity fluorescence was recognized in region i and iv for the effluent taken from rpho bio and rbio similar phenomenon was also observed in previous studies lu et al 2012b wu et al 2018 where the contents of aromatic proteins such as tyrosine and dissolved organic matters related microbial by products increased due to the biodegradation of organic matter the two perks in region i and iv remained high intensity fluorescence after 48 h because their corresponding dissolved organic matters were resistant to further biodegradation it was worth mentioning that rpho bio showed lower strength of fluorescence intensity in regions iv and v as compared to rbio indicating enhanced removal of intermediates in rpho bio which was consistent with significant toc removal in rpho bio 3 5 microbial community structure the diversity of microbial community on the semiconductor microbe interface in rpho bio was relatively low as compared to rbio and rpho bio dark probably due to the inhibition of specific microbial community by various reactive species such as superoxide radical anion o2 hydroxyl radical oh and photoholes h generated on semiconductor table s1 and text s1 in addition the selection of specific functional species in the specific environment would be another reason for the low diversity on the semiconductor microbe interface the microbial community structure in inocula sludge rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio was further analyzed at the phylum level text s2 and fig s4 and genus level fig 5 through high throughput sequencing as displayed in fig 5 rhodopseudomonas 17 04 paracoccus 16 16 and methyloversatilis 4 02 were dominant in inocula sludge in rbio rhodococcus 26 73 hydrogenophaga 6 04 and paracoccus 5 48 were found to be the dominant species in rpho bio dark species namely paracoccus 29 45 dokdonella 5 25 and desulfovibrio 5 22 were most dominant paracoccus has been reported to be an excellent pyridine degrader as well as a typical denitrifying bacterium bai et al 2008 sun et al 2011 found that rhodococcus was capable of degrading pyridine and phenol at the same time dokdonella was found to be the dominant species in granular activated carbon filters treating wastewater containing chlorinated hydrocarbons munro et al 2013 desulfovibrio was responsible for the reductive transformation of various oxidative contaminants such as coiiiedta blessing et al 2001 hydrogenophaga was also observed in an electricity assisted anaerobic system treating pyridine containing wastewater jiang et al 2018 however these species were not dominant in rpho bio demonstrating the substantial difference of community structure instead shewanella 29 81 bacillus 13 18 lysinibacillus 8 03 and tissierella 7 61 were found to be most dominant in rpho bio shewanella which was the most abundant in rpho bio was a well known electrochemically active species capable of utilizing various extracellular respiratory electron acceptors such as metal oxides and dimethyl sulfoxide heidelberg et al 2002 in addition shewanella could growth using pyridine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source mathur et al 2008 according to yao et al 2011 and uma and sandhya 1997 both bacillus and lysinibacillus were excellent pyridine degraders bacillus has also been reported to play an essential role in ammonia release during the biodegradation of nitrogen containing organic matter choi et al 2014 tissierella was reported to be capable of producing riboflavin as an extracellular electron shuttling compound which was rather beneficial for extracellular electron transfer eet fuller et al 2015 therefore it can be inferred that the species involved in pyridine biodegradation shewanella bacillus and lysinibacillus and electron transfer shewanella and tissierella could be efficiently enriched in rpho bio as compared to inocula sludge rbio and rpho bio dark system 3 6 importance of light excited photoholes various reactive species such as superoxide radical anion o2 hydroxyl radical oh and photoholes h could be produced by semiconductor under light irradiation after removing dissolved oxygen in rpho bio system pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency remained almost unchanged indicating that o2 was not the main reaction species responsible for pyridine degradation in rpho bio system fig 6 a besides this result also indicated that pyridine could be degraded in rpho bio system under strict anaerobic conditions very weak suppression on pyridine removal was observed after the addition of ipa as indicated by the slight decrease of pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency from 100 and 84 51 8 95 to 95 46 3 14 and 79 41 2 54 respectively indicating that limited oh was participated in pyridine degradation it was quite interesting that when met was added into rpho bio system pyridine degradation efficiency and nh4 n formation efficiency decreased significantly from 100 and 84 51 8 95 to 78 85 15 84 and 0 respectively this result indicated that the photoholes rather than oh were the main reactive species responsible for pyridine bio photodegradation ets activity was found to be an effective indicator for microorganism respiration and substrate removal potential in biological process yin et al 2018 in order to investigate the effect of photoholes on biological activity and electron transfer ets activity in rbio rpho bio dark and rpho bio system was assessed as shown in fig 6b ets activity of rpho bio was as high as 36 7 1 2 mg intf g tss h 1 which was significantly higher than those in rpho bio dark 19 4 1 3 mg intf g tss h 1 and rbio 16 5 0 3 mg intf g tss h 1 probably due to the enrichment of specific functional species involved in rpho bio as well as the relatively weak inhibition of reactive species such as photoholes the low ets activity in rbio and rpho bio dark could be attributed to the high toxicity and recalcitrance of pyridine which was consistent with the poor pyridine removal fig 2 as indicated in fig 5 the functional species related to both pyridine biodegradation and electron transfer increased significantly in rpho bio system which could be the main reason for the high ets activity in rpho bio system the efficient utilization of pyridine and its degradation intermediates in the microbial respiration chain under visible light irradiation catalyzed by bivo4 feooh cp would result in the improvement of ets activity in rpho bio system the low ets activity observed in rpho bio dark system confirmed that bivo4 feooh cp could not work for microorganisms without light therefore it could be inferred that the semiconductor microbe interface could accelerate the electron transfer and improve pyridine degradation electron transfer dynamics and the photogenerated charge separation was closely related to the degradation of various contaminants in photocatalysis system ding et al 2018 as indicated in fig 6c in both rpho and rpho bio photocurrent was immediately induced after illumination of visible light and the photocurrent declined when the illumination was stopped indicating the effectiveness of bivo4 feooh cp in visible light catalysis however the peak photocurrent density in rpho bio was around 23 µa cm 2 which was obviously higher than that in rpho about 15 µa cm 2 indicating the key role of microorganisms in electron generation and transfer it could be inferred that additional photogenerated carriers transfer pathway between the semiconductors and biofilms existed in rpho bio from eis analysis fig 6d it could be observed that the charge transfer resistances rct in rpho bio with and without visible light irradiation were 1 80 kω and 17 36 kω respectively which were obviously lower than those in rpho 4 77 kω and 23 32 kω indicating the effective separation of the photoelectron hole pairs and rapid transmission of photogenerated carriers at the semiconductor microbe interface the biofilm formed on bivo4 feooh cp would play an important role in both photogenerated carriers transfer and pyridine biodegradation as indicated in fig 1b the rough surface of bivo4 feooh cp could provide abundant space for the growth of microorganisms as shown in fig s5 after operation for 30 days dense biofilm could be observed on the surface of bivo4 feooh cp which was mainly consisted of micrococcus and rod shaped species the successful formation of biofilm on the semiconductor microbe interface demonstrated the excellent biocompatibility of bivo4 feooh nanocomposites the close combination of biofilm and bivo4 feooh nanocomposites would contribute to the accelerated photogenerated carriers transport the significantly improved ets activity and photoelectrochemical property at the semiconductor microbe interface in addition the biofilm could act as a protective barrier against the toxicity of pyridine for the microorganisms inside biomass retention especially for the slow growing species could be improved through the formation of biofilm at the semiconductor microbe interface 3 7 possible mechanism for enhanced pyridine bio photodegradation based on the above analysis a possible mechanism responsible for enhanced pyridine bio photodegradation was proposed fig 7 firstly the led lamp acted as an excitation source that could effectively excite bivo4 feooh nanocomposites resulting in the generation of photoelectron hole pairs secondly pyridine was firstly reduced to piperidine by photoelectrons generated at the semiconductor microbe interface which was revealed by pyridine degradation pathway thirdly the photoholes which were found to be the main reactive species in rpho bio could directly react with pyridine degradation intermediates such as piperidine to promote the degradation of pyridine similar phenomenon was also observed in a light driven geobacter sulfurreducens cds biohybrid system by huang et al 2019 where the intermediates produced in methyl orange degradation process could be oxidized as the sacrificial reagent by the photoholes from fig 6a it could be observed that photoholes was rather effective in nh4 n formation as compared to pyridine removal probably due to the fact that photoholes could not react directly with pyridine in our previous study it was also proven that electron acceptors such as nitrate played a vital role in pyridine biodegradation process shen et al 2015 based on the analysis of microbial community structure the species related to pyridine biodegradation and electron transfer were obviously enriched in rpho bio system the electrons produced in pyridine biodegradation process could be easily delivered to the electron acceptors such as photoholes by electron transfer related species qian et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 moreover the consumption of photoelectrons and photoholes at the semiconductor microbe interface suppressed the recombination of photoelectron and hole which was rather beneficial for pyridine degradation as a consequence significant improvement in pyridine removal was achieved at the semiconductor microbe interface showing great potential to be a cost effective technology for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing pyridine 4 conclusions pyridine removal performance at the bivo4 feooh semiconductor microbe interface under visible light was far more efficient than biodegradation only system and photolysis only system pyridine was firstly reduced by photoelectrons and then oxidized in the bio photodegradation process it was worth noting that photoholes played a crucial role in promoting pyridine mineralization on the semiconductor microbe interface the ets activity and electron transfer efficiency could be significantly improved due to the combination of the biofilms and semiconductors this study demonstrated that the bio photodegradation system would provide a promising and feasible alternative for the efficient treatment of wastewater containing recalcitrant pollutant such as pyridine declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

17503,sediment microbial communities are an important sink for both organic and inorganic nitrogen n with microphytobenthos mpb biomass making the largest contribution to short term n assimilation and retention coastal waters are increasingly subject to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment but the effect of nutrient enrichment on microbial assimilation processing and fate of mpb derived n mpb n remains poorly characterised in this study an mpb dominated microbial community was labeled in situ with a pulse of 15nh4 n laboratory core incubations of this labeled sediment under increasing nutrient concentrations nh4 and po4 3 ambient 2 ambient 5 ambient and 10 ambient were used to investigate changes in the processing and flux pathways of the 15n labeled mpb n across 10 5 d under nutrient enrichment short term retention of mpb n by mpb was stimulated by nutrient addition with higher 15n in mpb in the nutrient amended treatments 71 93 than in the ambient treatment 38 at 0 5 d after 10 5 d the nutrient amended treatments had increased turnover of mpb n out of mpb biomass into an uncharacterised pool of sediment on 45 75 increased turnover of mpb n likely resulted from decreased recycling of mpb n between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria as inorganic nutrients were preferentially used as an n source and remineralisation of sediment on decreased decreased breakdown of sediment on reduced the efflux of mpb n via don in the amended 3 9 5 2 versus the ambient treatment 10 9 exports of mpb n to the water column were relatively small accounting for a maximum of 14 of 15n exported from the sediment and were predominantly exported don and n2 denitrification overall there was considerable retention of mpb n over 10 5 d but increased nutrient loading shifted n from mpb biomass into other sediment on keywords 15n amino acid denitrification pulse chase intertidal flood 1 introduction estuaries have a considerable role in altering and processing terrestrial and riverine derived organic matter prior to export to the coastal oceans within shallow photic coastal settings much of the organic matter processing is mediated within the sediments by the microbial community bauer et al 2013 in benthic sediments microphytobenthos mpb contribute significantly to primary production and biomass by fixing carbon c and utilizing nitrogen n from the water column and porewater cook et al 2004a dalsgaard 2003 mcglathery et al 2007 coupling between mpb production and bacterial remineralisation within these sediments can result in strong retention of n and recycling of c heterotrophic bacteria utilize the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by mpb while mpb rely on inorganic sources or bacterially excreted nh4 from remineralisation of organic matter cook et al 2007 forehead et al 2013 the fate and processing of mpb derived c mpb c within sediments has been well described with studies quantifying the incorporation of mpb c into sediment organic matter and its loss from the sediment via efflux of primarily dissolved inorganic carbon dic with some dissolved organic carbon doc middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2001 oakes et al 2012 oakes and eyre 2014 2016 in contrast to mpb c the processing and fate of mpb derived n mpb n in coastal sediments is poorly understood mpb n is expected to be processed along the same pathways as mpb c but transfer of n will proceed at different rates according to the biological needs of the microbial community and stoichiometric limitation in comparison to c eyre et al 2016 two in situ studies have quantified mpb n processing and loss of n via effluxes of din don and n2 during tidal inundation and observed different outcomes for the fate of the initially incorporated 15n over 30 d eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 subtidal losses due to denitrification were considerably higher than intertidal losses as processing of mpb n provided substrates for denitrifying bacteria eyre et al 2016 while intense competition from mpb for n resulted in considerable retention of mpb n within intertidal sediments oakes et al 2020 in both studies mpb dominated the uptake of 15n initially but only remained the dominant reservoir for mpb n within sediment organic matter in subtidal sediments in intertidal sediments mpb and uncharacterised material 15n contained in sediment on that is not incorporated into microbial biomass contained comparable amounts of mpb n after 31 days due to increased turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised sediment organic matter increased turnover into the uncharacterised pool between these two studies may indicate quicker turnover of newly assimilated mpb n into sediment on in settings where mpb outcompete ammonia oxidizing bacteria for n substrates risgaard petersen et al 2004 coastal waters are increasingly subject to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment howarth and marino 2006 which alters biogeochemical pathways and can cause eutrophication within otherwise healthy estuaries howarth and marino 2006 rabalais et al 2009 within intertidal sediments increased availability of inorganic nutrients from anthropogenic sources is expected to alter the processing of mpb n as the microbial community responds to an additional source of n that was previously in limited supply cook et al 2007 efflux of n as din or n2 occurs as the net result of mineralisation and competition between mpb heterotrophic bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria for uptake of available nh4 in n limited settings strong competition for nutrients arising from bacterial remineralisation of sediment on results in strong retention of remineralised mpb n within sediment organic matter om compartments mpb bacteria and uncharacterised fig 1 a and little n is available for export via din or the coupled nitrification denitrification pathways cook et al 2004b 2007 mcglathery et al 2007 sundback et al 2000 with additional nutrient inputs increased mpb productivity has been observed coinciding with decreasing efflux of din and n2 to the water column dalsgaard 2003 ferguson and eyre 2013 ferguson et al 2004 few studies have examined how increased n availability in the water column alters the processing and fate of mpb n within shallow photic coastal settings a laboratory study partitioned the algal and bacterial contribution to uptake of 15n within the sediment microbial community through the use a biomarker technique d l alanine and found that the addition of nutrients nh4 si oh 4 hpo4 increased mpb incorporation of 15n and decreased competition for inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria cook et al 2007 fig 1b however cook et al 2007 did not quantify water column efflux of din don or n2 in this 15n pulse chase study we aimed to quantify changes in the processing and fate of mpb n within subtropical intertidal sediments due to increased water column nutrient availability pathways considered included transfer of mpb n through sediment on compartments mpb bacteria and uncharacterised and export via efflux of nh4 don and n2 to the overlying water column we expected decreased remineralisation re capture and recycling of processed mpb n through the sediment compartments as introduced inorganic nutrients were preferentially utilised by the microbial community utilization of inorganic nutrients by the microbial community could result in either increased retention of mpb n within the uncharacterised sediment organic matter pool due to decreased utilization of mpb n by both mpb and bacteria or increased mpb n export as mpb n is effluxed to the water column as don without being re captured and remineralised the resulting decreased remineralisation of mpb n within the microbial community should decrease the export of 15n via efflux of nh4 don and n2 and result in increased sediment retention of mpb n within n replete treatments fig 1b 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site was a subtropical intertidal shoal 2 km upstream of the mouth of the richmond river estuary in new south wales australia 28 52 30 s 153 33 26 e that was simultaneously used for a 13c pulse chase study riekenberg et al 2018 the 6900 km2 richmond river catchment has a mean annual rainfall of 1300 mm mckee et al 2000 and an average flow rate of 2200 ml d 1 daily gauged flow adjusted for catchment area averaged over years for which data was available 1970 2013 although the richmond river estuary has highly variable flushing salinity and nutrient concentrations associated with frequent episodic rainfall events and flooding eyre 1997 mckee et al 2000 this study was undertaken during a period of average rainfall 200 mm in the month prior the site experiences semidiurnal tides with a range of 2 m samples were collected in january 2015 summer with average site water temperature of 25 6 2 3 c 2 2 experimental overview an in situ application of 15n 99 nh4 was used to introduce a pulse of 15n labeled mpb n into sediment unincorporated 15n was flushed from the sediment during the next tidal inundation of the site sediment cores were then collected and incubated in the laboratory under four nutrient enrichment scenarios ambient minimal moderate and elevated using pulsed nutrient additions in situ label application and uptake into the microbial community followed with laboratory incubation of cores allowed for explicit control of nutrient additions and their effect on the fate and processing of the pulse of mpb n over 10 5 d this time period was chosen based on previous work that has indicated that the majority of microbial processing of mpb derived c and n occurs within 10 to 15 d of initial uptake within benthic sediment under photic conditions eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 sediments remained inundated during incubation to minimize loss of mpb n through physical processes as we were primarily interested in biological sediment processing and previous studies have shown that physical loss processes can have an important seasonal role in the processing of mpb n nielsen et al 2017 2 3 15n labeling an experimental plot 2 m2 of bare sediment free of large animal burrows was labeled with 15n 99 15nh4 when sediments were initially exposed during the ebbing tide in the middle of the day to ensure even application the plot was divided into 400 cm2 subplots and a 20 ml aliquot of 40 µmol 15nh4 solution was sprayed onto each subplot using motorized sprayers this gave a label application rate of 2 mmol 15nh4 m 2 the labeled solution was prepared with nacl amended milli q to match site salinity 34 6 assimilation of 15n by the sediment community occurred during the 4 h prior to tidal inundation tidal inundation and flushing then removed unincorporated 15n predominately through dilution and physical removal 15n remaining in the sediment that was not taken up by the microbial community or adsorbed to sediment grains as confirmed by measurement of 90 3 removal of 15n from the initial application in 0 10 cm from non kcl extracted sediment on between treatment application and core removal 2 4 sample collection prior to application of 15n 3 cores 9 cm diameter 20 cm depth were collected immediately adjacent to the treatment plot and were immediately extruded and sectioned 0 2 cm 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm to provide unlabeled control samples for sediment on δ15n at the next low tide 11 h after label application 43 sediment cores were collected from the labeled plot using clear acrylic core liners 9 cm diameter 47 cm height immediately three cores were extruded and sectioned as described above the sediment samples were placed into plastic bags transported to the laboratory on ice stored frozen in the dark 20 c and were later used to determine initial 15n uptake grain size distribution across sediment depths and chlorophyll α chl a concentration within 0 1 cm sediments the 40 remaining core liners were sealed with acrylic bottom plates and transported to the laboratory for incubation within 2 h of sampling site water 400 l was collected and transported to the laboratory for use during incubations 2 5 nutrient amendment sediment cores were incubated in the laboratory with a range of nutrient concentrations in the overlying water that were below the sediment capacity for uptake incubation tanks 85 l volume each containing ten randomly assigned cores from the application plots were established with nutrients at ambient concentration site water din of 2 5 0 04 µmol n l 1 tp 0 9 0 09 µmol p l 1 measured on incoming tide and with n nh4 and p h3po4 amendments to site water at 2 minimal treatment 5 moderate treatment and 10 elevated treatment average water column concentrations near the study site 4 µmol l 1 nh4 and 5 µmol l 1 po4 3 eyre 2000 nutrient amendments were added to the incubation tanks and to bags of replacement water an hour prior to cores being transferred into treatment tanks for incubation two additional identical amendments of nh4 were added to the incubation tanks at the respective treatment concentrations after sampling at 1 5 d and 3 5 d of incubation to maintain treatment applications of nh4 supplementary fig 1 these additions were designed to maintain increased din availability to the microbial community without developing secondary limitation for p or si that would limit uptake of din into the diatom dominated mpb community the lower than expected water column values for din observed throughout the experiment indicate that uptake of the nh4 applications occurred quickly and nh4 was readily removed from the water column by the benthic microbial community within 24 h of additions processing of nh4 varied between treatments likely as a result of the variability in the microbial community present in each core but there was no significant accumulation of din within treatment tank waters the equimolar application of nutrients was equivalent to 2 5 the trigger concentration for increased trophic status under the australian and new zealand environment conservation council guidelines anzecc 2018 an addition of sodium metasilicate na2sio3 17 µmol si l 1 was also added to all incubation tanks at the end of the 2 5 d of incubation to prevent secondary limitation of si 2 6 benthic flux incubations in the laboratory cores were fitted with magnetic stir bars positioned 10 cm above the sediment surface filled with 2 l of site water and randomly allocated to one of the four treatment tanks ambient minimal moderate elevated ten cores per treatment water within treatment tanks and cores was continuously recirculated held at in situ temperature 25 1 c using a temperature controller and aerated cores were stirred at a rate below the threshold for sediment resuspension ferguson et al 2003

allowed to acclimate in the treatment tanks for 6 h prior to the start of incubation allowing sediment microhabitats and any disturbed redox conditions to re establish cores remained open to the tank water until 30 min before sampling when clear plexiglas lids were fitted to each core liner to seal in overlying water within the core for the duration of the incubation 16 h on each sampling occasion 8 cores 2 per treatment at 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 10 5 d were sampled for dissolved oxygen 0 01 mg l and temperature 0 01 c using a hach hq40d multi parameter meter via a sampling port in the core lid for each sampling period measurements were made at three time points initial dark end light start and light end to allow dark light and net flux calculations initial samples were taken 30 min after closure of the lids dark end light start samples were taken after 12 h incubation with no light and light end samples were taken 3 h after illumination at the end of the dark sampling at each initial dark end light start and light end sampling duplicate samples for n2 ar analysis were collected by allowing water from suspended replacement water bags to gently displace sample water out of the core via tubing into 7 ml gastight glass stoppered glass vials these vials were allowed to overflow by 2 3 vol killed with 20 µl of saturated hgcl2 and stored submerged at ambient temperature to determine nh4 no3 and don concentrations and δ15n values sample water was syringe filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate into 10 ml and 50 ml polyethylene vials leaving a headspace and stored frozen 20 c to determine δ15n values for n2 sample water was filtered 0 45 µm cellulose acetate into a 20 ml glass vial containing 500 µl of 2 m naoh these samples were sealed without headspace using a lid containing a teflon coated septum and refrigerated for storage after completion of the dark light flux incubation cores were sacrificed and sediment was extruded and sectioned top scrape 0 2 2 cm 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm depths a subsample 1 cm3 of sediment was taken for chl α analysis from the 0 1 cm depth prior to sectioning of the 0 2 cm layer using a spatula and placed in a 10 ml centrifuge vial containing 5 ml of 90 acetone sediment samples were placed in ziplock bags and stored in the dark at 20 c until analysis 2 7 sample analysis a portion of each sediment sample was freeze dried and kcl extracted 2 m kcl for analysis of concentration and δ15n of sediment on both kcl extracted and non amended sediment samples were dried 60 c and weighed into tin capsules for analysis of δ15n and n using a flash elemental analyzer coupled on line to a thermo fisher delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms reproducibility of δ15n values for samples with δ15n enrichment 100 was 0 2 precision decreased with enrichment beyond 100 additional freeze dried sediment was analyzed for d and l alanine concentration and δ15n to determine the relative contribution to uptake of 15n by both mpb and bacteria concentrations for don nh4 and no3 were determined through colorimetric analysis on a four channel flow injection analyser fia lachat quickchem 8000 eyre et al 2011 eyre and pont 2003 don was quantified via measurement of total nitrogen tn through flow injection analysis using persulfate digestion valderrama 1981 and subsequent subtraction of din nh4 no3 no2 concentrations lachat 1994 prior to analysis vials for n2 analysis had 4 ml of water displaced with a helium headspace and were held at ambient temperature n2 concentrations were analysed using n2 ar measured with a membrane inlet mass spectrometer with o2 removal eyre et al 2002 δ15n2 values were determined using the he headspace in n2 samples analyzed via gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry using a thermo trace ultra gas chromatograph coupled to a delta v plus irms via a thermo conflo iii interface detailed description of δ15n determination for nh4 and no3 is included in supplement 1 in supplementary materials the relative contribution of mpb and bacteria to 15n uptake and transfer was determined through compound specific analysis of d and l alanine following acid hydrolysis and extraction of total hydrolysable amino acids from 7 g of freeze dried sediment following methods described in riekenberg et al 2017 due to the laborious extraction process concentrations and δ15n values from single replicates from the 0 2 2 2 5 and 5 10 cm depths per sampling time were determined via gas chromatography combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry on a hp 6890 gc interfaced via a thermo conflo iii interfaced with a thermo delta v plus irms using the column and ramp schedule described in eyre et al 2016 detailed description of the calculations for sediment on and microbial biomass for mpb and heterotrophic bacteria calculations for excess fluxes for nh4 don and n2 and the statistical analyses that support this analysis are included in supplements 2 4 in supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 sediment characteristics sediment at depths of 0 2 cm 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm was dominated by fine sand 66 73 and sediment across 0 10 cm had an organic n content of 1 2 0 1 mol n

al 2017 2018 foraminifera were not considered in the current study as they have previously been found to make a minimal contribution to uptake of mpb n 1 in sediments in the adjacent brunswick estuary

similarly low for all treatments across sampling times p 0 1 in all comparisons uptake of 15n into microbial biomass mpb and bacteria accounted for 22 95 of the total 15n incorporated into sediment on across all treatments and sampling times fig 3 initially 15n retained 0 5 d in mpb during the incubation was higher in the elevated treatment one way anova f 3 7 6 9 p 0 046 minimal 71 21 moderate 75

moderate treatments falling intermediate between them this indicates that initial retention of mpb n was stimulated by increased nutrient availability and this assimilated 15n remained in mpb at 0 5 d within the microbial community after 0 5 d distribution of 15n continued to be dominated by mpb for all treatments ambient 83 3 minimal 79 4 moderate 74 2 elevated 75 5 fig 4 bacterial contribution to

across the incubation period in nutrient amended treatments two way anova f 2 15 0 1 p 0 9 3 3 loss of 15n from sediments there was relatively little efflux of 15n from the sediment to the water column in this study with loss pathways accounting for a maximum of 14 of the initially incorporated 15n across treatments fig 2 across all treatments most of this loss to the water column occurred in the form of don and n2 fluxes fig 5 with only a minor contribution from din nh4 maximum of 0 3 within the ambient treatment don was the largest export pathway accounting for loss over 10 5 d of 10 5 of the initially incorporated 15n figs 5 6 loss of 15n from the sediments via don effluxes was lower within the nutrient amended treatments minimal 4 8 moderate 5 2 elevated 5 2 but was not statistically significant export of 15n via n2 was comparably low between ambient minimal and elevated treatments 3 3 2 8 and 2 3 respectively but was higher in the moderate treatment 7 1 figs 4 6 overall export via combined efflux pathways was low across all treatments with the bulk of mpb n remaining within the sediment by 10 5 d ambient 86 4 minimal 90 2 moderate 88 2 and elevated 94 3 fig 6 the majority of 15n remaining in the sediment was found in the 0 2 cm depth for all treatments ambient 70 minimal 63 moderate 69 and elevated 80 fig 2 while 15n incorporation remained lower for depths below 2 cm ambient 16 minimal 27 moderate 18 and elevated 14 4 discussion by combining a pulse chase application of the rare isotope 15n with the d l ala biomarker technique we identified that increased nutrient availability as a pulsed addition of 5 to 50 µmol l 1 nh4 across three treatments 1 stimulated initial retention of mpb n within mpb 2 increased microbial turnover of mpb n into the uncharacterised sediment on compartment as incubations progressed and 3 decreased the amount of mpb n lost via don effluxes by the end of the incubation 10 5 d 86 94 of the 15n incorporated remained in the sediment with 3 9 10 9 effluxed as don 2 3 7 1 effluxed as n2 and less than 1 effluxed as nh4 fig 6 of the 15n contained in the sediment 12 40 was in mpb 6 15 was in bacteria and the remaining 45 75 within uncharacterised sediment on fig 6 this study tracks the fate and processing of a pulse of mpb n produced in situ under an increasing gradient of water column nutrient availability 4 1 initial incorporation and downward transfer of 15n initial retention of 15n into microbial biomass was dominated by mpb across all treatments as has been observed previously at this site riekenberg et al 2017 and was stimulated by increased nutrient availability ambient 53 versus 84 95 nutrient amended treatments 0 5 d fig 4 retention of mpb n may have resulted from decoupling of bacterial processing from mpb production with heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilizing inorganic nutrients in lieu of mpb n in the nutrient amended treatments resource switching by heterotrophic bacteria is further supported by decreased initial mpb n turnover into uncharacterised on considerable turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised on occurred in the ambient treatment 47 3 0 5 d but was significantly lower in the nutrient amended treatments 5 16 t 3 8 p 0 009 fig 3 the uncharacterised pool represents 15n within bulk sediment om that was not accounted for by 15n contained within microbial biomass this pool is composed of 15n containing compounds such as eps enzymes and om derived from the remineralisation of mpb n increased breakdown and initial transfer of mpb n into the uncharacterised pool is consistent with bacterial utilization of mpb n during remineralisation that resulted in increased initial turnover in low nutrient settings fig 3 increased coupling between mpb and bacteria in low nutrient settings cook et al 2007 oakes et al 2012 has previously been attributed to increased reliance on the limited nutrients arising from bacterial remineralisation of sediment on ratios of microbial biomass 13c 15n were estimated based on excess 13c incorporation determined in a complementary study riekenberg et al 2018 13c 15n ratios potentially over estimate relative uptake of 15n into the microbial community as phospholipid fatty acid analysis only accounts for 13c contained in living biomass and d l ala accounts for 15n in both living and dead biomass particularly as incubations progress therefore 13c 15n ratios for microbial biomass were only examined during the initial sampling 0 5 d the 13c 15n ratio in the ambient treatment 16 7 2 8 was considerably higher than in nutrient amended treatments minimal 8 3 3 8 moderate 5 2 3 4 and elevated 7 5 2 one way anova f 3 7 5 4 p 0 068 and aligns well with previous estimates where preferential excretion of fixed c as eps would occur due to n limitation within algal cells e g 20 van den meersche et al 2004 a lower 13c 15n ratio within nutrient amended treatments indicates uptake occurring at a ratio closer to the redfield ratio expected for algal uptake 6 7 as a result of increased n availability cook et al 2007 bacteria under n replete conditions utilize inorganic nutrients to support production of low c n biomass regardless of the c n ratio of the substrate being processed to produce that biomass goldman and dennett 2000 shifting retention of mpb n between sediment compartments due to nutrient amendment indicates changed short term processing of recently fixed organic matter and was observed despite considerable time having elapsed prior to incubation 18 h allowing for flushing of tracer and core acclimation over 10 5 d the majority 81 of 15n incorporated into the sediment was recovered from the 0 2 cm depth but deeper sediment layer incorporation occurred rapidly within 0 5 d fig 2 resulting in a transport rate of 2 7 4 4 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 downward transport was substantially lower than previously observed at this site e g 19 6 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 over 1 5 d oakes et al 2020 likely driven by the draining and re filling of cores to simulate intertidal conditions in that study downward transport for 15n in this study is similar to that observed for mpb n in subtropical subtidal sediments e g 2 7 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 over 3 d with ambient din of 8 µmoll 1 eyre et al 2016 but represent a smaller portion of the total incorporated 15n 8 3 16 4 compared to 29 similar downward transport for mpb n between the two studies likely reflect comparable downward migration by mpb within subtropical sands saburova and polikarpov 2003 incorporation of 15n into 2 10 cm depth increased slowly thereafter and resulted in higher downward transport in the nutrient amended treatments as the incubations progressed average over 3 5 10 5 d ambient 15 6 2 0 minimal 22 6 2 8 moderate 23 6 2 7 and elevated 21 2 2 0 fig 2 downward migration of mpb can be enhanced by light stress underwood 2002 but given that light intensity was consistent across treatments increased downward transfer of mpb n within nutrient amended treatments more likely reflects increased downward migration for nutrients and cell division as water column nutrients quickly became limiting later in the incubations saburova and polikarpov 2003 4 2 transfer of mpb n within sediments transfer and processing of mpb n between sediment compartments within sediment on decreased between the ambient and nutrient amended treatments due to decreased bacterial remineralization of mpb n reducing recycling and transfer of mpb n between sediment compartments fig 3 across 10 5 d the ambient treatments contribution of mpb to 15n within microbial biomass increased 77 90 bacterial contributions declined 23 to 10 fig 4 and the uncharacterised pool of 15n contributed considerably to the excess 15n in sediment on 23 61 fig 3 these combined factors indicate mpb n was efficiently recycled when nutrients are relatively scarce bacteria in the ambient treatment re mineralised mpb n within the uncharacterised pool fig 1a providing inorganic nutrients that were increasingly used by mpb as they competed for available nutrients under nutrient limitation cook et al 2007 in contrast across 10 5 d in the nutrient amended treatments tight recycling of nutrients from bacterial remineralisation decreased as bacteria preferentially utilised inorganic nutrients instead of degrading organic matter for n this switch resulted in accumulation of 15n within sediment on as mpb n was not remineralised and remained unavailable for recycling back into mpb with increased nutrient loading mpb contributions to 15n within microbial biomass declined bacterial contributions increased fig 3 and resulted in increased 15n contained in the uncharacterised pool minimal 41 47 moderate 29 75 elevated 23 70 fig 3 accumulation of 15n in uncharacterised sediment on reflects decreased recycling of mpb n contained in om likely as eps and detritus mpb and bacterial biomass as bacteria preferentially utilised inorganic nutrients instead of mpb n within the uncharacterised pool fig 1b 4 3 effluxes of mpb n export of 15n from the sediments to the water column occurred via fluxes of don n2 and nh4 figs 2 6 fluxes of nh4 from remineralisation 0 0 3 contributed little to exported 15n across all treatments indicating strong retention of nutrients arising from mpb n remineralisation retention of n from remineralization is expected as competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria for n has been previously observed under nutrient limiting settings agogue et al 2014 risgaard petersen et al 2004 limited export of 15n as nh4 across all treatments suggests that the microbial community maintained capacity for further n uptake throughout the incubations cumulative flux of nh4 in this study was considerably smaller than observed in subtropical subtidal sediments over 33 d 20 8 eyre et al 2016 but similar to previous observations for this site across 31 d 0 2 oakes et al 2020 similar nh4 fluxes between studies at this site likely result from decreased bacterial remineralisation of sediment on and increased retention of mpb n in comparison to subtidal processing from increased competition between heterotrophic bacteria and mpb for available n low fluxes of n2 may be caused by competition for inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria intense competition for recycled inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria would have starved both ammonia oxidizing and subsequently denitrifying bacteria of substrates mcglathery et al 2007 sundbäck and miles 2002 and reduced n2 efflux from denitrification 2 3 7 1 10 5 d fig 6 this finding is comparable with previously reported denitrification rates for this site 2 6 by 31 d oakes et al 2020 and suggests that competition from mpb for nh4 was similarly limiting during that period as ambient nh4 was higher in oakes et al 2020 2 1 1 8 µmoll 1 than in this study 0 9 0 1 µmoll 1 limited availability of substrates for denitrification was maintained as intense competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria for nh4 occurred starving ammonia oxidizers that produce no3 substrate limitation helps to explain the low percentage for n2 efflux observed in this study versus the higher rates found in subtropical subtidal sediments 20 7 eyre et al 2016 enhanced efflux of mpb n as both n2 and nh4 in a subtidal setting suggests that increased remineralisation produced inorganic nutrients sufficient to overcome the n limitation from mpb in the moderate treatment denitrification bacterial incorporation of mpb n and the flux of nh4 were higher by 10 5 d indicating that competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria did not limit substrate availability for denitrification both moderate and elevated treatments provide examples of decreased competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria that resulted in increased turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised sediment om between these treatments only the moderate had increased denitrification indicating that changed processing between the sediment compartments may occur with or without considerably increased denitrification as a symptom increased inorganic nutrient availability decreased bacterial remineralisation as inorganic nutrients were preferentially utilised instead of sediment on fig 1b in the ambient treatment efflux of mpb n via don accounted for 10 of the 15n assimilated within the system and is evidence of increased remineralisation hydrolysis of freshly deposited material ferguson et al 2004 glud et al 2008 and export of mpb n from the uncharacterised pool within sediment on with nutrient amendment export of mpb n via don decreased to 3 9 5 2 fig 6 despite enhanced mpb n retention at 0 5 d and the equal or increased presence of 15n within the uncharacterised pool within the nutrient amended treatments decreased export of mpb n via don likely occurred due to added din being preferentially used by heterotrophic bacteria instead of sediment on via remineralisation 4 4 retention of mpb n mpb have a considerable role in regulating processing of nutrients within shallow unvegetated benthic settings through primary production and n uptake ferguson and eyre 2013 ferguson et al 2004 mcglathery et al 2007 nielsen et al 2017 sundbäck and miles 2002 newly assimilated n is considered to be retained within mpb biomass with increased mpb biomass resulting in reduced n efflux from sediments sundbäck et al 2006 excluding eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 and veuger et al 2007 the chiral forms of alanine have not been used to partition sediment on into mpb and bacterial compartments as well as processed mpb n remaining in sediment on partitioning the uncharacterised pool within sediment on reveals that much of the initially assimilated mpb n is transferred there presumably via excretion of eps by mpb and turnover of microbial cellular material under nutrient limiting conditions this material is quickly remineralised by bacteria releasing 15nh4 that is then recycled as mpb and bacteria compete for available nutrients fig 1a under ambient conditions this coupling resulted in efficient bacterial remineralisation and recycling of mpb n resulting in turnover of 15n among all the sediment compartments effluxes of din or n2 were not stimulated by the altered processing of mpb n in sediment on which differs greatly from our stated hypothesis sediment retention of mpb n was somewhat reduced by increased efflux of don through increased hydrolysis and bacterial remineralisation of freshly deposited mpb n with added nutrient amendments hydrolysis and bacterial remineralisation of mpb n slowed resulting in reduced processing and accumulation of mpb n within sediment on and decreased 15n export via don efflux these changes caused decreased retention of mpb n in mpb and increased turnover into sediment on under nutrient amendment retained mpb n occurred largely outside of the microbial biomass within the uncharacterised sediment on pool i e retained as eps and other n containing molecules this is in stark contrast to previous findings that mpb n is predominately strongly retained in mpb biomass eyre et al 2016 nielsen et al 2017 and reflects the considerable turnover of mpb n within this system 5 conclusion the microbial community is an important sink for organic and inorganic n within benthic coastal settings ferguson et al 2004 mcglathery et al 2007 thornton et al 2002 uptake of n is typically viewed as being mpb dominated with n retained in mpb biomass evrard et al 2008 hardison et al 2011 sundbäck et al 2006 veuger et al 2007 unless grazing causes trophic transfer of mpb n eyre and ferguson 2002 2005 addition of inorganic nutrients appears to initially stimulate n retention in mpb but then causes reduced bacterial remineralisation and recycling of remineralised mpb n as inorganic nutrients are preferentially utilised this leads to decreased mpb n retention within mpb biomass greater accumulation of mpb n within sediment on as uncharacterised material and corresponds with decreased efflux of mpb n as don uncharacterised material is a mixture of eps enzymes and other n bearing om that is either associated with the microbial biofilm and is fairly resistant to breakdown and export or has accumulated due to the low physical transport processes associated with this study either way turnover of mpb n between the sediment compartments has decreased and is no longer strongly retained within mpb biomass these changes resulted in increased accumulation of relatively labile mpb n in the shallow surface sediments that may stimulate long term support of increased bacterial respiration increased accumulation of newly assimilated om in the sediment occurred with short lived pulses of nutrients within shallow mpb dominated sediments and occurred under nutrient replete settings regardless of whether denitrification of 15n increased this indicates that short term pulses of nutrients into coastal ecosystems can result in considerable accumulation of newly assimilated om regardless of whether n2 export is

nutrient concentrations nh4 and po4 3 ambient 2 ambient 5 ambient and 10 ambient were used to investigate changes in the processing and flux pathways of the 15n labeled mpb n across 10 5 d under nutrient enrichment short term retention of mpb n by mpb was stimulated by nutrient addition with higher 15n in mpb in the nutrient amended treatments 71 93 than in the ambient treatment 38 at 0 5 d after 10 5 d the nutrient amended treatments had increased turnover of mpb n out of mpb biomass into an uncharacterised pool of sediment on 45 75 increased turnover of mpb n likely resulted from decreased recycling of mpb n between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria as inorganic nutrients were preferentially used as an n source and remineralisation of sediment on decreased decreased breakdown of sediment on reduced the efflux of mpb n via don in the amended 3 9 5 2 versus the ambient treatment 10 9 exports of mpb n to the water column were relatively small accounting for a maximum of 14 of 15n exported from the sediment and were predominantly exported don and n2 denitrification overall there was considerable retention of mpb n over 10 5 d but increased nutrient loading shifted n from

riverine derived organic matter prior to export to the coastal oceans within shallow photic coastal settings much of the organic matter processing is mediated within the sediments by the microbial community bauer et al 2013 in benthic sediments microphytobenthos mpb contribute significantly to primary production and biomass by fixing carbon c and utilizing nitrogen n from the water column and porewater cook et al 2004a dalsgaard 2003 mcglathery et al 2007 coupling between mpb production and bacterial remineralisation within these sediments can result in strong retention of n and recycling

cook et al 2007 forehead et al 2013 the fate and processing of mpb derived c mpb c within sediments has been well described with studies quantifying the incorporation of mpb c into sediment organic matter and its loss from the sediment via efflux of primarily dissolved inorganic carbon dic with some dissolved organic carbon doc middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2001 oakes et al 2012 oakes and eyre 2014 2016 in contrast to mpb c the processing and fate of mpb derived n mpb n in coastal sediments is poorly understood mpb n is expected to be processed along the same pathways as mpb c but transfer of n will proceed at different rates according to the biological needs of the microbial community and stoichiometric limitation in comparison to c eyre et al 2016 two in situ studies have quantified mpb n processing and loss of n via effluxes of din don and n2 during tidal inundation and observed different outcomes for the fate of the initially incorporated 15n over 30 d eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 subtidal losses due to denitrification were considerably higher than intertidal losses as processing of mpb n provided substrates for denitrifying bacteria eyre et al 2016 while intense competition from mpb for n resulted in considerable retention of mpb n within intertidal sediments oakes et al 2020 in both studies mpb dominated the uptake of 15n initially but only remained the dominant reservoir for mpb n within sediment organic matter in subtidal sediments in intertidal sediments mpb and uncharacterised material 15n contained in sediment on that is not incorporated into microbial biomass contained comparable amounts of mpb n after 31 days due to increased turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised sediment organic matter increased turnover into the uncharacterised pool between these two studies may indicate quicker turnover of newly assimilated mpb n into sediment on in settings where mpb outcompete ammonia oxidizing bacteria for n substrates risgaard petersen et al 2004 coastal waters are increasingly subject to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment howarth and marino 2006 which alters biogeochemical pathways and can cause eutrophication within otherwise healthy estuaries howarth and marino 2006 rabalais et al 2009 within intertidal sediments increased availability of inorganic nutrients from anthropogenic sources is expected to alter the processing of mpb n as the microbial community responds to an additional source of n that was previously in limited supply cook et al 2007 efflux of n as din or n2 occurs as the net result of mineralisation and competition between mpb heterotrophic bacteria and ammonia oxidizing bacteria for uptake of available nh4 in n limited settings strong competition for nutrients arising from bacterial remineralisation

coinciding with decreasing efflux of din and n2 to the water column dalsgaard 2003 ferguson and eyre 2013 ferguson et al 2004 few studies have examined how increased n availability in the water column

community through the use a biomarker technique d l alanine and found that the addition of nutrients nh4 si oh 4 hpo4 increased mpb incorporation of 15n and decreased competition for inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria cook et al 2007 fig 1b however cook et al 2007 did not quantify water column efflux of din don or n2 in this 15n pulse chase study we aimed to quantify changes in the processing and fate of mpb n within subtropical intertidal sediments due to increased water column nutrient availability pathways considered included transfer of mpb n through sediment on compartments mpb bacteria and uncharacterised and export via efflux of nh4 don and n2 to the overlying water column we expected decreased remineralisation re capture and recycling of processed mpb n through the sediment compartments as introduced inorganic nutrients were preferentially utilised by the microbial community utilization of inorganic nutrients by the microbial community could result in either increased retention of mpb n within the uncharacterised sediment organic matter pool due to decreased utilization of mpb n by both mpb and bacteria or increased mpb n export as mpb n is effluxed to the water column as don without being re captured and remineralised the resulting decreased remineralisation of mpb n within the microbial community should decrease the export of 15n via efflux of nh4 don and n2 and result in increased sediment retention of mpb n within n replete treatments fig 1b 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site was a subtropical intertidal shoal 2 km upstream

available 1970 2013 although the richmond river estuary has highly variable flushing salinity and nutrient concentrations associated with frequent episodic rainfall events and flooding eyre 1997 mckee et al 2000 this study was undertaken during a period of average rainfall 200 mm in the month prior the site experiences semidiurnal tides with a range of 2 m samples were collected in january 2015 summer with average site water temperature of 25 6 2 3 c 2 2 experimental overview an in situ application of 15n 99 nh4 was used to introduce a pulse of 15n labeled mpb n into sediment unincorporated 15n was flushed from the sediment during the next tidal inundation of the site sediment cores were then collected and incubated in the laboratory under four nutrient enrichment scenarios ambient minimal moderate and elevated using pulsed nutrient additions in situ label application and uptake into the microbial community followed with laboratory incubation of cores allowed for explicit control of nutrient additions and their effect on the fate and processing of the pulse of mpb n over 10 5 d this time period was chosen based on previous work that has indicated that the majority of microbial processing of mpb derived c and n occurs within 10 to 15 d of initial uptake within benthic sediment under photic conditions eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 sediments remained inundated during incubation to minimize loss of mpb n through physical processes as we were primarily interested in biological sediment processing and previous studies have shown that physical loss processes can have an important seasonal role in the processing of mpb n nielsen et al 2017 2 3 15n labeling an experimental plot 2 m2 of bare sediment free of large animal burrows was labeled with 15n 99 15nh4 when sediments were initially exposed during the ebbing tide in the middle of the day to ensure even application the plot was divided into 400 cm2 subplots and a 20 ml aliquot of 40 µmol 15nh4 solution was sprayed onto each subplot using motorized sprayers this gave a label application rate of 2 mmol 15nh4 m 2 the labeled solution was prepared with nacl amended milli q to match site salinity 34 6 assimilation of 15n by the sediment community occurred during the 4 h prior to tidal inundation tidal inundation and flushing then removed unincorporated 15n predominately through dilution and physical removal 15n remaining in the sediment that was not taken up by the microbial community or adsorbed to sediment grains as confirmed by measurement of 90 3 removal of 15n from the initial application in 0 10 cm from non kcl extracted sediment on between treatment application and core removal 2 4 sample collection prior to application of 15n 3 cores 9 cm diameter 20 cm depth

low tide 11 h after label application 43 sediment cores were collected from the labeled plot using clear acrylic core liners 9 cm diameter 47 cm height immediately three cores were extruded and sectioned as described above the sediment samples were placed into plastic bags transported to the laboratory on ice stored frozen in the dark 20 c and were later used to determine initial 15n uptake

nutrient amendments were added to the incubation tanks and to bags of replacement water an hour prior to cores being transferred into treatment tanks for incubation two additional identical amendments of nh4 were added to the incubation tanks at the respective treatment concentrations after sampling at 1 5 d and 3 5 d of incubation to maintain treatment applications of nh4 supplementary fig 1 these additions were designed to maintain increased din availability to the microbial community without developing secondary limitation for p or si that would limit uptake of din into the diatom dominated mpb community the lower than expected water column values for din observed throughout the experiment indicate that uptake of the nh4 applications occurred quickly and nh4 was readily removed from the water column by the benthic microbial community within 24 h of additions processing of nh4 varied between treatments likely as a result of the variability in the microbial community present in each core but there was no significant accumulation of din within treatment tank waters the equimolar application of nutrients was equivalent to 2 5 the trigger concentration for increased trophic status under the australian and new zealand environment conservation council guidelines anzecc 2018 an addition of sodium metasilicate na2sio3 17 µmol si l 1 was also added to all incubation tanks at the end of the 2 5 d of incubation to prevent secondary limitation of si 2 6 benthic flux incubations in the laboratory cores were fitted with magnetic stir bars positioned 10 cm above the sediment surface

allowed to acclimate in the treatment tanks for 6 h prior to the start of incubation allowing sediment microhabitats and any disturbed redox conditions to re establish cores remained open to the tank

8 cores 2 per treatment at 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 10 5 d were sampled for dissolved oxygen 0 01 mg l and temperature 0 01 c using a hach hq40d multi parameter meter via a sampling port in the core lid for each sampling period measurements were made at three time points initial dark end light start and light end to allow dark light and net flux calculations initial samples were taken 30 min after closure of the lids dark end light start samples were taken after 12 h incubation with no light and light end samples were taken 3 h after illumination at the end of the dark sampling at each initial dark end light start and light end sampling duplicate samples for n2 ar analysis were collected by allowing water from suspended replacement water bags to gently displace sample water out of the core

heterotrophs 500 µm foraminifera and no cyanobacteria observed under light microscopy 1000 as has been described previously for this site oakes and eyre 2014 riekenberg et al submitted riekenberg et al 2017 2018 foraminifera were not considered in the current study as they have previously been found to make a minimal contribution to uptake of mpb n 1 in sediments in the adjacent brunswick estuary eyre et al 2016 sediment chl α at 0 2 2 cm depth averaged 48 3 2 9 mg m 2 mean se across all cores collected in this study and was not affected by time or treatment two way anova f3 20 0 8 p 0 5

taken after labeling but prior to incubation mpb biomass had the greatest contribution to sediment on 20 in the 0 2 cm depth with bacteria representing only 4 table 1 due to uptake of 15n being largely confined to on in the uppermost sediment layer 0 2 cm in the initial cores deeper depths 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm were not examined for uptake into mpb bacteria and uncharacterised sediment

15n m 2 detected in 0 2 cm of sediment 11 h after label application when the first 15n labeled cores were collected after tidal flushing at this time 15n was largely confined to the top scrape upper 2

in the 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm depths 10 2 mmol n m 2 5 3 13 1 mmol n m 2 6 8 respectively at 0 2 cm 15n uptake into the microbial community was dominated by mpb mpb 53 8 mmol n m 2 83 bacteria 11 1 mmol n m 2 17 table 1 due to limited labeling uptake within the lower depths during the initial sampling we did not run d l ala analysis for the microbial community in the 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm depths 15n was incorporated into deeper sediments 2 5 cm and 5 10 cm within all treatments by the initial sampling time fig 2 by 0 5 d similar amounts of the assimilated mpb n 8 16 was in sediment below 2 cm one way anova f 3 7 5 3 p 0 07 ambient 12 minimal 16 moderate 8 and elevated 10 after 10 5 d there was significantly more 15n contained in the 0 2 cm layer ts 0 2 2 cm than the 2 5 cm or 5 10 cm layers across all treatments two way anova f 2 108 1070 p 0 001 fig 2 ambient 83 4 minimal 81 9 moderate 79 1 and elevated 78 6 post hoc tukey tests indicated that incorporation into the 2 5 and 5 10 cm depths was similarly low for all treatments across sampling times p 0 1 in all comparisons uptake of 15n into microbial biomass mpb and bacteria accounted for 22 95 of the total 15n incorporated into sediment on across all treatments and sampling times fig 3 initially 15n retained 0 5 d in mpb during the incubation was higher in the elevated treatment one way anova f 3 7 6 9 p 0 046 minimal 71 21 moderate 75 12 and elevated 93 1 mean se than in the ambient treatment 38 4 with tukey tests indicating a significant difference between elevated and ambient treatments p 0 04 fig 3 with values for minimal and moderate treatments falling intermediate between them this indicates that initial retention of mpb n was stimulated by increased nutrient availability and this assimilated 15n remained in mpb at 0 5 d within the microbial community after 0 5 d distribution of 15n continued to be dominated by mpb for all treatments ambient 83 3 minimal 79 4 moderate 74 2 elevated 75 5 fig 4 bacterial contribution to 15n uptake was comparable or higher during the later sampling times 1 5 to 10 5 d in the nutrient amended treatments minimal 15 23 moderate 2 49 elevated 2 40 fig 4 compared to the ambient treatment 10 23 in the ambient treatment distribution of 15n between microbial biomass and uncharacterised sediment on remained comparable across the 10 5 d incubation one way anova f 4 9 0 5 p 0 8 fig 3 in contrast in the nutrient amended treatments 15n incorporation was initially dominated by microbial biomass primarily mpb but shifted towards increased incorporation into the uncharacterised pool as the incubations progressed two way anovas minimal f 1 10 10 p 0 01 moderate f 1 10 10 p 0 001 elevated f 1 10 10 p 0 001 fig 3 in the nutrient amended treatments the 15n contributing to the increased uncharacterised pool appeared to be largely sourced from mpb resulting in reduced mpb contributions by 10 5 d minimal 38 moderate 12 elevated 16 fig 3 bacterial contributions to 15n remained similar across the incubation period in nutrient amended treatments two way anova f 2 15 0 1 p 0 9 3 3 loss of 15n from sediments there was relatively little efflux of 15n from the sediment to the water column in this study with loss pathways accounting for a maximum of 14 of the initially incorporated 15n across treatments fig 2 across all treatments most of this loss to the water column occurred in the form of don and n2 fluxes fig 5 with only a minor contribution from din nh4 maximum of 0 3 within the ambient treatment don was the largest export pathway accounting for loss over 10 5 d of 10 5 of the initially incorporated 15n figs 5 6 loss of 15n from the sediments via don effluxes was lower within the nutrient amended treatments minimal 4 8 moderate 5 2 elevated 5 2 but was not statistically significant export of 15n via n2 was comparably low between ambient minimal and elevated treatments 3 3 2 8 and 2 3 respectively but was higher in the moderate treatment 7 1 figs 4 6 overall export via combined efflux pathways was low across all treatments with the bulk of mpb n remaining within the sediment by 10 5 d ambient 86 4 minimal 90 2 moderate 88 2 and elevated 94 3 fig 6 the majority of 15n remaining in the sediment was found in the 0 2 cm depth for all treatments ambient 70 minimal 63 moderate 69 and elevated 80 fig 2 while 15n incorporation remained lower for depths below 2 cm ambient 16 minimal 27 moderate 18 and elevated 14 4 discussion by combining a pulse chase application of the rare isotope 15n with the d l ala biomarker technique we identified that increased nutrient availability as a pulsed addition of 5 to 50 µmol l 1 nh4 across three treatments 1 stimulated initial retention of mpb n within mpb 2 increased microbial turnover of mpb n into the uncharacterised sediment on compartment as incubations progressed and 3 decreased the amount of mpb n lost via don effluxes by the end of the incubation 10 5 d 86 94 of the 15n incorporated remained in the sediment with 3 9 10 9 effluxed as don 2 3 7 1 effluxed as n2 and less than 1 effluxed as nh4 fig 6 of the 15n contained in the sediment 12 40 was in mpb 6 15 was in bacteria and the remaining 45 75 within uncharacterised sediment on fig 6 this study tracks the fate and processing of a pulse of mpb n produced in situ under an increasing gradient of water column nutrient availability 4 1 initial incorporation and downward transfer of 15n initial retention of 15n into microbial biomass was dominated by mpb across all treatments as has been observed previously at this site riekenberg et al 2017 and was stimulated by increased nutrient availability ambient 53 versus 84 95 nutrient amended treatments 0 5 d fig 4 retention of mpb n may have resulted from decoupling of bacterial processing from mpb production with heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilizing inorganic nutrients in lieu of mpb n in the nutrient amended treatments resource switching by heterotrophic bacteria is further supported by decreased initial mpb n turnover into uncharacterised on considerable turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised on occurred in the ambient treatment 47 3 0 5 d but was significantly lower in the nutrient amended treatments 5 16 t 3 8 p 0 009 fig 3 the uncharacterised pool represents 15n within bulk sediment om that was not accounted for by 15n contained within microbial biomass this pool is composed of 15n containing compounds such as eps enzymes and om derived from the remineralisation of mpb n increased breakdown and initial transfer of mpb n into the uncharacterised pool is consistent with bacterial utilization of mpb n during remineralisation that resulted in increased initial turnover in low nutrient settings fig 3 increased coupling between mpb and bacteria in low nutrient settings cook et al 2007 oakes et al 2012 has previously been attributed to increased reliance on the limited nutrients arising from bacterial remineralisation of sediment on ratios of microbial biomass 13c 15n were estimated based on excess 13c incorporation determined in a complementary study riekenberg et al 2018 13c 15n ratios potentially over estimate relative uptake of 15n into the microbial community as phospholipid fatty acid analysis only accounts for 13c contained in living biomass and d l ala accounts for 15n in both living and dead biomass particularly as incubations progress therefore 13c 15n ratios for microbial biomass were only examined during the initial sampling 0 5 d the 13c 15n ratio in the ambient treatment 16 7 2 8 was considerably higher than in nutrient amended treatments minimal 8 3 3 8 moderate 5 2 3 4 and elevated 7 5 2 one way anova f 3 7 5 4 p 0 068 and aligns well with previous estimates where preferential excretion of fixed c as eps would occur due to n limitation within algal cells e g 20 van den meersche et al 2004 a lower 13c 15n ratio within nutrient amended treatments indicates uptake occurring at a ratio closer to the redfield ratio expected for algal uptake 6 7 as a result of increased n availability cook et al 2007 bacteria under n replete conditions utilize inorganic nutrients to support production of low c n biomass regardless of the c n ratio of the substrate being processed to produce that biomass goldman and dennett 2000 shifting retention of mpb n between sediment compartments due to nutrient amendment indicates changed short term processing of recently fixed organic matter and was observed despite considerable time having elapsed prior to incubation 18 h allowing for flushing of tracer and core acclimation over 10 5 d the majority 81 of 15n incorporated into the sediment was recovered from the 0 2 cm depth but deeper sediment layer incorporation occurred rapidly within 0 5 d fig 2 resulting in a transport rate of 2 7 4 4 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 downward transport was substantially lower than previously observed at this site e g 19 6 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 over 1 5 d oakes et al 2020 likely driven by the draining and re filling of cores to simulate intertidal conditions in that study downward transport for 15n in this study is similar to that observed for mpb n in subtropical subtidal sediments e g 2 7 µmol 15n m 2 h 1 over 3 d with ambient din of 8 µmoll 1 eyre et al 2016 but represent a smaller portion of the total incorporated 15n 8 3 16 4 compared to 29 similar downward transport for mpb n between the two studies likely reflect comparable downward migration by mpb within subtropical sands saburova and polikarpov 2003 incorporation of 15n into 2 10 cm depth increased slowly thereafter and resulted in higher downward transport in the nutrient amended treatments as the incubations progressed average over 3 5 10 5 d ambient 15 6 2 0 minimal 22 6 2 8 moderate 23 6 2 7 and elevated 21 2 2 0 fig 2 downward migration of mpb can be enhanced by light stress underwood 2002 but given that light intensity was consistent across treatments increased downward transfer of mpb n within nutrient amended treatments more likely reflects increased downward migration for nutrients and cell division as water column nutrients quickly became limiting later in the incubations saburova and polikarpov 2003 4 2 transfer of mpb n within sediments transfer and processing of mpb n between sediment compartments within sediment on decreased between the ambient and nutrient amended treatments due to decreased bacterial remineralization of mpb n reducing recycling and transfer of mpb n between sediment compartments fig 3 across 10 5 d the ambient treatments contribution of mpb to 15n within microbial biomass increased 77 90 bacterial contributions declined 23 to 10 fig 4 and the uncharacterised pool of 15n contributed considerably to the excess 15n in sediment on 23 61 fig 3 these combined factors indicate mpb n was efficiently recycled when nutrients are relatively scarce bacteria in the ambient treatment re mineralised mpb n within the uncharacterised pool fig 1a providing inorganic nutrients that were increasingly used by mpb as they competed for available nutrients under nutrient limitation cook et al 2007 in contrast across 10 5 d in the nutrient amended treatments tight recycling of nutrients from bacterial remineralisation decreased as bacteria preferentially utilised inorganic nutrients instead of degrading organic matter for n this switch resulted in accumulation of 15n within sediment on as mpb n was not remineralised and remained unavailable for recycling back into mpb with increased nutrient loading mpb contributions to 15n within microbial biomass declined bacterial contributions increased fig 3 and resulted in increased 15n contained in the uncharacterised pool minimal 41 47 moderate 29 75 elevated 23 70 fig 3 accumulation of 15n in uncharacterised sediment on reflects decreased recycling of mpb n contained in om likely as eps and detritus mpb and bacterial biomass as bacteria preferentially utilised inorganic nutrients instead of mpb n within the uncharacterised pool fig 1b 4 3 effluxes of mpb n export of 15n from the sediments to the water column occurred via fluxes of don n2 and nh4 figs 2 6 fluxes of nh4 from remineralisation 0 0 3 contributed little to exported 15n across all treatments indicating strong retention of nutrients arising from mpb n remineralisation retention of n from remineralization is expected as competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria for n has been previously observed under nutrient limiting settings agogue et al 2014 risgaard petersen et al 2004 limited export of 15n as nh4 across all treatments suggests that the microbial community maintained capacity for further n uptake throughout the incubations cumulative flux of nh4 in this study was considerably smaller than observed in subtropical subtidal sediments over 33 d 20 8 eyre et al 2016 but similar to previous observations for this site across 31 d 0 2 oakes et al 2020 similar nh4 fluxes between studies at this site likely result from decreased bacterial remineralisation of sediment on and increased retention of mpb n in comparison to subtidal processing from increased competition between heterotrophic bacteria and mpb for available n low fluxes of n2 may be caused by competition for inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria intense competition for recycled inorganic nutrients between mpb and bacteria would have starved both ammonia oxidizing and subsequently denitrifying bacteria of substrates mcglathery et al 2007 sundbäck and miles 2002 and reduced n2 efflux from denitrification 2 3 7 1 10 5 d fig 6 this finding is comparable with previously reported denitrification rates for this site 2 6 by 31 d oakes et al 2020 and suggests that competition from mpb for nh4 was similarly limiting during that period as ambient nh4 was higher in oakes et al 2020 2 1 1 8 µmoll 1 than in this study 0 9 0 1 µmoll 1 limited availability of substrates for denitrification was maintained as intense competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria for nh4 occurred starving ammonia oxidizers that produce no3 substrate limitation helps to explain the low percentage for n2 efflux observed in this study versus the higher rates found in subtropical subtidal sediments 20 7 eyre et al 2016 enhanced efflux of mpb n as both n2 and nh4 in a subtidal setting suggests that increased remineralisation produced inorganic nutrients sufficient to overcome the n limitation from mpb in the moderate treatment denitrification bacterial incorporation of mpb n and the flux of nh4 were higher by 10 5 d indicating that competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria did not limit substrate availability for denitrification both moderate and elevated treatments provide examples of decreased competition between mpb and heterotrophic bacteria that resulted in increased turnover of mpb n into uncharacterised sediment om between these treatments only the moderate had increased denitrification indicating that changed processing between the sediment compartments may occur with or without considerably increased denitrification as a symptom increased inorganic nutrient availability decreased bacterial remineralisation as inorganic nutrients were preferentially utilised instead of sediment on fig 1b in the ambient treatment efflux of mpb n via don accounted for 10 of the 15n assimilated within the system and is evidence of increased remineralisation hydrolysis of freshly deposited material ferguson et al 2004 glud et al 2008 and export of mpb n from the uncharacterised pool within sediment on with nutrient amendment export of mpb n via don decreased to 3 9 5 2 fig 6 despite enhanced mpb n retention at 0 5 d and the equal or increased presence of 15n within the uncharacterised pool within the nutrient amended treatments decreased export of mpb n via don likely occurred due to added din being preferentially used by heterotrophic bacteria instead of sediment on via remineralisation 4 4 retention of mpb n mpb have a considerable role in regulating processing of nutrients within shallow unvegetated benthic settings through primary production and n uptake ferguson and eyre 2013 ferguson et al 2004 mcglathery et al 2007 nielsen et al 2017 sundbäck and miles 2002 newly assimilated n is considered to be retained within mpb biomass with increased mpb biomass resulting in reduced n efflux from sediments sundbäck et al 2006 excluding eyre et al 2016 oakes et al 2020 and veuger et al 2007 the chiral forms of alanine have not been used to partition sediment on into mpb and bacterial compartments as well as processed mpb n remaining in sediment on partitioning the uncharacterised pool within sediment on reveals that much of the initially assimilated mpb n is transferred there presumably via excretion of eps by mpb and turnover of microbial cellular material under nutrient limiting conditions this material is quickly remineralised by bacteria releasing 15nh4 that is then recycled as mpb and bacteria compete for available nutrients fig 1a under ambient conditions this coupling resulted in efficient bacterial remineralisation and recycling of mpb n resulting in turnover of 15n among all the sediment compartments effluxes of din or n2 were not stimulated by the altered processing of mpb n in sediment on which differs greatly from our stated hypothesis sediment retention of mpb n was somewhat reduced by increased efflux of don through increased hydrolysis and bacterial remineralisation of freshly deposited mpb n with added nutrient amendments hydrolysis and bacterial remineralisation of mpb n slowed resulting in reduced processing and accumulation of mpb n within sediment on and decreased 15n export via don efflux these changes caused decreased retention of mpb n in mpb and increased turnover into sediment on under nutrient amendment retained mpb n occurred largely outside of the microbial biomass within the uncharacterised sediment on pool i e retained as eps and other n containing molecules this is in stark contrast to previous findings that mpb n is predominately strongly retained in mpb biomass eyre et al 2016 nielsen et al 2017 and reflects the considerable turnover of mpb n within this system 5 conclusion the microbial community is an important sink for organic and inorganic n within benthic coastal settings ferguson et al 2004 mcglathery et al 2007 thornton et al 2002 uptake of n is typically viewed as being mpb dominated with n retained in mpb biomass evrard et al 2008 hardison et al 2011 sundbäck et al 2006 veuger et al 2007 unless grazing causes trophic transfer of mpb n eyre and ferguson 2002 2005 addition of inorganic nutrients appears to initially stimulate n retention in mpb but then causes reduced bacterial remineralisation and recycling of remineralised mpb n as inorganic nutrients are preferentially utilised this leads to decreased mpb n retention within mpb biomass greater accumulation of mpb n within sediment on as uncharacterised material and corresponds with decreased efflux of mpb n as don uncharacterised material is a mixture of eps enzymes and other n bearing om that is either associated with the microbial biofilm and is fairly resistant to breakdown and export or has accumulated due to the low physical transport processes associated with this study either way turnover of mpb n between the sediment compartments has decreased and is no longer strongly retained within mpb biomass these changes resulted in increased accumulation of relatively labile mpb n in the shallow surface sediments that may stimulate long term support of increased bacterial respiration increased accumulation of newly assimilated om in the sediment occurred with short lived pulses of nutrients within shallow mpb dominated sediments and occurred under nutrient replete settings regardless of whether denitrification of 15n increased this indicates that short term pulses of nutrients into coastal ecosystems can result in considerable accumulation of newly assimilated om regardless of whether n2 export is

17504,the presence of sars cov 2 in the feces of infected patients and wastewater has drawn attention not only to the possibility of fecal oral transmission but also to the use of wastewater as an epidemiological tool the covid 19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches due to a lack of diagnostic capacity and their application to only a small proportion of the population as in previous pandemics statistics particularly the proportion of the population infected are believed to be widely underestimated furthermore analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers threfore community scale surveillance including wastewater based epidemiology can bridge the broader community and the clinic becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for sars cov 2 and other pandemic viruses this article summarizes current knowledge and discusses the critical factors for implementing wastewater based epidemiology of covid 19 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology environmental

infection disease since the 1918 influenza pandemic sars cov 2 is a positive sense single stranded rna enveloped virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus in the family coronaviridae order nidovirales the infection caused by sars cov 2 is typically characterized by respiratory symptoms indicative of airborne and droplet transmission chan et al 2020 however a significant proportion of

predictive tool for addressing the covid 19 pandemic 2 the concept wbe was theorized in 2001 daughton and jones lepp 2001 and then implemented in 2005 to trace cocaine and other illicit drug use zuccato et al 2005 zuccato et al 2008 and oseltamivir tamiflu use during the 2009 influenza pandemic reddy 2010 singer et al 2013 the approach relies on the assumption that any substance that is excreted by humans and is stable in wastewater can be used to back calculate the original concentration excreted by the serviced population this same concept can be translated to virus surveillance berchenko et al 2017 contrary to other microorganisms such as bacteria viruses do not grow outside the host cells therefore human viruses in wastewater can represent the concentrations excreted by the corresponding human population as long as they persist long enough 2 4 days to be detected carducci et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 therefore monitoring temporal changes in viral concentrations and diversity in community wastewater samples can be used not only to determine the true extent of the infection in the population but also the emergence of new viral strains and the early detection of new viral outbreaks adriaenssens et al 2008 ahmed et al 2020 daughton 2020 hart and halden 2020 the utility and potential of a wastewater surveillance system have been previously demonstrated during the global polio eradication program it was utilized as a tool to assess polio circulation within populations and the evaluation of immunization efficacy against poliovirus hovi et al 2012 ndiaye et al 2014 roberts 2013 it has also been used in the retrospective prediction of disease outbreaks of hepatitis a and norovirus associated gastroenteritis hellmér et al 2014 however wbe methods have not yet been applied to assess and predict viral disease outbreaks in a systematic way wbe could solve certain limitations in existing surveillance systems that have been highlighted during this covid 19 pandemic or previous ones like the 2009 influenza a pandemic dawood et al 2012 simonsen et al 2013 specifically the sensitivity and specificity of syndromic surveillance approaches greatly depend on the reporting and severity of clinical symptoms and how much these signs overlap with existing diseases within the population mandi et al 2004 in the case of sars cov 2 a significant proportion of patients are either asymptomatic presymptomatic or experience mild non specific symptoms and therefore go unreported resulting in considerable underestimation of infection in a range of studies the rate of asymptomatic infection has been estimated at ca 20 45 mizumoto et al 2020 oran and topol 2020 wang et al 2020 whilst syndromic surveillance based on hospital admissions is likely to be more specific given the current prevalence of disease in the population estimates of population infection based on hospital admissions represents a delay of days to weeks between infection and admission in addition a significant proportion of patients admitted to hospital will die in theory individual sampling and testing represents the most accurate measure of active transmission and disease prevalence however the spatial and temporal scale of testing required to achieve adequate penetrance to gather granular information is impractical or economically challenging for most countries further repeated testing would be required to ensure effective disease control novel rapid diagnostics may be useful in this respect but they are not yet available and present their own challenges with respect to reliability and quality control therefore there is a need for a more sensitive specific and timely measure of infection in the population the biological information that wastewater contains can be used as an unbiased surveillance system and reflection of the community s health human viruses in wastewater are by nature biological markers of their own circulation in populations due to their dna or rna their detection in influents of wastewater treatment plants wwtp can suggest human sources and hence indicate what diseases are circulating within a population in almost real time wbe is scalable and cost effective even in low resource settings provides rapid results and can monitor a wide variety of emergent and re emergent viral diseases and or imported pathogens in addition the move towards centralized wastewater treatments plants in most urban centres where sars cov 2 is most prevalent means that the viral load from 104 to 106 individuals can be captured in a single sample facilitating the analysis for the whole community 3 enveloped viruses in wastewater the paradigm shift historically the study of viruses in wastewater has been focused on enteric non enveloped viruses that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and are readily transmitted via the fecal oral route e g norovirus rotavirus all viruses are susceptible to environmental degradation by factors such as temperature uv light and predation by the microbial community enteric viruses are highly resistant to heat acids and oxidants and survive for long periods in the environment bosch et al 2006 in contrast enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses ebola virus or influenza viruses are generally not associated with fecal oral transmission in humans and are considered more susceptible to inactivation because damage to the labile lipid envelope leads to loss of infectivity in aqueous environments interestingly not all enveloped viruses rapidly lose their infectivity studies in the last decade have expanded this view and revealed that some epidemic enveloped viruses like sars cov mers cov and now sars cov 2 typically considered respiratory viruses can also be detected in the water cycle carducci et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 singer and wray 2020 wigginton et al 2015 temperature ph matrix composition or the presence of other microorganisms can influence survivability of enveloped viruses but also virus recovery and concentration methods historically optimized for non enveloped viruses like enteric viruses can impact infectivity assay outcome and underestimate their infectivity rates aquino de carvalho et al 2017 gundy et al 2009 la rosa et al 2020 ye et al 2016 whether or not an enveloped infective virus persists long enough in wastewater to represent a threat to human health is still unclear and further research is needed however in the 2003 sars cov outbreak a clear link was made between localized sars infections and the sewage network albeit associated with fecal aerosolization mckinney et al 2006 in summary the presence of viral nucleic acids in feces and wastewater indicate that the concept of wbe could be applied to a wide range of viruses beyond the enteric viruses and that an enveloped virus such as sars cov 2 is relevant to wbe o brien and xagoraraki 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 early data from the us suggest this may be possible peccia et al 2020 but more work is needed to validate early results regardless wbe offers a paradigm shift in infectious disease surveillance 4 critical factors in wbe implementation 4 1 sampling sampling for wbe applications offers both spatial and temporal challenges that can compromise the degree to which the resulting data is representative of the study population fig 1 differences between urban and rural wastewater systems must be considered when the specific surveillance program is designed urban sewage systems can provide more representative samples of the community because wastewater ultimately is aggregated across the population through interceptors that can be used to partition the study population o brien and xagoraraki 2020 should viral concentrations be observed as higher in one interceptor than the rest the corresponding serviced area would be of greater concern for a potential viral outbreak sampling in rural areas is more complex due to the lack of sewage collection systems and proximity to testing facilities therefore watershed modeling and microbial source tracking are usually integral components of wbe used to evaluate wastewater disposal and transport and to determine the best locations for effective sampling o brien et al 2017b the time of sampling is also crucial and should be based upon expected critical pathways such as environmental reservoirs and locations where the virus is most easily transported and transmitted o brien and xagoraraki 2020 careful consideration needs to be given to the size of the catchment area and hence its susceptibility to diurnal changes in flow and or viral detection rates cornman et al 2018 dong et al 2015 for example in some large urban areas there may be a delay of 24 h for the wastewater to go from the household to a centralized plant whilst autosamplers can be used to obtain composite samples over a representative time period e g 24 h refrigerated units necessary to prevent viral degradation are expensive hence in many situations grab sampling may represent the most practical and appropriate approach the fate and decay rate of viruses may be different between systems that use enclosed underground sewer pipes storm tanks and systems that utilize septic tanks catchments and the open environment factors that lead to an increase in viral levels in wastewater influents include larger incidence rates in the community or cooler temperatures on the contrary dilution due to infiltration of precipitation or from surface water leads to lower levels detailed modeling of viral decay and wastewater flow rates through the system are therefore required to accurately relate viral concentration at the point of sampling to the presence of virus within the catchment population in addition sampling sars cov 2 in wastewater from hospitals may be compromised by the wide range of disinfectants and detergents co entering the sewage network 4 2 virus recovery and concentration virus detection in environmental samples likely requires viral concentration into a smaller volume to improve detection limits there are a variety of available methods designed and optimized for non enveloped viruses which are based on combinations of filtrations ultracentrifugation and polyethylene glycol peg precipitation with a range of ph values chemicals filter types centrifuge speeds and purification steps la rosa et al 2020 ye et al 2016 however most methods are not suitable for enveloped viruses because the outer lipid layer renders these viruses more sensitive to temperature ph and organic solvents like chloroform or cesium chloride solutions two general types of charged filters are commonly available electronegative and electropositive charged filters electropositive filtration is commonly used for non enveloped viruses like enteric viruses with good recoveries and by extension they are also being employed for enveloped viruses like sars cov wang et al 2005 however care must be taken since membrane filtration efficiencies will vary depending on the type of water sample tap water seawater wastewater the virus the isoelectric point of the virus that influences the net charge of the viral particle the ph the presence in the sample of other contaminants with potential inhibitory activity for further steps in the process or of organic material that could hamper the filtration armanious et al 2016 pepper and gerba 2015 virus culture and infectivity assays are not critical to implement wbe however they are crucial to evaluate the risk that a sample poses to human health or to potential animal reservoirs this is not possible with pcr or sequencing techniques and therefore future infectivity studies are needed to fill this gap 4 3 virus quantification exact virus quantification is the principal goal of wbe because peaks in viral concentrations can indicate the potential onset of future disease outbreaks sars cov 2 primer probe sets are already published targeting n e and rdrp genes corman et al 2020 for rna viruses classical reverse transcription pcr rt pcr and rt real time pcr rt qpcr are still the gold standard methods to obtain qualitative and quantitative data respectively however virus extraction concentrates from wastewater samples often contain diverse pcr inhibitors including fats proteins and humic substances which interfere with the pcr reaction gibson et al 2012 they also contribute to bias in metagenomic analysis hall et al 2014 sometimes these inhibitors can be minimized by dilution or by the addition of quenching agents however future wastewater virus monitoring will need to depend on the development of better extraction and purification methods new molecular techniques such as digital pcr dpcr can help with some problems the partitioning effect of distributing the target nucleic acid into thousands of reaction wells has shown to be more sensitive and to decrease the effect of pcr inhibitory substances in complex matrices including wastewater polo et al 2016 varela et al 2018 next generation sequencing and metaviromics have the potential to revolutionize viral wastewater surveillance however standardized protocols for these technologies remain a challenge the complexity of the matrix and the high abundance of genetic material in the samples often lead to more conservative results of viral detection as well as to poorer detection limits for a specific virus compared to qpcr fernandez cassi et al 2018 martínez puchol et al 2020 conversely they can also detect new variants that are missed by conventional qpcr primer sets as de virus progressively mutates adriaenssens et al 2018 4 4 sars cov 2 shedding rates and levels in wastewater the shedding rate is the rate with which viruses are released from the body and knowing rates are critical linking back wastewater data to human populations fig 1 many factors can impact the shedding rate of viruses in the feces including viremia the duration severity and the stage of the disease or age chen and li 2020 when data on viral loads in wastewater are absent viral loads in human stool or urine samples may help to predict levels in wastewater during an outbreak event it should be noted however that in contrast to fecal shedding which occurs in ca 50 of clinically diagnosed infections shedding of sars cov 2 in urine is far less common 5 of confirmed infections peng et al 2020 sars cov 2 has been detected by rt qpcr in the feces at concentrations ranging from 103 to 10⁵ copies ml pan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the duration and shedding rate of the virus in asymptomatic cases however still remains extremely uncertain but is expected to be much lower in a pandemic scenario concentrations in wastewater will therefore depend on the number of people infected in the community and the rate at which infected individuals shed the viruses regarding sars cov 2 a few studies have assessed the levels in wastewater ranging from 102 to 106 copies l in untreated wastewater ahmed et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 the establishment of correlations and comparisons between measured viral concentrations in wastewater and the reported clinical cases of disease or the extension of the outbreak in the population is the final goal of wbe these correlations can serve as a validation for a prediction model that accounts for the factors discussed above providing evidence for the notion that changes of viral concentrations in wastewater will indicate changes in disease cases in the human population 4 5 population normalization an important step in the application of wbe is the estimation of the contributing population to wastewater samples namely population normalization for this purpose both census and biomarker data can be used which needs to be independently collected but also integrated with common units fig 1 endogenous or exogenous human biomarkers can be used to estimate the serviced population in an area via statistical modeling table 1 quantification of biomarkers would provide context to measured viral concentrations and ensure that differences in viral loads could not be attributed to changes in population when observed viral concentrations are significantly high relative to the estimated population a viral outbreak could be indicated o brien and xagoraraki 2020 sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 some substances that have been proposed as population biomarkers are creatinine cholesterol coprostanol nicotine cortisol androstenedione and the serotonin metabolite 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa however all these biomarkers require capability in analytical chemistry and there is still concern when applying these markers to different catchments due to differing consumption or disposal habits stability and sorption to particulate matter which contribute to high uncertainties rico et al 2017 hence human nucleic acid has a great potential to act as a population biomarker due to its limited affinity to other species in wastewater stability constant excretion by human and the possibility of being quantifiable using the same pipelines and platforms as the viral nucleic acid of interest very promising viral indicators of human activity include crassphage pepper mild mosaic virus and adenovirus farkas et al 2019 they are better than other human pathogenic viruses such as norovirus which demonstrate strong seasonality in wastewater total nitrogen phosphorus biological oxygen demand and ammonium have also been proposed as population biomarkers but these better reflect human activity and industry footprint rather than populations choi et al 2018 daughton 2018 census information is also used in wbe however in some cases this approach can underestimate the population compared to biomarkers o brien et al 2014 normalization of population is crucial to enable inter city comparisons as well as to ensure that a significant increase in viral concentration in a wastewater sample does not correspond to an increase in population in the serviced area in this sense fluctuations in the population pose a challenge to wbe e g due to tourism or commuter activity whilst these dynamics may have negligible impact on the levels of biomarkers in large populations they might contribute to higher uncertainties in smaller populations chen et al 2014 ort et al 2014 4 6 ethical considerations wbe does not collect data on individuals so a priori the ethical risks are low however expanding wbe to include viral infectious diseases and outbreaks will pose new challenges with respect to ethical considerations in many cases infectious diseases monitoring and control requires lockdowns and or sampling of subgroups and small populations as it might provide faster interventions by public health authorities however these measures could also lead to stigmatizing behaviors one of the best documented cases is the increased spread of ebola in western africa due to fear trigged behaviors stigmatism surrounding individuals infected with ebola combined with a sense of distrust in health services and treatment centers resulted in efforts to hide cases home treatment and increased chances of infecting family members and then other members of the community shultz et al 2016 similar ethical issues have also been observed in outbreaks such as sars cov 1 and influenza and social stigma associated with covid 19 has already been reported these earlier episodes lead to the publishing in 2017 of the first comprehensive international ethics guidelines on public health surveillance who 2017 highlighting that ethical guidelines should be appropriately adapted to different social economic and epidemiological circumstances in this sense care must be taken in disease reporting and to reduce media misinterpreting the publication s findings 5 conclusions the presence of new highly pathogenic strains of enveloped viruses such as sars co 2 in wastewater represents a new challenge and an opportunity to employ wbe for its surveillance there is a need for optimized recovery and concentration methods for enveloped viruses as they have not previously been explored as part of a wbe approach the presence of viral rna within wastewater regardless of viral infectivity constitutes an indirect population level diagnostic tool representative sampling viral concentration in wastewater population normalization and ethical guidelines are crucial factors for reliable wbe approach a well validated wbe system is imperative for viral surveillance particularly with respect to an early warning system for the next human pandemic declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17504,the presence of sars cov 2 in the feces of infected patients and wastewater has drawn attention not only to the possibility of fecal oral transmission but also to the use of wastewater as an epidemiological tool the covid 19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches due to a lack of diagnostic capacity and their application to only a small proportion of the population as in previous pandemics statistics particularly the proportion of the population infected are believed to be widely underestimated furthermore analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers threfore community scale surveillance including wastewater based epidemiology can bridge the broader community and the clinic becoming a valuable indirect epidemiological prediction tool for sars cov 2 and other pandemic viruses this article summarizes current knowledge and discusses the critical factors for implementing wastewater based epidemiology of covid 19 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater based epidemiology environmental monitoring coronavirus sars cov 2 covid 19 sewage 1 introduction the early 2020s will be remembered for the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 which causes viral pneumonia called coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 this new coronavirus strain first detected in wuhan hubei province china has rapidly spread across the world causing the most consequential infection disease since the 1918 influenza pandemic sars cov 2 is a positive sense single stranded rna enveloped virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus in the family coronaviridae order nidovirales the infection caused by sars cov 2 is typically characterized by respiratory symptoms indicative of airborne and droplet transmission chan et al 2020 however a significant proportion of patients infected with covid 19 also show gastrointestinal symptoms and or viral shedding in feces outlasting those from the respiratory tract holshue et al 2020 xu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020a wu et al 2020 furthermore intracellular staining of viral nucleocapsid protein in gastric duodenal and rectal epithelia showed that the virus can infect glandular epithelial cells in these areas and that virions are secreted from gastrointestinal cells xiao et al 2020a however very limited evidence of sars cov 2 infectivity in fecal samples has been obtained xiao et al 2020b whether sars cov 2 virons in sewage are infective or not the use of virus particles in wastewater as an epidemiological tool for community covid 19 prevalence is possible individual wastewater samples represent a snapshot of infection within the population whilst a structured longitudinal sampling strategy as part of an integrated wastewater based epidemiology wbe program see fig 1 can be an invaluable additional

androstenedione and the serotonin metabolite 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa however all these biomarkers require capability in analytical chemistry and there is still concern when applying these markers to different catchments due to differing consumption or disposal habits stability and sorption to particulate matter which contribute to high uncertainties rico et al 2017 hence human nucleic acid has a great potential to act as a population biomarker due to its limited affinity to other species in wastewater stability constant excretion by human and the possibility of being quantifiable using the same pipelines and platforms as the viral nucleic acid of interest very promising viral indicators of human activity include crassphage pepper mild mosaic virus and adenovirus farkas et al 2019 they are better than other human pathogenic viruses such as norovirus which demonstrate strong seasonality in wastewater total nitrogen phosphorus biological oxygen demand and ammonium have also been proposed as population biomarkers but these better reflect human activity and industry footprint rather than populations choi et al 2018 daughton 2018 census information is also used in wbe however in some cases this approach can underestimate the population compared to biomarkers o brien et al 2014 normalization of population is crucial to enable inter city comparisons as well as to ensure that a significant increase in viral concentration in a wastewater sample does not correspond to an increase in population in the serviced area in this sense fluctuations in the population pose a challenge to wbe e g due to tourism or commuter activity whilst these dynamics may have negligible impact on the levels of biomarkers in large populations they might contribute to higher uncertainties in smaller populations chen et al 2014 ort et al 2014 4 6 ethical considerations wbe does not collect data on individuals so a priori the ethical risks are low however expanding wbe to include viral infectious diseases and outbreaks will pose new challenges with respect to ethical considerations in many cases infectious diseases monitoring and control requires lockdowns and or sampling of subgroups and small populations as it might provide faster interventions by public health authorities however these measures could also lead to stigmatizing behaviors one of the best documented cases is the increased spread of ebola in western africa due to fear trigged behaviors stigmatism surrounding individuals infected with ebola combined with a sense of distrust in health services and treatment centers resulted in efforts to hide cases home treatment and increased chances of infecting family members and then other members of the community shultz et al 2016 similar ethical issues have also been observed in outbreaks such as sars cov 1 and influenza and social stigma associated with covid 19 has already been reported these earlier episodes lead to the publishing in 2017 of the first comprehensive international ethics guidelines on public health surveillance who 2017 highlighting that ethical guidelines should be appropriately adapted to different social economic and epidemiological circumstances in this sense care must be taken in disease reporting and to reduce media misinterpreting the publication s findings 5 conclusions the presence of new highly pathogenic strains of enveloped viruses such as sars co 2 in wastewater represents a new challenge and an opportunity to employ wbe for its surveillance there is a need for optimized recovery and concentration methods for enveloped viruses as they have not previously been explored as part of a wbe approach the presence of viral rna within wastewater regardless of viral infectivity constitutes an indirect population level diagnostic tool representative sampling viral concentration in wastewater population normalization and ethical guidelines are crucial factors for reliable wbe approach a well validated wbe system is imperative for viral surveillance particularly with respect to an early warning system for the next human pandemic declaration of competing interest the authors declare
