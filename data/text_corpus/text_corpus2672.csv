influent c n ratio of 3 18 the acclimatization of vgs to the tertiary treatment process exhibited an aerial biomass production rate of 5063 37 mg ts m2 d the treated water attained the standards for household recycling as prescribed by who graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords greywater blackwater anaerobic biofilm reactor sequential batch reactor vertical greenery system 1 introduction wastewater discharged by households can be primarily classified as greywater gw and blackwater bw 1 the treatment and recycling of gw within the household for non potable secondary reuse can reduce the consumption of freshwater and simultaneously provide year round water security the requisite for a rational concept of household gw recycling is i treatment of gw up to reusable water standards by processes that generate low sludge consume less operational energy are easy to operate and maintain by the user ii ancillary plumbing lines to segregate the untreated gw untreated bw and treated gw anaerobic aerobic and phytoremediation are the commonly used biological processes for wastewater treatment anaerobic treatment of wastewater consumes lower energy and generates low sludge whereas ineffectual in the mineralization of ammonia and phosphate 2 furthermore anaerobic microbes are susceptible to inhibition against household chemicals personal care and pharma products 3 aerobic treatment on the one hand requires a shorter startup time and on the other hand exhibit ability to mineralize recalcitrant compounds with a relatively higher rate of removal of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorous p 4 on the other hand aerobic processes demand a relatively higher operational energy resulting from operations such as aeration mixing and downstream sludge processing etc 5 sludge generated by aerobic process amounts to 40 50 of the input c requires frequent removal from the reactor that would otherwise lead to operational discrepancies such as lower hrt inefficient treatment hindered sludge settling due to sludge bulking sludge foaming higher oxygen demand etc 6 vertical greenery systems vgs also referred to as green walls green fa√ßade living walls vertical gardens are a modification to the conventional concept of phytoremediation constructed wetlands 7 vgs is implemented in two distinct design configurations i the planter beds are modular in design arranged in vertical racking such that excess water cascades downwards through a series of planter beds from the top to bottom while the vegetation is primarily composed of non climbers and shrubs ii the planter bed is stationed at the ground level whereas the vines climbers proliferate on walls facades 7 the commonly used plant species in vgs are hereda helix parthenocissus tricuspidata wisteria sp fruits species such as luffa sp phaseolus vulgaris etc 8 vgs is suitable for the treatment of low strength wastewater and exhibits various advantages such as lower operational energy requirement ease of operation n and p removal lower footprint demand in comparison to conventional phytoremediation and horizontal wetlands 9 in contrast vgs suffers from issues common to phytoremediation such as the light requirement for photosynthesis clogging of growth substratum flooding low oxygen transfer to the roots at higher hydraulic and organic loads 10 thus it could be envisaged that a standalone process would be ineffectual in achieving the holistic treatment of household gw therefore a combination of multiple processes comprising anaerobic aerobic and vgs is desirable the primary treatment of gw in the anaerobic reactor would facilitate the decomposition of the easily degradable fraction at a relatively low sludge production and energy requirement 2 5 of c input subsequently treatment in the aerobic reactor would lead to the removal of residual c n p household chemical compounds and de odorization with low input energy finally the low levels of residual n p and suspended solids in water would be removed in vgs comprising ornamental flowering plants besides vgs could enhance aesthetics thermal insulation urban biodiversity air quality etc 7 11 the relatively lower influx of pollutants in vgs along with the oxygenated water discharged by the aerobic process would reduce the toxicity exhibited by wastewater provide aeration to the roots reduce the growth of heterotrophic microbes in planter beds resulting in the need for high oxygen transfer and simultaneously prolonging the life of vegetation the two stage treatment of 10 m3 sewage per day in a uasb reactor followed by the aerobic reactor discharged an effluent with a bod of 30 mg l 12 the uasb reactor exhibited 36 removal of solids and 34 cod removal at hrt of 3 2 h whereas the subsequent treatment took place in the aerobic reactor at hrt of 3 h in another study the sequential treatment of municipal wastewater in a uasb reactor followed by an aerobic reactor achieved an overall treatment of 93 at a total hrt of 7 9 h 13 the treatment of greywater in a sequential anaerobic aerobic reactor was demonstrated during the summer and winter seasons 14 the treatment performances of anaerobic aerobic reactors in the winter and summer seasons were 45 39 and 53 64 respectively the treated water quality met the standards for irrigation except for the pathogen concentrations by contemplating the potency of each process this research aims to converge them to a 3 stage sequential gw treatment process comprising a multi chamber anaerobic biofilm reactor aerobic sequencing batch reactor and vertical greenery system vgs that raises ornamental flowering plants such as sphagneticola trilobata the 3 stage treatment process is hypothesized to enhance the robustness of the overall treatment processes including the quality of treated water and protect against shock loads respectively the key objectives are i quantitative and qualitative characterization of the gw and bw discharged by a household ii design optimize and demonstrate the treatment performance of the 3 stage sequential gw treatment process at a bench scale iii study the viability of s trilobata in the tertiary treatment of gw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection gw and bw samples were collected from a household located in bengaluru india that consisted of separate plumbing lines for the discharge of gw and bw the gw was collected in an underground tank of 500 l placed in the setback of the house bw was collected in a makeshift underground tank of 30 l that was discharged from 3 different toilets in the house the water samples were collected from these tanks daily 6 days week for a month generally between 11 am 1 pm and transferred immediately to the laboratory for analysis 2 2 bioreactor setup a sketch of the treatment setup is shown in fig 1 and supplementary data 1 and 2 the anaerobic biofilm reactor anbr was fabricated in stainless steel cylindrical l 0 93 m d 0 4 m working volume of around 100 l it comprised 3 internal chambers of 30 l working volume each whereas the top overflow and headspace zones had a capacity of 10 l each respectively the bottom chamber is composed of sludge sludge chamber sc the middle chamber contains fluidized biofilm support material made up of pvc spiral fluidized chamber fc the top chamber situated above the fc contains a packed bed of washed and retted coir cocos nucifera fiber acting as biofilter packed chamber pc to trap the suspended matter the physical properties of support materials have been reported previously 15 the quantity of pvc spiral in fc and coir in pc was 2 28 and 1 3 kg respectively the 3 chambers were fitted with sampling ports the gw inlet port was present at sc whereas the outlet port at the top overflow a peristaltic pump recirculated water from the overflow into the sc at predetermined periodic intervals at a rate of 1 25 l min with an overall recycling volume of 300 l d table 1 the aerobic reactor aer l 0 55 m d 0 5 m was fabricated from commercially available polyethylene barrels with a working volume of 100 l an external air pump supplied air at the bottom of aer with the help of a ceramic diffuser at a rate of 2 0 5 lpm attaining a peak dissolved oxygen do concentration in aer between 2 and 2 5 mg l the airflow rate was controlled with the help of a rotameter an inlet port was placed at the bottom whereas the outlet port was at the top the vgs comprised 3 columns each column containing 6 planter beds arranged in succession with a total of 18 planter beds fig 1 the planter bed was made up of polyethylene resembling the frustum of a cone with an approximate empty volume of 4 76 l the top and bottom cross sectional areas were 0 08 m2 0 008 m2 respectively and height of 0 16 m the floor space usage of vgs e g aerial footprint was 0 24 m2 due to the vertical arrangement of the planter beds the planter bed comprised 4 perforations of 5 mm diameter at the bottom to ensure drainage of water to the successive planter beds placed below a collection container was placed at the bottom of each column to receive the drained water the 3 collection containers were connected in series to ensure the exit of treated water through one outlet the planter beds were packed with 3 different gravel sizes top bed 1 l empty volume grain size 2 mm middle bed 2 l empty volume grain size 10 12 mm bottom bed grain size 17 24 mm 1 l empty volume the gravel bed provided physical support to the vegetation besides the trickling of water through the gravel bed slowed the descent of water simultaneously increasing the contact time with roots sphagneticola trilobata an ornamental flowering creeper commonly called wedelia singapore daisy creeping daisy was propagated in the planter beds supplementary data 1 and 2 s trilobata stem cuttings of 200 250 mm length containing 4 6 nodes were collected from the plant nursery at the indian institute of science in each planter bed 3 stems were equidistantly buried up to 50 of the length s trilobata was chosen due to the following reasons easy availability across the world ability to creep across a wall hedge maximizing the surface area for light capture perennial and tropical nature ease of vegetative propagation through the stem cuttings year round flowering adapts to high sunlight as well growth in the shade is moderately tolerant to drought and flooding optimum growth between ph 5 5 7 5 vgs was continuously illuminated with led panels on all four sides at an intensity of 627 137 lx 2 3 bioreactor operation the chemical constituents of the synthetically prepared gw feed mimicking household conditions are as follows arrowroot starch 160 mg l laundry detergent 100 mg l liquid handwash 100 mg l urea co nh2 2 53 mg l kh2po4 5 mg l the feed was prepared daily in tap water and stored in the gw feed tank all the bioreactors were operated at room temperatures varying between 22 26 c at designated intervals anbr was fed with untreated gw using a peristaltic pump i e gw feed pump the incoming feed displaced the partially treated water from anbr into aer subsequently the partially treated water in aer was displaced via gravity and collected in a holding tank a dosing pump i e vgs feed pump delivered water from the holding tank to the drip manifold for a designated period the evenly distributed water in the manifold dribbled through the orifice to each column of vgs by gravity subsequently water trickled vertically down through successive planter beds planted with s trilobata and finally collected in the collection container the anbr and aer were operated in an upflow mode whereas vgs was operated in downflow mode the operation of the reactors e g feeding recycling and aeration were controlled automatically using timer relay controllers table 1 the samples for physicochemical analysis were collected from the gw feed tank the outlet of the anbr aer and vgs respectively the anbr and aer were subjected to an initial startup time of 30 days and subsequently operated at full scale the vgs was started afterward and commenced the operation from the 44th day as shown in fig 2 the upflow movement of gw in anbr at a velocity of 0 16 m h leads to the decomposition of compounds to vfas and subsequently to biogas recycling of water within anbr enhances the dispersal of the substrate metabolites nutrients and volatile fatty acids vfa altogether enhancing the rates of cod removal the operation of aer was similar to the conventional sequencing batch reactor sbr with four distinct steps taking place sequentially in one reactor called fill react settle draw however in this research draw and fill steps happen simultaneously due to the introduction of anbr effluent at the bottom of aer leading to the displacement of treated water from the top it avoided the use of a suction pump decanter in the fill stage partially treated water discharged by anbr is introduced at the bottom of aer for 50 min at an upflow velocity of 0 08 m h during the fill stage the influent comes in contact with the settled sludge at the bottom zone of aer creating an anoxic zone at the bottom of the reactor besides this a high f m ratio under anoxic conditions promotes the rapid uptake of substrates and denitrification similar to the conventional sbr thereafter in the react phase aeration is provided for 120 min subsequently the settle stage lasts for 60 min to ensure the adequate settling of suspended sludge and clarify the treated water the effluent from aer is fed in vgs for 120 min followed by 120 min of idle pause table 1 this prevents flooding and rotting of roots and simultaneously enhances oxygenation the vgs consumes any residual cod and nutrients during the trickling of water 2 4 physico chemical analysis the water samples were analyzed as per the standard methods 16 all the samples were subjected to filtration using grade 1 whatman filter paper before chemical analysis excluding untreated greywater in brief the chemical oxygen demand cod was conducted by the micro digestion closed reflux titrimetric method the do concentrations were estimated with the help of a ysi professional plus meter connected to a polarimetric sensor the ph was measured with a tabletop eutech instrument the ammonia was quantified using steam distillation in pelican kelplus equipment followed by acid base titration the samples for total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were acid digested followed by distillation and titration the anionic surfactants as expressed as methylene blue active substances mbas were extracted with chloroform and then analyzed in the spectrophotometer using las linear alkylbenzene sulfonate as a standard the non ionic surfactants were estimated according to the method described by toei et al 1982 using triton x 100 as the reference standard 17 the total phosphorous tp in the samples was quantified by the persulfate digestion method followed by spectrophotometric quantification using the ascorbic acid method nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 concentrations in the water were quantified using hach reagents nitraver 5 and nitriver 3 respectively in a hach drb5000 spectrophotometer the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured gravimetrically the physical properties of sludge in sbr such as sludge volume index svi and zone settling was studied by removing some amount of sludge from the reactor at the end of the study period the size of the microbial sludge particles granules was estimated using a compound microscope fitted with an oculometer before the experiment the oculometer was calibrated using a stage micrometer the granules shape was assumed to be spherical and the presented data is an average of 100 different randomly selected sludge granules the growth longitudinal length of 10 different stems of s trilobata were monitored for 30 days the ts and vs of 10 different stems each of 15 cm length from the tip were analyzed gravimetrically based on the aforementioned gravimetric data the growth rate per day mm d and biomass production rate per day vs mg d of s trilobata was estimated control indicates s trilobata growing on the soil in its natural habitat the c h n composition of s trilobata were analyzed in thermo scientific flash 2000 organic elemental analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and pqs ss 2m 6 5 mm column helium gas was used as a carrier and reference whereas o2 was used for combustion oven temperature and furnace temperature maintained at 75 c and 900 c respectively 2 5 faecal coliform the faecal coliform was isolated from sewage with the help of tryptone phosphate broth followed by levine s eosin methylene blue agar and macconkey agar the isolated colonies were cultivated and maintained in luria bertani broth miller lbbm at 44 0 5 c the quantitative assay of faecal coliform in lbbm and bioreactor samples were conducted using the membrane filtration technique the assay was performed in sterile and disposable cellulose membrane filters petri plates cellulose pads respectively using m fc broth base and rosolic acid incubated at 44 0 5 c approximately 106 cfu 100 ml were dosed in the untreated gw continuously for 60 days to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment processes for the reduction in the population of coliforms 3 results and discussion 3 1 gw composition in household the water consumption in the household comprising 2 adults and 2 children was estimated to be in the range of 250 300 l day 62 75 l cap day lpcd with approximately 40 bw and 60 gw the water usage was somewhat lower than the per capita water supply in bengaluru india however it was lower by 2 6 times when compared to the per capita water consumption in developed countries 18 19 the gw had a comparatively lower cod tkn tss and tp than bw table 2 which may be attributed to the higher volume of water usage in gw fraction and other biological factors such as i a healthy individual discharges 7 16 g n d 1 4 g p d primarily via urine and feces 20 ii the undigested and unwanted food components mainly the undigested fibers are discharged via feces that contribute to higher ts vs in bw 20 the bod cod ratio of gw was 0 59 indicating high biodegradability the bod cod ratio in bw was 0 19 this was intriguing considering the biogenic origin of its decomposable c within table 2 the low bod cod ratio in bw may be attributed to the inhibition of bod assimilating microbes by the relatively higher levels of nh3 n 21 the coliform content was relatively higher in bw due to the discharge of enteric coliforms via feces on the other hand coliforms discarded during bathing hand wash laundry etc culminate in gw the household chemicals are mainly discharged through the gw route therefore the as and nis were higher in gw when compared to bw the gw discharged in western countries contain anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants at average concentrations of 41 1 1 7 11 3 mg l respectively together contributing 15 of the total cod 22 in comparison the estimated surfactant concentrations in gw were significantly lower presenting lower challenges during biological microbial treatment based on the experience gained in this study it is important to reiterate that quantifying the exact water usage and pollutant contributions by various household activities such as cooking hand wash bath etc is essential however this is often challenging due to the reluctance of the residents in sharing data and the perception that it breaches social privacy 3 2 cod removal and ph status in the 3 stage sequential process the bioreactors were fed with synthetic gw with a cod ranging between 250 and 300 mg l fig 2 the composition of synthetic gw was in concordance with the household gw except for the ph the low ph e g 7 in household gw can be attributed to the fermentation of compounds in the collection tank and the mixing of fresh gw with the previous days partially degraded gw in contrast the relatively high ph in the synthetic gw was contributed by the laundry detergent and gw was prepared daily to avoid the reduction in ph due to microbial spoilage during the start up and stabilization stages days 0 100 anbr discharged effluent at an average cod of 139 6 21 mg l 49 20 cod removal fig 2 subsequent decomposition of the residual compounds in aer reduced the cod to 85 3 15 4 mg l 38 89 cod removal finally vgs reduced the cod to 25 5 8 8 mg l 70 15 cod removal the fraction of total cod removed by anbr aer and vgs was 49 20 19 76 and 21 77 respectively the cod removal efficiency of the combined processes was 90 73 during the days 0 100 the ph of anbr aer and vgs was 7 4 0 1 7 7 0 2 7 8 0 1 respectively supplementary data 3 after 100 days the cod decomposition in anbr increased to 75 54 or effluent cod reducing to 68 7 21 1 mg l thereby reducing the subsequent influx of cod in aer and thereafter in vgs secondary treatment in aer led to the reduction in effluent cod to 44 6 11 4 mg l 35 02 cod removal on a few occasions aer discharged effluents with cod 30 mg l however the overall effluent cod prevailed between 25 and 50 mg l thereafter tertiary treatment in vgs led to a reduction in cod to 18 7 1 8 mg l 58 00 cod removal the fraction of total cod removed by anbr aer and vgs was 75 54 8 57 and 9 22 respectively at steady state 100 200 days the combined processes achieved a cod removal efficiency of 93 33 between days 0 100 the average organic loading rate olr in aer was 139 6 2 mg l d whereas the aerial loading rate alr in vgs was 3553 3 643 5 mg m2 d a relatively high cod removal i e 75 54 in anbr offers several advantages such as i anaerobic processes generate low sludge per unit c removal and consume low operational energy ii low olr in the subsequent aer results in lower sludge production less oxygen demand and a lower rate of aeration resulting in low operational energy demand and operational costs the acclimatization period of anbr was approximately 100 days which was unexpectedly longer than the reported acclimatization time for anaerobic biofilm reactors at similar loading rates this can be attributed to the presence of synthetic household products in gw such as laundry detergent and handwash the household products comprised of recalcitrant compounds such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonate las alkyl benzene sulfate triclosan triclocarban have been reported to inhibit anaerobic bacteria 23 furthermore the selective inhibition of methanogens and syntrophic microbes results in the accumulation of metabolites and vfa and reduction in ph which was evident in anbr fig 3a 24 despite a comparatively lower cod in typical household gw the inhibitory effects of the gw constituents will be vital in deciding the process parameters such as startup time hrt olr thus the treatment of low strength wastewater 500 mg l such as gw at higher olr by a simultaneous reduction in hrt would be counterintuitive due to the inhibitory effects of synthetic household products 25 following the acclimatization and process stabilization i e after 100 days anbr exhibited an increase in cod removal from 49 20 to 75 54 the average olr in aer reduced to 68 7 21 1 mg l d whereas alr in vgs reduced to 1859 8 475 4 mg m2 d lower olr in both aer and vgs improved the overall effluent quality further expected to reduce the sludge production and energy consumption in aer improve the oxygen transfer both in aer and roots of s trilobata respectively at steady states the effluent ph in anbr aer and vgs were 7 1 0 1 7 7 0 2 7 6 0 2 respectively supplementary data 3 relatively higher ph in aer and vgs than anbr can be attributed to the metabolism of residual vfas formation of bicarbonates and carbonates 26 a majority of cod removal took place in anbr despite the presence of recalcitrant household chemicals hence retrospecting the cod removal and ph reduction in the different biofilm chambers is vital for process optimization the water samples collected from each chamber of anbr via the sampling point revealed that a major extent of treatment takes place in sc fig 3a and b followed by pc whereas fc exhibited insignificant reductions in both cod and turbidity on average 58 48 and 71 71 reduction in cod and turbidity respectively took place in sc the average turbidity of the fc was marginally higher than the other zones that could be attributed to the gentle agitation created by the fluidized pvc biofilm media the reduction in ph from 8 8 to 7 2 in sc could be attributed to the conversion of cod into volatile fatty acids vfas and metabolites the current findings correspond with our previous studies on anaerobic biofilm reactors 15 the fc and pc subsequently enhanced the cod removal by 2 08 and 14 97 respectively around 71 71 and 10 70 reduction in turbidity was observed in sc and pc the relatively higher rate of treatment in sc with a simultaneous reduction in ph is attributed to the higher population of the acidogenic microbes and lower population of methanogens corresponds to our findings reported in previous studies 15 the eminent treatment performance of the coir fiber based biofilm support medium can be attributed to the following firstly the biofilms growing on lignocellulosic materials withstand shocks of long term starvation as well as frequent organic overloads secondly the biofilms produced have very few extracellular polysaccharides and are not easily washed off during stressed periods 27 3 3 turbidity reduction and sludge characteristics in addition to high cod removal the anbr exhibited higher removal of suspended solids and dissolved solids the turbidity of anbr effluent was 16 3 7 8 ntu between days 0 100 75 78 removal which reduced to 11 5 3 4 ntu between days 100 200 81 82 removal supplementary data 4 this indicates a lower production of sludge and longer intervals between disposal the 26 34 improvement in cod reduction of anbr after 100 days resulted in a 6 00 enhancement in turbidity removal the turbidity of aer effluent 21 5 3 6 ntu was higher than anbr between 0 and 100 days attributed to the washout of suspended microbes subsequently the turbidity was reduced to 5 2 2 6 ntu i e 9 91 increase in turbidity removal after 100 days of operation the reduction in input cod in aer coupled with an increase in flocs formation is believed to have contributed to the reduction in turbidity supplementary data 4 an upflow mode of feeding in aer leads to the washout of suspended and filamentous microbes simultaneously fostering the growth of dense and low bulking sludge a low bulking sludge is often characterized by the following i formation of sludge flocs and sludge granules i e 1 mm leading to faster settling velocity of the sludge ii low sludge volume index svi 150 ml g 28 the results indicated a significantly higher sludge settling velocity of 0 48 0 10 m min that can be attributed to the larger diameter of the sludge floc of 2 18 0 98 mm and low svi value of 105 26 3 24 table 3 a higher sludge settling velocity in comparison to the upflow velocity of incoming feed prevents the washout of microbes and maintains the desired concentration of mlvss the tertiary treatment in vgs demonstrated excellent turbidity removal discharging effluent with 0 9 0 1 ntu before 100 days and 0 8 0 1 ntu after 100 days 7 03 increase in turbidity removal reduction in turbidity by the vgs can be attributed to the slow filtration accomplished by the series of gravel planter beds functioning similarly to the conventional high rate sand filtration the entire process achieved an overall turbidity removal of 98 76 and is an important achievement of this process 3 4 removal of surfactants the sources of surfactants in gw were detergents used in various household activities as well as the more recent rise in the use of hand wash gels sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates las sdbs were the primary groups of as listed in the product labels the concentrations of as in the aforementioned products have been reported earlier 29 the anbr reduced the concentration of as from 16 2 mg l to 14 57 mg l at a steady state with a subsequent reduction to 2 95 mg l in aer fig 4 finally the deployment of vgs reduced the surfactant concentration to an average of 1 17 mg l the entire process achieved a total as removal of 92 77 out of which 71 72 reduction took place predominantly in the aer as are organic compounds that also contribute to the measurable cod the corresponding cod of sds and las have been reported to be 2 221 mg cod mg as 29 thus the reduction of as in the bioreactors corresponds to an equivalent cod reduction of 3 61 mg l 25 8 mg l and 3 95 mg l in anbr aer and vgs respectively in this study therefore the removal of 25 mg cod l in aer could be attributed mostly to the removal of as fig 2 the results vindicated that anbr selectively metabolized the easily degradable carbon compounds in the gw such as starch and other compounds whereas the residual recalcitrant compounds such as as were predominantly removed in the aer and vgs the results imply that treatment of a typical household gw in a solitary anaerobic process would not be adequate to remove all the pollutants and needs to be augmented with aerobic processes to ensure the degradation of surfactants and xenobiotics commonly used household products the typical inhibitory concentrations of anionic surfactants for anaerobic microbes and aerobic microbes are 18 9 mg l and 20 mg l 30 31 the reported mechanisms for as removal in the bioreactor are as follows i mineralization of the as into gaseous compounds such as co2 ch4 h2s cl2 dechlorination n2 denitrification predominantly under aerobic conditions 32 ii partial breakdown of the structure and loss of functional property under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions 33 iii immobilization of as on the biofilms sludge and gravel bed in vgs respectively due to the surface affinity and adsorption properties 34 the inefficient removal of as in anbr may be attributed to their recalcitrance under anaerobic conditions and also their bactericidal effects on the contrary the broad metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and the high rate of adsorption could have facilitated the removal of as in aer 35 36 3 5 removal of n p in the 3 stage treatment process and growth of s trilobata the tkn concentration of the gw was 24 41 0 84 mg l where as the overall tkn loading rate in the 3 stage treatment process was 10 82 mg l d the effluent tkn concentration in anbr was 21 60 1 42 mg l at an influent tkn concentration of 24 41 0 84 mg l exhibiting an n removal of 11 50 fig 5 the residual tkn discharged by anbr existed primarily in the form of soluble nh3 nh4 subsequent treatment in aer reduced the tkn concentration from 21 6 mg l to 17 76 mg l nearly 1 48 mg l of the transformed tkn in aer accumulated as no3 with trace concentrations of no2 contributing to a total n reduction by 9 71 fig 5 tertiary treatment in vgs discharged effluent with tkn and no3 concentration of 2 09 0 81 and 9 08 1 62 respectively primarily due to the nitrification process vgs exhibited an 88 25 reduction in the influent tkn out of which 37 80 persisted in the form of no3 vgs contributed to an overall n removal of 33 02 whereas the 3 stage combined process achieved a total n removal of 54 23 at steady state 100d a sequential reduction in the cod n ratio was observed in each of the processes starting with untreated gw 11 8 the effluent of anbr 3 18 aer 2 32 and vgs 1 67 respectively relatively higher carbon removal and lower n removal in anbr were expected however lower n removal in aer 37 38 was intriguing and could be attributed to the following i a deficit in organic carbon source c n of 3 18 to drive the nitrification denitrification steps ii the effluent discharged by anbr was mainly composed of undecomposed surfactants and other relatively difficult to degrade organic carbon these compounds have deleterious effects on aerobic bacteria and are known to reduce the growth rate and metabolism including nitrifiers 39 iii in a conventional aerobic treatment process around 40 of the cod is converted to cell mass 40 since n is an essential component of cell mass it is readily consumed from the wastewater along with cod on the contrary the rate of sludge generation in aer was relatively low with an increase in sludge concentration from 100 mg l vs to 550 mg l vs in 200 days primarily due to lower olr 68 mg l d caused by mineralization of cod in anbr and the washout of suspended microbes in days 0 100 the n removal in vgs takes place through two different routes i uptake by growing plants and the formation of plant biomass via the consumption of both the reduced and oxidized forms of n no3 ii mineralization of n by the nitrifying denitrifying microbes inhabiting the planter beds at steady states the total n removal by the vgs was estimated to be 806 26 mg n d or 3359 41 mg n m2 d out of which 29 77 mg n d i e 3 69 or 124 04 mg n m2 d is transformed into biomass table 4 and the remaining n i e 776 49 mg n d or 3235 375 mg n m2 d 96 31 is mineralized via denitrification a marginal reduction in ph from 7 8 to 7 6 during the steady state operation in vgs was indicative of ph reduction during nitrification denitrification the s trilobata demonstrated a 4 times higher growth rate and biomass production in vgs than the growth under control e g outdoor soil and natural sunlight table 4 this could be attributed to the continuous illumination adequate availability of water and nutrients n p etc the accumulation of c in vgs biomass amounted to 373 43 mg c d or 1555 95 mg m2 d furthermore the results implied that the illustrated model of treatment and the partially treated gw discharged by aer did not exhibit inhibitory effects on s trilobata the concentration of influent p 1 13 0 05 mg l was relatively lower in gw in comparison to the municipal sewage 41 at an overall tp loading rate of 0 50 mg l d the total p removal in the 3 stages sequential process was 97 19 with 51 45 removal in anbr and a subsequent 45 74 removal in aer supplementary data 5 p is an essential component in the formation of biomass hence bio accumulation is the primary route for p uptake in all the three bioreactors processes whereas removal of p via precipitation and polyphosphate accumulation by the aerobic bacteria are the other known mechanisms that could influence the p removal 42 however the 3 stage treatment process was envisaged to operate on a long term without the common practice of frequent sludge wasting i e daily weekly hence prolonged holding of sludge in anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors exacerbate the putrefaction of dead microbes subsequently releasing p in water 42 therefore periodic removal of biomass from the aerobic bioreactor e g lower solids retention time and relatively less frequently from the anaerobic bioreactor is essential to reduce the effluent p content the estimated p uptake by the vgs was 1 94 0 73 mg d at an influent p of 3 2 mg d indicating that the bioaccumulation accounted for around 64 p removal however the effluent concentration of p in vgs was nearly identical to the influent in other words the p removal was insignificant the aforementioned results were in contradiction because the influent was the only source for p for biomass growth therefore the relatively higher p concentration in vgs effluent can be attributed to the simultaneous decomposition and leaching of p by the dead leaf litter stem and roots in the gravel bed respectively further research is necessary to quantify the speciation the 3 stage treatment process was designed to offer a longer period between sludge removal i e long srt sludge removal 2 3 times a year to reduce the periodic maintenance associated with sludge disposal hence a trade off with p uptake could be expected in this process 3 6 faecal coliform the recycling of treated gw for non potable applications requires strict adherence to health safety especially against human enteric pathogens generally proxied as faecal coliform at an influent coliform count of 6 logs cfu 100 ml the sequential reduction in faecel coliform was 0 79 1 62 and 1 54 log cfu 100 ml in anbr aer and vgs respectively supplementary data 6 the treatment system exhibited an overall cfu reduction of 99 959 attaining the non potable recycling standards of 103 cfu 100 ml prescribed by who both aer and vgs demonstrated relatively higher capabilities in coliform removal than anbr predation by protozoans and zoogleans whereas the adsorption to the sludge and gravel bed are the primarily reported mechanisms for the coliform removal in the microbial and phytoremediation systems techniques and is believed to be functioning similarly here too 43 3 7 comparison with other processes the anoxic anaerobic stage generally succeeds the aeration step in aerobic processes such as activated sludge and sequential batch reactor e g aerobic anaerobic to achieve denitrification and selective outgrowth of the populations of filamentous bacteria 44 in several instances the aerobic sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion to recover the energy via biogas 45 in contrast the sequential anaerobic aerobic treatment as described in this study leads to the primary conversion of aquatic pollutants to biogas resulting in the lower input of c in the subsequent aerobic stage this results in the lowering of hrt aeration requirement sludge production operational energy demand and maintenance respectively 46 a comparison of the above two sequential processes e g aerobic anaerobic and anaerobic aerobic have their advantages and disadvantages often dictated by the purpose of their applications both the processes can achieve similar levels of carbon removal however the aerobic anaerobic is more superior in achieving nitrogen and phosphorous removal from the wastewater and requires higher operational energy maintenance costs etc 47 48 the anaerobic aerobic on the other hand would require comparatively lesser operational energy maintenances and costs and suited for decentralized household level recycling the residual pollutants escaping the anaerobic aerobic treatment are subsequently removed by the vgs 4 conclusion the per capita generation of gw 62 75 l cap day in india was significantly lower due to a relatively lower volume of water supply the lower volume of water consumption for daily household activities resulted in the generation of gw containing a high concentration of pollutants the 3 stage treatment process discharged an effluent with a cod of 18 7 1 8 mg l and turbidity of 0 8 0 1 ntu at an olr of 123 mg l d and hrt of 2 25 d the formation of sludge flocs in aer after 100 days of operation resulted in the reduction in effluent turbidity from 20 ntu to 5 ntu the predominant removal of as took place in aer i e 71 72 due to the broader metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria while the combined system attained an overall 92 77 removal the treatment system achieved an overall n removal of 54 23 with the highest removal in vgs the aerobic microbes exhibited a lower rate of nitrification due to the inhibition of nitrifiers by the as the total p removal in the treatment system was 97 19 with 51 45 removal in anbr and 45 74 removal in aer the treatment system exhibited an overall cfu reduction to 103 cfu 100 ml from an influent value of 106 cfu 100 m l declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support from imprint ministry of human resource

13360,non potable reuse of treated greywater gw within households can reduce daily freshwater consumption and provide water security urban household in india was estimated to discharge 38 45 l gw

bench scale 3 stage sequential gw treatment process was optimized and its long term performance was demonstrated with synthetic gw feedstock corresponding to the aforementioned characteristics the treatment process comprises a multi chambered upflow anaerobic biofilm reactor anbr followed by an upflow aerobic reactor aer and vertical greenery system vgs inhabited by flowering creeper sphagneticola trilobata at steady state hrt of 2 25 day the process achieved the following pollutant removal as cod 93 23 turbidity ntu 98 75 total nitrogen tn 54 23 tp 96 42 as 92 97 faecal coliform

influent c n ratio of 3 18 the acclimatization of vgs to the tertiary treatment process exhibited an aerial biomass production rate of 5063 37 mg ts m2 d the treated water attained the standards for household recycling as prescribed by who graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords greywater blackwater anaerobic biofilm reactor sequential batch reactor vertical greenery system 1 introduction wastewater discharged by households can be primarily classified as greywater gw and blackwater bw 1 the treatment and recycling of gw within the household for non potable secondary reuse can reduce the consumption of freshwater and simultaneously provide year round water security the requisite for a rational concept of household gw recycling is i treatment of gw up to reusable water standards by processes that generate low sludge consume less operational energy are easy to operate and maintain by the user ii ancillary plumbing lines to segregate the untreated gw untreated bw and treated gw anaerobic aerobic and phytoremediation are the commonly used biological processes for wastewater treatment anaerobic treatment of wastewater consumes lower energy and generates low sludge whereas ineffectual in the mineralization of ammonia and phosphate 2 furthermore anaerobic microbes are susceptible to inhibition against household chemicals personal care and pharma products 3 aerobic treatment on the one hand requires a shorter startup time and on the other hand exhibit ability to mineralize recalcitrant compounds with a relatively higher rate of removal of carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorous p 4 on the other hand aerobic processes demand a relatively higher operational energy resulting from operations such as aeration mixing and downstream sludge processing etc 5 sludge generated by aerobic process amounts to 40 50 of the input c requires frequent removal from the reactor that would otherwise lead to operational discrepancies such as lower hrt inefficient treatment hindered sludge settling due to sludge bulking sludge foaming higher oxygen demand etc 6 vertical greenery systems vgs also referred to as green walls green fa√ßade living walls vertical gardens are a modification to the conventional concept of phytoremediation constructed wetlands 7 vgs is implemented in two distinct design configurations i the planter beds are modular in design arranged in vertical racking such that excess water cascades downwards through a series of planter beds from the top to bottom while the vegetation is primarily composed of non climbers and shrubs ii the planter bed is stationed at the ground level whereas the vines climbers proliferate on walls facades 7 the commonly used plant species in vgs are hereda helix parthenocissus tricuspidata wisteria sp fruits species such as luffa sp phaseolus vulgaris etc 8 vgs is suitable for the treatment of low strength wastewater and exhibits various advantages such as lower operational energy requirement ease of operation n and p removal lower footprint demand in comparison to conventional phytoremediation and horizontal wetlands 9 in contrast vgs suffers from issues common to phytoremediation such as the light requirement for photosynthesis clogging of growth substratum flooding low oxygen transfer to the roots at higher hydraulic and organic loads 10 thus it could be envisaged that a standalone process would be ineffectual in achieving the holistic treatment of household gw therefore a combination of multiple processes comprising anaerobic aerobic and vgs is desirable the primary treatment of gw in the anaerobic reactor would facilitate the decomposition of the easily degradable fraction at a relatively low sludge production and energy requirement 2 5 of c input subsequently treatment in the aerobic reactor would lead to the removal of residual c n p household chemical compounds and de odorization with low input energy finally the low levels of residual n p and suspended solids in water would be removed in vgs comprising ornamental flowering plants besides vgs could enhance aesthetics thermal insulation urban biodiversity air quality etc 7 11 the relatively lower influx of pollutants in vgs along with the oxygenated water discharged by the aerobic process would reduce the toxicity exhibited by wastewater provide aeration to the roots reduce the growth of heterotrophic microbes in planter beds resulting in the need for high oxygen transfer and simultaneously prolonging the life of vegetation the two stage treatment of 10 m3 sewage per day in a uasb reactor followed by the aerobic reactor discharged an effluent with a bod of 30 mg l 12 the uasb reactor exhibited 36 removal of solids and 34 cod removal at hrt of 3 2 h whereas the subsequent treatment took place in the aerobic reactor at hrt of 3 h in another study the sequential treatment of municipal wastewater in a uasb reactor followed by an aerobic reactor achieved an overall treatment of 93 at a total hrt of 7 9 h 13 the treatment of greywater in a sequential anaerobic aerobic reactor was demonstrated during the summer and winter seasons 14 the treatment performances of anaerobic aerobic reactors in the winter and summer seasons were 45 39 and 53 64 respectively the treated water quality met the standards for irrigation except for the pathogen concentrations by contemplating the potency of each process this research aims to converge them to a 3 stage sequential gw treatment process comprising a multi chamber anaerobic biofilm reactor aerobic sequencing batch reactor and vertical greenery system vgs that raises ornamental flowering plants such as sphagneticola trilobata the 3 stage treatment process is hypothesized to enhance the robustness of the overall treatment processes including the quality of treated water and protect against shock loads respectively the key objectives are i quantitative and qualitative characterization of the gw and bw discharged by a household ii design optimize and demonstrate the treatment performance of the 3 stage sequential gw treatment process at a bench scale iii study the viability of s trilobata in the tertiary treatment of gw 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection gw and bw samples were collected from a household located in bengaluru india that consisted of separate plumbing lines for the discharge of gw and bw the gw was collected in an underground tank of 500 l placed in the setback of the house bw was collected in a makeshift underground tank of 30 l that was discharged from 3 different toilets in the house the water samples were collected from these tanks daily 6 days week for a month generally between 11 am 1 pm and transferred immediately to the laboratory for analysis 2 2 bioreactor setup a sketch of the treatment setup is shown in fig 1 and supplementary data 1 and 2 the anaerobic biofilm reactor anbr was fabricated in stainless steel cylindrical l 0 93 m d 0 4 m working volume of around 100 l it comprised 3 internal chambers of 30 l working volume each whereas the top overflow and headspace zones had a capacity of 10 l each respectively the bottom chamber is composed of sludge sludge chamber sc the middle chamber contains fluidized biofilm support material made up of pvc spiral fluidized chamber fc the top chamber situated above the fc contains a packed bed of washed and retted coir cocos nucifera fiber acting as biofilter packed chamber pc to trap the suspended matter the physical properties of support materials have been reported previously 15 the quantity of pvc spiral in fc and coir in pc was 2 28 and 1 3 kg respectively the 3 chambers were fitted with sampling ports the gw inlet port was present at sc whereas the outlet port at the top overflow a peristaltic pump recirculated water from the overflow into the sc at predetermined periodic intervals at a rate of 1 25 l min with an overall recycling volume of 300 l d table 1 the aerobic reactor aer l 0 55 m d 0 5 m was fabricated from commercially available polyethylene barrels with a working volume of 100 l an external air pump supplied air at the bottom of aer with the help of a ceramic diffuser at a rate of 2 0 5 lpm attaining a peak dissolved oxygen do concentration in aer between 2 and 2 5 mg l the airflow rate was controlled with the help of a rotameter an inlet port was placed at the bottom whereas the outlet port was at the top the vgs comprised 3 columns each column containing 6 planter beds arranged in succession with a total of 18 planter beds fig 1 the planter bed was made up of polyethylene resembling the frustum of a cone with an approximate empty volume of 4 76 l the top and bottom cross sectional areas were 0 08 m2 0 008 m2 respectively and height of 0 16 m the floor space usage of vgs e g aerial footprint was 0 24 m2 due to the vertical arrangement of the planter beds the planter bed comprised 4 perforations of 5 mm diameter at the bottom to ensure drainage of water to the successive planter beds placed below a collection container was placed at the bottom of each column to receive the drained water the 3 collection containers were connected in series to ensure the exit of treated water through one outlet the planter beds were packed with 3 different gravel sizes top bed 1 l empty volume grain size 2 mm middle bed 2 l empty volume grain size 10 12 mm bottom bed grain size 17 24 mm 1 l empty volume the gravel bed provided physical support to the vegetation besides the trickling of water through the gravel bed slowed the descent of water simultaneously increasing the contact time with roots sphagneticola trilobata an ornamental flowering creeper commonly called wedelia singapore daisy creeping daisy was propagated in the planter beds supplementary data 1 and 2 s trilobata stem cuttings of 200 250 mm length containing 4 6 nodes were collected from the plant nursery at the indian institute of science in each planter bed 3 stems were equidistantly buried up to 50 of the length s trilobata was chosen due to the following reasons easy availability across the world ability to creep across a wall hedge maximizing the surface area for light capture perennial and tropical nature ease of vegetative propagation through the stem cuttings year round flowering adapts to high sunlight as well growth in the shade is moderately tolerant to drought and flooding optimum growth between ph 5 5 7 5 vgs was continuously illuminated with led panels on all four sides at an intensity of 627 137 lx 2 3 bioreactor operation the chemical constituents of the synthetically prepared gw feed mimicking household conditions are as follows arrowroot starch 160 mg l laundry detergent 100 mg l liquid handwash 100 mg l urea co nh2 2 53 mg l kh2po4 5 mg l the feed was prepared daily in tap water and stored in the gw feed tank all the bioreactors were operated at room temperatures varying between 22 26 c at designated intervals anbr was fed with untreated gw using a peristaltic pump i e gw feed pump the incoming feed displaced the partially treated water from anbr into aer subsequently the partially treated water in aer was displaced via gravity and collected in a holding tank a dosing pump i e vgs feed pump delivered water from the holding tank to the drip manifold for a designated period the evenly distributed water in the manifold dribbled through the orifice to each column of vgs by gravity subsequently water trickled vertically down through successive planter beds planted with s trilobata and finally collected in the collection container the anbr and aer were operated in an upflow mode whereas vgs was operated in downflow mode the operation of the reactors e g feeding recycling and aeration were controlled automatically using timer relay controllers table 1 the samples for physicochemical analysis were collected from the gw feed tank the outlet of the anbr aer and vgs respectively the anbr and aer were subjected to an initial startup time of 30 days and subsequently operated at full scale the vgs was started afterward and commenced the operation from the 44th day as shown in fig 2 the upflow movement of gw in anbr at a velocity of 0 16 m h leads to the decomposition of compounds to vfas and subsequently to biogas recycling of water within anbr enhances the dispersal of the substrate metabolites nutrients and volatile fatty acids vfa altogether enhancing the rates of cod removal the operation of aer was similar to the conventional sequencing batch reactor sbr with four distinct steps taking place sequentially in one reactor called fill react settle draw however in this research draw and fill steps happen simultaneously due to the introduction of anbr effluent at the bottom of aer leading to the displacement of treated water from the top it avoided the use of a suction pump decanter in the fill stage partially treated water discharged by anbr is introduced at the bottom of aer for 50 min at an upflow velocity of 0 08 m h during the fill stage the influent comes in contact with the settled sludge at the bottom zone of aer creating an anoxic zone at the bottom of the reactor besides this a high f m ratio under anoxic conditions promotes the rapid uptake of substrates and denitrification similar to the conventional sbr thereafter in the react phase aeration is provided for 120 min subsequently the settle stage lasts for 60 min to ensure the adequate settling of suspended sludge and clarify the treated water the effluent from aer is fed in vgs for 120 min followed by 120 min of idle pause table 1 this prevents flooding and rotting of roots and simultaneously enhances oxygenation the vgs consumes any residual cod and nutrients during the trickling of water 2 4 physico chemical analysis the water samples were analyzed as per the standard methods 16 all the samples were subjected to filtration using grade 1 whatman filter paper before chemical analysis excluding untreated greywater in brief the chemical oxygen demand cod was conducted by the micro digestion closed reflux titrimetric method the do concentrations were estimated with the help of a ysi professional plus meter connected to a polarimetric sensor the ph was measured with a tabletop eutech instrument the ammonia was quantified using steam distillation in pelican kelplus equipment followed by acid base titration the samples for total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were acid digested followed by distillation and titration the anionic surfactants as expressed as methylene blue active substances mbas were extracted with chloroform and then analyzed in the spectrophotometer using las linear alkylbenzene sulfonate as a standard the non ionic surfactants were estimated according to the method described by toei et al 1982 using triton x 100 as the reference standard 17 the total phosphorous tp in the samples was quantified by the persulfate digestion method followed by spectrophotometric quantification using the ascorbic acid method nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 concentrations in the water were quantified using hach reagents nitraver 5 and nitriver 3 respectively in a hach drb5000 spectrophotometer the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss total solids ts and volatile solids vs were measured gravimetrically the physical properties of sludge in sbr such as sludge volume index svi and zone settling was studied by removing some amount of sludge from the reactor at the end of the study period the size of the microbial sludge particles granules was estimated using a compound microscope fitted with an oculometer before the experiment the oculometer was calibrated using a stage micrometer the granules shape was assumed to be spherical and the presented data is an average of 100 different randomly selected sludge granules the growth longitudinal length of 10 different stems of s trilobata were monitored for 30 days the ts and vs of 10 different stems each of 15 cm length from the tip were analyzed gravimetrically based on the aforementioned gravimetric data the growth rate per day mm d and biomass production rate per day vs mg d of s trilobata was estimated control indicates s trilobata growing on the soil in its natural habitat the c h n composition of s trilobata were analyzed in thermo scientific flash 2000 organic elemental analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and pqs ss 2m 6 5 mm column helium gas was used as a carrier and reference whereas o2 was used for combustion oven temperature and furnace temperature maintained at 75 c and 900 c respectively 2 5 faecal coliform the faecal coliform was isolated from sewage with the help of tryptone phosphate broth followed by levine s eosin methylene blue agar and macconkey agar the isolated colonies were cultivated and maintained in luria bertani broth miller lbbm at 44 0 5 c the quantitative assay of faecal coliform in lbbm and bioreactor samples were conducted using the membrane filtration technique the assay was performed in sterile and disposable cellulose membrane filters petri plates cellulose pads respectively using m fc broth base and rosolic acid incubated at 44 0 5 c approximately 106 cfu 100 ml were dosed in the untreated gw continuously for 60 days to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment processes for the reduction in the population of coliforms 3 results and discussion 3 1 gw composition in household the water consumption in the household comprising 2 adults and 2 children was estimated to be in the range of 250 300 l day 62 75 l cap day lpcd with approximately 40 bw and 60 gw the water usage was somewhat lower than the per capita water supply in bengaluru india however it was lower by 2 6 times when compared to the per capita water consumption in developed countries 18 19 the gw had a comparatively lower cod tkn tss and tp than bw table 2 which may be attributed to the higher volume of water usage in gw fraction and other biological factors such as i a healthy individual discharges 7 16 g n d 1 4 g p d primarily via urine and feces 20 ii the undigested and unwanted food components mainly the undigested fibers are discharged via feces that contribute to higher ts vs in bw 20 the bod cod ratio of gw was 0 59 indicating high biodegradability the bod cod ratio in bw was 0 19 this was intriguing considering the biogenic origin of its decomposable c within table 2 the low bod cod ratio in bw may be attributed to the inhibition of bod assimilating microbes by the relatively higher levels of nh3 n 21 the coliform content was relatively higher in bw due to the discharge of enteric coliforms via feces on the other hand coliforms discarded during bathing hand wash laundry etc culminate in gw the household chemicals are mainly discharged through the gw route therefore the as and nis were higher in gw when compared to bw the gw discharged in western countries contain anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants at average concentrations of 41 1 1 7 11 3 mg l respectively together contributing 15 of the total cod 22 in comparison the estimated surfactant concentrations in gw were significantly lower presenting lower challenges during biological microbial treatment based on the experience gained in this study it is important to reiterate that quantifying the exact water usage and pollutant contributions by various household activities such as cooking hand wash bath etc is essential however this is often challenging due to the reluctance of the residents in sharing data and the perception that it breaches social privacy 3 2 cod removal and ph status in the 3 stage sequential process the bioreactors were fed with synthetic gw with a cod ranging between 250 and 300 mg l fig 2 the composition of synthetic gw was in concordance with the household gw except for the ph the low ph e g 7 in household gw can be attributed to the fermentation of compounds in the collection tank and the mixing of fresh gw with the previous days partially degraded gw in contrast the relatively high ph in the synthetic gw was contributed by the laundry detergent and gw was prepared daily to avoid the reduction in ph due to microbial spoilage during the start up and stabilization stages days 0 100 anbr discharged effluent at an average cod of 139 6 21 mg l 49 20 cod removal fig 2 subsequent decomposition of the residual compounds in aer reduced the cod to 85 3 15 4 mg l 38 89 cod removal finally vgs reduced the cod to 25 5 8 8 mg l 70 15 cod removal the fraction of total cod removed by anbr aer and vgs was 49 20 19 76 and 21 77 respectively the cod removal efficiency of the combined processes was 90 73 during the days 0 100 the ph of anbr aer and vgs was 7 4 0 1 7 7 0 2 7 8 0 1 respectively supplementary data 3 after 100 days the cod decomposition in anbr increased to 75 54 or effluent cod reducing to 68 7 21 1 mg l thereby reducing the subsequent influx of cod in aer and thereafter in vgs secondary treatment in aer led to the reduction in effluent cod to 44 6 11 4 mg l 35 02 cod removal on a few occasions aer discharged effluents with cod 30 mg l however the overall effluent cod prevailed between 25 and 50 mg l thereafter tertiary treatment in vgs led to a reduction in cod to 18 7 1 8 mg l 58 00 cod removal the fraction of total cod removed by anbr aer and vgs was 75 54 8 57 and 9 22 respectively at steady state 100 200 days the combined processes achieved a cod removal efficiency of 93 33 between days 0 100 the average organic loading rate olr in aer was 139 6 2 mg l d whereas the aerial loading rate alr in vgs was 3553 3 643 5 mg m2 d a relatively high cod removal i e 75 54 in anbr offers several advantages such as i anaerobic processes generate low sludge per unit c removal and consume low operational energy ii low olr in the subsequent aer results in lower sludge production less oxygen demand and a lower rate of aeration resulting in low operational energy demand and operational costs the acclimatization period of anbr was approximately 100 days which was unexpectedly longer than the reported acclimatization time for anaerobic biofilm reactors at similar loading rates this can be attributed to the presence of synthetic household products in gw such as laundry detergent and handwash the household products comprised of recalcitrant compounds such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonate las alkyl benzene sulfate triclosan triclocarban have been reported to inhibit anaerobic bacteria 23 furthermore the selective inhibition of methanogens and syntrophic microbes results in the accumulation of metabolites and vfa and reduction in ph which was evident in anbr fig 3a 24 despite a comparatively lower cod in typical household gw the inhibitory effects of the gw constituents will be vital in deciding the process parameters such as startup time hrt olr thus the treatment of low strength wastewater 500 mg l such as gw at higher olr by a simultaneous reduction in hrt would be counterintuitive due to the inhibitory effects of synthetic household products 25 following the acclimatization and process stabilization i e after 100 days anbr exhibited an increase in cod removal from 49 20 to 75 54 the average olr in aer reduced to 68 7 21 1 mg l d whereas alr in vgs reduced to 1859 8 475 4 mg m2 d lower olr in both aer and vgs improved the overall effluent quality further expected to reduce the sludge production and energy consumption in aer improve the oxygen transfer both in aer and roots of s trilobata respectively at steady states the effluent ph in anbr aer and vgs were 7 1 0 1 7 7 0 2 7 6 0 2 respectively supplementary data 3 relatively higher ph in aer and vgs than anbr can be attributed to the metabolism of residual vfas formation of bicarbonates and carbonates 26 a majority of cod removal took place in anbr despite the presence of recalcitrant household chemicals hence retrospecting the cod removal and ph reduction in the different biofilm chambers is vital for process optimization the water samples collected from each chamber of anbr via the sampling point revealed that a major extent of treatment takes place in sc fig 3a and b followed by pc whereas fc exhibited insignificant reductions in both cod and turbidity on average 58 48 and 71 71 reduction in cod and turbidity respectively took place in sc the average turbidity of the fc was marginally higher than the other zones that could be attributed to the gentle agitation created by the fluidized pvc biofilm media the reduction in ph from 8 8 to 7 2 in sc could be attributed to the conversion of cod into volatile fatty acids vfas and metabolites the current findings correspond with our previous studies on anaerobic biofilm reactors 15 the fc and pc subsequently enhanced the cod removal by 2 08 and 14 97 respectively around 71 71 and 10 70 reduction in turbidity was observed in sc and pc the relatively higher rate of treatment in sc with a simultaneous reduction in ph is attributed to the higher population of the acidogenic microbes and lower population of methanogens corresponds to our findings reported in previous studies 15 the eminent treatment performance of the coir fiber based biofilm support medium can be attributed to the following firstly the biofilms growing on lignocellulosic materials withstand shocks of long term starvation as well as frequent organic overloads secondly the biofilms produced have very few extracellular polysaccharides and are not easily washed off during stressed periods 27 3 3 turbidity reduction and sludge characteristics in addition to high cod removal the anbr exhibited higher removal of suspended solids and dissolved solids the turbidity of anbr effluent was 16 3 7 8 ntu between days 0 100 75 78 removal which reduced to 11 5 3 4 ntu between days 100 200 81 82 removal supplementary data 4 this indicates a lower production of sludge and longer intervals between disposal the 26 34 improvement in cod reduction of anbr after 100 days resulted in a 6 00 enhancement in turbidity removal the turbidity of aer effluent 21 5 3 6 ntu was higher than anbr between 0 and 100 days attributed to the washout of suspended microbes subsequently the turbidity was reduced to 5 2 2 6 ntu i e 9 91 increase in turbidity removal after 100 days of operation the reduction in input cod in aer coupled with an increase in flocs formation is believed to have contributed to the reduction in turbidity supplementary data 4 an upflow mode of feeding in aer leads to the washout of suspended and filamentous microbes simultaneously fostering the growth of dense and low bulking sludge a low bulking sludge is often characterized by the following i formation of sludge flocs and sludge granules i e 1 mm leading to faster settling velocity of the sludge ii low sludge volume index svi 150 ml g 28 the results indicated a significantly higher sludge settling velocity of 0 48 0 10 m min that can be attributed to the larger diameter of the sludge floc of 2 18 0 98 mm and low svi value of 105 26 3 24 table 3 a higher sludge settling velocity in comparison to the upflow velocity of incoming feed prevents the washout of microbes and maintains the desired concentration of mlvss the tertiary treatment in vgs demonstrated excellent turbidity removal discharging effluent with 0 9 0 1 ntu before 100 days and 0 8 0 1 ntu after 100 days 7 03 increase in turbidity removal reduction in turbidity by the vgs can be attributed to the slow filtration accomplished by the series of gravel planter beds functioning similarly to the conventional high rate sand filtration the entire process achieved an overall turbidity removal of 98 76 and is an important achievement of this process 3 4 removal of surfactants the sources of surfactants in gw were detergents used in various household activities as well as the more recent rise in the use of hand wash gels sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates las sdbs were the primary groups of as listed in the product labels the concentrations of as in the aforementioned products have been reported earlier 29 the anbr reduced the concentration of as from 16 2 mg l to 14 57 mg l at a steady state with a subsequent reduction to 2 95 mg l in aer fig 4 finally the deployment of vgs reduced the surfactant concentration to an average of 1 17 mg l the entire process achieved a total as removal of 92 77 out of which 71 72 reduction took place predominantly in the aer as are organic compounds that also contribute to the measurable cod the corresponding cod of sds and las have been reported to be 2 221 mg cod mg as 29 thus the reduction of as in the bioreactors corresponds to an equivalent cod reduction of 3 61 mg l 25 8 mg l and 3 95 mg l in anbr aer and vgs respectively in this study therefore the removal of 25 mg cod l in aer could be attributed mostly to the removal of as fig 2 the results vindicated that anbr selectively metabolized the easily degradable carbon compounds in the gw such as starch and other compounds whereas the residual recalcitrant compounds such as as were predominantly removed in the aer and vgs the results imply that treatment of a typical household gw in a solitary anaerobic process would not be adequate to remove all the pollutants and needs to be augmented with aerobic processes to ensure the degradation of surfactants and xenobiotics commonly used household products the typical inhibitory concentrations of anionic surfactants for anaerobic microbes and aerobic microbes are 18 9 mg l and 20 mg l 30 31 the reported mechanisms for as removal in the bioreactor are as follows i mineralization of the as into gaseous compounds such as co2 ch4 h2s cl2 dechlorination n2 denitrification predominantly under aerobic conditions 32 ii partial breakdown of the structure and loss of functional property under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions 33 iii immobilization of as on the biofilms sludge and gravel bed in vgs respectively due to the surface affinity and adsorption properties 34 the inefficient removal of as in anbr may be attributed to their recalcitrance under anaerobic conditions and also their bactericidal effects on the contrary the broad metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria and the high rate of adsorption could have facilitated the removal of as in aer 35 36 3 5 removal of n p in the 3 stage treatment process and growth of s trilobata the tkn concentration of the gw was 24 41 0 84 mg l where as the overall tkn loading rate in the 3 stage treatment process was 10 82 mg l d the effluent tkn concentration in anbr was 21 60 1 42 mg l at an influent tkn concentration of 24 41 0 84 mg l exhibiting an n removal of 11 50 fig 5 the residual tkn discharged by anbr existed primarily in the form of soluble nh3 nh4 subsequent treatment in aer reduced the tkn concentration from 21 6 mg l to 17 76 mg l nearly 1 48 mg l of the transformed tkn in aer accumulated as no3 with trace concentrations of no2 contributing to a total n reduction by 9 71 fig 5 tertiary treatment in vgs discharged effluent with tkn and no3 concentration of 2 09 0 81 and 9 08 1 62 respectively primarily due to the nitrification process vgs exhibited an 88 25 reduction in the influent tkn out of which 37 80 persisted in the form of no3 vgs contributed to an overall n removal of 33 02 whereas the 3 stage combined process achieved a total n removal of 54 23 at steady state 100d a sequential reduction in the cod n ratio was observed in each of the processes starting with untreated gw 11 8 the effluent of anbr 3 18 aer 2 32 and vgs 1 67 respectively relatively higher carbon removal and lower n removal in anbr were expected however lower n removal in aer 37 38 was intriguing and could be attributed to the following i a deficit in organic carbon source c n of 3 18 to drive the nitrification denitrification steps ii the effluent discharged by anbr was mainly composed of undecomposed surfactants and other relatively difficult to degrade organic carbon these compounds have deleterious effects on aerobic bacteria and are known to reduce the growth rate and metabolism including nitrifiers 39 iii in a conventional aerobic treatment process around 40 of the cod is converted to cell mass 40 since n is an essential component of cell mass it is readily consumed from the wastewater along with cod on the contrary the rate of sludge generation in aer was relatively low with an increase in sludge concentration from 100 mg l vs to 550 mg l vs in 200 days primarily due to lower olr 68 mg l d caused by mineralization of cod in anbr and the washout of suspended microbes in days 0 100 the n removal in vgs takes place through two different routes i uptake by growing plants and the formation of plant biomass via the consumption of both the reduced and oxidized forms of n no3 ii mineralization of n by the nitrifying denitrifying microbes inhabiting the planter beds at steady states the total n removal by the vgs was estimated to be 806 26 mg n d or 3359 41 mg n m2 d out of which 29 77 mg n d i e 3 69 or 124 04 mg n m2 d is transformed into biomass table 4 and the remaining n i e 776 49 mg n d or 3235 375 mg n m2 d 96 31 is mineralized via denitrification a marginal reduction in ph from 7 8 to 7 6 during the steady state operation in vgs was indicative of ph reduction during nitrification denitrification the s trilobata demonstrated a 4 times higher growth rate and biomass production in vgs than the growth under control e g outdoor soil and natural sunlight table 4 this could be attributed to the continuous illumination adequate availability of water and nutrients n p etc the accumulation of c in vgs biomass amounted to 373 43 mg c d or 1555 95 mg m2 d furthermore the results implied that the illustrated model of treatment and the partially treated gw discharged by aer did not exhibit inhibitory effects on s trilobata the concentration of influent p 1 13 0 05 mg l was relatively lower in gw in comparison to the municipal sewage 41 at an overall tp loading rate of 0 50 mg l d the total p removal in the 3 stages sequential process was 97 19 with 51 45 removal in anbr and a subsequent 45 74 removal in aer supplementary data 5 p is an essential component in the formation of biomass hence bio accumulation is the primary route for p uptake in all the three bioreactors processes whereas removal of p via precipitation and polyphosphate accumulation by the aerobic bacteria are the other known mechanisms that could influence the p removal 42 however the 3 stage treatment process was envisaged to operate on a long term without the common practice of frequent sludge wasting i e daily weekly hence prolonged holding of sludge in anaerobic and aerobic bioreactors exacerbate the putrefaction of dead microbes subsequently releasing p in water 42 therefore periodic removal of biomass from the aerobic bioreactor e g lower solids retention time and relatively less frequently from the anaerobic bioreactor is essential to reduce the effluent p content the estimated p uptake by the vgs was 1 94 0 73 mg d at an influent p of 3 2 mg d indicating that the bioaccumulation accounted for around 64 p removal however the effluent concentration of p in vgs was nearly identical to the influent in other words the p removal was insignificant the aforementioned results were in contradiction because the influent was the only source for p for biomass growth therefore the relatively higher p concentration in vgs effluent can be attributed to the simultaneous decomposition and leaching of p by the dead leaf litter stem and roots in the gravel bed respectively further research is necessary to quantify the speciation the 3 stage treatment process was designed to offer a longer period between sludge removal i e long srt sludge removal 2 3 times a year to reduce the periodic maintenance associated with sludge disposal hence a trade off with p uptake could be expected in this process 3 6 faecal coliform the recycling of treated gw for non potable applications requires strict adherence to health safety especially against human enteric pathogens generally proxied as faecal coliform at an influent coliform count of 6 logs cfu 100 ml the sequential reduction in faecel coliform was 0 79 1 62 and 1 54 log cfu 100 ml in anbr aer and vgs respectively supplementary data 6 the treatment system exhibited an overall cfu reduction of 99 959 attaining the non potable recycling standards of 103 cfu 100 ml prescribed by who both aer and vgs demonstrated relatively higher capabilities in coliform removal than anbr predation by protozoans and zoogleans whereas the adsorption to the sludge and gravel bed are the primarily reported mechanisms for the coliform removal in the microbial and phytoremediation systems techniques and is believed to be functioning similarly here too 43 3 7 comparison with other processes the anoxic anaerobic stage generally succeeds the aeration step in aerobic processes such as activated sludge and sequential batch reactor e g aerobic anaerobic to achieve denitrification and selective outgrowth of the populations of filamentous bacteria 44 in several instances the aerobic sludge is subjected to anaerobic digestion to recover the energy via biogas 45 in contrast the sequential anaerobic aerobic treatment as described in this study leads to the primary conversion of aquatic pollutants to biogas resulting in the lower input of c in the subsequent aerobic stage this results in the lowering of hrt aeration requirement sludge production operational energy demand and maintenance respectively 46 a comparison of the above two sequential processes e g aerobic anaerobic and anaerobic aerobic have their advantages and disadvantages often dictated by the purpose of their applications both the processes can achieve similar levels of carbon removal however the aerobic anaerobic is more superior in achieving nitrogen and phosphorous removal from the wastewater and requires higher operational energy maintenance costs etc 47 48 the anaerobic aerobic on the other hand would require comparatively lesser operational energy maintenances and costs and suited for decentralized household level recycling the residual pollutants escaping the anaerobic aerobic treatment are subsequently removed by the vgs 4 conclusion the per capita generation of gw 62 75 l cap day in india was significantly lower due to a relatively lower volume of water supply the lower volume of water consumption for daily household activities resulted in the generation of gw containing a high concentration of pollutants the 3 stage treatment process discharged an effluent with a cod of 18 7 1 8 mg l and turbidity of 0 8 0 1 ntu at an olr of 123 mg l d and hrt of 2 25 d the formation of sludge flocs in aer after 100 days of operation resulted in the reduction in effluent turbidity from 20 ntu to 5 ntu the predominant removal of as took place in aer i e 71 72 due to the broader metabolic activities of aerobic bacteria while the combined system attained an overall 92 77 removal the treatment system achieved an overall n removal of 54 23 with the highest removal in vgs the aerobic microbes exhibited a lower rate of nitrification due to the inhibition of nitrifiers by the as the total p removal in the treatment system was 97 19 with 51 45 removal in anbr and 45 74 removal in aer the treatment system exhibited an overall cfu reduction to 103 cfu 100 ml from an influent value of 106 cfu 100 m l declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors acknowledge the financial support from imprint ministry of human resource

13361,fe2 is widely used in wastewater treatment and plays an important role in the anammox system in this study the effects of fe2 on the anammox system was investigated with 0 1 and 5 mm fe2 in reactors during the start up the nitrogen removal performance was changed significantly the nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrogen removal rate reached 94 and 81 5 g n m 3 d 1 in the reactor respectively at the 1 mm fe2 after 63 days of operation moreover the extracellular polymeric substances were improved and showed linear correlation with fe2 concentration the 16s metagenomic analysis proved that fe2 addition increased the relative abundances of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia than that of control the results of rt qpcr also indicated that fe2 oxidation activated the central metabolism by up regulating the key functional genes hdh and hao in anammox bacteria the difference between functional genes and candidatus brocadia abundances in the sludge led to differences in ammonium removal efficiency and nitrite removal efficiency between all reactors because ca brocadia has great influence on anaerobic ammonium oxidation are and nre will be improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge overall the anammox system can be quickly improved even at higher concentrations when the anammox consortium encounter with an appropriate amount of fe2 keywords anammox process candidatus brocadia fe2 microbial abundance nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox produces nitrogen gas from ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 under anoxic conditions 1 this unique process has drawn much attention due to its significant advantages in removing nitrogenous wastes from aquatic systems 2 anammox process entails low operational costs without external carbon substrates and aeration demands despite the eco friendly advantages of an anammox process the start up time during denitrification long doubling time and slow growth rate remains challenging for the engineering applications to overcome these obstacles numerous options have been explored to shorten start up time during annamox process including microchemical treatments anoxic digestion 3 dechlorination 4 nitrate ammonia reduction 5 and some of these technologies are ultrasound and electric file 6 granular activated carbon gac 7 polymeric gels sodium alginate gel bead 8 therefore still further efforts are needed to improve the start up of the anammox system in order to improve the anammox system it is necessary to develop inexpensive and effective strategies for biological denitrification performance hui chen et al 9 suggested that environmental conditions and nutrient methods can be used in industrial applications to optimize the anammox process fe2 is one of the most abundant metals in wastewater 10 11 hence fe2 is relatively cheap readily available and more effective in precipitation pollution control phosphorus and antibiotic removal in sewage treatment plants 12 13 the rapid development of the metallurgy beneficiation processing and machine industries are common causes of the availability of metal ions in nitrogen wastewaters 14 plenty of fe2 and nitrogen compounds on the earth s crust are considered water pollutants that have some inhibitory and toxic effects and can cause toxicity intolerance for denitrifiers and other microorganisms 15 on the other hand these both toxic substances are utilized by anammox bacteria fe2 is the main component of cytochrome c hydrazine dehydrogenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and heme c proteins in anammox bacteria that play central role in anammox metabolism 16 the metabolism of anammox bacteria was regulated by many pathways that are coupled with nitrogen and iron cycling 17 schadler et al 18 reported that after fe2 addition fe2 oxidation takes place inside the cell and then reacts with aqueous solution h2o alternatively ferrous hydroxide generated with releasing h ions during autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification pathways fig s1 these pathways include denitrification no2 to n2 nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo no3 to n2 anammox process nh4 to n2 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra no3 to nh4 under anoxic condition fig s2 moreover fe2 is readily soluble and the more accessible form in nature while fe3 had poor solubility at neutral ph and therefore only available after fe2 oxidation eq 1 19 1 4 fe 2 2 no 2 8 h 4 fe 3 n 2 4 h 2 o the effects of fe2 addition on the anammox process have attracted more attention some studies were conducted on the inhibitory impacts of fe2 addition on microbal growth for example fe2 could exhibit toxic effect on citrobacter pxl1 20 strain 2002 21 e coli peudomonas szf15 22 and bofen1 23 by causing cell membrane damages besides positive regulatory effect of different concentrations of fe2 on the anammox system has been extensively studied huang et al 24 discovered that the higher nitrogen removal was achieved at high fe2 0 08 mm which was almost 15 higher than the lowest fe2 0 04 mm and shu et al 25 also found that low concentration of fe2 at 0 08 mm improved the specific growth rate 0 2648 d 1 than the higher fe2 0 12 mm recently feng et al 26 showed that high concentrations of fe2 25 mg l have no inhibitory effect on marine anammox and zhou et al 27 demonstrated the short term effect of low fe2 at 5 80 mg l was significant for reactor performance although most of the studies have investigated the role of fe2 under different low concentrations in anammox system however the effect of higher optimal fe2 concentration in anammox system is still need to be revealed in order to test our hypothesis we investigated whether the addition of fe2 at higher concentrations 0 mm 1 mm and 5 mm could improve the anammox system during start up using anammox consortia herein the effect of different fe2 concentrations on eps are and nre at constant nitrogen load were investigated after the reactors were operated for 63 days moreover the 16s metagenomic analysis on bacterial abundances and rt qpcr of the functional genes were performed we suggested the mechanism about the fe2 relationship among eps production and nitrogen removal our findings provide that adding 1 mm fe2 during the start up process can improve the anammox system 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation and synthetic media three parallel anammox batch reactors with a working volume of 0 5 l were operated in this study for 63 days at 30 c including fe 0 reactor for control without fe2 fe 1 reactor with 1 mm fe2 and fe 5 with 5 mm fe2 the seed sludge c 0 c 2 and c3 that responds fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 the seed sludge c 0 c 2 and c3 that responds fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 was collected from the laboratory sequencing batch reactor sbr in our laboratory the sludge contains dark black particles with a diameter of 2 5 mm this dark color characteristic of granular sludge may be caused by dense population of anammox consortia within granules due to long term operation 14 28 the capacity of the sbr was 10 l and it was operated for over 2 years the nitrogen loading rate nlr 250 g n m3 d and nitrogen removal rate

reagents co ltd shanghai china the solutions were prepared using ultrapure water prior to the start up of the batch reactors the sbr sludge sample was washed with phosphate buffer ph 7 4 containing 0 6 g l k2hpo4 and 0 2 g l kh2po4 to remove any previous nitrogen influence 2 2 experimental set up batch assays were performed to compare the effect of fe2 on anammox activity in different fe2 doses

tukey s multiple test comparison to evaluate statistical differences the statistical significance was indicated with p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the effect of fe2 on anammox performance was investigated during start up process three batch reactors fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 were operated for 63 days as shown in fig 1 anammox performance process was set into four phases settling phase i 0 9 d pre active phase ii 10 26 d active phase iii 27 44 d and dominant phase iv 45 63 d as shown in table 1 after inoculation in phase i 0 9 d three reactors were equally adjusted with 40 mg l n of ammonium and 50 mg l nitrite respectively the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent started to decrease fig 1a and the removal of nitrogen was same in the three reactors we also observed that in the first 9 days the effluent concentration of nitrate was almost undetectable sun et al indicated that stoichiometric ratios could reflect the nitrogen removal performance of anammox 39 fig 1b displays the stoichiometric ratios of consumed nitrite and ammonium no2 n nh4 and produced nitrate and consumed ammonium no3 n nh4 of the three reactors during nitrogen removal performances during the first 9 days the nitrogen conversion ratios of three reactors were in the range of 1 5 no2 n nh4 and 0 21 no3 n nh4 respectively the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent started to decrease constantly this indicated that the initial concentration had no inhibitory effect on anammox consortia and the performance of all reactors is normal 40 in phase ii 10 26 d the concentrations of the fed ammonium and nitrite were increased from 40 to 60 mg l and 50 to 70 mg l respectively at the same time different fe2 concentrations 1 and 5 mm were inoculated in fe 1 and fe 5 reactors we found that performance of the fe 1 reactor was notably improved and the stable condition was achieved in the 26 days fig 1a the value of no3 n nh4 0 25 in fe 1 reactor was close to the theoretical value for anammox reaction i e 0 26 suggesting the strong anammox process in fe 1 reactor the effluent concentrations of nh4 and no2 sharply decreased in the fe 1 reactor and appeared lower than the fe 0 and fe 5 reactors with high total nitrogen removal efficiency 94 3 51 2 and 82 6 respectively as shown in fig 1c we also observed that anammox activity was decreased in both fe 0 and fe 5 reactors and their ratios of no3 n nh4 n were 0 11 and 0 14 both conversion ratios of nitrate and ammonium were lower than that of theoretical values which means that nitrogen removal performance was attenuated this result also indicates that elevated fe2 5 mm weakens the anammox activity however the nitrogen removal rate was suppressed when the fe2 added amount was higher or lower than 1 mm this result is consistent with previous report that high fe2 concentration could diminish the anammox process and suppress the anammox activity 41 in phase iii 27 44 d in the starting days of this phase the nitrogen removal in all reactors showed no significant variation total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre and nitrogen removal rate nrr were dropped first according to previous studies and this result the fluctuation of tnre and nrr may be related to the weakening of denitrification 40 42 this may be attributed to the abundance of the denitrifiers began to decline although the recovery may be due to the enhancement of anammox by fe2 43 nitrogen removal recovered from the 36 day are nre and tnre all increased moderately and finally tnre was stabilized with 68 6 fe 0 86 5 fe 1 and 70 8 fe 5 the nrr reached 58 7 g nm 3 d 1 fe 0 75 2 g nm 3 d 1 fe 1 and 62 1 g nm 3 d 1 fe 5 fig 1d respectively in addition nrr of each reactor is still low indicating that the anammox process is slow as previously reported due to short operational time low nlr and low contents of inoculated sludge it contains a small amount of anammox bacteria resulting in slow growth and changes in nrr than parent reactor 40 finally in phase iv 45 63 d the no3 nh4 ratios in the fe 1 reactor 0 27 was bigger than those of the fe 0 0 17 and fe 5 0 22 reactors at the end of operation nrr was significantly improved 81 5 g nm 3 d 1 in the fe 1 reactor and the nrr of fe 1 reactor is much higher than those of the fe 0 76 6 g nm 3 d 1 and fe 5 75 3 g nm 3 d 1 reactors at this time the nrr of the fe 5 reactor was suppressed and the nrr was lower than that of fe 0 control which indicated that high fe2 had an adverse effect these results suggested that addition of 1 mm fe2 in the fe 1 reactor has a better effect on nitrogen removal performance compared to fe 0 and fe 5 reactors it proved that the stable reactor performances were marked during phase iv in the fe 1 reactor at the end of the process the residual concentration of fe2 from the two reactors fe 1 and fe 5 was checked table s2 in the fe 1 reactor the fe2 concentration decreased and conversion was 89 9 indicating that both fe2 and the nitrogen substrates were consumed simultaneously however in fe 5 reactor the situation is not significant with 60 34 conversion this suggests that the anammox system does not encourage high fe2 consumption in conclusion the optimal dose of fe2 can improve anammox activity and the appropriate fe2 supplementation was 1 mm in this study indicated the fe2 1 mm showed increment on anammox bacteria while the adding 5 mm fe2 showed the unfavorable effect on anammox bacteria some previous studies had reported that appropriate fe2 supplementation with 0 08 0 09 mm and 0 12 mm significantly improved anammox activity and microbial abundance compared with 0 03 mm and 0 09 mm 24 25 43 44 these results are consistent with the improvement of anammox activity at optimal dose of fe2 in present study as showed in fig 1 however the higher fe2 concentration 1 5 mm was not considered by these previous literature while more information about the anammox process during start up with higher fe2 is provided by the present study this study provides better information about the removal of are and nre at 1 and 5 mm of fe2 table 1 while the higher concentration of fe2 5 mm showed suppression of anammox process in addition table 2 compares the nitrogen removal rates nrr with the different operation times d and displays the different nrr values these variations in values reported by other studies could be associated with various factors such as amount of seed sludge substrate concentrations type of reactors experimental conditions and dominated anammox species our results demonstrated that reactor performance was improved with better nitrogen removal rate than reported values by other studies hence supplementation of fe2 might be favorable to improve the anammox process 3 2 effect of fe ii on eps production extracellular polymeric substance eps plays a key role in the sludge granulation or biofilm 45 eps improves anammox activity and provide the resistivity against environmental stresses 46 our results showed that eps has ability to entrap the fe2 from fe 1 or fe 5 reactors fig s3 the linear equation was fitted with r2 0 99 which indicates the profitable linear correlation between eps and fe2 as reported previously eps has strong ability to form metal ion complexes to change metal solubility and equilibria to reduce the toxic effect of metal ions 47 generally eps metal binding mechanism is influenced by the species type and number of functional groups hydroxyl bipyridine phosphoric carboxyl and amide like groups that groups form electrostatic interactions or bond between eps and metal ions 48 the results suggested that the addition of fe2 in the two reactors would lead to an imbalance of the fe2 ion concentration inside and outside the microbial cells thereby enhancing the binding of iron in the eps which indicates the active transport from high concentration to low concentration the higher concentration of fe2 in the fe 5 reactor enhanced the adsorption of fe2 in eps fig s3 b as compared with fe 1 reactor fig s3 a it can be observed that polynomial fit curve was fitted between the fe2 in eps and the fe2 from 0 to 5 mm with well correlation r2 0 98 which indicated that protective ability of eps was beneficial to the fe 1 reactor in this study moreover anammox bacteria use the redox capacity of iron to provide protons for ammonia oxidation and participate in the synthesis of intracellular nitrogen removal proteins which may enhance the performances of anammox bacteria however the higher fe2 concentration in the eps of the fe 5 reactor may cause the hindrance of nutrient absorption by microorganisms this inhibitory effect is consistent with the results of nitrogen removal therefore the higher fe2 in fe 5 interferes with the anammox performance and as a result tnre and nrr are lower than fe 1 eps is mainly composed of polysaccharide ps and proteins pn components eps also can be used as an indicator to characterize the settle ability of the granular sludge 2 pn component accelerate the formation of protein metal complex to enhance hydrophobicity of the granular sludge meanwhile ps component improves the binding of metal ions 14 in this study excretion of eps in the three reactors were measured fig 2 to assess the effect of fe2 on pn and ps components the variations in ps and pn content over time d for all the reactors are shown in fig 2a the initial ps content after cultivation in seed sludge reached 31 16 fe 0 33 12 fe 1 and 27 34 fe 5 mg g vss respectively accounting for 9 7 10 9 and 7 4 of eps respectively the higher ps content in the fe 1 sludge i e 43 39 mg g vss accounting for 18 8 of eps was observed on 18th day of reactor operation moreover the highest level of ps was observed in the fe 5 sludge i e 47 59 mg g vss accounting for 22 6 of eps it can be observed that the ps contents in the fe 1 and fe 5 systems were elevated while ps in the fe 0 system did not change significantly during operation although a reduction in ps was analyzed during 36 63 days many authors reported that fe2 can stimulate the protein rich eps in microorganisms when exposed to environmental stresses 14 49 compared with ps pn has a stronger binding affinity with metals to protect cells from unfavorable effects pn rich eps forms a natural barrier to complex metal ions thereby preventing metals from entering the cells resulting in a decrease of ps than pn on the other hand the total pn load increased when polysaccharides started to decrease as shown in fig 2b in fe 0 i e control and fe 1 pn contents reached 85 76 mg g vss and 110 4 mg g vss of the total eps respectively on day 63 the highest pn content was observed in fe 5 with the concentrations reaching 135 82 mg g vss of eps it means that the highest pn and ps levels were obtained with high fe2 concentrations 50 thus the pn concentration increased gradually in the fe 5 reactors than that of fe 0 and fe 1 but also ps of the total eps declined by the end of this experiment these results may suggest that fe2 had a positive correlation with pn secretions only but not a direct relationship with polysaccharides production fe2 at high concentrations can increase the eps thereby higher pn concentration in eps was a metabolic self protection response and act as extracellular electron receptor stimulated by anammox bacteria against the fe2 stress environment such as heavy metals and toxins 41 51 anammox bacterial activity of the treated sludge could be affected by eps composition with fe2 furthermore to observe the correlation between each experimental group fe 0 fe and fe 5 and the contents of pn and ps expressed as mg g vss pearson correlation and two tail analysis was conducted as shown in table s3 it was found that each experimental group had significant correlation with pn contents r 0 9734 p by two tail t test 0 0001 while no significant differences were found with ps contents r 0 7165 p 0 03 this may suggest that fe2 had direct relationship with proteins group of the total eps but not with polysaccharides an analysis of the eps in these results showed that fe2 stimulated pn production it might be due to higher rates of metabolic activities of the proteins which further increased protein contents of the eps 51 a previous study has found that fe2 promoted granular formation because of charge neutralization roles which impacts on reactor performances 52 therefore granular settling ability and stability of reactor operation were examined with respect to the ps pn ratio fig 2b the ratio was quantified as 1 72 during days 18 27 2 16 during 36 4 and 3 57 during days 54 63 of reactor operation it was observed that the settling ability of granules and the reactor performance could be controlled when ps pn ratios were between 1 4 and 2 9 range respectively it has been confirmed that the hydrophobicity of the sludge was enhanced after fe2 addition 53 with lower pn ps values therefore no disruption was observed during operation however pn rich eps would increase the risk of disturbance by producing viscosity in long term performances this phenomenon still need to be further explored in future eps is also considerable key indicator for biofilm after fe2 addition in anammox system the elevated eps was self protection response triggered by anammox cell to resist higher fe2 concentration it was speculated that higher fe2 resulting in more eps production 3 3 influence of fe2 on the relative abundances of microbial community the abundances of anammox bacteria was quantified using rt qpcr experiment at the end of operational phase as shown in fig s4 the relative abundance of anammox 16s rrna gene in fe 1 reactor was higher than that in fe 0 and fe 5 reactors furthermore influence of fe2 addition on the microbial communities at phylum and genus level during start up process is shown in fig 3 in the seed sludge c 0 c 1 and c 5 without fe2 addition the dominated microbial composition belonged primarily to planctomycetes 27 3 30 2 and 32 2 respectively followed by proteobacteria 15 3 14 7 and 13 8 chlorobi 11 6 10 4 and 12 5 chloroflexi 9 5 9 2 and 8 5 ignavibacteria 7 8 7 9 and 7 2 and armatimonadetes 4 8 4 6 and 4 2 fig 3a these phyla are generally present in anammox reactors and the relative abundances vary due to different type of reactors and treatments in the present study phyla composition mainly belonged to anammox bacteria with principle phylum planctomycetes 54 which is responsible for anammox process after 63 days of the operation the microbial abundances significantly changed fig 3a the relative abundance of planctomycetes phylum was increased significantly by 43 3 in the sludge of fe 1 reactor compared with that in the sludge of fe 0 36 7 or the fe 5 reactors 39 8 however there is no significant change on the abundances of proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteria and armatimonadetes it was reported that planctomycetes phylum belongs to anammox bacteria and proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteria and armatimonadetes are denitrifying bacteria 42 55 furthermore the microbial abundances at genus level in these sludges were shown in fig 3b the predominated genera in the initial seed sludge c 0 c 1 and c 5 were ca brocadia 26 4 29 3 and 31 3 ignavibacterium 7 5 7 5 and 7 2 burkholderia 7 1 6 7 and 6 6 and anaerolinea 6 4 4 4 and 4 3 respectively ca brocadia was still the major dominated anammox bacteria in these sludges after 63 days of the operation and its abundances became most dominated genus accounted for 36 4 43 05 and 39 5 in the fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 reactors respectively however there is no significant change on the abundances of burkholderia ignavibacterium and anaerolinea it is obviously that the increasing rate of ca brocadia in the fe 1 reactor is higher than those of general existed microbial communities in anammox consortium fig 3c however the relative abundance of the other anammox genera ca kuenenia in the sludge of fe 1 reactor was accounted for only 0 03 fig 3c results indicated that suitable fe2 addition enhanced the relative abundances of one genera ca brocadia of anammox bacteria it was reported that ca brocadia ca kuenenia ca scalindua ca anammoximicrobium and ca jettenia belong to anammox bacteria 56 and burkholderia ignavibacterium and anaerolinea belong to denitrifiers thus these results proved that fe2 addition in the sludge especially 1 mm fe2 was beneficial for specific anammox bacteria rather than denitrifiers bacteria several studies demonstrated that anammox bacteria utterly rely on iron proteins cytochrome c and heme not only for iron storage but also for energy purpose to accelerate the anammox process 16 57 furthermore nitrogen removal process in the anammox bacteria is coupled with fe2 iron during anaerobic ammonium oxidation as reported previously 58 these could be the reasons that the abundance of ca brocadia was improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge during anammox process and then are and nre were improved because ca brocadia has an important role in anaerobic ammonium oxidation 3 4 effect of microbial fe2 oxidation on the gene expression and transcription the central catabolism in anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox organism can be described into three redox reactions in eqs 1 2 and 3 fig 1s reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide is catalyzed by nitrite reductases enzymes nirs nirk eq 1 however anammox bacteria lacked nitrite reductases enzymes but possessed an alternative hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao enzyme to produce nitric oxide 59 after the condensation process eq 2 the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh oxidizes hydrazine into the nitrogen gas eq 3 previous researchers have reported that in the absence of oxygen nitrite is first reduced to nitric oxide and then the resulting nitrite is condensed with ammonium 60 61 it can be seen that reduction and condensation reactions are coupled with nitrite compared with the oxidation reaction both reactions produce a higher thermodynamically reduced reduction potential e 0 62 this may be because hydrazine is a very toxic and reactive intermediate with very low redox potential e 0 in addition this last one oxidation reaction is one of the most powerful reaction among all anammox reactions during this reaction 4 potential electrons release to strengthening membrane potential then electrons return back to the first two reactions to fuel up the anammox process 63 1 reduction no 2 2 h e no h 2 o e 0 380 mv 2 condensation no nh 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o e 0 60 mv 3 oxidation n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e e 0 700 mv this study covered key functional genes such as hao producing hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and hdh producing hydrazine dehydrogenase for the chief anammox reactions meanwhile denitrification genes nirk producing copper nitrite reductase nirs producing heme cd1 nitrite reductase and nosz producing nitrous oxide reductase were considered as indicator genes for denitrification moreover norb producing nitric oxide reductase beta subunit and nrfa producing nitrite reductase c 552 were used indicators for the dissimilatory n reduction herein we investigated these gene expression level in the sludge fig 4 by rt qpcr fig 4b we found that the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in the fe 1 reactor is higher than those in the other reactors after 63 days of operation and were up regulated 2 5 and 4 6 fold respectively comparted to that in the fe 0 reactor this result indicated that anammox process was stronger than other microbial reactions on the other hand there is no significant change on the transcriptional level of indicator genes nirk norb nrfa nirs and nosz among all sludges we suggested that fe2 addition in the sludge improved the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in anammox bacteria we suggested that fe2 addition in the sludge improved the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in anammox bacteria and then are and nrr were improved 4 conclusion in this study we proved that fe2 addition has a great influence on eps production and nitrogen removal of anammox system especially are and nre reached 94 33 and 94 84 respectively when 1 mm fe2 was added into the sludge we found that the relative abundance of ca brocadia with fe2 addition is higher than those of without fe2 addition through metagenomics analysis addition of fe2 in the sludge especially 1 mm fe2 was beneficial for specific anammox bacteria growth rather than anaerobic bacteria it was suggested that fe2 addition enhanced the abundances of ca brocadia and then are and nre were improved because ca brocadia has great influence on anaerobic ammonium oxidation moreover the transcriptional expressions of hao and hdh in the sludge of the fe 1 reaction were higher than the other sludge which indicated that anammox process was up regulated overall are and nre will be improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge during anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13361,fe2 is widely used in wastewater treatment and plays an important role in the anammox system in this study the effects of fe2 on the anammox system was investigated with 0 1 and 5 mm fe2 in reactors during the start up the nitrogen removal performance was changed significantly the nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrogen removal rate reached 94 and 81 5 g n m 3 d 1 in the reactor respectively at the 1 mm fe2 after 63 days of operation moreover the extracellular polymeric substances were improved and showed linear correlation with fe2 concentration the 16s metagenomic analysis proved that fe2 addition increased the relative abundances of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia than that of control the results of rt qpcr also indicated that fe2 oxidation activated the central metabolism by up regulating the key functional genes hdh and hao in anammox bacteria the difference between functional genes and candidatus brocadia abundances in the sludge led to differences in ammonium removal efficiency and nitrite removal efficiency between all reactors because ca brocadia has great influence on anaerobic ammonium oxidation are and nre will be improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge overall the anammox system can be quickly improved even at higher concentrations when the anammox consortium encounter with an appropriate amount of fe2 keywords anammox process candidatus brocadia fe2 microbial abundance nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox produces nitrogen gas from ammonium nh4 and nitrite no2 under anoxic conditions 1 this unique process has drawn much attention due to its significant advantages in removing nitrogenous wastes from aquatic systems 2 anammox process entails low operational costs without external carbon substrates and aeration demands despite the eco friendly advantages of an anammox process the start up time during denitrification long doubling time and slow growth rate remains challenging for the engineering applications to overcome these obstacles numerous options have been explored to shorten start up time during annamox process including microchemical treatments anoxic digestion 3 dechlorination 4 nitrate ammonia reduction 5 and some of these technologies are ultrasound and electric file 6 granular activated carbon gac 7 polymeric gels sodium alginate gel bead 8 therefore still further efforts are needed to improve the start up of the anammox system in order to improve the anammox system it is necessary to develop inexpensive and effective strategies for biological denitrification performance hui chen et al 9 suggested that environmental conditions and nutrient methods can be used in industrial applications to optimize the anammox process fe2 is one of the most abundant metals in wastewater 10 11 hence fe2 is relatively cheap readily available and more effective in precipitation pollution control phosphorus and antibiotic removal in sewage treatment plants 12 13 the rapid development of the metallurgy beneficiation processing and machine industries are common causes of the availability of metal ions in nitrogen wastewaters 14 plenty of fe2 and nitrogen compounds on the earth s crust are considered water pollutants that have some inhibitory and toxic effects and can cause toxicity intolerance for denitrifiers and other microorganisms 15 on the other hand these both toxic substances are utilized by anammox bacteria fe2 is the main component of cytochrome c hydrazine dehydrogenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and heme c proteins in anammox bacteria that play central role in anammox metabolism 16 the metabolism of anammox bacteria was regulated by many pathways that are coupled with nitrogen and iron cycling 17 schadler et al 18 reported that after fe2 addition fe2 oxidation takes place inside the cell and then reacts with aqueous solution h2o alternatively ferrous hydroxide generated with releasing h ions during autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification pathways fig s1 these pathways include denitrification no2 to n2 nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo no3 to n2 anammox process nh4 to n2 and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra no3 to nh4 under anoxic condition fig s2 moreover fe2 is readily soluble and the more accessible form in nature while fe3 had poor solubility at neutral ph and therefore only available after fe2 oxidation eq 1 19 1 4 fe 2 2 no 2 8 h 4 fe 3 n 2 4 h 2 o the effects of fe2 addition on the anammox process have attracted more attention some studies were conducted on the inhibitory impacts of fe2 addition on microbal growth for example fe2 could exhibit toxic effect on citrobacter pxl1 20 strain 2002 21 e coli peudomonas szf15 22 and bofen1 23 by causing cell membrane damages besides positive regulatory effect of different concentrations of fe2 on the anammox system has been extensively studied huang et al 24 discovered that the higher nitrogen removal was achieved at high fe2 0 08 mm which was almost 15 higher than the lowest fe2 0 04 mm and shu et al 25 also found that low concentration of fe2 at 0 08 mm improved the specific growth rate 0 2648 d 1 than the higher fe2 0 12 mm recently feng et al 26 showed that high concentrations of fe2 25 mg l have no inhibitory effect on marine anammox and zhou et al 27 demonstrated the short term effect of low fe2 at 5 80 mg l was significant for reactor performance although most of the studies have investigated the role of fe2 under different low concentrations in anammox system however the effect of higher optimal fe2 concentration in anammox system is still need to be revealed in order to test our hypothesis we investigated whether the addition of fe2 at higher concentrations 0 mm 1 mm and 5 mm could improve the anammox system during start up using anammox consortia herein the effect of different fe2 concentrations on eps are and nre at constant nitrogen load were investigated after the reactors were operated for 63 days moreover the 16s metagenomic analysis on bacterial abundances and rt qpcr of the functional genes were performed we suggested the mechanism about the fe2 relationship among eps production and nitrogen removal our findings provide that adding 1 mm fe2 during the start up process can improve the anammox system 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation and synthetic media three parallel anammox batch reactors with a working volume of 0 5 l were operated in this study for 63 days at 30 c including fe 0 reactor for control without fe2 fe 1 reactor with 1 mm fe2 and

reactor sbr in our laboratory the sludge contains dark black particles with a diameter of 2 5 mm this dark color characteristic of granular sludge may be caused by dense population of anammox consortia within granules due to long term operation 14 28 the capacity of the sbr was 10 l and it was operated for over 2 years the nitrogen loading rate nlr 250 g n m3 d and nitrogen removal rate

6 g l k2hpo4 and 0 2 g l kh2po4 to remove any previous nitrogen influence 2 2 experimental set up batch assays were performed to compare the effect of fe2 on anammox activity in different fe2 doses

tukey s multiple test comparison to evaluate statistical differences the statistical significance was indicated with p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 nitrogen removal performance the effect of fe2 on anammox performance was investigated during start up process three batch reactors fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 were operated for 63 days as shown in fig 1 anammox performance process was set into four phases settling phase i 0 9 d pre active phase ii 10 26 d active phase iii 27 44 d and dominant phase iv 45 63 d as shown in table 1 after inoculation in phase i 0 9 d three reactors were equally adjusted with 40 mg l n of ammonium and 50 mg l nitrite respectively the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent started to decrease fig 1a and the removal of nitrogen was same in the three reactors we also observed that in the first 9 days the effluent concentration of nitrate was almost undetectable sun et al indicated that stoichiometric ratios could reflect the nitrogen removal performance of anammox 39 fig 1b displays the stoichiometric ratios of consumed nitrite and ammonium no2 n nh4 and produced nitrate and consumed ammonium no3 n nh4 of the three reactors during nitrogen removal performances during the first 9 days the nitrogen conversion ratios of three reactors were in the range of 1 5 no2 n nh4 and 0 21 no3 n nh4 respectively the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the influent started to decrease constantly this indicated that the initial concentration had no inhibitory effect on anammox consortia and the performance of all reactors is normal 40 in phase ii 10 26 d the concentrations of the fed ammonium and nitrite were increased from 40 to 60 mg l and 50 to 70 mg l respectively at the same time different fe2 concentrations 1 and 5 mm were inoculated in fe 1 and fe 5 reactors we found that performance of the fe 1 reactor was notably improved and the stable condition was achieved in the 26 days fig 1a the value of no3 n nh4 0 25 in fe 1 reactor was close to the theoretical value for anammox reaction i e 0 26 suggesting the strong anammox process in fe 1 reactor the effluent concentrations of nh4 and no2 sharply decreased in the fe 1 reactor and appeared lower than the fe 0 and fe 5 reactors with high total nitrogen removal efficiency 94 3 51 2 and 82 6 respectively as shown in fig 1c we also observed that anammox activity was decreased in both fe 0 and fe 5 reactors and their ratios of no3 n nh4 n were 0 11 and 0 14 both conversion ratios of nitrate and ammonium were lower than that of theoretical values which means that nitrogen removal performance was attenuated this result also indicates that elevated fe2 5 mm weakens the anammox activity however the nitrogen removal rate was suppressed when the fe2 added amount was higher or lower than 1 mm this result is consistent with previous report that high fe2 concentration could diminish the anammox process and suppress the anammox activity 41 in phase iii 27 44 d in the starting days of this phase the nitrogen removal in all reactors showed no significant variation total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre and nitrogen removal rate nrr were dropped first according to previous studies and this result the fluctuation of tnre and nrr may be related to the weakening of denitrification 40 42 this may be attributed to the abundance of the denitrifiers began to decline although the recovery may be due to the enhancement of anammox by fe2 43 nitrogen removal recovered from the 36 day are nre and tnre all increased moderately and finally tnre was stabilized with 68 6 fe 0 86 5 fe 1 and 70 8 fe 5 the nrr reached 58 7 g nm 3 d 1 fe 0 75 2 g nm 3 d 1 fe 1 and 62 1 g nm 3 d 1 fe 5 fig 1d respectively in addition nrr of each reactor is still low indicating that the anammox process is slow as previously reported due to short operational time low nlr and low contents of inoculated sludge it contains a small amount of anammox bacteria resulting in slow growth and changes in nrr than parent reactor 40 finally in phase iv 45 63 d the no3 nh4 ratios in the fe 1 reactor 0 27 was bigger than those of the fe 0 0 17 and fe 5 0 22 reactors at the end of operation nrr was significantly improved 81 5 g nm 3 d 1 in the fe 1 reactor and the nrr of fe 1 reactor is much higher than those of the fe 0 76 6 g nm 3 d 1 and fe 5 75 3 g nm 3 d 1 reactors at this time the nrr of the fe 5 reactor was suppressed and the nrr was lower than that of fe 0 control which indicated that high fe2 had an adverse effect these results suggested that addition of 1 mm fe2 in the fe 1 reactor has a better effect on nitrogen removal performance compared to fe 0 and fe 5 reactors it proved that the stable reactor performances were marked during phase iv in the fe 1 reactor at the end of the process the residual concentration of fe2 from the two reactors fe 1 and fe 5 was checked table s2 in the fe 1 reactor the fe2 concentration decreased and conversion was 89 9 indicating that both fe2 and the nitrogen substrates were consumed simultaneously however in fe 5 reactor the situation is not significant with 60 34 conversion this suggests that the anammox system does not encourage high fe2 consumption in conclusion the optimal dose of fe2 can improve anammox activity and the appropriate fe2 supplementation was 1 mm in this study indicated the fe2 1 mm showed increment on anammox bacteria while the adding 5 mm fe2 showed the unfavorable effect on anammox bacteria some previous studies had reported that appropriate fe2 supplementation with 0 08 0 09 mm and 0 12 mm significantly improved anammox activity and microbial abundance compared with 0 03 mm and 0 09 mm 24 25 43 44 these results are consistent with the improvement of anammox activity at optimal dose of fe2 in present study as showed in fig 1 however the higher fe2 concentration 1 5 mm was not considered by these previous literature while more information about the anammox process during start up with higher fe2 is provided by the present study this study provides better information about the removal of are and nre at 1 and 5 mm of fe2 table 1 while the higher concentration of fe2 5 mm showed suppression of anammox process in addition table 2 compares the nitrogen removal rates nrr with the different operation times d and displays the different nrr values these variations in values reported by other studies could be associated with various factors such as amount of seed sludge substrate concentrations type of reactors experimental conditions and dominated anammox species our results demonstrated that reactor performance was improved with better nitrogen removal rate than reported values by other studies hence supplementation of fe2 might be favorable to improve the anammox process 3 2 effect of fe ii on eps production extracellular polymeric substance eps plays a key role in the sludge granulation or biofilm 45 eps improves anammox activity and provide the resistivity against environmental stresses 46 our results showed that eps has ability to entrap the fe2 from fe 1 or fe 5 reactors fig s3 the linear equation was fitted with r2 0 99 which indicates the profitable linear correlation between eps and fe2 as reported previously eps has strong ability to form metal ion complexes to change metal solubility and equilibria to reduce the toxic effect of metal ions 47 generally eps metal binding mechanism is influenced by the species type and number of functional groups hydroxyl bipyridine phosphoric carboxyl and amide like groups that groups form electrostatic interactions or bond between eps and metal ions 48 the results suggested that the addition of fe2 in the two reactors would lead to an imbalance of the fe2 ion concentration inside and outside the microbial cells thereby enhancing the binding of iron in the eps which indicates the active transport from high concentration to low concentration the higher concentration of fe2 in the fe 5 reactor enhanced the adsorption of fe2 in eps fig s3 b as compared with fe 1 reactor fig s3 a it can be observed that polynomial fit curve was fitted between the fe2 in eps and the fe2 from 0 to 5 mm with well correlation r2 0 98 which indicated that protective ability of eps was beneficial to the fe 1 reactor in this study moreover anammox bacteria use the redox capacity of iron to provide protons for ammonia oxidation and participate in the synthesis of intracellular nitrogen removal proteins which may enhance the performances of anammox bacteria however the higher fe2 concentration in the eps of the fe 5 reactor may cause the hindrance of nutrient absorption by microorganisms this inhibitory effect is consistent with the results of nitrogen removal therefore the higher fe2 in fe 5 interferes with the anammox performance and as a result tnre and nrr are lower than fe 1 eps is mainly composed of polysaccharide ps and proteins pn components eps also can be used as an indicator to characterize the settle ability of the granular sludge 2 pn component accelerate the formation of protein metal complex to enhance hydrophobicity of the granular sludge meanwhile ps component improves the binding of metal ions 14 in this study excretion of eps in the three reactors were measured fig 2 to assess the effect of fe2 on pn and ps components the variations in ps and pn content over time d for all the reactors are shown in fig 2a the initial ps content after cultivation in seed sludge reached 31 16 fe 0 33 12 fe 1 and 27 34 fe 5 mg g vss respectively accounting for 9 7 10 9 and 7 4 of eps respectively the higher ps content in the fe 1 sludge i e 43 39 mg g vss accounting for 18 8 of eps was observed on 18th day of reactor operation moreover the highest level of ps was observed in the fe 5 sludge i e 47 59 mg g vss accounting for 22 6 of eps it can be observed that the ps contents in the fe 1 and fe 5 systems were elevated while ps in the fe 0 system did not change significantly during operation although a reduction in ps was analyzed during 36 63 days many authors reported that fe2 can stimulate the protein rich eps in microorganisms when exposed to environmental stresses 14 49 compared with ps pn has a stronger binding affinity with metals to protect cells from unfavorable effects pn rich eps forms a natural barrier to complex metal ions thereby preventing metals from entering the cells resulting in a decrease of ps than pn on the other hand the total pn load increased when polysaccharides started to decrease as shown in fig 2b in fe 0 i e control and fe 1 pn contents reached 85 76 mg g vss and 110 4 mg g vss of the total eps respectively on day 63 the highest pn content was observed in fe 5 with the concentrations reaching 135 82 mg g vss of eps it means that the highest pn and ps levels were obtained with high fe2 concentrations 50 thus the pn concentration increased gradually in the fe 5 reactors than that of fe 0 and fe 1 but also ps of the total eps declined by the end of this experiment these results may suggest that fe2 had a positive correlation with pn secretions only but not a direct relationship with polysaccharides production fe2 at high concentrations can increase the eps thereby higher pn concentration in eps was a metabolic self protection response and act as extracellular electron receptor stimulated by anammox bacteria against the fe2 stress environment such as heavy metals and toxins 41 51 anammox bacterial activity of the treated sludge could be affected by eps composition with fe2 furthermore to observe the correlation between each experimental group fe 0 fe and fe 5 and the contents of pn and ps expressed as mg g vss pearson correlation and two tail analysis was conducted as shown in table s3 it was found that each experimental group had significant correlation with pn contents r 0 9734 p by two tail t test 0 0001 while no significant differences were found with ps contents r 0 7165 p 0 03 this may suggest that fe2 had direct relationship with proteins group of the total eps but not with polysaccharides an analysis of the eps in these results showed that fe2 stimulated pn production it might be due to higher rates of metabolic activities of the proteins which further increased protein contents of the eps 51 a previous study has found that fe2 promoted granular formation because of charge neutralization roles which impacts on reactor performances 52 therefore granular settling ability and stability of reactor operation were examined with respect to the ps pn ratio fig 2b the ratio was quantified as 1 72 during days 18 27 2 16 during 36 4 and 3 57 during days 54 63 of reactor operation it was observed that the settling ability of granules and the reactor performance could be controlled when ps pn ratios were between 1 4 and 2 9 range respectively it has been confirmed that the hydrophobicity of the sludge was enhanced after fe2 addition 53 with lower pn ps values therefore no disruption was observed during operation however pn rich eps would increase the risk of disturbance by producing viscosity in long term performances this phenomenon still need to be further explored in future eps is also considerable key indicator for biofilm after fe2 addition in anammox system the elevated eps was self protection response triggered by anammox cell to resist higher fe2 concentration it was speculated that higher fe2 resulting in more eps production 3 3 influence of fe2 on the relative abundances of microbial community the abundances of anammox bacteria was quantified using rt qpcr experiment at the end of operational phase as shown in fig s4 the relative abundance of anammox 16s rrna gene in fe 1 reactor was higher than that in fe 0 and fe 5 reactors furthermore influence of fe2 addition on the microbial communities at phylum and genus level during start up process is shown in fig 3 in the seed sludge c 0 c 1 and c 5 without fe2 addition the dominated microbial composition belonged primarily to planctomycetes 27 3 30 2 and 32 2 respectively followed by proteobacteria 15 3 14 7 and 13 8 chlorobi 11 6 10 4 and 12 5 chloroflexi 9 5 9 2 and 8 5 ignavibacteria 7 8 7 9 and 7 2 and armatimonadetes 4 8 4 6 and 4 2 fig 3a these phyla are generally present in anammox reactors and the relative abundances vary due to different type of reactors and treatments in the present study phyla composition mainly belonged to anammox bacteria with principle phylum planctomycetes 54 which is responsible for anammox process after 63 days of the operation the microbial abundances significantly changed fig 3a the relative abundance of planctomycetes phylum was increased significantly by 43 3 in the sludge of fe 1 reactor compared with that in the sludge of fe 0 36 7 or the fe 5 reactors 39 8 however there is no significant change on the abundances of proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteria and armatimonadetes it was reported that planctomycetes phylum belongs to anammox bacteria and proteobacteria chloroflexi ignavibacteria and armatimonadetes are denitrifying bacteria 42 55 furthermore the microbial abundances at genus level in these sludges were shown in fig 3b the predominated genera in the initial seed sludge c 0 c 1 and c 5 were ca brocadia 26 4 29 3 and 31 3 ignavibacterium 7 5 7 5 and 7 2 burkholderia 7 1 6 7 and 6 6 and anaerolinea 6 4 4 4 and 4 3 respectively ca brocadia was still the major dominated anammox bacteria in these sludges after 63 days of the operation and its abundances became most dominated genus accounted for 36 4 43 05 and 39 5 in the fe 0 fe 1 and fe 5 reactors respectively however there is no significant change on the abundances of burkholderia ignavibacterium and anaerolinea it is obviously that the increasing rate of ca brocadia in the fe 1 reactor is higher than those of general existed microbial communities in anammox consortium fig 3c however the relative abundance of the other anammox genera ca kuenenia in the sludge of fe 1 reactor was accounted for only 0 03 fig 3c results indicated that suitable fe2 addition enhanced the relative abundances of one genera ca brocadia of anammox bacteria it was reported that ca brocadia ca kuenenia ca scalindua ca anammoximicrobium and ca jettenia belong to anammox bacteria 56 and burkholderia ignavibacterium and anaerolinea belong to denitrifiers thus these results proved that fe2 addition in the sludge especially 1 mm fe2 was beneficial for specific anammox bacteria rather than denitrifiers bacteria several studies demonstrated that anammox bacteria utterly rely on iron proteins cytochrome c and heme not only for iron storage but also for energy purpose to accelerate the anammox process 16 57 furthermore nitrogen removal process in the anammox bacteria is coupled with fe2 iron during anaerobic ammonium oxidation as reported previously 58 these could be the reasons that the abundance of ca brocadia was improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge during anammox process and then are and nre were improved because ca brocadia has an important role in anaerobic ammonium oxidation 3 4 effect of microbial fe2 oxidation on the gene expression and transcription the central catabolism in anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox organism can be described into three redox reactions in eqs 1 2 and 3 fig 1s reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide is catalyzed by nitrite reductases enzymes nirs nirk eq 1 however anammox bacteria lacked nitrite reductases enzymes but possessed an alternative hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao enzyme to produce nitric oxide 59 after the condensation process eq 2 the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh oxidizes hydrazine into the nitrogen gas eq 3 previous researchers have reported that in the absence of oxygen nitrite is first reduced to nitric oxide and then the resulting nitrite is condensed with ammonium 60 61 it can be seen that reduction and condensation reactions are coupled with nitrite compared with the oxidation reaction both reactions produce a higher thermodynamically reduced reduction potential e 0 62 this may be because hydrazine is a very toxic and reactive intermediate with very low redox potential e 0 in addition this last one oxidation reaction is one of the most powerful reaction among all anammox reactions during this reaction 4 potential electrons release to strengthening membrane potential then electrons return back to the first two reactions to fuel up the anammox process 63 1 reduction no 2 2 h e no h 2 o e 0 380 mv 2 condensation no nh 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o e 0 60 mv 3 oxidation n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e e 0 700 mv this study covered key functional genes such as hao producing hydroxylamine dehydrogenase and hdh producing hydrazine dehydrogenase for the chief anammox reactions meanwhile denitrification genes nirk producing copper nitrite reductase nirs producing heme cd1 nitrite reductase and nosz producing nitrous oxide reductase were considered as indicator genes for denitrification moreover norb producing nitric oxide reductase beta subunit and nrfa producing nitrite reductase c 552 were used indicators for the dissimilatory n reduction herein we investigated these gene expression level in the sludge fig 4 by rt qpcr fig 4b we found that the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in the fe 1 reactor is higher than those in the other reactors after 63 days of operation and were up regulated 2 5 and 4 6 fold respectively comparted to that in the fe 0 reactor this result indicated that anammox process was stronger than other microbial reactions on the other hand there is no significant change on the transcriptional level of indicator genes nirk norb nrfa nirs and nosz among all sludges we suggested that fe2 addition in the sludge improved the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in anammox bacteria we suggested that fe2 addition in the sludge improved the transcriptional level of hao and hdh in anammox bacteria and then are and nrr were improved 4 conclusion in this study we proved that fe2 addition has a great influence on eps production and nitrogen removal of anammox system especially are and nre reached 94 33 and 94 84 respectively when 1 mm fe2 was added into the sludge we found that the relative abundance of ca brocadia with fe2 addition is higher than those of without fe2 addition through metagenomics analysis addition of fe2 in the sludge especially 1 mm fe2 was beneficial for specific anammox bacteria growth rather than anaerobic bacteria it was suggested that fe2 addition enhanced the abundances of ca brocadia and then are and nre were improved because ca brocadia has great influence on anaerobic ammonium oxidation moreover the transcriptional expressions of hao and hdh in the sludge of the fe 1 reaction were higher than the other sludge which indicated that anammox process was up regulated overall are and nre will be improved when the suitable amount of fe2 was added into the sludge during anammox process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13362,a matter of major importance relies on managing the water treatment process in order to optimize the disinfection process and the corresponding cost maintaining the high standards of the produced water the paper aims at developing a prediction model for trihalomethanes formation of the water treatment plant of thessaloniki northern greece by means of a set of explanatory variables such as temperature ph turbidity total organic carbon chlorine dose and residence time the dataset runs from 2008 to 2020 the analysis used a set of advanced statistical techniques one way anova tukey pairwise comparisons as well as a combination of adequate statistical methods such as partial least square regression pls multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise regression the results revealed a strong positive correlation of temperature with concentrations of trihalomethanes after validation the best model was the one of stepwise regression that included only temperature and residence time to predict total trihalomethanes with high accuracy at low and medium concentration levels r2 46 07 r2 pred 42 9 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment trihalomethanes regression analysis partial least square multiple linear regression 1 introduction over the last five decades starting from rook 1 scientists observed and discovered that disinfecting water with chlorine made the formation of trihalomethanes thms furthermore they recognized the harmful effects that may have on the human body due to long term exposure to disinfection by products westerhoff 2 cantor et al 3 mills et al 4 and king et al 5 disinfection of water with chlorine seems to have significant advantages but also some important disadvantages connected to human health richardson et al 6 it has been over a century since the use of chlorine and some excellent results were pointed out as it minimizes waterborne diseases according to srivastav et al 7 several regulations have been imposed to protect human health in addition many techniques have been developed to remove dbps from the drinking water using advance oxidation process coagulation and membrane based filtration thms are formed in water and in particular in water treatment plants when the natural organic matter present in the water reacts with a strong oxidator the chlorine world health organization 8 di cristo et al 9 the formation of thms in drinking water is very important because of the potentially negative effects on human health several epidemiological studies have linked the presence of thms in drinking water with heart abnormalities premature births but also with bladder colon and rectum cancers cantor et al 3 mills et al 4 and king et al 5 chowdhury et al 10 conducted an experimental study to investigate the factors that influence the formation of thms according to their research the most important and common factors with a positive effect on formation of thms are the disinfectant used i e chlorine total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 ph temperature residence time and bromide concentrations in addition several studies sadiq and rodriguez 11 navalon et al 12 ye et al 13 mahato and gupta 14 reported the above factors as the most common factors influencing disinfection by products in particular natural organic matter is considered to be the most important precursor of formation of thms however even though it cannot be directly measured it is expressed through toc doc or uv254 as demonstrated in chowdhury and champagne 15 according to stevens et al 16 ph indicates a positive association with formation of thms moreover the reaction time of chlorine in water has the same increasing effect to œÑŒ∑Œºs concentrations furthermore the requirement for chlorine residuals in water up to the extreme point of the distribution network in order to avoid microbial load may contribute to additional increase of thms concentrations gougoutsa et al 17 in their research find out that the main factors affecting thms formations were the chlorine dose and the toc furthermore they conducted that by increasing the contact time the concentration of chlorinated dbps increased also moreover temperature seems to affect also the formation of thms higher temperature leads to the increase of thms concentrations this can be observed as well as be reflected in analysis of drinking water during winter and summer months according to el shahat et al 18 the temperature variability has a significant impact on thms concentrations this is due to the fact that the higher the temperature the higher is the concentration of thms furthermore valdivia garcia et al 19 preformed a laboratory experiment to investigate how the climate change could affect thms concentrations their results showed a positive relation between thms concentration and temperature and specifically if temperature increases by 1 8 c by 2050 the thms will likely increase by 39 on the other hand a recent study of the tap water in 8 counties of china showed higher levels of thms concentrations in winter than in summer or spring zhou et al 20 saidan et al 21 developed a mathematical model for predicting the formation of thms their prediction model includes parameters such as temperature residence time ph chlorine dose and toc they concluded that an increase of one or more parameters leads to an increase in thms concentrations one of the first models to predict the formation of thms was the one of minear and morrow 22 disinfection by products dbps since then many attempts have been made to develop methodologies and models for predicting the formation of thms sadiq and rodriguez 11 kumari and gupta 23 tello et al 24 hong et al 25 lin et al 26 hong 27 most of these based on regression analysis linear or not considering that thms concentration levels are related to temperature ph toc bromides chlorine dose and chlorine residence time godo pla et al 28 used field scale data to predict thms concentration at a full scale drinking water treatment plant a multiple linear regression model was used and after the validation the predictive model was incorporated into an environmental decision support system however the diversity and complexity of thms formation reactions limits the direct application of any developed forecasting model since any model resulted from case study of a specific water treatment plant and therefore cannot be used on a large scale without recalibration nikolaou and lekkas 29 nikolaou et al 30 golfinopoulos et al 31 nikolaou et al 32 golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 developed a methodology of predicting the formation of thms for the water treatment plant of menidi in attica greece the main purpose of their work was to test the use of multiple linear regressions to calculate the concentrations of total trihalomethanes tthms henceforth in order to generalize the methodology in different facilities the examined variables were water temperature ph chlorine dose bromides and chlorophyll chla the development of this model was based on measurements of thms from the final water storage tank as for the examined variables forecast variables the measurement values were calculated after examining the untreated water it is noted that the disinfection of water is done only with chlorine in the untreated water followed by post chlorination before the input of the final drinking water in the distribution system additionally they concluded the values of tthms ranged from 6 to 34 Œºg l with the concentrations of dibrochloromethane and bromomethane not participating as their values were below the detection limit platikanov et al 34 attempted to define chemometric design and prediction of thm formation for a water treatment plant in barcelona multifactorial statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca multiple linear regression analysis mlr including stepwise regression as well as partial of least squares pls regression were used the results of their analysis indicated that the most important predictor variables for determining the concentration of thms are temperature total organic carbon chlorine dose uv absorption and turbidity without taking into account the reaction time after chlorination stage additionally in this water treatment plant chlorination takes place in the first stages of water treatment and before the storage of water in the final tank the values of tthms ranged from 40 8 to 121 5 Œºg l with an average of 75 5 Œºg l with the concentrations of all trihalomethane compounds chloroform bromodichloromethane dibrochloromethane and bromomethane being included as their values were above lower detection limit 0 1 0 25 Œºg l similar study to predict the formation of thms in a water treatment plant was conducted in istanbul as reported by uyak et al 35 temperature total organic carbon ph and chlorine dose were used as parameters and the development of the model was based on the characteristics of the raw water chlorination in this case study took place before the treatment of the water and it was followed by post chlorination mlr was used to predict the formation of thms the values of tthms ranged from 48 to 102 Œºg l with an average of 68 Œºg l with the chloroform compound accounting for 90 of the total trihalomethanes followed by dibromochloromethane the object of this research is the application of statistical analysis techniques to water parameter data at the water treatment plant of thessaloniki to create a reliable prediction model for the thms formation the aim of the prediction model is the daily estimation of the formation concentration of thms since the frequency of sample collection for the measurement of thms is limited only to 18 times per year in case of prediction of unusual concentration of thms an emergency water sample will be taken to be analyzed by the laboratory to make timely decisions of the process of water treatment the novelty of this study is that the prediction model includes only two parameters the most statistically significant ones temperature and residence time showing high accuracy at low and medium concentration levels of measured thms concentrations the present analysis attempts to enrich the research field of the formation of thms through analyzing a specific water treatment plant that of thessaloniki the paper is organized as follows section 1 is an introduction part to analyze the significance as well as the relevant empirical attempts in this field section 2 analyzes the water treatment plant the data sample and the methodological background section 3 reports the results of the analysis along with the relevant discussion and finally section 4 reports the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the water treatment plant national laws of every country report the maximum levels of trihalomethane concentrations therefore the levels of trihalomethane concentrations must be kept at a low level and must not exceed the maximum values that the national laws determine according to the european economic community directive eecd 36 the upper limit of total trihalomethane concentration is set at 100 Œºg l for greece according to the number c1 d gp oik 67322 2017 sanitary ordinance the parametric value is also set at 100 Œºg l and measurement frequency depends on the daily supply of drinking water the water treatment plant of thessaloniki has been operating since 2003 and utilizes the surface water of aliakmon river eyath 37 nowadays the plant has the capacity to process 150 000 cubic meter per day the relevant laboratory that analyzes the water is accredited according to en iso 17025 2017 the basic stages of water treatment are presented in fig 1 the first step of the treatment process involves ph reduction pre ozonation and rapid mixing the aforementioned steps aim at the effective oxidation of natural organic matter nom and reduction of algae population as well as optimization of flocculation conditions the reduction of ph is achieved by the addition of carbon dioxide co2 polyaluminium chloride pac addition aims to improve flocculation and rapid mixing achieves the homogeneity of the solution heading for the coagulation tanks three coagulation clarification tanks are used for the removal of suspended solids and flocculated colloids in this inner tank a polymer cationic polyectrolyte is added to enhance coagulation s efficiency additionally remaining solids that manage to pass through the coagulation clarification tanks are removed by rapid gravity sand filtration in the water treatment plant nine twin beds single layer sand and two single beds single layer sand zeolite filtering media are in operation once a sand filter is saturated it is backwashed with water and air the turbidity target is already achieved at this stage of the treatment process for the optimum oxidation of organic matter and removal of taste and odor ozonation is employed the ozone is produced by four generators which they produce ozone with electric evacuations for the effective removal of micropollutants and taste and odor compounds activated carbon filtration is implemented in pre ozonation stage 3 in fig 1 the ozone dose ranged from 0 35 0 94 mg l with an average of 0 65 mg l while in main ozonation stage 8 in fig 1 the dose ranged from 0 16 0 54 mg l with an average of 0 31 mg l the group of beds of granulated activated carbon gac includes eight twin beds chlorination follows activated carbon filtration to accomplish destruction of pathogenic organisms and hindrance of growth of microbiological pollution in the reservoir and in the pipes of water distribution finally ph of the produced water is increased by the addition of lime so as to avoid undesirable sediments in the distribution network it should be pointed out that the quality of water derived from all treatment stages is continuously monitored via online instruments that measure physicochemical parameters e g ph temperature turbidity conductivity pressure drop residual chlorine etc and all signals are sent to the control center scada a large number of samples are daily collected from all treatment stages 18 sampling points and analyzed at the quality control lab of the water treatment plant of thessaloniki table 1 presents the raw water quality data from the surface water of aliakmon river the samples of raw data are collected from the inlet tank stage 1 in fig 1 and analyzed from the laboratory 2 2 data description and software tools the laboratory measurements of ph and turbidity conducted according to elot 658 and standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2130 turbidity 2130b nephelometric method respectively furthermore measurements of ph turbidity and temperature were held in the field by means of electrodes connected to endres hauser hach lange and wtw online meters measurements of toc were conducted in the laboratory by internal method according to apha 5310 Œ≤ the measuring equipment includes shimadzu toc analyzer toc v csh csn synthetic air cylinder air zero and glass sample collection containers of 100 ml also the measurements of thms were conducted in the laboratory according on en iso 17943 2016 e the laboratory analyzed the samples by the head space technique using device for solid phase microextraction with magnetic agitation the quantification limits for the compounds determined range from 0 48 0 83 Œºg l in drinking water agilent technologies gas chromatograph type 7890a gc system were also used for the measurements internal quality control took place before each sample batch measurement and for every 20 samples with standard solutions of known concentration as far as it concerns the external quality control the laboratory participates at least once a year in laboratory quality control tests for the prediction model of thms six parameters have been examined temperature expressed in c ph expressed in units ph turbidity in ntu toc in mg l chlorine dose in mg l time residence in hours represent the effect of contact time and all thms compounds expressed in Œºg l water samples for thms measurements were collected from the exit of final drinking water tank while for temperature ph turbidity toc water samples were collected after the exit of granular activated carbon filter beds stage 9 fig 1 finally statistical analysis was performed with minitab software minitab 19 x 38 while the Œ± significance level was considered equal to 0 05 the predictors and the response are presented in table 2 2 3 methodological tools the current analysis utilizes three different techniques to estimate the variability of tthms concentration these are pls mlr and stepwise regression analysis in order to select the best estimated model it is needed to compare the coefficient of determination r2 or r sq the sum of the square distances ss and the predictive ability r2 pred or r sq pred among models the analysis started from pls method in order to examine the existence of possible relationship among selected predictors and the response variable as mentioned in table 2 this method is able to include all selected parameters in the regression and reduce them into a smaller number ensuring that they are not related to each other then the regression analysis is performed in the reduced model pls leads to a model that explains adequately the variance of the response variable including the smallest number of predictors this is in line with the main objective of the pls technique which is to estimate the best predictability for the response variable furthermore using its residual plots the presence of leverage point could be also examined this contributes to the acceptance or not of the model as a measure to determine how well the model fits to the data more specifically pls method consists of two stages before these stages cross validation is performed this process starts from a model full of predictors and moves forward by leaving out of the analysis one variable at a time the appropriate model is the one with the highest predicted r2 pred value the analysis continues as follows in the first stage which is called training stage a prediction model is created in the second stage the model of the training stage is validated with a different data set the analysis provides the r2 the ss and the r2 pred of the model since cross validation was used the coefficient of determination r2 should be compared with the corresponding prediction coefficient r2 pred ideally the values of both coefficients of determination should be equal furthermore mlr was the second method to use and relies on ordinary least squares methodology mlr aims at minimizing the sum squares of the differences between the observed and the predicted values the mlr is an adequate method for predicting the value of a response from a number of independed variables the model of mlr fits the following formula 1 y i Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ k x k e i where y i is the response variable expressed as a linear function of the parameters Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤k as well as the independent variables x1 xk e i represents a random error term to interpet the results of the mlr it is necessary to complete three following steps first of all a matter of major importance is to notice whether the relationship of response to each included term of the model is statistically significant to do so a pair of hypotheses is set the null hypothesis ho is that each parameter Œ≤ is statistically insignificant this conclusion is in favor of no relation between the response and the independent variable related to the relevant examined parameter on the contrary the alternative hypothesis results in statistical significance of the examined parameter this conclusion is in favor of the existence of relation between the response and the independent variable related to the relevant examined parameter in order to decide the observed significance level p value of each term is compared to the determined significance level Œ± statistical significance is held if the null is rejected that is when p value is lower than the determined significance level Œ± moving forward to the second step it is important to measure the proportion of response variable variation that can be explained via the estimated linear regression to do so r2 is explained taking into account that ranges from 0 to 1 the closer to 1 the better the model explains the variability of the response variable around its mean by adding more predictors to the model the coefficient r2 tends to increase the last stage is to determine how well the model meets the assumptions of analysis the residuals for the response variable should be normally distributed independent and should have homogeneity in variance finally the third performed method is the stepwise regression this method is about fitting regression models it starts with a blank model or with specific terms that are necessary to be included then the selection of predictive variables is resulting after a number of simulations automatically this is held in every step of the analysis since a term is considered to be added to or to be removed from the model based on a set of explanatory variables and pre specified criterion the analysis stops when all variables that are present in the model are statistically significant moreover stepwise regression allows removing terms from the model based on their statistical significance since it is tested after each iteration methodological tools are further analyzed in gupta and guttman 39 and ross 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary samples the descriptive statistical values of the thms after subtraction of the deflection values are presented in table 3 155 samples were used and analyzed for all four thms compounds chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chcl2br dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 according to the results of table 3 the maximum value of the tthms is below 10 Œºg l while the minimum is close to 1 Œºg l furthermore table 3 mentions the skewness and kurtosis coefficients for tthms concentration skewness coefficient is positive 0 27 while kurtosis coefficient is negative 0 30 these ones indicate that the distribution is positive or right skewed the distribution points to the right the top and tails of this distribution are lighter than the normal distribution respectively fig 2 depicts the normal probability chart in order to ensure that the 155 measurements of tthms belong to a normal population according to the observed p value that is 0 252 it is noticed that it is greater than the 0 05 significance level 95 confidence interval cl this means that the null hypothesis is accepted that is the data sample follows a normal distribution therefore it could be assumed that the data distribution of tthms may be approached by normal distribution additionally fig 3 shows the variance of the thms compounds for all 155 measurements for the bromoform compound chbr3 there is no variation as the measurements were considered zero purple line since it was below detection limit and the maximum concentration of tthms do not exceed 10 Œºg l while in studies in similar water treatment plants golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 platikanov et al 34 and uyak et al 35 where the disinfection of water performed only with chlorine without using ozone the tthms concentrations were 34 Œºg l 121 5 Œºg l and 102 Œºg l respectively it is noted that in the above studies the disinfection of water is done only with chlorine in the untreated water followed by post chlorination while in the water treatment plant of thessaloniki for the oxidation of natural organic matter ozonation is employed in order to avoid using chlorine at the beginning of treatment process 3 2 seasonal variation of total trihalomethanes for a completely randomized one factor experiment it is used the standard y ij Œº ij e ij with i 1 2 nj and j 1 2 k where Œº ij is the mean value of variable response for the j level of the factor k represents the 4 different samples winter w spring sp summer s autumn a and e ij represents a random error as far as the choice of the samples is concerned it is important to underline that the treatments correspond to four different populations w sp s a that differ only in the date of sampling the number of the observations for each sample for winter spring summer and autumn were 35 38 39 and 43 respectively this was considered the criterion of having random and independent samples null hypothesis Œ∑Œø Œºw Œºsp Œºs Œºa against the alternative Œ∑Œ± mean values are not equal after performing general manova the residuals for the response variable are independent are normally distributed and have homogeneity of variance as presented in fig 4 a fig 4 b and fig 4 c this indicates that the model meets the assumptions moreover fig 5 presents the one way analysis of means according to the results of one way analysis of means there is evidence that the tthms concentrations 1 winter and 3 summer differ significantly from the overall mean at 0 05 level of significance since they exceed the decision limits red lines similar results can be found by means of tukey pairwise simultaneous in order to test the differences of means the results are reported in fig 6 if any 95 ci does not contain zero the corresponding means are significantly different we concluded that only the difference of means between 2 and 4 sp a relatively is negligible the interval contains zero since the mean temperature for spring 15 c and autumn 18 c are close together and the same mean chlorine dose 0 67 mg l applied œÑhe seasonal variation for the mean values of the concentrations of the thms compounds and of the tthms presented in fig 7 it is immediately apparent that the highest concentrations occur in summer and the lowest in winter corresponding results of the occurrence of seasonal variation are presented in the works of golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 and platikanov et al 34 3 3 prediction of total trihalomethanes temperature t c ph turbidity ntu total organic carbon toc mg l chlorine dose mg l and residence time hours were used to develop the model and these variables were set as predictors while tthms considered as the response variable the residence time or the effect of contact time in thms formation is a function of three factors 1 the inlet mass flow m3 h of water to the final tank of drinking water 2 the existing volume m3 of water in the final tank and 3 the outlet mass flow from the final tank to the city network after subtracting the outliers of turbidity and toc from the data the size of the final sample was formed in 153 instead of 155 we concluded in the following final descriptive statistics of the parameters as presented in table 4 considering the importance of validating the prediction model large sample permits to use part of it to develop a prediction model training model and the rest of the sample to validate it therefore for the sake of the analysis two random samples were created describe as follows the first sample consists of 102 observations and the second sample of 51 observations the first sample will be used for the training model and the second for validation of the prediction model initially using the first sample of 102 observations pearson correlation was used in order to investigate possible correlations among the parameters the results are reported in table 5 according to the results tthms and temperature have a strong positive correlation r 0 632 furthermore slight positive correlation is also notified between tthms and chlorine dose r 0 272 as well as between tthms and residence time r 0 181 it is worth mentioning that a positive correlation r 0 241 between temperature and chlorine dose is also significant p value 0 015 0 05 this could be due to the fact that during summer months the chlorine dose is higher in order to counterbalance the losses of chlorination due to solar rays golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 for the water treatment plant of thessaloniki the mean chlorine dose during summer months was 0 69 mg l while in winter months was 0 64 mg l 3 3 1 pls prediction model the analysis was started by performing pls method table 6 presents the results of pls regression six components were evaluated temperature ph turbidity toc cl dose and residence time and two were finally selected temperature and residence time according to analysis of variance for tthms the f test is in favor of statistical significance of the selected regression since p value is lower than the 0 05 level of significance the model explains the 37 1 of the variation in tthms while the model with the highest r2 pred 0 413 is selected additionally to the above fig 8 below depicts the model selection diagram the blue dots represent the values of r2 while the red squares represent the values of r2 predicted for each model the best model of all is the one with the blue dot and the red square upon the dashed line as it was mentioned before the model with the two components is the adequate one since it has the highest value of r sq pred thus no differences between the adjusted values and the validation values are observed and therefore no leverage points are indicated as presented in fig 9 fig 10 shows the pls plot of the standard coefficients of predictive variables standard coefficients were used in order to compare the magnitude of the predictors since predictors are not on the same scale the 1st standard coefficient which corresponds to temperature is the largest one and therefore has the greatest effect on the response tthms and then follow the 6th standard coefficient which corresponds to residence time 3 3 2 mlr prediction model table 7 presents the results of mlr the first step in interpreting the results is to determine whether the relationship between the response tthms and each term of the model is statistically significant for the temperature and residence time p values equal to 0 000 and 0 004 respectively both are less than the determined 0 05 significance level therefore there is a significant effect of temperature and time on the response variable tthms since these terms are both statistically significant at 0 05 significance level for every 1 c tthms concentrations increase 0 235 Œºg l ceteris paribus while for every extra hour of chlorine residence in the water tank tthms concentrations increase 0 18 Œºg l ceteris paribus the other variables do not have a corresponding effect to the response variable all p values are greater from the determined 0 05 significance level the model explains the 48 34 of the variation of tthms concentrations multilicollinearity of predictors is also tested via variance inflation factor vif when vif exceeds 10 then multicollinearity could be notified as a problem of the regression that it is necessary to fix this coefficient indicates how much of the variance of a coefficient increases due to the possible correlations among the independents for each predictor there is a corresponding vif coefficient with the maximum value 1 41 referring to the chlorine dose predictor chlorine dose is considered moderately correlated though without negative effects to the level of the coefficients therefore mlr analysis can be applied since no multicollinearity problem is created taking into account the r2 the percentage of variation that can be explained by the model in this case is 48 34 table 7 as mentioned before this percentage explains the variation of tthms concentrations while the rest is explained through other factors thus the r2 pred presents the predictive ability and equals to 41 29 finally a residual plot is presented in order to examine whether the model meets the assumptions of the analysis to conclude fig 11 present the necessary plots according to fig 11 a fig 11 b and fig 11 c residuals are randomly distributed have constant variance and are independent from one another without showing any trends or patterns in time order and are normally distributed respectively 3 3 3 stepwise prediction model the results of stepwise regression are presented in table 8 based on the above results only statistically significant terms to the response variable have been recorded the initial model included six possible predictors however this model has only two significant predictors temperature and residence time since the observed significance levels are lower than the 0 05 significance level these results coincide with those with relevant results of mrl regression according to the estimated regression the coefficients of temperature and residence time have the expected signs and both affect positively tthms more specifically as far as it concerns temperature if it increases by 1 c then tthms concentrations are predicted to change by about 0 254 Œºg l ceteris paribus as for residence time if it increases by 1 h then tthms concentrations are predicted to change by about 0 18 Œºg l ceteris paribus moreover the model explains the 46 07 of the variation of tthms while the r2 pred is equal to 42 90 furthermore as far as it concerns multicollinearity vif coefficients vif 1 indicates that the predictors of temperature and residence time are not correlated and therefore no multicollinearity problem is reported lastly the f hypothesis testing reported indicates whether or not the regression is statistically significant in the relevant part of table 8 the reported p value equals to 0 000 that is lower than 0 05 this means that the regression is statistically significant since the two coefficients as a group affect tthms 3 4 summary of the results taking into account the results of pls mlr stepwise analysis table 9 shows the summarized results according to the results of the regression models mlr model has the highest r2 this is expected since all six predictors included in the model however this model has the smallest r2 pred which means that the import of all predictors in the model is redundant on the other hand stepwise model has the highest r2 pred this is very important since the model will be used for validation finally pls model is very close to predictability to mlr model since both models have almost equal r2 pred and sum of squared errors all models have similar results and no significant differences however the model of stepwise regression was selected as the most suitable one since it has the highest r2 pred using only temperature and residence time as predictors at this point it is a matter of major importance to proceed to a time series plot among measured values of tthms and adjusted values of pls mlr stepwise training models all these are depicted in fig 12 the peaks of the measured tthms values with concentrations higher than 7 Œºg l are higher in all models in contrast for values lower than 7 Œºg l the models fit better and there are no significant differences between three models this trend therefore mainly concerns values that are relatively high on an overall scale indicating that all models pls mlr stepwise are less sensitive in cases of formation of high concentrations of trihalomethanes for the stepwise model as the most suitable model 48 of the adjusted values are within 20 of the measured concentrations of tthms while about 20 of the adjusted values show a high deviation 35 finally time series plot among measured values of tthms and adjusted values of pls mlr stepwise validation models is presented in fig 13 there are only two peaks of the measured tthms between the 10th 14th observation and the 21st 23rd observation where the models deviate from the measured values of response on the contrary all models have good adaptation to the data following the trend of the measured values without having significant differences between them in conclusion for the stepwise model about 40 of the predicted values are within 20 of the measured concentrations of tthms while about 25 of the predicted values show high variance 35 4 conclusions this paper explored empirically the formation of thms in the water treatment plant of thessaloniki greece in this context the analysis employed a dataset of specific parameters that is possible to be measured in this specific the water treatment plant the model was initially used with sample data of 102 observations and then validated with a sample of 51 observations following platikanov et al 34 a combination of three techniques mlr pls and stepwise regression were used to analyze the relevant data sheet regarding the empirical results interesting findings are summarized below the maximum concentration of tthms is below 10 Œºg l the investigation of seasonal variation of tthms clearly showed the effect of temperature on thms concentrations pearson correlation test was in favor of strong positive correlation of tthms with temperature r 0 632 with chlorine dose r 0 272 and residence time r 0 181 as reported in table 5 pls mlr and stepwise models have similar results in pls model from the evaluation of the six predictors through cross validation only two were selected temperature and residence time with r sq pred 41 3 while the chlorine dose was marginally not selected the mlr model includes all variables in the prediction equation with r sq pred 41 29 this regression reported that there is no problem of multicollinearity among variables since all vif coefficients were slightly larger than one finally the stepwise model was selected as the most suitable one since it marginally has the highest r sq pred 42 9 moreover in this model no multicollinearity problem is pointed out since all vifs coefficients were significantly lower vif 1 the stepwise model takes into account only two predictors temperature and residence time this can be statistically explained by the fact that these variables had the highest standard deviations as reported in table 4 specifically standard deviation for temperature and residence time were 5 36 c and 2 27 h respectively while the standard deviation of the other predictors were much smaller declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the

13362,a matter of major importance relies on managing the water treatment process in order to optimize the disinfection process and the corresponding cost maintaining the high standards of the produced water the paper aims at developing a prediction model for trihalomethanes formation of the water treatment plant of thessaloniki northern greece by means of a set of explanatory variables such as temperature ph turbidity total organic carbon chlorine dose and residence time the dataset runs from 2008 to 2020 the analysis used a set of advanced statistical techniques one way anova tukey pairwise comparisons as well as a combination of adequate statistical methods such as partial least square regression pls multiple linear regression mlr and stepwise regression the results revealed a strong positive correlation of temperature with concentrations of trihalomethanes after validation the best model was the one of stepwise regression that included only temperature and residence time to predict total trihalomethanes with high accuracy at low and medium concentration levels r2 46 07 r2 pred 42 9 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water treatment trihalomethanes regression analysis partial least square multiple linear regression 1 introduction over the last five decades starting from rook 1 scientists observed and discovered that disinfecting water with chlorine made the formation of trihalomethanes thms furthermore they recognized the harmful effects that may have on the human body due to long term exposure to disinfection by products westerhoff 2 cantor et al 3 mills et al 4 and king et al 5 disinfection of water with chlorine seems to have significant advantages but also some important disadvantages connected to human health richardson et al 6 it has been over a century since the use of chlorine and some excellent results were pointed out as it minimizes waterborne diseases according to srivastav et al 7 several regulations have been imposed to protect human health in addition many techniques have been developed to remove dbps from the drinking water using advance oxidation process coagulation and membrane based filtration thms are formed in water and in particular in water treatment plants when the natural organic matter present in the water reacts with a strong oxidator the chlorine world health organization 8 di cristo et al 9 the formation of thms in drinking water is very important because of the potentially negative effects on human health several epidemiological studies have linked the presence of thms in drinking water with heart abnormalities premature births but also with bladder colon and rectum cancers cantor et al 3 mills et al 4 and king et al 5 chowdhury et al 10 conducted an experimental study to investigate the factors that influence the formation of thms according to their research the most important and common factors with a positive effect on formation of thms are the disinfectant used i e chlorine total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc uv254 ph temperature residence time and bromide concentrations in addition several studies sadiq and rodriguez 11 navalon et al 12 ye et al 13 mahato and gupta 14 reported the above factors as the most common factors influencing disinfection by products in particular natural organic matter is considered to be the most important precursor of formation of thms however even though it cannot be directly measured it is expressed through toc doc or uv254 as demonstrated in chowdhury and champagne 15 according to stevens et al 16 ph indicates a positive association with formation of thms moreover the reaction time of chlorine in water has the same increasing effect to œÑŒ∑Œºs concentrations furthermore the requirement for chlorine residuals in water up to the extreme point of the distribution network in order to avoid microbial load may contribute to additional increase of thms concentrations gougoutsa et al 17 in their research find out that the main factors affecting thms formations were the chlorine dose and the toc furthermore they conducted that by increasing the contact time the concentration of chlorinated dbps increased also moreover temperature seems to affect also the formation of thms higher temperature leads to the increase of thms concentrations this can be observed as well as be reflected in analysis of drinking water during winter and summer months according to el shahat et al 18 the temperature variability has a significant impact on thms concentrations this is due to the fact that the higher the temperature the higher is the concentration of thms furthermore valdivia garcia et al 19 preformed a laboratory experiment to investigate how the climate change could affect thms concentrations their results showed a positive relation between thms concentration and temperature and specifically if temperature increases by 1 8 c by 2050 the thms will likely increase by 39 on the other hand a recent study of the tap water in 8 counties of china showed higher levels of thms concentrations in winter than in summer or spring zhou et al 20 saidan et al 21 developed a mathematical model for predicting the formation of thms their prediction model includes parameters such as temperature residence time ph chlorine dose and toc they concluded that an increase of one or more parameters leads to an increase in thms concentrations one of the first models to predict the formation of thms was the one of minear and morrow 22 disinfection by products dbps since then many attempts have been made to develop methodologies and models for predicting the formation of thms sadiq and rodriguez 11 kumari and gupta 23 tello et al 24 hong et al 25 lin et al 26 hong 27 most of these based on regression analysis linear or not considering that thms concentration levels are related to temperature ph toc bromides chlorine dose and chlorine residence time godo pla et al 28 used field scale data to predict thms concentration at a full scale drinking water treatment plant a multiple linear regression model was used and after the validation the predictive model was incorporated into an environmental decision support system however the diversity and complexity of thms formation reactions limits the direct application of any developed forecasting model since any model resulted from case study of a specific water treatment plant and therefore cannot be used on a large scale without recalibration nikolaou and lekkas 29 nikolaou et al 30 golfinopoulos et al 31 nikolaou et al 32 golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 developed a methodology of predicting the formation of thms for the water treatment plant of menidi in attica greece the main purpose of their work was to test the use of multiple linear regressions to calculate the concentrations of total trihalomethanes tthms henceforth in order to generalize the methodology in different facilities the examined variables were water temperature ph chlorine dose bromides and chlorophyll chla the development of this model was based on measurements of thms from the final water storage tank as for the examined variables forecast variables the measurement values were calculated after examining the untreated water it is noted that the disinfection of water is done only with chlorine in the untreated water followed by post chlorination before the input of the final drinking water in the distribution system additionally they concluded the values of tthms ranged from 6 to 34 Œºg l with the concentrations of dibrochloromethane and bromomethane not participating as their values were below the detection limit platikanov et al 34 attempted to define chemometric design and prediction of thm formation for a water treatment plant in barcelona multifactorial statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca multiple linear regression analysis mlr including stepwise regression as well as partial of least squares pls regression were used the results of their analysis indicated that the most important predictor variables for determining the concentration of thms are temperature total organic carbon chlorine dose uv absorption and turbidity without taking into account the reaction time after chlorination stage additionally in this water treatment plant chlorination takes place in the first stages of water treatment and before the storage of water in the final tank the values of tthms ranged from 40 8 to 121 5 Œºg l with an average of 75 5 Œºg l with the concentrations of all trihalomethane compounds chloroform bromodichloromethane dibrochloromethane and bromomethane being included as their values were above lower detection limit 0 1 0 25 Œºg l similar study to predict the formation of thms in a water treatment plant was conducted in istanbul as reported by uyak et al 35 temperature total organic carbon ph and chlorine dose were used as parameters and the development of the model was based on the characteristics of the raw water chlorination in this case study took place before the treatment of the water and it was followed by post chlorination mlr was used to predict the formation of thms the values of tthms ranged from 48 to 102 Œºg l with an average of 68 Œºg l with the chloroform compound accounting for 90 of the total trihalomethanes followed by dibromochloromethane the object of this research is the application of statistical analysis techniques to water parameter data at the water treatment plant of thessaloniki to create a reliable prediction model for the thms formation the aim of the prediction model is the daily estimation of the formation concentration of thms since the frequency of sample collection for the measurement of thms is limited only to 18 times per year in case of prediction of unusual concentration of thms an emergency water sample will be taken to be analyzed by the laboratory to make timely decisions of the process of water treatment the novelty of this study is that the prediction model includes only two parameters the most statistically significant ones temperature and residence time showing high accuracy at low and medium concentration levels of measured thms concentrations the present analysis attempts to enrich the research field of the formation of thms through analyzing a specific water treatment plant that of thessaloniki the paper is organized as follows section 1 is an introduction part to analyze the significance as well as the relevant empirical attempts in this field section 2 analyzes the water treatment plant the data sample and the methodological background section 3 reports the results of the analysis along with the relevant discussion and finally section 4 reports the conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the water treatment plant national laws of every country report the maximum levels of trihalomethane concentrations therefore the levels of trihalomethane concentrations must be kept at a low level and must not exceed the maximum values that the national laws determine according to the european economic community directive eecd 36 the upper limit of total trihalomethane concentration is set at 100 Œºg l for greece according to the number c1 d gp oik 67322 2017 sanitary ordinance the parametric value is also set at 100 Œºg l and measurement frequency depends on the daily supply of drinking water the water treatment plant of thessaloniki has been operating since 2003 and utilizes the surface water of aliakmon river eyath 37 nowadays the plant has the capacity to process 150 000 cubic meter per day the relevant laboratory that analyzes the water is accredited according to en iso 17025 2017 the basic stages of water treatment are presented in fig 1 the first step of the treatment process involves ph reduction pre ozonation and rapid mixing the aforementioned steps aim at the effective oxidation of natural organic matter nom and reduction of algae population as well as optimization of flocculation conditions the reduction of ph is achieved by the addition of carbon dioxide co2 polyaluminium chloride pac addition aims to improve flocculation and rapid mixing achieves the homogeneity of the solution heading for the coagulation tanks three coagulation clarification tanks are used for the removal of suspended solids and flocculated colloids in this inner tank a polymer cationic polyectrolyte is added to enhance coagulation s efficiency additionally remaining solids that manage to pass through the coagulation clarification tanks are removed by rapid gravity sand filtration in the water treatment plant nine twin beds single layer sand and two single beds single layer sand zeolite filtering media are in operation once a sand filter is saturated it is backwashed with water and air the turbidity target is already achieved at this stage of the treatment process for the optimum oxidation of organic matter and removal of taste and odor ozonation is employed the ozone is produced by four generators which they produce ozone with electric evacuations for the effective removal of micropollutants and taste and odor compounds activated carbon filtration is implemented in pre ozonation stage 3 in fig 1 the ozone dose ranged from 0 35 0 94 mg l with an average of 0 65 mg l while in main ozonation stage 8 in fig 1 the dose ranged from 0 16 0 54 mg l with an average of 0 31 mg l the group of beds of granulated activated carbon gac includes eight twin beds chlorination follows activated carbon filtration to accomplish destruction of pathogenic organisms and hindrance of growth of microbiological pollution in the reservoir and in the pipes of water distribution finally ph of the produced water is increased by the addition of lime so as to avoid undesirable sediments in the distribution network it should be pointed out that the quality of water derived from all treatment stages is continuously monitored via online instruments that measure physicochemical parameters e g ph temperature turbidity conductivity pressure drop residual chlorine etc and all signals are sent to the control center scada a large number of samples are daily collected from all treatment stages 18 sampling points and analyzed at the quality control lab of the water treatment plant of thessaloniki table 1 presents the raw water quality data from the surface water of aliakmon river the samples of raw data are collected from the inlet tank stage 1 in fig 1 and analyzed from the laboratory 2 2 data description and software tools the laboratory measurements of ph and turbidity conducted according to elot 658 and standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 2130 turbidity 2130b nephelometric method respectively furthermore measurements of ph turbidity and temperature were held in the field by means of electrodes connected to endres hauser hach lange and wtw online meters measurements of toc were conducted in the laboratory by internal method according to apha 5310 Œ≤ the measuring equipment includes shimadzu toc analyzer toc v csh csn synthetic air cylinder air zero and glass sample collection containers of 100 ml also the measurements of thms were conducted in the laboratory according on en iso 17943 2016 e the laboratory analyzed the samples by the head space technique using device for solid phase microextraction with magnetic agitation the quantification limits for the compounds determined range from 0 48 0 83 Œºg l in drinking water agilent technologies gas chromatograph type 7890a gc system were also used for the measurements internal quality control took place before each sample batch measurement and for every 20 samples with standard solutions of known concentration as far as it concerns the external quality control the laboratory participates at least once a year in laboratory quality control tests for the prediction model of thms six parameters have been examined temperature expressed in c ph expressed in units ph turbidity in ntu toc in mg l chlorine dose in mg l time residence in hours represent the effect of contact time and all thms compounds expressed in Œºg l water samples for thms measurements were collected from the exit of final drinking water tank while for temperature ph turbidity toc water samples were collected after the exit of granular activated carbon filter beds stage 9 fig 1 finally statistical analysis was performed with minitab software minitab 19 x 38 while the Œ± significance level was considered equal to 0 05 the predictors and the response are presented in table 2 2 3 methodological tools the current analysis utilizes three different techniques to estimate the variability of tthms concentration these are pls mlr and stepwise regression analysis in order to select the best estimated model it is needed to compare the coefficient of determination r2 or r sq the sum of the square distances ss and the predictive ability r2 pred or r sq pred among models the analysis started from pls method in order to examine the existence of possible relationship among selected predictors and the response variable as mentioned in table 2 this method is able to include all selected parameters in the regression and reduce them into a smaller number ensuring that they are not related to each other then the regression analysis is performed in the reduced model pls leads to a model that explains adequately the variance of the response variable including the smallest number of predictors this is in line with the main objective of the pls technique which is to estimate the best predictability for the response variable furthermore using its residual plots the presence of leverage point could be also examined this contributes to the acceptance or not of the model as a measure to determine how well the model fits to the data more specifically pls method consists of two stages before these stages cross validation is performed this process starts from a model full of predictors and moves forward by leaving out of the analysis one variable at a time the appropriate model is the one with the highest predicted r2 pred value the analysis continues as follows in the first stage which is called training stage a prediction model is created in the second stage the model of the training stage is validated with a different data set the analysis provides the r2 the ss and the r2 pred of the model since cross validation was used the coefficient of determination r2 should be compared with the corresponding prediction coefficient r2 pred ideally the values of both coefficients of determination should be equal furthermore mlr was the second method to use and relies on ordinary least squares methodology mlr aims at minimizing the sum squares of the differences between the observed and the predicted values the mlr is an adequate method for predicting the value of a response from a number of independed variables the model of mlr fits the following formula 1 y i Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x 1 Œ≤ k x k e i where y i is the response variable expressed as a linear function of the parameters Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤k as well as the independent variables x1 xk e i represents a random error term to interpet the results of the mlr it is necessary to complete three following steps first of all a matter of major importance is to notice whether the relationship of response to each included term of the model is statistically significant to do so a pair of hypotheses is set the null hypothesis ho is that each parameter Œ≤ is statistically insignificant this conclusion is in favor of no relation between the response and the independent variable related to the relevant examined parameter on the contrary the alternative hypothesis results in statistical significance of the examined parameter this conclusion is in favor of the existence of relation between the response and the independent variable related to the relevant examined parameter in order to decide the observed significance level p value of each term is compared to the determined significance level Œ± statistical significance is held if the null is rejected that is when p value is lower than the determined significance level Œ± moving forward to the second step it is important to measure the proportion of response variable variation that can be explained via the estimated linear regression to do so r2 is explained taking into account that ranges from 0 to 1 the closer to 1 the better the model explains the variability of the response variable around its mean by adding more predictors to the model the coefficient r2 tends to increase the last stage is to determine how well the model meets the assumptions of analysis the residuals for the response variable should be normally distributed independent and should have homogeneity in variance finally the third performed method is the stepwise regression this method is about fitting regression models it starts with a blank model or with specific terms that are necessary to be included then the selection of predictive variables is resulting after a number of simulations automatically this is held in every step of the analysis since a term is considered to be added to or to be removed from the model based on a set of explanatory variables and pre specified criterion the analysis stops when all variables that are present in the model are statistically significant moreover stepwise regression allows removing terms from the model based on their statistical significance since it is tested after each iteration methodological tools are further analyzed in gupta and guttman 39 and ross 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 primary samples the descriptive statistical values of the thms after subtraction of the deflection values are presented in table 3 155 samples were used and analyzed for all four thms compounds chloroform chcl3 bromodichloromethane chcl2br dibromochloromethane chbr2cl and bromoform chbr3 according to the results of table 3 the maximum value of the tthms is below 10 Œºg l while the minimum is close to 1 Œºg l furthermore table 3 mentions the skewness and kurtosis coefficients for tthms concentration skewness coefficient is positive 0 27 while kurtosis coefficient is negative 0 30 these ones indicate that the distribution is positive or right skewed the distribution points to the right the top and tails of this distribution are lighter than the normal distribution respectively fig 2 depicts the normal probability chart in order to ensure that the 155 measurements of tthms belong to a normal population according to the observed p value that is 0 252 it is noticed that it is greater than the 0 05 significance level 95 confidence interval cl this means that the null hypothesis is accepted that is the data sample follows a normal distribution therefore it could be assumed that the data distribution of tthms may be approached by normal distribution additionally fig 3 shows the variance of the thms compounds for all 155 measurements for the bromoform compound chbr3 there is no variation as the measurements were considered zero purple line since it was below detection limit and the maximum concentration of tthms do not exceed 10 Œºg l while in studies in similar water treatment plants golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 platikanov et al 34 and uyak et al 35 where the disinfection of water performed only with chlorine without using ozone the tthms concentrations were 34 Œºg l 121 5 Œºg l and 102 Œºg l respectively it is noted that in the above studies the disinfection of water is done only with chlorine in the untreated water followed by post chlorination while in the water treatment plant of thessaloniki for the oxidation of natural organic matter ozonation is employed in order to avoid using chlorine at the beginning of treatment process 3 2 seasonal variation of total trihalomethanes for a completely randomized one factor experiment it is used the standard y ij Œº ij e ij with i 1 2 nj and j 1 2 k where Œº ij is the mean value of variable response for the j level of the factor k represents the 4 different samples winter w spring sp summer s autumn a and e ij represents a random error as far as the choice of the samples is concerned it is important to underline that the treatments correspond to four different populations w sp s a that differ only in the date of sampling the number of the observations for each sample for winter spring summer and autumn were 35 38 39 and 43 respectively this was considered the criterion of having random and independent samples null hypothesis Œ∑Œø Œºw Œºsp Œºs Œºa against the alternative Œ∑Œ± mean values are not equal after performing general manova the residuals for the response variable are independent are normally distributed and have homogeneity of variance as presented in fig 4 a fig 4 b and fig 4 c this indicates that the model meets the assumptions moreover fig 5 presents the one way analysis of means according to the results of one way analysis of means there is evidence that the tthms concentrations 1 winter and 3 summer differ significantly from the overall mean at 0 05 level of significance since they exceed the decision limits red lines similar results can be found by means of tukey pairwise simultaneous in order to test the differences of means the results are reported in fig 6 if any 95 ci does not contain zero the corresponding means are significantly different we concluded that only the difference of means between 2 and 4 sp a relatively is negligible the interval contains zero since the mean temperature for spring 15 c and autumn 18 c are close together and the same mean chlorine dose 0 67 mg l applied œÑhe seasonal variation for the mean values of the concentrations of the thms compounds and of the tthms presented in fig 7 it is immediately apparent that the highest concentrations occur in summer and the lowest in winter corresponding results of the occurrence of seasonal variation are presented in the works of golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 and platikanov et al 34 3 3 prediction of total trihalomethanes temperature t c ph turbidity ntu total organic carbon toc mg l chlorine dose mg l and residence time hours were used to develop the model and these variables were set as predictors while tthms considered as the response variable the residence time or the effect of contact time in thms formation is a function of three factors 1 the inlet mass flow m3 h of water to the final tank of drinking water 2 the existing volume m3 of water in the final tank and 3 the outlet mass flow from the final tank to the city network after subtracting the outliers of turbidity and toc from the data the size of the final sample was formed in 153 instead of 155 we concluded in the following final descriptive statistics of the parameters as presented in table 4 considering the importance of validating the prediction model large sample permits to use part of it to develop a prediction model training model and the rest of the sample to validate it therefore for the sake of the analysis two random samples were created describe as follows the first sample consists of 102 observations and the second sample of 51 observations the first sample will be used for the training model and the second for validation of the prediction model initially using the first sample of 102 observations pearson correlation was used in order to investigate possible correlations among the parameters the results are reported in table 5 according to the results tthms and temperature have a strong positive correlation r 0 632 furthermore slight positive correlation is also notified between tthms and chlorine dose r 0 272 as well as between tthms and residence time r 0 181 it is worth mentioning that a positive correlation r 0 241 between temperature and chlorine dose is also significant p value 0 015 0 05 this could be due to the fact that during summer months the chlorine dose is higher in order to counterbalance the losses of chlorination due to solar rays golfinopoulos and arhonditsis 33 for the water treatment plant of thessaloniki the mean chlorine dose during summer months was 0 69 mg l while in winter months was 0 64 mg l 3 3 1 pls prediction model the analysis was started by performing pls method table 6 presents the results of pls regression six components were evaluated temperature ph turbidity toc cl dose and residence time and two were finally selected temperature and residence time according to analysis of variance for tthms the f test is in favor of statistical significance of the selected regression since p value is lower than the 0 05 level of significance the model explains the 37 1 of the variation in tthms while the model with the highest r2 pred 0 413 is selected additionally to the above fig 8 below depicts the model selection diagram the blue dots represent the values of r2 while the red squares represent the values of r2 predicted for each model the best model of all is the one with the blue dot and the red square upon the dashed line as it was mentioned before the model with the two components is the adequate one since it has the highest value of r sq pred thus no differences between the adjusted values and the validation values are observed and therefore no leverage points are indicated as presented in fig 9 fig 10 shows the pls plot of the standard coefficients of predictive variables standard coefficients were used in order to compare the magnitude of the predictors since predictors are not on the same scale the 1st standard coefficient which corresponds to temperature is the largest one and therefore has the greatest effect on the response tthms and then follow the 6th standard coefficient which corresponds to residence time 3 3 2 mlr prediction model table 7 presents the results of mlr the first step in interpreting the results is to determine whether the relationship between the response tthms and each term of the model is statistically significant for the temperature and residence time p values equal to 0 000 and 0 004 respectively both are less than the determined 0 05 significance level therefore there is a significant effect of temperature and time on the response variable tthms since these terms are both statistically significant at 0 05 significance level for every 1 c tthms concentrations increase 0 235 Œºg l ceteris paribus while for every extra hour of chlorine residence in the water tank tthms concentrations increase 0 18 Œºg l ceteris paribus the other variables do not have a corresponding effect to the response variable all p values are greater from the determined 0 05 significance level the model explains the 48 34 of the variation of tthms concentrations multilicollinearity of predictors is also tested via variance inflation factor vif when vif exceeds 10 then multicollinearity could be notified as a problem of the regression that it is necessary to fix this coefficient indicates how much of the variance of a coefficient increases due to the possible correlations among the independents for each predictor there is a corresponding vif coefficient with the maximum value 1 41 referring to the chlorine dose predictor chlorine dose is considered moderately correlated though without negative effects to the level of the coefficients therefore mlr analysis can be applied since no multicollinearity problem is created taking into account the r2 the percentage of variation that can be explained by the model in this case is 48 34 table 7 as mentioned before this percentage explains the variation of tthms concentrations while the rest is explained through other factors thus the r2 pred presents the predictive ability and equals to 41 29 finally a residual plot is presented in order to examine whether the model meets the assumptions of the analysis to conclude fig 11 present the necessary plots according to fig 11 a fig 11 b and fig 11 c residuals are randomly distributed have constant variance and are independent from one another without showing any trends or patterns in time order and are normally distributed respectively 3 3 3 stepwise prediction model the results of stepwise regression are presented in table 8 based on the above results only statistically significant terms to the response variable have been recorded the initial model included six possible predictors however this model has only two significant predictors temperature and residence time since the observed significance levels are lower than the 0 05 significance level these results coincide with those with relevant results of mrl regression according to the estimated regression the coefficients of temperature and residence time have the expected signs and both affect positively tthms more specifically as far as it concerns temperature if it increases by 1 c then tthms concentrations are predicted to change by about 0 254 Œºg l ceteris paribus as for residence time if it increases by 1 h then tthms concentrations are predicted to change by about 0 18 Œºg l ceteris paribus moreover the model explains the 46 07 of the variation of tthms while the r2 pred is equal to 42 90 furthermore as far as it concerns multicollinearity vif coefficients vif 1 indicates that the predictors of temperature and residence time are not correlated and therefore no multicollinearity problem is reported lastly the f hypothesis testing reported indicates whether or not the regression is statistically significant in the relevant part of table 8 the reported p value equals to 0 000 that is lower than 0 05 this means that the regression is statistically significant since the two coefficients as a group affect tthms 3 4 summary of the results taking into account the results of pls mlr stepwise analysis table 9 shows the summarized results according to the results of the regression models mlr model has the highest r2 this is expected since all six predictors included in the model however this model has the smallest r2 pred which means that the import of all predictors in the model is redundant on the other hand stepwise model has the highest r2 pred this is very important since the model will be used for validation finally pls model is very close to predictability to mlr model since both models have almost equal r2 pred and sum of squared errors all models have similar results and no significant differences however the model of stepwise regression was selected as the most suitable one since it has the highest r2 pred using only temperature and residence time as predictors at this point it is a matter of major importance to proceed to a time series plot among measured values of tthms and adjusted values of pls mlr stepwise training models all these are depicted in fig 12 the peaks of the measured tthms values with concentrations higher than 7 Œºg l are higher in all models in contrast for values lower than 7 Œºg l the models fit better and there are no significant differences between three models this trend therefore mainly concerns values that are relatively high on an overall scale indicating that all models pls mlr stepwise are less sensitive in cases of formation of high concentrations of trihalomethanes for the stepwise model as the most suitable model 48 of the adjusted values are within 20 of the measured concentrations of tthms while about 20 of the adjusted values show a high deviation 35 finally time series plot among measured values of tthms and adjusted values of pls mlr stepwise validation models is presented in fig 13 there are only two peaks of the measured tthms between the 10th 14th observation and the 21st 23rd observation where the models deviate from the measured values of response on the contrary all models have good adaptation to the data following the trend of the measured values without having significant differences between them in conclusion for the stepwise model about 40 of the predicted values are within 20 of the measured concentrations of tthms while about 25 of the predicted values show high variance 35 4 conclusions this paper explored empirically the formation of thms in the water treatment plant of thessaloniki greece in this context the analysis employed a dataset of specific parameters that is possible to be measured in this specific the water treatment plant the model was initially used with sample data of 102 observations and then validated with a sample of 51 observations following platikanov et al 34 a combination of three techniques mlr pls and stepwise regression were used to analyze the relevant data sheet regarding the empirical results interesting findings are summarized below the maximum concentration of tthms is below 10 Œºg l the investigation of seasonal variation of tthms clearly showed the effect of temperature on thms concentrations pearson correlation test was in favor of strong positive correlation of tthms with temperature r 0 632 with chlorine dose r 0 272 and residence time r 0 181 as reported in table 5 pls mlr and stepwise models have similar results in pls model from the evaluation of the six predictors through cross validation only two were selected temperature and residence time with r sq pred 41 3 while the chlorine dose was marginally not selected the mlr model includes all variables in the prediction equation with r sq pred 41 29 this regression reported that there is no problem of multicollinearity among variables since all vif coefficients were slightly larger than one finally the stepwise model was selected as the most suitable one since it marginally has the highest r sq pred 42 9 moreover in this model no multicollinearity problem is pointed out since all vifs coefficients were significantly lower vif 1 the stepwise model takes into account only two predictors temperature and residence time this can be statistically explained by the fact that these variables had the highest standard deviations as reported in table 4 specifically standard deviation for temperature and residence time were 5 36 c and 2 27 h respectively while the standard deviation of the other predictors were much smaller declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the

bioreactors c d e processing synthetic wastewater containing pentachlorophenol pcp were used to study the effectiveness of pcp removal and the impact of high levels of pcp 100 mg l 1 on bacterial community compositions another mm sbbr a treating real effluent of the recycled paper mill industry containing pcp was also operated and compared the mm sbbr b achieved a high chemical oxygen demand cod ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n and pcp removal efficiencies reaching 97 93 and 99 respectively which were attributed to the enrichment of high pcp resistant bacteria in this reactor it was found that the number of bacterial species was the highest 10 species in bioreactor b when compared to the other bioreactors bioreactor a c d and e proteobacteria phylum 9 species was found dominated throughout the study suggesting that the combination mm with granular activated carbon gac and plastic media encouraged the growth of various bacterial species that were resistant to high levels of pcp and thus enhancing the removal of pcp it can be concluded that the hybrid treatment system of multimedia mm and sbbr is highly capable of removing pcp from water contaminated with pcp due to the diversity presence of pcp resistant bacteria in this bioreactor mm sbbr could be the effective treatment method for wastewater containing pcp to improve water quality and ensure sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcr dgge hybrid treatment system multimedia sequencing batch biofilm reactor pentachlorophenol 1 introduction the release of adsorbable organic halide aox compounds to the environment as a result of industrial activity has become particularly alarming due to the toxic effects of these compounds effluents derived from the activities of the pulp and paper industry contain various aox compounds that are mutagenic and cause disruption to the endocrine system 1 chlorophenols cps are considered as the major aox pollutants from the pulp and paper industry because of their toxic nature they are difficult to degrade 2 and besides they inhibit the growth of microorganisms therefore pulp and paper mill effluent containing cps must be treated before being released into the water courses physicochemical and biological treatment technologies such as solvent extraction catalytic oxidation adsorption and photocatalytic degradation have emerged in order to remove cps from contaminated medium 3 among these treatment technologies biological techniques have gained more interest due to high treatment effectiveness ease of treatment eco friendly approach having less capital input and do not form toxic by products like physicochemical treatments 4 in recent years a number of biodegradation studies have focused on bacterial species that effectively degrade pentachlorophenol pcp at high levels of contamination it is scientifically proven that many strains of bacteria have a potentially significant role in resistance degradation and mineralisation of pcp among the reported bacterial species that have potential for pcp biodegradation are pseudomonas sp 5 sphingomonas sp 6 kokuria sp 7 bacillus sp 8 serratia sp 9 and acinetobacter sp 10 however most of these studies focused on the degradation efficiency of pcp by isolated strains from non industrial environments such as soil water plants and animals despite that information concerning bacterial communities that are found in the engineering biomass e g biofilm is currently limited the biofilm generated during the paper making process can be an effective incubator to a wide variety of bacteria that can adapt to any resistance due to the presence of lignin cellulose hemicellulose lipids and some toxic compounds such as chlorinated organic compounds resin acids heavy metals and others 5 recently the application of biofilm process in wastewater treatment has attracted more attention over conventional treatment methods this is due to the ability of having high reaction rates due to formation of biofilm that contributes to the increased concentrations of active biomass 29 furthermore it is important to understand how the toxic nature of pcp impacts bacterial communities dynamics as well as how bacterial communities can impact the fate of pcp in a biofilm treatment system knowledge about the bacterial community in effluent treatment is necessary to ensure that the treatment system is functioning effectively however a conventional culture dependent approach to identify the bacterial community is not only laborious and time consuming but is only capable of detecting a small amount of bacteria exist in the environmental samples 11 currently a variety of dna fingerprinting methods based on 16s rdna are available including polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge 12 terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp 13 random amplified polymorphic dna rapd 14 and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification risa analysis 15 among these methods the most widely used analytical method for microbial community studies in pulp and paper mill samples is 16s rdna pcr dgge 16 due to its virtues of low cost good repeatability and less intensive data analysis 17 although the ability of 16s rdna pcr dgge to identify the target organisms is in relatively small quantities 0 1 1 this method is extremely versatile with lower cost in microbial profile identification compared to results obtained by next generation sequencing ngs method 18 in recent years this pcr dgge method has been applied to evaluate the toxicity effect on microbial communities as it can show variations in microbial diversity and community structure throughout the process 19 according to chen et al 20 there are factors that influence the microbial community profile in effluent treatment including influent composition and process configuration the profile of the microbial community in the effluent treatment system has a high relation to the concentration of the substrate and the inhibitory component present in the influent 21 this is due to differences in metabolic activity substrate affinity and resistance capability of various microorganisms he et al 22 showed that the presence of pcp affected the performance and community of microbes in a sequencing batch reactor sbr they found that by increasing the pcp concentration the quantity of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob remained while the number of bacterial species decreased on the other hand a study by long et al 23 also found that abundance of proteobacteria which was responsible for dechlorination and denitrification was observed after pcp was introduced into hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr siczek et al 24 also mentioned the same in which the presence of pcp stimulates the growth of proteobacteria in soil the presence of co substrates also affects the microbial community profile li et al 25 studied the lincomycin degradation in the aerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr system with the addition of glucose as a growth substrate the dgge and 16s rdna result showed a greater diversity in the co metabolism system than in the control system without glucose and different dominant populations were formed inside both systems variation in the different effluent treatment processes also results in the different structure of the microbial population xiao et al 26 showed that there was an increase in the diversity of bacterial communities when the mode of operation shifted from sbbr to sbr in the study by hu et al 27 they successfully found proteobacteria such as nitrosomonas as the most dominant in aerobic anoxic a o processes or anaerobic aerobic anoxic a2 o in 12 municipal effluent treatment plants via 454 pyrosequencing analysis by using the same analysis shu et al 28 found that the phyla of chloroflexi proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the majority of the bacteria in samples retrieved from six full scale wastewater treatment plants based on the findings it can be concluded that the diversity of microbial community is affected by difference composition and process configuration thus contributing on the performance of bioreactors however no record on the deployment of multimedia mm with sbbr to remove pollutants correlated to the responsible bacteria community profile has been reported the use of multimedia mm in sbbr is important as it serves a high porosity rough medium surface which enhances the adsorption of pollutants and provides surface for the active biomass to attach and grow thus enhancing the removal efficiency as reported by muhamad et al 29 the potential removal of mm sbbr towards pollutant removal and its bacteria community composition remains undiscovered until now therefore in this present study the removal performance of pollutants was investigated using a hybrid treatment system namely mm sbbr as we are aware there is no record regarding the understanding on how the toxic compounds such as pcp impact bacterial community dynamics as well as how bacterial communities can influence the fate of pcp in mm sbbr as a result a dna fingerprinting method namely polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge based on 16s rdna was selected to portray the bacterial community compositions inside the mm sbbr knowledge about bacterial community in wastewater treatment is necessary to ensure that the treatment system is functioning effectively the findings from this study will shed light on future biofilm treatment technology not only for water contaminated with pcp but also for industry having similar effluent characteristics thus this study aimed to characterise the composition of bacterial population in a multimedia sequencing batch biofilm reactor mm sbbr as a hybrid treatment system and its control bioreactors in processing synthetic wastewater containing pcp using the pcr dgge to comprehend the realistic application of wastewater treatment the composition of bacterial communities of mm sbbr in processing the effluent of real recycled paper mill containing pcp was also evaluated the mm sbbr systems were composed of different carriers namely granular activated carbon gac and plastic media gac presents a high porosity rough medium surface 30 which enhances the adsorbance of pcp and facilitates a surface for the active biomass to attach and growth this is a continuation from a previous research carried out by muhamad et al 29 which focused on the performance of mm sbbr system at 5 to 100 mg l 1 of pcp initial concentrations and the mechanism and kinetic studies of mm sbbr for the treatment of contaminated wastewater containing pcp and not towards the bacterial community compositions therefore in this current work the bacterial populations were analysed focusing on the possible influence of the influent composition and process configuration on the profile of the bacterial communities when exposed to the highest initial concentration observed from the previous study of 100 mg pcp l 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors system setup and operational conditions fig 1 shows the bioreactors set up used in this study bioreactors a b c d and e operated in a similar manner to the setup used during the study focusing on the mechanism and kinetics conducted by muhamad et al 29 bioreactor c was without biofilm carrier while other bioreactors were equipped with different type of biofilm carriers bioreactor a and b having multimedia

while bioreactor e was with gac bioreactor a was fed with real wastewater samples which was retrieved from a recycled paper mill in selangor malaysia while bioreactor b and the other three control bioreactors bioreactor c d and e were fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose ammonium sulphate and tri sodium phosphate as reported previously in muhamad et al 29 the bioreactors were operated using a strategy similar to that used by muhamad et al 29 which considers a phase of acclimatisation 294 days prior to the performance study of water contaminated with 100 mg pcp l 1 49 days briefly the bioreactors were allowed to operate at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h with three consecutive phases filling and reaction aerated duration 22 h settling non aerated duration 1 h and drawing non aerated duration 1 h in sequencing batch mode 29 the effect on the highest initial concentration of pcp towards the bacterial community compositions was studied further and is elaborated in the following section 2 4 2 2 analysis of wastewater wastewater from each bioreactor was collected 100 ml twice per week and was preserved at 4 c prior to the analysis of cod and nh3 n samples were filtered using 0 45 Œºm cellulose nitrate membrane filters whatman german physico chemical analysis was done according to the hach technique and spectrophotometer hach dr3900 usa was used to analyse the samples while pcp was analysed according to the method used by muhamad et al 29 2 3 analysis of statistical data experimental data obtained was tested using analysis of variance anova in which spss programme version 21 0 spss inc chicago il was used to conduct these tests and at 95 confidence limits 31 two way anova was employed to discover the out turn on the performance of pcp removal

amplification biomass samples from five bioreactor systems fig 1 were taken at the end of the bioreactor experiment to identify the resistant bacterial community against 100 mg l 1 pcp to identify this bacterial community 100 ml of suspended biomass sample was extracted from the bioreactor system for bioreactor systems containing carriers sampling of carriers containing biofilm was performed together with 100 ml of suspended biomass samples each carrier samples were collected in 100 ml of suspended biomass and sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasonic water bath thermo 100 ultrasonic cleaner malaysia then samples were placed in an incubator shaker protech s1 100d malaysia for 20 min 37 1 c 150 rpm to detach the biofilm from the carriers into the liquid phase all prepared biomass samples

discussion 3 1 performance of bioreactors the cod nh3 n and pcp removal performance in the bioreactors a b c d and e is shown in fig 2 the small and capital letters of a a b b c c d d or e e mean that there is a significant difference at p 0 05 of cod nh3n or pcp values between two bioreactors for example when bioreactor a was taken as the reference point any comparison resulting a a means the values of cod nh3n or pcp between bioreactor a and another bioreactor bioreactor b c d or e is different significantly this also applies for b b c c d d and e e with respect to bioreactor b c d and e respectively based on fig 2 a there is a significant difference for cod removal that can be observed among the five bioreactors with the removal percentage in the range of 88 97 a different feed composition was found to affect the removal efficiencies between bioreactors a and b based on fig 2 a the percentage of cod removal in bioreactor a was significantly lower 88 compared to bioreactor b 97 due to the presence of organic and inorganic matter in real wastewater with higher influent cod concentration 1436 1588 mg l 1 applied in bioreactor a in contrast the cod removal percentage in bioreactor b exhibited an elevated removal due to the application of an easily degradable carbon source of glucose in the synthetic water according to chen et al 20 feed composition was one of the factors influencing the structure of microbial population and played a vital role in the removal of contaminants based on fig 2 a bioreactor b showed a higher removal performance than bioreactors c d and e despite being operated at the same influent cod and pcp concentrations multimedia applications encouraged the growth of biofilms with the presence of a highly resistant population of degrading bacteria 29 the increase in the population of these bacteria enhanced the potential of bioreactor b in cod removal compared to the other bioreactors in general there was a significant difference in cod removal between the five bioreactors and bioreactor b showed a more effective cod removal performance than the other bioreactors based on the higher removal percentage obtained based on fig 2 b bioreactor a showed the highest nh3 n removal performance which was more than 99 while bioreactor c showed the lowest nh3 n removal performance of only 30 significant performance differences between these two bioreactors were due to the factors of supporting media influent feed composition and the presence of inoculum application of multimedia with high surface area real wastewater containing organic and nutrient loads and activated sludge with high biomass concentration as inoculums provided a favorable environment for biofilm growth in bioreactor a which in turn had improved nh3 n removal efficiency regardless the pcp toxicity according to rittmann 34 the existence of biofilms protects sensitive microorganisms from loss or inhibition 34 although categorised as a biofilm reactor with gac applications as supporting media only 58 of nh3 n was removed in bioreactor e the removal of this nh3 n was possibly influenced by the adsorption of gac alone as bioreactor e operated without any inoculums nonetheless the existence of non polar surfaces on gac due to the process of gac production at high temperatures reduce the adsorption ability for nh3 n 35 nh3 n removal in bioreactor e may also be affected by the existence of indigenous microbial biomass but its presence did not give significant impact on nh3 n removal since pcp toxicity had a negative impact on microbial biodegradation potential and there was no additional nutrient supply in general bioreactor a had demonstrated a much better nh3 n removal performance than the other bioreactors suggesting that the feed composition including pcp did not negatively affect nh3 n removal performance since bioreactor a was fully acclimatised with the influent and various hard degradable organics in influent were expected to support the growth of biomass and provide sufficient energy for the metabolism process of nh3 n based on fig 2 c two bioreactors namely bioreactors b and d showed almost complete pcp removal efficiency of more than 98 however bioreactor b was seen to be more effective because faster removal rates were observed as early as 2 h of removal 29 in addition to the increase of biofilm biodegradation rate in bioreactor b the adsorption of gac present in multimedia also played an important role in accelerating the rate of pcp removal gac applications were seen to be quite relevant in the adsorption of organic matter such as pcp due to the hydrophobic gac surface properties with a pore size in the nanometre range or more 36 based on fig 2 c almost no pcp removal was observed and pcp toxicity at 100 mg l 1 pursued to retard pcp biodegradation in bioreactor c furthermore the percentages of pcp removal in bioreactors a and e were found to be satisfactory with removals of 43 and 46 respectively the performance shown by bioreactor a illustrated that the possibility of the presence of hard degradable compounds in real wastewater had created competition between pcp compounds which in turn slowed down the pcp removal rate for bioreactor e the performance indicated the adsorption capability of gac remained consistent it was possible due to the inhibition of gac caused by the speedy growth of biomass on the surface of gac thus decreasing the effectiveness of pcp removal from the contaminated medium sharbatmaleki and batista 37 also faced the same issue to overcome this leong et al 38 suggested several cleaning techniques namely air scouring and backwashing to reduce the blockage issue in general bioreactor b had better pcp removal performance than the other bioreactors indicating that the mm sbbr system is one of the effective methods for pcp removal but its performance depends on the influent feed composition as it exists in real wastewater muhamad et al 29 stated that the removal of pcp cod and nh3 n in the bulk solution in the mm sbbr was highly related with the biodegradation and adsorption processes two major factors affecting the removal efficiencies of pcp cod and nh3 n were the inoculum of suspended biomass growth and gac as adsorbent in the mm sbbr despite being affected by pcp toxicity moreover despite increment in pcp load and biofilm formation the gac adsorption capacity remains consistent liu et al 39 suggested that the œÄ œÄ dispersive interactions plays a major role in the adsorption behaviour of phenolic compounds on activated carbon in which the œÄ œÄ interactions are enhanced with the increase in the number of electron withdrawing substituent groups therefore in this study the higher chloro substituent group in pcp further enhances the œÄ œÄ interactions resulting in lower probability of desorption apart from that this is the continuation study from the previous work by muhamad et al 29 that focused on the identification of bacteria resistant towards high concentrations of pcp in which highly pcp resistant bacteria were identified from each bioreactor exposed with water contaminated with the highest pcp initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the following section in addition the effects of different configurations and feed compositions on diversity of bacterial species are discussed 3 2 identification of highly pcp resistant bacteria the dna bands were cut from each bioreactor sample fig 3 in principle bands at the same position should contain identical sequences and were derived from the same species the species identification process for each selected band was carried out through dna sequence analysis in total there were 22 sequences of 16s rrna genes fig 3 that were identified to be highly resistant to pcp 100 mg pcp l 1 the strains closest to the 22 sequences of these 16s rrna genes were determined by blast analysis using the genbank database bands that failed to show quality 16s rrna gene sequence are not listed in table 1 out of the 22 selected 16s rrna gene sequences only one of the 16s rrna gene sequences was poor quality which is band 10 table 1 to obtain a comprehensive picture all 16s rrna gene sequences were analysed in one phylogenetic tree as shown in fig 4 sequence analysis of the dgge band showed that the dominant phyla was present in the bioreactors results found that bioreactors consisted of three main phyla namely proteobacteria firmicutes and spirochaetes among the three phyla proteobacteria was the dominant phylogeny of 71 15 species followed by firmicutes 24 5 species and spirochaetes 5 1 species a study conducted by bailon salas et al 16 identified that proteobacteria 56 and firmicutes 28 were the dominant phylogenies in air lagoon effluent samples from paper and pulp mills although the relative ratios were different from this study the sequences were the same according to zhao et al 40 proteobacteria and firmicutes were widely identified in various effluent treatment plants and played an important role in the removal of contaminants proteobacteria phylum was often ranked higher in the removal of chlorophenol compounds than the other phylum as listed in table 1 gammaproteobacteria is the dominant class of proteobacteria with 57 12 species followed by betaproteobacteria 10 2 species and alphaproteobacteria 5 1 species bands 4 12 and 17 showed similarities to cronobacter sp with the percentage of the similarities greater than 97 table 1 two identifiable cronobacter sp were cronobacter dublinensis subsp lactaridi for band 4 97 similarity and cronobacter sakazakii for bands 12 100 similarity and 17 98 similarity according to kumar et al 41 the results of the species survival test showed that cronobacter sp was not only effective but was the dominant strain in pulp and paper mill effluents this result showed that this species was suitable to be applied on a real scale as it is very similar to the actual conditions sequence analysis for bands 18 and 22 respectively showed 99 and 98 similarities to salmonella sp according to turki et al 42 salmonella sp was one of the most resistant species in the environment the two rrna sequences of bands 6 and 7 respectively showed 87 and 94 similarities to intestinibacter sp for bands 11 and 21 blast analysis showed greater than 99 similarities with asaccharospora sp intestinibacter bartlettii and asaccharospora irregularis were two species formerly known as clostridium bartlettii and clostridium irregularis 43 recombination of these two species led to the formation of a new gene intestinibacter sp and asaccharospora sp basically these two species were classified into the same gene of clostridium sp clostridium sp was not only able to degrade toxic aromatic compounds but also played a role in biological production of hydrogen this fact was in accordance with a study conducted by tai et al 44 who found that the clostridium butyricum strain can produce hydrogen at approximately 1 4 mol h2 mol 1 glucose in the presence of 200 400 mg l 1 phenol in the wastewater in the study some phenols were also degraded although toxic industrial effluents were more likely to be considered hazardous waste than sources a study conducted by tai et al 44 indicated that there was a potential for biological production of these hazardous compounds using selected strains of bacteria in the appropriate environment referring to the pcp removal fig 2 there were two bacterial species that were unique to bioreactor b e psidii strain lmg 7039 and a irregularis dsm 2635 and two bacterial species that were found in bioreactor b and d p diazotrophica strain nkmu jpy461 and n multiformis strain nl13 from the aforementioned species n multiformis found in bioreactor b and d was reported to be a good denitrifying bacterium de chlorination of pcp involves several complex mechanisms including the electron transfer in this case good denitrifying bacteria was reported to facilitate as electron donor which resulted in the enhancement of pcp de chlorination processes 45 in addition erwinia sp 46 and paraburkholderia sp 47 are also reported to be able to perform dehalogenation which is the important initial stage in the degradation of pcp up to now research related to the denitrification or dehalogenation capability by asaccharospora sp is yet to be explored according to the obtained result e psidii p diazotrophica and n multiformis was subjected to be responsible for pcp removal via de chlorination pathway producing an intermediate compound that can be processed further by the bacterial metabolism 48 3 3 influence of different bioreactor configuration on the diversity of bacterial species to examine the effects of dissimilar bioreactor configurations on the diversity of bacterial species the discussion in this section will focus on four different bioreactor configurations b c d e that treated the same wastewater based on the analysis of samples obtained from these four bioreactor configurations b c d e a number of different bacterial species were obtained of the 21 bacterial species listed in table 1 only 17 bacterial species were present in bioreactor b c d and e and were linked in the venn diagram fig 5 based on fig 5 10 dominant bacterial species were identified in bioreactor b followed by bioreactor e 9 species bioreactor c 8 species and bioreactor d 2 species the number of bacterial species in bioreactor b 10 species was the highest among the four bioreactors while the number of bacterial species in bioreactor d 2 species was the lowest among all four bioreactors the differences in the number of species between these two bioreactors suggested that multimedia applications through the combination of gac and plastic media in bioreactor b have encouraged the growth of various bacterial species which was different from bioreactor d which used only plastic media according to fig 5 only certain unique bacterial species grew within bioreactor b 3 species bioreactor c 1 species and bioreactor e 5 species the combination of gac and plastic media in bioreactor b supported the growth of these three bacterial species as for bioreactor c only one bacterial species from the inoculum source grew without the presence of supporting media in contrast to bioreactors b and c bioreactor e promoted the growth of five bacterial species even without the addition of inoculum due to the presence of bacterial species in synthetic wastewater in addition gac as the only supporting medium in bioreactor e promoted the growth of all five bacterial species the application of gac media alone in bioreactor e 9 species promoted a significantly higher bacterial species growth than plastic media in bioreactor d 2 species as can be seen in table 1 even without any inoculum the potential of gac allowed for a wide variety of bacteria to grow naturally in bioreactor e the uneven shape and porous structure of gac particles can protect microorganisms from high shear forces and therefore promote microbe colonisation 49 in contrast bioreactor d did not promote the growth of various bacterial species the smooth surface of plastic media as well as smaller surface area 0 0012 m2 g 1 compared to gac 875 m2 g 1 may affect the biofilm formation thereby reducing the growth of various bacterial species the inoculum application alone in bioreactor c 8 species promoted the growth of eight dominant bacterial species this number can be considered quite high compared to the number of dominant bacterial species present in bioreactor b 10 species of the eight bacterial species presented in bioreactor c six species of the bioreactor were the same bacterial species present in bioreactor b table 1 the six species included klebsiella sp band 1 samsonia sp band 3 cronobacter sp band 4 paraburkholderia sp band 13 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 all six species belong to the genus proteobacteria these findings clearly indicate that these species of proteobacteria are able to survive in bioreactor c which is classified as a suspended growth system although burdened with relatively high concentrations of pcp up to 100 mg l 1 the results from this study are consistent with previous studies reporting that species of the proteobacteria phylum were the dominant species identified in a bioreactor supplied with 4 chlorophenol compounds representing other chlorophenol compounds 50 fig 6 shows the bacterial community of each bioreactor studied based on fig 6 a the proteobacteria phylum was one of the most dominant phyla in bioreactor b c d and e among the four bioreactors bioreactor b showed the highest number of proteobacteria communities 9 species fig 6 a and the majority were bacterial species belonging to the class gammaproteobacteria fig 6 b seven identified species bands 1 2 3 4 12 16 and 18 within the bioreactor b were close to the genes that belong to the class gammaproteobacteria of these seven species the majority belong to the family enterobacteriaceae klebsiella sp band 1 cronobacter sp bands 4 12 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 as listed in table 1 according to hurrell et al 51 species of the enterobacteriaceae family are able to adhere to inert surfaces and grow to form biofilms therefore it is possible that the four species of enterobacteriaceae identified in the bioreactor b attached to multimedia and grew at high cell concentrations according to fig 6 although there were no significant differences in the number of species in bioreactors b and e most of the bacterial species growing in both bioreactors were different this difference can be seen in fig 5 which shows that only three species of bacteria were present in the two bioreactors for bioreactor b it was possible that the growth of bacterial species from inoculum sources was more dominant than that of synthetic wastewater on the other hand the growth of bacterial species from synthetic wastewater sources was very encouraging despite the absence of inoculum in the bioreactor e based on blast analysis and confirmed by the phylogenetic tree the rrna sequence of band 1 in bioreactor b was close to klebsiella sp 94 similarity klebsiella sp bands 1 and 19 were also identified in bioreactor c with a similarity of over 94 according to xu et al 52 klebsiella sp can be characterized as 1 a species of facultative anaerobic bacteria which has two types of metabolism namely respiration and fermentation 2 physiologically versatile and 3 gram negative rod shaped bacteria although found in many natural elements of the intestinal flora there is a report of the presence of this species in effluent and contaminated soil indicating that this species has the potential to metabolise toxic compounds 53 klebsiella pneumonia is a well known species of klebsiella the results of a study conducted by gaur et al 54 confirmed that klebsiella pneumonia is capable of degrading phenolic and lignin compounds this species not only has the ability to metabolise toxic compounds but may also carry out heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification activities as reported by pal et al 55 through this activity these species are able to produce cell clumps in the presence of ammonia nitrite and nitrate the discovery of klebsiella sp in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system indicates that this species plays an important role in biofilm formation in the presence of ammonia nitrite and nitrate and thus assures the resistance of the species to pcp toxicity in this study two species close to the cronobacter gene were identified based on blast analysis and validated by phylogenetic tree bands 4 and 12 were identified to match cronobacter dublinensis species 97 similarity and cronobacter sakazakii 100 similarity species of cronobacter dublinensis band 4 were also identified in bioreactor c application of cronobacter sp in the process of environmental bioremediation has been reported in several studies 56 57 according to du et al 56 this species was detected in most biofilm samples on a rotating biological contactor the main reason was this species represented a stable population that existed throughout different stages of treatment as it was formed and attached to the biofilm matrix 57 the discovery of two cronobacter species in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system indicated that both species were able to remain stable in the biofilm structure despite being burdened with pcp toxicity this situation was different from the suspended growth system namely bioreactor c in which only cronobacter dublinensis species were detected in the bioreactor among the new species of enterobacteriaceae identified in bioreactor b was shimwellia pseudoproteus band 16 with 99 similarity according to octavia and lan 58 the habitat of shimwellia sp was still unclear as there were no further reports on the isolation of this species after the initial isolation report the presence of the shimwellia gene in this bioreactor b may be due to the discovery of new habitats suitable for the growth of this species this gene was not only found in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system but was also identified in bioreactor c suspended growth system the discovery of these genes in both types of bioreactor configurations suggests that these genes can grow in different bioreactor configurations despite being burdened with pcp toxicity the fourth enterobacteriaceae species identified in bioreactor b was salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium band 18 with 99 similarity according to schaefer et al 59 salmonella sp were able to withstand many environmental changes including the water environment for a long time the ability of this gene in biofilm formation was also reported by solano et al 60 who found that almost all 97 salmonella sp isolated from various sources were capable of forming biofilms therefore this gene was able to survive in bioreactor b despite being burdened with pcp toxicity two species in the bioreactor b were identified close to the genes belonging to the betaproteobacteria class paraburkholderia diazotrophica band 13 and nitrosospira multiformis band 15 paraburkholderia diazotrophica band 13 with a similarity of 95 was also found in the other three bioreactors namely bioreactors c d and e paraburkholderia diazotrophica was the only species identified in all four bioreactors b c d e as illustrated in fig 5 this paraburkholderia gene belongs to the family burkholderiaceae which is in the order of burkholderiales this gene was proposed following the reclassification of burkholderia genes based on 16s rrna phylogenetic studies however there is still debate over the reclassification of this gene therefore the original name of the burkholderia gene remains as a reference to be associated with the new paraburkholderia gene according to suarez moreno et al 61 the burkholderia gene is capable of degrading various aromatic compounds and use them as a source of carbon most of the burkholderia gene also possesses immense potential in biotechnology applications due to its capability of degrading pollutants for example burkholderia phenoliruptrix now known as paraburkholderia phenoliruptrix was one of the most resistant species capable of degrading complex xenobiotic compounds such as pcp 62 the discovery of the paraburkholderia gene in this study provided a clear indication that this gene was one of the most resistant species against pcp even in different bioreactor configurations nitrosospira multiformis band 15 with similarity of 83 was the only species of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob identified in bioreactor b the nitrosospira gene was also detected in two other bioreactors namely bioreactors d and e these three bioreactors b d and e are classified as biofilm growth systems liang et al 63 found that nitrosospira sp was among the dominant aob species in biofilms and the species responsible for the nitrification process according to kocamemi and √ße√ßen 64 the growth of aob in biofilms was able to withstand the effects of the inhibition caused by xenobiotic compounds therefore it is possible that biofilm formation in all three biofilm growth systems bioreactors b d e studied provides more stable and resistance features of the nitrosospira gene community from the inhibition effects of pcp compared to the free suspended growth system bioreactor c 3 4 effects of different feed composition on the diversity of bacterial species this situation can be seen through the comparison of bacterial species in bioreactors a and b which had the same bioreactor configuration with application of multimedia for biofilm growth but each treated different wastewater sources containing pcp namely paper mill effluent and synthetic wastewater although the number of dominant species living in both bioreactors was very similar the diversity of bacterial species was different due to the different substrate feed composition table 1 based on fig 6 a only two phyla can be identified in the two bioreactors namely proteobacteria and firmicutes where it was found that proteobacteria phylum was the dominant phylum compared to firmicutes the number of species of proteobacteria in bioreactor b 9 species was higher than that of bioreactor a 6 species as can be seen in fig 6 a in this study two types of carbon sources namely complex carbon paper mill effluent and simple glucose synthetic wastewater respectively were provided to bioreactors a and b both bioreactors were found to promote the growth of different bacterial species except that only three of the same species fig 7 were identified in both bioreactors cronobacter sp band 12 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 as can be observed in table 1 all three species came from the same family enterobacteriaceae which belonged to the gammaproteobacteria class the presence of these three species in both sbbr bioreactors proved that these species are able to survive and adapt to different environments cronobacter sakazakii band 14 is a bacterial species that can be easily found from various sources in the environment from insects 65 to plants such as wheat rice spices 66 and household foods 67 the presence of cronobacter sakazakii in various environments indicates that this species has developed many features that enhance its survival in difficult environments such as 1 resistance to uv radiation 2 the ability to attach to various surfaces due to fimbria formation 3 biofilm formation and 4 the ability to resist drying 68 given the advantages of this cronobacter sakazakii it was not possible for this species to survive in different environments with different substrate compositions as can be seen in the bioreactors a and b 3 5 comparative analysis of biological treatment of pcp and related compounds a comparative study of biological treatment of pentachlorophenol and related compounds including aerobic anaerobic and micro aerobic processes under different operational conditions of the ph hrt and do is shown in table 2 long et al 23 built and operated a novel anaerobic lab scale membrane biofilm reactor supplied with an alternative electron donor hydrogen gas h2 to degrade pcp from a synthetic wastewater a mixed microbial community that consisted of three dominant bacteria were identified belonging to the genera xanthobacter azospira and thauera that were able to degrade pcp along with nitrate and sulphate at hrt of 24 h almost 100 of up to 10 mg l 1 pcp was removed table 2 in another study lv et al 72 cultivated micro aerobic granular sludge under oxygen limited conditions 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 in column type combined reactors for degrading pcp from a synthetic wastewater microbial analysis results by pcr dgge revealed that the main microorganisms for pcp degradation might be related to actinobacterium and sphingomonas with an observed high removal of pcp up to 90 at hrt of 10 h table 2 g√≥mez acata et al 69 treated a synthetic wastewater containing 74 mg l 1 of three phenolic compounds comprising 2 cp phenol and m cresol in an aerobic glass bubble column used as a reactor inoculated with activated sludge they reported that bacteroidetes leadbetterella and proteobacteria rhizobiales caulobacterales were the major species in sludge wastewater samples contaminated with a mixture of phenolic compounds they obtained high removal of phenolic compounds 99 at hrt of 48 h table 2 zhao et al 70 demonstrated the effectiveness of lab scale aerobic sbr that could achieve outstandingly high 4 cp removals 100 at hrt of 12 h table 2 the results of microbial community analysis by pcr dgge showed that proteobacteria methylobacillus pseudomonas pseudoxanthomonas comamonas caulobacter stenotrophomonas and bacteroidetes flavobacterium caulobacter sphingobacterium were the most dominant species responsible for the metabolism of 4 cp in recent research wang et al 71 reported results of 4 cp and phenol removals in an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor enriched with manganese oxidising bacteria mnob the biofilm carriers anchored a mixed microbial community nine dominant bacteria were identified as belonging to the genera comamonas zoogloea pseudomonas cupriavidus dokdonella roseomonas and tahibacter this consortium was able to remove 100 of 4 cp and phenol at high hrt of 72 h table 2 based on the discussion above and table 2 pcp removal achieved in mm sbbr bioreactor b obtained in this work was in accordance with the reported results for bioreactors in experiments degrading pcp or related compounds with higher loading rates of pcp at 100 mg l 1 in contrast to mm sbbr bioreactor a in this work pcp removal in real paper wastewater was quite satisfactory due to the complex wastewater content moreover the population of proteobacteria in the mm sbbr bioreactor b was higher than those reported in table 2 which explains the better performance of the mm sbbr bioreactor b 4 conclusions the cod nh3 n and pcp removal performances of mm sbbr were significantly higher than those of the control bioreactors the difference in the removal performances was due to the differences between the bacterial diversity in the mm sbbr and the control bioreactors mm sbbr bioreactor b had attained high cod nh3 n and pcp removal efficiencies reaching 97 93 and 99 respectively which were contributed by the enrichment of high pcp resistant bacteria mm encouraged the growth of various bacterial species in which 10 species was identified in the mm sbbr bioreactor b where the majority belong to proteobacteria phylum 9 species the results indicate that bacterial species belong to the phylum might have a great prospective for pcp polluted wastewater treatment finally all these results indicate that mm sbbr can be a good option for the effluent treatment with high loads of pcp and provide an important reference for the treatment of wastewater containing chlorinated phenolic compounds to further comprehend the behaviour of complex bacterial population with a variety of highly toxic compounds multiple molecular approaches should be examined declaration

bioreactors c d e processing synthetic wastewater containing pentachlorophenol pcp were used to study the effectiveness of pcp removal and the impact of high levels of pcp 100 mg l 1 on bacterial community compositions another mm sbbr a treating real effluent of the recycled paper mill industry containing pcp was also operated and compared the mm sbbr b achieved a high chemical oxygen demand cod ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n and pcp removal efficiencies reaching 97 93 and 99 respectively which were attributed to the enrichment of high pcp resistant bacteria in this reactor it was found that the number of bacterial species was the highest 10 species in bioreactor b when compared to the other bioreactors bioreactor a c d and e proteobacteria phylum 9 species was found dominated throughout the study suggesting that the combination mm with granular activated carbon gac and plastic media encouraged the growth of various bacterial species that were resistant to high levels of pcp and thus enhancing the removal of pcp it can be concluded that the hybrid treatment system of multimedia mm and sbbr is highly capable of removing pcp from water contaminated with pcp due to the diversity presence of pcp resistant bacteria in this bioreactor mm sbbr could be the effective treatment method for wastewater containing pcp to improve water quality and ensure sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords pcr dgge hybrid treatment system multimedia sequencing batch biofilm reactor pentachlorophenol 1 introduction the release of adsorbable organic halide aox compounds to the environment as a result of industrial activity has become particularly alarming due to the toxic effects of these compounds effluents derived from the activities of the pulp and paper industry contain various aox compounds that are mutagenic and cause disruption to the endocrine system 1 chlorophenols cps are considered as the major aox pollutants from the pulp and paper industry because of their toxic nature they are difficult to degrade 2 and besides they inhibit the growth of microorganisms therefore pulp and paper mill effluent containing cps must be treated before being released into the water courses physicochemical and biological treatment technologies such as solvent extraction catalytic oxidation adsorption and photocatalytic degradation have emerged in order to remove cps from contaminated medium 3 among these treatment technologies biological techniques have gained more interest due to high treatment effectiveness ease of treatment eco friendly approach having less capital input and do not form toxic by products like physicochemical treatments 4 in recent years a number of biodegradation studies have focused on bacterial species that effectively degrade pentachlorophenol pcp at high levels of contamination it is scientifically proven that many strains of bacteria have a potentially significant role in resistance degradation and mineralisation of pcp among the reported bacterial species that have potential for pcp biodegradation are pseudomonas sp 5 sphingomonas sp 6 kokuria sp 7 bacillus sp 8 serratia sp 9 and acinetobacter sp 10 however most of these studies focused on the degradation efficiency of pcp by isolated strains from non industrial environments such as soil water plants and animals despite that information concerning bacterial communities that are found in the engineering biomass e g biofilm is currently limited the biofilm generated during the paper making process can be an effective incubator to a wide variety of bacteria that can adapt to any resistance due to the presence of lignin cellulose hemicellulose lipids and some toxic compounds such as chlorinated organic compounds resin acids heavy metals and others 5 recently the application of biofilm process in wastewater treatment has attracted more attention over conventional treatment methods this is due to the ability of having high reaction rates due to formation of biofilm that contributes to the increased concentrations of active biomass 29 furthermore it is important to understand how the toxic nature of pcp impacts bacterial communities dynamics as well as how bacterial communities can impact the fate of pcp in a biofilm treatment system knowledge about the bacterial community in effluent treatment is necessary to ensure that the treatment system is functioning effectively however a conventional culture dependent approach to identify the bacterial community is not only laborious and time consuming but is only capable of detecting a small amount of bacteria exist in the environmental samples 11 currently a variety of dna fingerprinting methods based on 16s rdna are available including polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge 12 terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp 13 random amplified polymorphic dna rapd 14 and ribosomal intergenic spacer amplification risa analysis 15 among these methods the most widely used analytical method for microbial community studies in pulp and paper mill samples is 16s rdna pcr dgge 16 due to its virtues of low cost good repeatability and less intensive data analysis 17 although the ability of 16s rdna pcr dgge to identify the target organisms is in relatively small quantities 0 1 1 this method is extremely versatile with lower cost in microbial profile identification compared to results obtained by next generation sequencing ngs method 18 in recent years this pcr dgge method has been applied to evaluate the toxicity effect on microbial communities as it can show variations in microbial diversity and community structure throughout the process 19 according to chen et al 20 there are factors that influence the microbial community profile in effluent treatment including influent composition and process configuration the profile of the microbial community in the effluent treatment system has a high relation to the concentration of the substrate and the inhibitory component present in the influent 21 this is due to differences in metabolic activity substrate affinity and resistance capability of various microorganisms he et al 22 showed that the presence of pcp affected the performance and community of microbes in a sequencing batch reactor sbr they found that by increasing the pcp concentration the quantity of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob remained while the number of bacterial species decreased on the other hand a study by long et al 23 also found that abundance of proteobacteria which was responsible for dechlorination and denitrification was observed after pcp was introduced into hydrogen based membrane biofilm reactor mbfr siczek et al 24 also mentioned the same in which the presence of pcp stimulates the growth of proteobacteria in soil the presence of co substrates also affects the microbial community profile li et al 25 studied the lincomycin degradation in the aerobic sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr system with the addition of glucose as a growth substrate the dgge and 16s rdna result showed a greater diversity in the co metabolism system than in the control system without glucose and different dominant populations were formed inside both systems variation in the different effluent treatment processes also results in the different structure of the microbial population xiao et al 26 showed that there was an increase in the diversity of bacterial communities when the mode of operation shifted from sbbr to sbr in the study by hu et al 27 they successfully found proteobacteria such as nitrosomonas as the most dominant in aerobic anoxic a o processes or anaerobic aerobic anoxic a2 o in 12 municipal effluent treatment plants via 454 pyrosequencing analysis by using the same analysis shu et al 28 found that the phyla of chloroflexi proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the majority of the bacteria in samples retrieved from six full scale wastewater treatment plants based on the findings it can be concluded that the diversity of microbial community is affected by difference composition and process configuration thus contributing on the performance of bioreactors however no record on the deployment of multimedia mm with sbbr to remove pollutants correlated to the responsible bacteria community profile has been reported the use of multimedia mm in sbbr is important as it serves a high porosity rough medium surface which enhances the adsorption of pollutants and provides surface for the active biomass to attach and grow thus enhancing the removal efficiency as reported by muhamad et al 29 the potential removal of mm sbbr towards pollutant removal and its bacteria community composition remains undiscovered until now therefore in this present study the removal performance of pollutants was investigated using a hybrid treatment system namely mm sbbr as we are aware there is no record regarding the understanding on how the toxic compounds such as pcp impact bacterial community dynamics as well as how bacterial communities can influence the fate of pcp in mm sbbr as a result a dna fingerprinting method namely polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge based on 16s rdna was selected to portray the bacterial community compositions inside the mm sbbr knowledge about bacterial community in wastewater treatment is necessary to ensure that the treatment system is functioning effectively the findings from this study will shed light on future biofilm treatment technology not only for water contaminated with pcp but also for industry having similar effluent characteristics thus this study aimed to characterise the composition of bacterial population in a multimedia sequencing batch biofilm reactor mm sbbr as a hybrid treatment system and its control bioreactors in processing synthetic wastewater containing pcp using the pcr dgge to comprehend the realistic application of wastewater treatment the composition of bacterial communities of mm sbbr in processing the effluent of real recycled paper mill containing pcp was also evaluated the mm sbbr systems were composed of different carriers namely granular activated carbon gac and plastic media gac presents a high porosity rough medium surface 30 which enhances the adsorbance of pcp and facilitates a surface for the active biomass to attach and growth this is a continuation from a previous research carried out by muhamad et al 29 which focused on the performance of mm sbbr system at 5 to 100 mg l 1 of pcp initial concentrations and the mechanism and kinetic studies of mm sbbr for the treatment of contaminated wastewater containing pcp and not towards the bacterial community compositions therefore in this current work the bacterial populations were analysed focusing on the possible influence of the influent composition and process configuration on the profile of the bacterial communities when exposed to the highest initial concentration observed from the previous study of 100 mg pcp l 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors system setup and operational conditions fig 1 shows the bioreactors set up used in this study bioreactors a b c d and e operated in a similar manner to the setup used during the study focusing on the mechanism and kinetics conducted by muhamad et al 29 bioreactor c was without biofilm carrier while other bioreactors were equipped with different type of biofilm carriers bioreactor a and b having multimedia plastic media height 6 cm diameter 2 cm actual volume 0 7 l and gac particle diameters 0 60 2 36 mm mesh size 8 30 actual volume 0 9 l as the biofilm carriers bioreactor d was with plastic media only while bioreactor e was with gac bioreactor a was fed with real wastewater samples which was retrieved from a recycled paper mill in selangor malaysia while bioreactor b and the other three control bioreactors bioreactor c d and e were fed with synthetic wastewater containing glucose ammonium sulphate and tri sodium phosphate as reported previously in muhamad et al 29 the bioreactors were operated using a strategy similar to that used by muhamad et al 29 which considers a phase of acclimatisation 294 days prior to the performance study of water contaminated with 100 mg pcp l 1 49 days

discussion 3 1 performance of bioreactors the cod nh3 n and pcp removal performance in the bioreactors a b c d and e is shown in fig 2 the small and capital letters of a a b b c c d d or e e mean that there is a significant difference at p 0 05 of cod nh3n or pcp values between two bioreactors for example when bioreactor a was taken as the reference point any comparison resulting a a means the values of cod nh3n or pcp between bioreactor a and another bioreactor bioreactor b c d or e is different significantly this also applies for b b c c d d and e e with respect to bioreactor b c d and e respectively based on fig 2 a there is a significant difference for cod removal that can be observed among the five bioreactors with the removal percentage in the range of 88 97 a different feed composition was found to affect the removal efficiencies between bioreactors a and b based on fig 2 a the percentage of cod removal in bioreactor a was significantly lower 88 compared to bioreactor b 97 due to the presence of organic and inorganic matter in real wastewater with higher influent cod concentration 1436 1588 mg l 1 applied in bioreactor a in contrast the cod removal percentage in bioreactor b exhibited an elevated removal due to the application of an easily degradable carbon source of glucose in the synthetic water according to chen et al 20 feed composition was one of the factors influencing the structure of microbial population and played a vital role in the removal of contaminants based on fig 2 a bioreactor b showed a higher removal performance than bioreactors c d and e despite being operated at the same influent cod and pcp concentrations multimedia applications encouraged the growth of biofilms with the presence of a highly resistant population of degrading bacteria 29 the increase in the population of these bacteria enhanced the potential of bioreactor b in cod removal compared to the other bioreactors in general there was a significant difference in cod removal between the five bioreactors and bioreactor b showed a more effective cod removal performance than the other bioreactors based on the higher removal percentage obtained based on fig 2 b bioreactor a showed the highest nh3 n removal performance which was more than 99 while bioreactor c showed the lowest nh3 n removal performance of only 30 significant performance differences between these two bioreactors were due to the factors of supporting media influent feed composition and the presence of inoculum application of multimedia with high surface area real wastewater containing organic and nutrient loads and activated sludge with high biomass concentration as inoculums provided a favorable environment for biofilm growth in bioreactor a which in turn had improved nh3 n removal efficiency regardless the pcp toxicity according to rittmann 34 the existence of biofilms protects sensitive microorganisms from loss or inhibition 34 although categorised as a biofilm reactor with gac applications as supporting media only 58 of nh3 n was removed in bioreactor e the removal of this nh3 n was possibly influenced by the adsorption of gac alone as bioreactor e operated without any inoculums nonetheless the existence of non polar surfaces on gac due to the process of gac production at high temperatures reduce the adsorption ability for nh3 n 35 nh3 n removal in bioreactor e may also be affected by the existence of indigenous microbial biomass but its presence did not give significant impact on nh3 n removal since pcp toxicity had a negative impact on microbial biodegradation potential and there was no additional nutrient supply in general bioreactor a had demonstrated a much better nh3 n removal performance than the other bioreactors suggesting that the feed composition including pcp did not negatively affect nh3 n removal performance since bioreactor a was fully acclimatised with the influent and various hard degradable organics in influent were expected to support the growth of biomass and provide sufficient energy for the metabolism process of nh3 n based on fig 2 c two bioreactors namely bioreactors b and d showed almost complete pcp removal efficiency of more than 98 however bioreactor b was seen to be more effective because faster removal rates were observed as early as 2 h of removal 29 in addition to the increase of biofilm biodegradation rate in bioreactor b the adsorption of gac present in multimedia also played an important role in accelerating the rate of pcp removal gac applications were seen to be quite relevant in the adsorption of organic matter such as pcp due to the hydrophobic gac surface properties with a pore size in the nanometre range or more 36 based on fig 2 c almost no pcp removal was observed and pcp toxicity at 100 mg l 1 pursued to retard pcp biodegradation in bioreactor c furthermore the percentages of pcp removal in bioreactors a and e were found to be satisfactory with removals of 43 and 46 respectively the performance shown by bioreactor a illustrated that the possibility of the presence of hard degradable compounds in real wastewater had created competition between pcp compounds which in turn slowed down the pcp removal rate for bioreactor e the performance indicated the adsorption capability of gac remained consistent it was possible due to the inhibition of gac caused by the speedy growth of biomass on the surface of gac thus decreasing the effectiveness of pcp removal from the contaminated medium sharbatmaleki and batista 37 also faced the same issue to overcome this leong et al 38 suggested several cleaning techniques namely air scouring and backwashing to reduce the blockage issue in general bioreactor b had better pcp removal performance than the other bioreactors indicating that the mm sbbr system is one of the effective methods for pcp removal but its performance depends on the influent feed composition as it exists in real wastewater muhamad et al 29 stated that the removal of pcp cod and nh3 n in the bulk solution in the mm sbbr was highly related with the biodegradation and adsorption processes two major factors affecting the removal efficiencies of pcp cod and nh3 n were the inoculum of suspended biomass growth and gac as adsorbent in the mm sbbr despite being affected by pcp toxicity moreover despite increment in pcp load and biofilm formation the gac adsorption capacity remains consistent liu et al 39 suggested that the œÄ œÄ dispersive interactions plays a major role in the adsorption behaviour of phenolic compounds on activated carbon in which the œÄ œÄ interactions are enhanced with the increase in the number of electron withdrawing substituent groups therefore in this study the higher chloro substituent group in pcp further enhances the œÄ œÄ interactions resulting in lower probability of desorption apart from that this is the continuation study from the previous work by muhamad et al 29 that focused on the identification of bacteria resistant towards high concentrations of pcp in which highly pcp resistant bacteria were identified from each bioreactor exposed with water contaminated with the highest pcp initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 in the following section in addition the effects of different configurations and feed compositions on diversity of bacterial species are discussed 3 2 identification of highly pcp resistant bacteria the dna bands were cut from each bioreactor sample fig 3 in principle bands at the same position should contain identical sequences and were derived from the same species the species identification process for each selected band was carried out through dna sequence analysis in total there were 22 sequences of 16s rrna genes fig 3 that were identified to be highly resistant to pcp 100 mg pcp l 1 the strains closest to the 22 sequences of these 16s rrna genes were determined by blast analysis using the genbank database bands that failed to show quality 16s rrna gene sequence are not listed in table 1 out of the 22 selected 16s rrna gene sequences only one of the 16s rrna gene sequences was poor quality which is band 10 table 1 to obtain a comprehensive picture all 16s rrna gene sequences were analysed in one phylogenetic tree as shown in fig 4 sequence analysis of the dgge band showed that the dominant phyla was present in the bioreactors results found that bioreactors consisted of three main phyla namely proteobacteria firmicutes and spirochaetes among the three phyla proteobacteria was the dominant phylogeny of 71 15 species followed by firmicutes 24 5 species and spirochaetes 5 1 species a study conducted by bailon salas et al 16 identified that proteobacteria 56 and firmicutes 28 were the dominant phylogenies in air lagoon effluent samples from paper and pulp mills although the relative ratios were different from this study the sequences were the same according to zhao et al 40 proteobacteria and firmicutes were widely identified in various effluent treatment plants and played an important role in the removal of contaminants proteobacteria phylum was often ranked higher in the removal of chlorophenol compounds than the other phylum as listed in table 1 gammaproteobacteria is the dominant class of proteobacteria with 57 12 species followed by betaproteobacteria 10 2 species and alphaproteobacteria 5 1 species bands 4 12 and 17 showed similarities to cronobacter sp with the percentage of the similarities greater than 97 table 1 two identifiable cronobacter sp were cronobacter dublinensis subsp lactaridi for band 4 97 similarity and cronobacter sakazakii for bands 12 100 similarity and 17 98 similarity according to kumar et al 41 the results of the species survival test showed that cronobacter sp was not only effective but was the dominant strain in pulp and paper mill effluents this result showed that this species was suitable to be applied on a real scale as it is very similar to the actual conditions sequence analysis for bands 18 and 22 respectively showed 99 and 98 similarities to salmonella sp according to turki et al 42 salmonella sp was one of the most resistant species in the environment the two rrna sequences of bands 6 and 7 respectively showed 87 and 94 similarities to intestinibacter sp for bands 11 and 21 blast analysis showed greater than 99 similarities with asaccharospora sp intestinibacter bartlettii and asaccharospora irregularis were two species formerly known as clostridium bartlettii and clostridium irregularis 43 recombination of these two species led to the formation of a new gene intestinibacter sp and asaccharospora sp basically these two species were classified into the same gene of clostridium sp clostridium sp was not only able to degrade toxic aromatic compounds but also played a role in biological production of hydrogen this fact was in accordance with a study conducted by tai et al 44 who found that the clostridium butyricum strain can produce hydrogen at approximately 1 4 mol h2 mol 1 glucose in the presence of 200 400 mg l 1 phenol in the wastewater in the study some phenols were also degraded although toxic industrial effluents were more likely to be considered hazardous waste than sources a study conducted by tai et al 44 indicated that there was a potential for biological production of these hazardous compounds using selected strains of bacteria in the appropriate environment referring to the pcp removal fig 2 there were two bacterial species that were unique to bioreactor b e psidii strain lmg 7039 and a irregularis dsm 2635 and two bacterial species that were found in bioreactor b and d p diazotrophica strain nkmu jpy461 and n multiformis strain nl13 from the aforementioned species n multiformis found in bioreactor b and d was reported to be a good denitrifying bacterium de chlorination of pcp involves several complex mechanisms including the electron transfer in this case good denitrifying bacteria was reported to facilitate as electron donor which resulted in the enhancement of pcp de chlorination processes 45 in addition erwinia sp 46 and paraburkholderia sp 47 are also reported to be able to perform dehalogenation which is the important initial stage in the degradation of pcp up to now research related to the denitrification or dehalogenation capability by asaccharospora sp is yet to be explored according to the obtained result e psidii p diazotrophica and n multiformis was subjected to be responsible for pcp removal via de chlorination pathway producing an intermediate compound that can be processed further by the bacterial metabolism 48 3 3 influence of different bioreactor configuration on the diversity of bacterial species to examine the effects of dissimilar bioreactor configurations on the diversity of bacterial species the discussion in this section will focus on four different bioreactor configurations b c d e that treated the same wastewater based on the analysis of samples obtained from these four bioreactor configurations b c d e a number of different bacterial species were obtained of the 21 bacterial species listed in table 1 only 17 bacterial species were present in bioreactor b c d and e and were linked in the venn diagram fig 5 based on fig 5 10 dominant bacterial species were identified in bioreactor b followed by bioreactor e 9 species bioreactor c 8 species and bioreactor d 2 species the number of bacterial species in bioreactor b 10 species was the highest among the four bioreactors while the number of bacterial species in bioreactor d 2 species was the lowest among all four bioreactors the differences in the number of species between these two bioreactors suggested that multimedia applications through the combination of gac and plastic media in bioreactor b have encouraged the growth of various bacterial species which was different from bioreactor d which used only plastic media according to fig 5 only certain unique bacterial species grew within bioreactor b 3 species bioreactor c 1 species and bioreactor e 5 species the combination of gac and plastic media in bioreactor b supported the growth of these three bacterial species as for bioreactor c only one bacterial species from the inoculum source grew without the presence of supporting media in contrast to bioreactors b and c bioreactor e promoted the growth of five bacterial species even without the addition of inoculum due to the presence of bacterial species in synthetic wastewater in addition gac as the only supporting medium in bioreactor e promoted the growth of all five bacterial species the application of gac media alone in bioreactor e 9 species promoted a significantly higher bacterial species growth than plastic media in bioreactor d 2 species as can be seen in table 1 even without any inoculum the potential of gac allowed for a wide variety of bacteria to grow naturally in bioreactor e the uneven shape and porous structure of gac particles can protect microorganisms from high shear forces and therefore promote microbe colonisation 49 in contrast bioreactor d did not promote the growth of various bacterial species the smooth surface of plastic media as well as smaller surface area 0 0012 m2 g 1 compared to gac 875 m2 g 1 may affect the biofilm formation thereby reducing the growth of various bacterial species the inoculum application alone in bioreactor c 8 species promoted the growth of eight dominant bacterial species this number can be considered quite high compared to the number of dominant bacterial species present in bioreactor b 10 species of the eight bacterial species presented in bioreactor c six species of the bioreactor were the same bacterial species present in bioreactor b table 1 the six species included klebsiella sp band 1 samsonia sp band 3 cronobacter sp band 4 paraburkholderia sp band 13 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 all six species belong to the genus proteobacteria these findings clearly indicate that these species of proteobacteria are able to survive in bioreactor c which is classified as a suspended growth system although burdened with relatively high concentrations of pcp up to 100 mg l 1 the results from this study are consistent with previous studies reporting that species of the proteobacteria phylum were the dominant species identified in a bioreactor supplied with 4 chlorophenol compounds representing other chlorophenol compounds 50 fig 6 shows the bacterial community of each bioreactor studied based on fig 6 a the proteobacteria phylum was one of the most dominant phyla in bioreactor b c d and e among the four bioreactors bioreactor b showed the highest number of proteobacteria communities 9 species fig 6 a and the majority were bacterial species belonging to the class gammaproteobacteria fig 6 b seven identified species bands 1 2 3 4 12 16 and 18 within the bioreactor b were close to the genes that belong to the class gammaproteobacteria of these seven species the majority belong to the family enterobacteriaceae klebsiella sp band 1 cronobacter sp bands 4 12 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 as listed in table 1 according to hurrell et al 51 species of the enterobacteriaceae family are able to adhere to inert surfaces and grow to form biofilms therefore it is possible that the four species of enterobacteriaceae identified in the bioreactor b attached to multimedia and grew at high cell concentrations according to fig 6 although there were no significant differences in the number of species in bioreactors b and e most of the bacterial species growing in both bioreactors were different this difference can be seen in fig 5 which shows that only three species of bacteria were present in the two bioreactors for bioreactor b it was possible that the growth of bacterial species from inoculum sources was more dominant than that of synthetic wastewater on the other hand the growth of bacterial species from synthetic wastewater sources was very encouraging despite the absence of inoculum in the bioreactor e based on blast analysis and confirmed by the phylogenetic tree the rrna sequence of band 1 in bioreactor b was close to klebsiella sp 94 similarity klebsiella sp bands 1 and 19 were also identified in bioreactor c with a similarity of over 94 according to xu et al 52 klebsiella sp can be characterized as 1 a species of facultative anaerobic bacteria which has two types of metabolism namely respiration and fermentation 2 physiologically versatile and 3 gram negative rod shaped bacteria although found in many natural elements of the intestinal flora there is a report of the presence of this species in effluent and contaminated soil indicating that this species has the potential to metabolise toxic compounds 53 klebsiella pneumonia is a well known species of klebsiella the results of a study conducted by gaur et al 54 confirmed that klebsiella pneumonia is capable of degrading phenolic and lignin compounds this species not only has the ability to metabolise toxic compounds but may also carry out heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification activities as reported by pal et al 55 through this activity these species are able to produce cell clumps in the presence of ammonia nitrite and nitrate the discovery of klebsiella sp in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system indicates that this species plays an important role in biofilm formation in the presence of ammonia nitrite and nitrate and thus assures the resistance of the species to pcp toxicity in this study two species close to the cronobacter gene were identified based on blast analysis and validated by phylogenetic tree bands 4 and 12 were identified to match cronobacter dublinensis species 97 similarity and cronobacter sakazakii 100 similarity species of cronobacter dublinensis band 4 were also identified in bioreactor c application of cronobacter sp in the process of environmental bioremediation has been reported in several studies 56 57 according to du et al 56 this species was detected in most biofilm samples on a rotating biological contactor the main reason was this species represented a stable population that existed throughout different stages of treatment as it was formed and attached to the biofilm matrix 57 the discovery of two cronobacter species in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system indicated that both species were able to remain stable in the biofilm structure despite being burdened with pcp toxicity this situation was different from the suspended growth system namely bioreactor c in which only cronobacter dublinensis species were detected in the bioreactor among the new species of enterobacteriaceae identified in bioreactor b was shimwellia pseudoproteus band 16 with 99 similarity according to octavia and lan 58 the habitat of shimwellia sp was still unclear as there were no further reports on the isolation of this species after the initial isolation report the presence of the shimwellia gene in this bioreactor b may be due to the discovery of new habitats suitable for the growth of this species this gene was not only found in bioreactor b classified as a biofilm growth system but was also identified in bioreactor c suspended growth system the discovery of these genes in both types of bioreactor configurations suggests that these genes can grow in different bioreactor configurations despite being burdened with pcp toxicity the fourth enterobacteriaceae species identified in bioreactor b was salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium band 18 with 99 similarity according to schaefer et al 59 salmonella sp were able to withstand many environmental changes including the water environment for a long time the ability of this gene in biofilm formation was also reported by solano et al 60 who found that almost all 97 salmonella sp isolated from various sources were capable of forming biofilms therefore this gene was able to survive in bioreactor b despite being burdened with pcp toxicity two species in the bioreactor b were identified close to the genes belonging to the betaproteobacteria class paraburkholderia diazotrophica band 13 and nitrosospira multiformis band 15 paraburkholderia diazotrophica band 13 with a similarity of 95 was also found in the other three bioreactors namely bioreactors c d and e paraburkholderia diazotrophica was the only species identified in all four bioreactors b c d e as illustrated in fig 5 this paraburkholderia gene belongs to the family burkholderiaceae which is in the order of burkholderiales this gene was proposed following the reclassification of burkholderia genes based on 16s rrna phylogenetic studies however there is still debate over the reclassification of this gene therefore the original name of the burkholderia gene remains as a reference to be associated with the new paraburkholderia gene according to suarez moreno et al 61 the burkholderia gene is capable of degrading various aromatic compounds and use them as a source of carbon most of the burkholderia gene also possesses immense potential in biotechnology applications due to its capability of degrading pollutants for example burkholderia phenoliruptrix now known as paraburkholderia phenoliruptrix was one of the most resistant species capable of degrading complex xenobiotic compounds such as pcp 62 the discovery of the paraburkholderia gene in this study provided a clear indication that this gene was one of the most resistant species against pcp even in different bioreactor configurations nitrosospira multiformis band 15 with similarity of 83 was the only species of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob identified in bioreactor b the nitrosospira gene was also detected in two other bioreactors namely bioreactors d and e these three bioreactors b d and e are classified as biofilm growth systems liang et al 63 found that nitrosospira sp was among the dominant aob species in biofilms and the species responsible for the nitrification process according to kocamemi and √ße√ßen 64 the growth of aob in biofilms was able to withstand the effects of the inhibition caused by xenobiotic compounds therefore it is possible that biofilm formation in all three biofilm growth systems bioreactors b d e studied provides more stable and resistance features of the nitrosospira gene community from the inhibition effects of pcp compared to the free suspended growth system bioreactor c 3 4 effects of different feed composition on the diversity of bacterial species this situation can be seen through the comparison of bacterial species in bioreactors a and b which had the same bioreactor configuration with application of multimedia for biofilm growth but each treated different wastewater sources containing pcp namely paper mill effluent and synthetic wastewater although the number of dominant species living in both bioreactors was very similar the diversity of bacterial species was different due to the different substrate feed composition table 1 based on fig 6 a only two phyla can be identified in the two bioreactors namely proteobacteria and firmicutes where it was found that proteobacteria phylum was the dominant phylum compared to firmicutes the number of species of proteobacteria in bioreactor b 9 species was higher than that of bioreactor a 6 species as can be seen in fig 6 a in this study two types of carbon sources namely complex carbon paper mill effluent and simple glucose synthetic wastewater respectively were provided to bioreactors a and b both bioreactors were found to promote the growth of different bacterial species except that only three of the same species fig 7 were identified in both bioreactors cronobacter sp band 12 shimwellia sp band 16 and salmonella sp band 18 as can be observed in table 1 all three species came from the same family enterobacteriaceae which belonged to the gammaproteobacteria class the presence of these three species in both sbbr bioreactors proved that these species are able to survive and adapt to different environments cronobacter sakazakii band 14 is a bacterial species that can be easily found from various sources in the environment from insects 65 to plants such as wheat rice spices 66 and household foods 67 the presence of cronobacter sakazakii in various environments indicates that this species has developed many features that enhance its survival in difficult environments such as 1 resistance to uv radiation 2 the ability to attach to various surfaces due to fimbria formation 3 biofilm formation and 4 the ability to resist drying 68 given the advantages of this cronobacter sakazakii it was not possible for this species to survive in different environments with different substrate compositions as can be seen in the bioreactors a and b 3 5 comparative analysis of biological treatment of pcp and related compounds a comparative study of biological treatment of pentachlorophenol and related compounds including aerobic anaerobic and micro aerobic processes under different operational conditions of the ph hrt and do is shown in table 2 long et al 23 built and operated a novel anaerobic lab scale membrane biofilm reactor supplied with an alternative electron donor hydrogen gas h2 to degrade pcp from a synthetic wastewater a mixed microbial community that consisted of three dominant bacteria were identified belonging to the genera xanthobacter azospira and thauera that were able to degrade pcp along with nitrate and sulphate at hrt of 24 h almost 100 of up to 10 mg l 1 pcp was removed table 2 in another study lv et al 72 cultivated micro aerobic granular sludge under oxygen limited conditions 0 1 0 2 mg l 1 in column type combined reactors for degrading pcp from a synthetic wastewater microbial analysis results by pcr dgge revealed that the main microorganisms for pcp degradation might be related to actinobacterium and sphingomonas with an observed high removal of pcp up to 90 at hrt of 10 h table 2 g√≥mez acata et al 69 treated a synthetic wastewater containing 74 mg l 1 of three phenolic compounds comprising 2 cp phenol and m cresol in an aerobic glass bubble column used as a reactor inoculated with activated sludge they reported that bacteroidetes leadbetterella and proteobacteria rhizobiales caulobacterales were the major species in sludge wastewater samples contaminated with a mixture of phenolic compounds they obtained high removal of phenolic compounds 99 at hrt of 48 h table 2 zhao et al 70 demonstrated the effectiveness of lab scale aerobic sbr that could achieve outstandingly high 4 cp removals 100 at hrt of 12 h table 2 the results of microbial community analysis by pcr dgge showed that proteobacteria methylobacillus pseudomonas pseudoxanthomonas comamonas caulobacter stenotrophomonas and bacteroidetes flavobacterium caulobacter sphingobacterium were the most dominant species responsible for the metabolism of 4 cp in recent research wang et al 71 reported results of 4 cp and phenol removals in an aerobic moving bed biofilm reactor enriched with manganese oxidising bacteria mnob the biofilm carriers anchored a mixed microbial community nine dominant bacteria were identified as belonging to the genera comamonas zoogloea pseudomonas cupriavidus dokdonella roseomonas and tahibacter this consortium was able to remove 100 of 4 cp and phenol at high hrt of 72 h table 2 based on the discussion above and table 2 pcp removal achieved in mm sbbr bioreactor b obtained in this work was in accordance with the reported results for bioreactors in experiments degrading pcp or related compounds with higher loading rates of pcp at 100 mg l 1 in contrast to mm sbbr bioreactor a in this work pcp removal in real paper wastewater was quite satisfactory due to the complex wastewater content moreover the population of proteobacteria in the mm sbbr bioreactor b was higher than those reported in table 2 which explains the better performance of the mm sbbr bioreactor b 4 conclusions the cod nh3 n and pcp removal performances of mm sbbr were significantly higher than those of the control bioreactors the difference in the removal performances was due to the differences between the bacterial diversity in the mm sbbr and the control bioreactors mm sbbr bioreactor b had attained high cod nh3 n and pcp removal efficiencies reaching 97 93 and 99 respectively which were contributed by the enrichment of high pcp resistant bacteria mm encouraged the growth of various bacterial species in which 10 species was identified in the mm sbbr bioreactor b where the majority belong to proteobacteria phylum 9 species the results indicate that bacterial species belong to the phylum might have a great prospective for pcp polluted wastewater treatment finally all these results indicate that mm sbbr can be a good option for the effluent treatment with high loads of pcp and provide an important reference for the treatment of wastewater containing

13364,the biological treatment of landfill leachate is a challenging process due to the high concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen compounds and other toxic compounds furthermore nitrification inhibition may occur in landfill leachate due to the high concentration of free ammonia and inhibitors such as poisonous compounds accordingly this study aimed to use non thermal plasma and aerobic granules to reduce organic loading rate and heavy metals of landfill leachate we used a plasma reactor with a working volume of 0 5 l quartz material for the pretreatment process according to the results the plasma reactor was most efficient in removing metals as well as d quasi metals e g arsenic antimony selenium cobalt iron strontium and silver and least efficient in the removal of nickel zinc aluminum and manganese our findings indicated that the cod removal efficiency decreased from 100 to 98 from 93 5 to 89 18 and from 92 to 88 for 20 50 plus 100 leachate and three hydraulic retention times 6 4 5 and 2 1 h respectively the amount of organic matter removal was a function of concentration and followed the second order kinetic r2 0 9 and stover kincannon models r2 0 97 thus it could be concluded that aerobic granules could effectively reduce e the organic load cod and heavy metals entering a gsbr reactor due to the good efficiency of the plasma reactor and gsbr so we

production has been growing progressively for instance in 1994 the world s waste production was reported to be 1 3 million tons 600 g per person per day annually which increased by 31 in 2004 to 1 7 million tons per year 1 the ascending trend of waste production in iran is no exception to this rule and now in iran more than 40 000 tons of waste is produced 2 hence considering the increasing population and changes in the country s economic cultural and industrial conditions to prevent environmental degradation and to save management costs proper and scientific management is required as the dominant strategy of final waste management in iran is sanitary landfills leachate production has also grown due to the increase in sanitary landfills leachate contains a wide range of organic matter ammonia nitrogen heavy metals chlorinated compounds and mineral salts 3 there are three conventional methods of leachate treatment i returning leachate to the landfill or transfer to the wastewater collection networks and the accompanying treatment of municipal wastewater ii aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment and iii physical and chemical methods 4 one of the biological treatment methods is using aerobic granules in the sbr reactor aerobic granules consisting of biological aggregates can reduce various pollutants at lower occupancy levels than conventional systems 5 they are resistant to various shocks and have better settling properties plus high quality of the effluent and are currently being examined as an alternative to the activated sludge system aerobic granules include extracellular polymeric materials inorganic compounds and multiple types of minerals 6 aerobic granules have high internal density and high settling capacity 7 thus it resists the release of substrates containing toxins into the cells which enhances the tolerance threshold of granules in the treatment of strong industrial wastewater with high pollution 8 in a study granules formed by slaughterhouse effluent showed better cod removal efficiencies than aerobic granules formed by conventionally treated sludge 9 the effective parameters on the granulation process include the type of bacteria wastewater composition organic loading feeding method aeration intensity and reactor design 10 use of seed sludge prepared in warm seasons is far more effective than in cold seasons due to the effective growth of microorganisms producing extracellular polymer substances eps 11 on the other hand due to the high leachate organic load as well as the existence of resistant organic compounds and heavy metals pretreatment methods are required to achieve better efficiency 12 among the pretreatment methods physicochemical processes can be mentioned 13 these methods are suitable for treating old leachate from closed landfills containing a large amount of non degradable organic matter or as an auxiliary process for bioremediation 14 one of the physical processes is non thermal plasma ntp widely used as an advanced oxidation method to degrade organic compounds in water 15 16 many hydroxyl oh oxygen h2o2 and o3 radicals will be generated in the plasma process which effectively oxidizes organic matter 16 among these active species oh has a higher oxidation capacity and can oxidize most pollutants especially organic pollutants molecular species with more extended o3 h2o2 can also produce large numbers of oh 16 in addition to generating active radicals the ntp process can also generate shock waves providing supercritical conditions in the electrical discharge channel creating vacuum bubbles as the ultrasonic process 17 and producing ultraviolet uv light plus visible light 18 further the plasma process can activate catalysts and boost their efficiency 18 according to studies ntp technology has been used for high efficiency treatment and pretreatment of water and wastewater in this system the generated radicals such as o3 and o are first developed in the gas phase and then rapidly injected into the liquid phase as a result they can remove contaminants more quickly thus the plasma process is efficient and safe for removing micro pollutants from wastewater and organic matter 19 the advantages of ntp include removal of heavy metals short retention time high efficiency of the reactor without using any chemicals increasing the refinery capacity without enlarging the reactor size significant reduction of bod and cod low energy consumption comparing high efficiency depending on the type of effluent 1 5 2 5 kw m3 of wastewater per hour without the need to elevate the temperature and adjust the ph as well as the possibility of reusing the treated effluent the ability of the ntp process to produce visible and ultraviolet light and to convert hard biodegradable resistant materials into biodegradable materials as well as to enhance the bod5 cod ratio plus the use of bioreactors can overcome the limitations of aerobic process and take advantage of their benefits such as enhancing the removal efficiency and lowering the retention time 20 considering the above mentioned points the innovation of this study is the use of the ntp process as a real leachate pretreatment along with the gsbr reactor as an advanced and secondary treatment to determine feed removal models as well as reducing the organic loading rate and heavy metals accordingly this study aims to reduce the organic matter heavy metals of actual landfill leachate in one of the western provinces of iran and to determine feed removal models 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling location hamadan city landfill is placed in hamadan bahar plain which is 20 km away from the north of hamadan hamadan metropolis has about 600 thousand populations which is estimated to produce about 750 tons of municipal solid waste every day the age of the leachate in the landfill has been evaluated as more than two years 21 table 1 reports the characteristics of raw leachate 2 2 conditions of the non thermal plasma reactor the primary phase of the pilot study involves the usage of a non thermal plasma reactor containing a quartz cylinder 500 ml with a ground connection electrode mounted on the wall the high voltage electrode which was prepared of hollow stainless steel rods was placed in the center of the reactor in a quartz chamber the aeration pump was attached to the lower part of the quartz chamber and the airflow entered the leachate phase of the reactor the electrodes were linked to a high voltage power supply 15 kv two valves were provided in the sidewall of the reactor for airflow and sampling 22 23 non thermal plasma was produced at 15 kv and 50 hz with the apparent power of 450 va and a current of 1 45 amps to investigate the effects of plasma on leachate purification three concentrations of leachate 20 50 and 100 entered the plasma reactor after determining the optimum retention time in the plasma reactor 30 min the leachate entered the plasma reactor at the specified concentrations past 30 min 2 3 specification and setup of the gsbr reactor this study used two laboratory scale column type reactors each with a working volume of 1 4 l and held in a temperature controlled room at 23 c the inside diameter and total height of the column were six and 110 cm 20 cm freeboard respectively the reactor operational h d ratio was around 18 3 and both reactors operated in the sbr mode fig 1 five ports were used for sampling discharge effluent and sludge removal located at equal distances from the reactor bottom the effluent was cleared from the second port at the bottom sidewall of the reactor the level of dissolved oxygen do was adjusted within the range of 1 8 2 4 mg l the reactors functioned within six hour cycles with 6 h hydraulic retention times the operational step included fill idle react settle and decant which were 5 15 330 2 and 5 min respectively for the gsbr process the working cycles were done using a plc time controller danab co iran the reactor was seeded by adding 1 2 l of leachate landfill and synthetic wastewater at 20 2350 mg l suspended solids 50 and 100 the synthetic wastewater included macro element contained glucose as the main source of carbon and energy as well as other nutrients the applied nutrient components were k2hpo4 58 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l mgso4 7h2o 75 mg l nh4cl 191 cacl2 2h2o 50 mg l and microelement 1 ml l the trace solution was composed of fecl3 6h2o 1 5 g l cuso4 5h2o 0 03 g l h3bo3 0 15 g l mncl2 4h2o 0 12 g l ki 0 03 g l na2moo4 2h2o 0 06 g l znso4 7h2o 0 12 g l and cocl2 6h2o 0 15 g l 24 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added to the synthetic wastewater to keep the suspension ph within the neutral range of 7 3 8 0 at the primary phase start up the gsbr and when adding the suitable seed the gsbr reactor operated under a continuous flow regime and complete aeration conditions the gsbr reactor had four 6 h cycles per day details the operating phase presented in table 2 the cycle occurring at 8 am 4 pm was selected as the work cycle to explore the variations in the studied variables in each cycle 80 of the reactor was filled at the beginning of each cycle 1000 ml of synthetic wastewater could enter the reactor by the pump for 5 min and 1000 ml of the treated effluent would be discharged by the pump within 5 min at the close of the cycle 2 4 gsbr reactor operation after the formation of aerobic granules and reduction of output cod to 100 mg l in the reactor starting phase after 50 days the aerobic granules were partially transferred to another reactor synthetic wastewater was progressively supplanted with real leachate at a specific ratio adaptation continued until the color of the fluid in the gsbr reactor turned from black to dark brown then the proportion of the supplanted leachate up to 50 was observed to rise with synthetic wastewater the gsbr reactor operated at room temperature 20 26 c and the concentration of do inside the reactor at the aeration phase was preserved at 1 9 2 8 mg l the daily mixed liquid sludge discharge amount was 120 130 mg regulated around constant for 9 2 days and constant the mixed suspended solids mlss in the reactor the operation of the gsbr reactor throughout the process phase began with loading and was followed by idle phase aeration sedimentation and the discharge of the treated effluent the loading idle aeration settling and unloading periods with times of 5 15 333 2 and 5 min in the design of the reactor through the operational phases were applied in investigating the effects of the organic loading rate olr at three hydraulic retention times hrts 6 4 5 and 2 1 h 2 5 determination of heavy metal concentrations the standard stock solutions for each metal were 1000 ppm hydrochloric acid fluoric acid nitric acid hydrogen peroxide and perchloric acid to measure heavy metals a diluted leachate sample with a specific concentration was injected into the icp ms with the concentration of the metals expressed in ppm 2 6 effect of organic loading on the gsbr we evaluated the effects of the changes in the olr on the performance of the gsbr in the organic load at three leachate concentrations of 20 50 and 100 2 7 measurement of variables the variable of cod 522 c bod5 5210 b ts and tss 2540 a po4 p 4500 p e were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 while nh4 n 8038 hach co no3 n 8039 hach co and no2 n 8507 hach co were determined according to the instructions of the hatch company 2 8 kinetic models kinetic studies are essential to examine the influential factors in the reaction rate the monod equation is widely used to determine the biokinetic coefficients of the activated sludge method as well as the correlation between bacterial growth and limited substrate in addition changes in the removal rate of cod in the reactor were evaluated the stover kincannon model is commonly used to assess the correlation between the loading and removing the total organic loading in system in the present study modeling was used to determine the correlation between biological models and speed in substrate removal based on the laboratory results these models are also applied to control and predict performance as well as optimize the refinery units fabricated on a laboratory scale 24 26 2 8 1 first order

represent the inlet and outlet substrate concentration mg l respectively and k1 l d refers to the constants of the first order kinetic with the stability of the biological reactor we would have ds dt

slope respectively and ks could be obtained by the following equation 6 m s 0 k s x 2 8 3 modified stover kincannon model in the modified stover kincannon model the consumption rate of the substrate as a function of organic loading rate is expressed by the kinetics of the single molecules for the biofilm reactor in the 1970s stover and kincannon proposed this kinetic model for aerobic biofilm reactor which was used for anaerobic processes later the kinetic model of carbon removal could be represented in cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc the stover kincannon model is a common mathematical model used to evaluate kinetic constants the equations of the stover kincannon model are as follows 28 7 ds dt q v s 0 s if the reversed elimination organic load versus

monod equation the first step to providing the monod equation based on empirical data is monitoring the disadvantages as well as evaluating the quality and speed of the biodegradability reaction in a controlled environment the quality and speed of the reaction in reactors that the initial concentration of the pollutants s0 in terms of cod and bod relative to the initial concentration mass biological x0 which is controlled by the mlss in general the lower values of s0 x0 cannot assess the growth of microorganisms in the environment on the other hand the high concentration of s0 x0 1 could determine the measurable growth of microorganisms 29 30 the monod equation could be expressed as follows 31 32 12 q x 0 q qw x e qwxr rgvv dx dt where dx dt is the changes in the biomass

carried out in triplicate data were described as mean sd and data comparison was done by one way anova test using spss software version 21 3 result and discussion the influent leachate was achieved from the hamadan landfill every week the necessary cod was prepared at three ratios of low medium and high 20 50 and 100 leachate respectively 3 1 effects of non thermal plasma and gsbr on the removal of heavy metals from leachate the efficiency of ntp reactor and gsbr in reducing heavy metal for three ratios of leachate 20 50 and 100 is presented in tables 3 5 concerning of the mean metal concentrations potassium had the highest concentration 3549 mg l in the leachate followed by sodium zinc nickel magnesium and manganese the plasma reactor was most effective in removing metals and quasi metals e g arsenic antimony selenium cobalt iron strontium tin and silver while showing the lowest efficiency in the removal of nickel zinc aluminum and manganese in addition more than 90 of the metals leaving the plasma reactor and entering the gsbr were reduced to a minimum similar to organic pollutants heavy metals cannot be decomposed in nature through chemical or biological processes one of the critical consequences of their stability is biological concentration in the food chain which magnifies the risk of these metals entering the higher classes of the food chain compared to their concentration in water or air which in turn causes damage to plants and endangers the wildlife as well as humans 33 according to our findings heavy metals including potassium sodium zinc nickel magnesium and manganese had the highest concentrations which could arise from the sources of these elements in wastes during the leachate pretreatment process by the plasma reactor and biological gsbr the reduction of heavy metal concentrations at three concentrations of 20 50 and 100 was considered significant pval 0 001 however removal of heavy metals with the plasma reactor and biological gsbr had no significant difference pval 0 133 one of the key influential factors in the removal of heavy metals from leachate is ph at high ph heavy metals precipitate with the formation of insoluble metal hydroxides in a study in this regard ke et al reported the highest removal of cr vi from samples with a high ph due to the presence of reductive species 34 since the ph of the inlet leachate to the neutral plasma reactor was alkaline in the present study the high removal efficiency could be attributed to this variable also some heavy metals e g aluminum zinc nickel vanadium barium and lead lesser removed in the plasma reactor which could be due to the formation of intermediary metal products or the catalytic properties of metals such as vanadium zinc and copper during the leachate purification process by plasma 35 the results of this part are consistent with the results of vieira cubas et al 2016 on leachate treatment using ntp to reduce the amount of iron and zinc metals 36 the predominant mechanism is the removal of heavy metals using the gsbr reactor biosorption using aerobic granules given the significant efficiency of the gsbr reactor in the removal of heavy metals it can be considered as a desirable option to remove heavy metals from leachate ahn and hong 2015 conducted a study on the biosorption of heavy metals by aerobic granules based on scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray analysis sem edx they found that the adsorption of heavy metals occurs not only on the granules surface but also in the core region of the aerobic granules 37 the heavy metal adsorption through aerobic granules is strongly influenced by the functional groups in aerobic granules such as the carboxylate alcohol and ether groups which act as binding sites for heavy metals in addition the pores in the aerobic granular sludge play an important role in the transport of heavy metals to the granules interior regions 37 in a study in this regard liu et al 2003 examined the bio sorption of divalent cadmium by aerobic granular sludge reporting that the removal of divalent cadmium was affected by the initial concentrations of cadmium and aerobic granular sludge according to the mentioned study 566 mg of dual capacity cadmium could be effectively absorbed by 1 g of aerobic granules 38 another influential factor in the biosorption rate of heavy metals by aerobic granular sludge was reported to be ph the effect of ph on the biosorption of ni2 was also evaluated by xu et al 2006 who found that the adsorption capacity increased at higher phs range 2 6 finally reaching the maximum capacity at the ph of 6 39 3 2 effect of olr on gsbr efficiency our findings regarding the effect of the organic input load on the cod removal efficiency indicated that at the leachate concentrations of 20 50 and 100 and by increasing the organic load from 2 34 to 14 85 g of cod l d the cod removal efficiency diminished from 100 to 98 from 93 5 to 89 18 and from 92 to 88 respectively figs 2 4 initial stage with the low organic load of reactor commissioning the efficiency of organic load consumption sewage sludge was observed to be low since the growth rate of the bacteria was lower than the state of the incoming organic load once the bacteria were adapted to the incoming food and the synthetic wastewater from the fourth week onwards and forming the primary nuclei of the granules the microbial community and bacterial multiplication increased thereby enhancing the organic matter consumption by the microorganisms the delay could be due to the stages of granule formation from the fusion of microorganism cells formation of primary granule nuclei through surface charge neutralization the van der waals force of proton displacement and the production of cellular polymer eps by sensors other possible reasons include the environmental signals of the cell maturation of the aerobic granules due to the effect of air and fluid hydrodynamic forces eps synthesis ion bridge formation hydraulic pressure selection and static biomass growth 30 by replacing leachate with wastewater the organic load removal efficiency was reduced to a minimum by increasing the organic load in the initial cycles due to the exposure of the bacteria to more complex and degradable compounds at this stage the microorganisms that were less resistant to shock from organic matter toxins and growth limiting compounds were eliminated from the catabolic cycle 32 once the bacteria became accustomed to the type of input food leachate and the onset of bacterial activity the organic charge consumed by the bacteria increased thereby causing due to the decay of the adapted granules using cultured granules in the current research the leachate removal efficiency increased to approximately 100 94 and 91 at the leachate ratios of 20 50 and 100 with the hrt of 6 h respectively with decreased hrt diminished aeration time and increased organic loading the organic load consumption also declined which could be attributed to the shorter contact time of the microorganisms with the organic matter the granules formed with glucose based synthetic wastewater decayed in the initial phase of leachate treatment due to phosphate ions po4 3 p in the leachate or the release of phosphorus under anaerobic conditions which replaced the ions furthermore calcium and magnesium were present in the structural bonds of the granules however the granules formed by the seeds produced in the leachate were created within a shorter time compared to synthetic wastewater the results of the present study indicated that the organic load leachate entering the gsbr contained aerobic granules which could be reduced by up to 90 the increase in the organic loading rate olr in the activated sludge cause movement of biomass from the reactor increasing the input cod decreasing the do and resizing flocculation in this study in response to the evaluation of the loading from 2 to more than 14 gcod l d the cod rate also increased by more than 90 initially the increase of the organic loading reduced the size of aerobic granules and the decomposing a significant number of granules further after increasing the organic loading the growth of biofilm in the gsbr reactor wall increased where the biofilm of the reactor wall was regularly and manually separated from the wall once every two days and the reactor wall was cleaned gradually after 10 days operating under controlled conditions small sized average 6 mm and high strength aerobic granules were formed however there was no change in the color of the granules this reveals that aerobic granules can recover quickly even after the increase of organic loading the results of this study are consistent with the research results of thanh et al 2009 on the properties of aerobic granules at different organic loadings 40 3 3 reaction kinetics and kinetic coefficients to investigate the kinetics of the biological reactions in removing organic matter we used four models of first order feed removal second order feed removal grau stover kincannon and the monod equation the grau and stover kincannon feed removal models for feed removal in the gsbr system showed high compliance with these models figs 5 6 as well as figs s1 s3 in the support information depict the regression of these models table 6 reports the kinetic coefficients and their adaptation order to the feed removal rate in the gsbr system in general the model results indicated that the reaction behavior in the purification system was more than matched with the second order and stover kincannon methods where increased substrate led to the higher reaction intensity by increasing the substrate the behavior of the system could also change to second order in the grau feed elimination model organic matter concentration was observed to rise and the nutrient was decisive in addition the growth rate became more dependent on the substrate concentration with high aeration time and retention time microorganisms have the opportunity to hydrolyze the suspended substrate and use it as a solution 31 as mentioned earlier we used the stover kincannon model which suggested that the removal rate of the substrate would be affected by the rate of the organic loading entering the reactor the observation of the regression coefficient also showed that the model well matched the obtained results and only 2 3 of the changes were not described by the regression model at the same time the material analysis in the system followed this model in the present study the value of Œºmax coefficients was low while kb was high which could be due to the presence of cod with rapid degradability in the leachate in addition the reason for the good performance of the plasma reactors was the non biodegradable organic matter 33 in a study of the models the results based on the first order model indicated that at the low concentrations of the output substrate high performance of the reactor the kinetic coefficients did not follow the first order model this model has been used for wastewater with a low substrate concentration 34 with the reduction of the mlss concentration the feed removal follows the first order model since the nutrient concentration grows relative to the microorganism along with the enzyme content and the microbe enters logarithmic growth in the present study k1 values increased at higher biomass concentrations indicating that at low biomass concentrations hrt is required for biological leachate treatment if the mlss concentration is high low hrt could also be effective for the treatment the results of the first order model demonstrated that at low mlss concentrations in this system the hydraulic downtime should increase which is a costly process 34 38 in the review of the monod equation the obtained results revealed that the evaluation of the monod equation was based on the description of organic matter removal during the treatment process as well as the low concentration of the organic matter entering the reactor and its control notably k ks y and kd coefficients were used to predict the variations in the system s behavior based on the wastewater source microbial population and temperature at high substrate concentrations and due to the growth rate control of microorganisms by the biomass concentration the monod equation showed a deviation from the research results the kinetic results of this study are consistent with the kinetic findings of yanjie wei study 2012 41 on the removal of organic matter and nitrogen from leachate using gsbr reactor a khan 2017 42 on the papermaking wastewater treatment using sbr reactor and the study of amin 2014 43 on saline wastewater treatment using the sbr for the first and second order models respectively however it has not been in line with stover kincannon model which can be due to the different characteristics of saline wastewater compared to leachate 4 conclusion in the present study the ntp reactor and gsbr reactor were used for purification of landfill leachate according to the results most of the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were k na zn ni mg and mn heavy metals were effectively removed by the two reactors but by increasing the leachate ratio from 20 to 100 the removal rate of heavy metals decreased the factors affecting the reduction of heavy metals included ph and do also increasing leachate concentrations of 20 to 100 and by increasing the olr the cod removal efficiency diminished furthermore the reaction rate of the leachate treatment by the biological reactor was a function of concentration and followed the second order kinetic and stover kincannon models due to the good efficiency of the plasma reactor and gsbr we would propose that full scale studies should be performed at the landfill site for heavy metal and organic loading reduction credit authorship contribution

13364,the biological treatment of landfill leachate is a challenging process due to the high concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen compounds and other toxic compounds furthermore nitrification inhibition may occur in landfill leachate due to the high concentration of free ammonia and inhibitors such as poisonous compounds accordingly this study aimed to use non thermal plasma

production has been growing progressively for instance in 1994 the world s waste production was reported to be 1 3 million tons 600 g per person per day annually which increased by 31 in 2004 to 1 7 million tons per year 1 the ascending trend of waste production in iran is no exception to this rule and now in iran more than 40 000 tons of waste is produced 2 hence considering the increasing population and changes in the country s economic cultural and industrial conditions to prevent environmental degradation and to save management costs proper and scientific management is required as the dominant strategy of final waste management in iran is sanitary landfills leachate production has also grown due to the increase in sanitary landfills leachate contains a wide range of organic matter ammonia nitrogen heavy metals chlorinated compounds and mineral salts 3 there are three conventional methods of leachate treatment i returning leachate to the landfill or transfer to the wastewater collection networks and the accompanying treatment of municipal wastewater ii aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment and iii physical and chemical methods 4 one of the biological treatment methods is using aerobic granules in the sbr reactor aerobic granules consisting of biological aggregates can reduce various pollutants at lower occupancy levels than conventional systems 5 they are resistant to various shocks and have better settling properties plus high quality of the effluent and are currently being examined as an alternative to the activated sludge system aerobic granules include extracellular polymeric materials inorganic compounds and multiple types of minerals 6 aerobic granules have high internal density and high settling capacity 7 thus it resists the release of substrates containing toxins into the cells which enhances the tolerance threshold of granules in the treatment of strong industrial wastewater with high pollution 8 in a study granules formed by slaughterhouse effluent showed better cod removal efficiencies than aerobic granules formed by conventionally treated sludge 9 the effective parameters on the granulation process include the type of bacteria wastewater composition organic loading feeding method aeration intensity and reactor design 10 use of seed sludge prepared in warm seasons is far more effective than in cold seasons due to the effective growth of microorganisms producing extracellular polymer substances eps 11 on the other hand due to the high leachate organic load as well as the existence of resistant organic compounds and heavy metals pretreatment methods are required to achieve better efficiency 12 among the pretreatment methods physicochemical processes can be mentioned 13 these methods are suitable for treating old leachate from closed landfills containing a large amount of non degradable organic matter or as an auxiliary process for bioremediation 14 one of the physical processes is non thermal plasma ntp widely used as an advanced oxidation method to degrade organic compounds in water 15 16 many hydroxyl oh oxygen h2o2 and o3 radicals will be generated in the plasma process which effectively oxidizes organic matter 16 among these active species oh has a higher oxidation capacity and can oxidize most pollutants especially organic pollutants molecular species with more extended o3 h2o2 can also produce large numbers of oh 16 in addition to generating active radicals the ntp process can also generate shock waves providing supercritical conditions in the electrical discharge channel creating vacuum bubbles as the ultrasonic process 17 and producing ultraviolet uv light plus visible light 18 further the plasma process can activate catalysts and boost their efficiency 18 according to studies ntp technology has been used for high efficiency treatment and pretreatment of water and wastewater in this system the generated radicals such as o3 and o are first developed in the gas phase and then rapidly injected into the liquid phase as a result they can remove contaminants more quickly thus the plasma process is efficient and safe for removing micro pollutants from wastewater and organic matter 19 the advantages of ntp include removal of heavy metals short retention time high efficiency of the reactor without using any chemicals increasing the refinery capacity without enlarging the reactor size significant reduction of bod and cod low energy consumption comparing high efficiency depending on the type of effluent 1 5 2 5 kw m3 of wastewater per hour without the need to elevate the temperature and adjust the ph as well as the possibility of reusing the treated effluent the ability of the ntp process to produce visible and ultraviolet light and to convert hard biodegradable resistant materials into biodegradable materials as well as to enhance the bod5 cod ratio plus the use of bioreactors can overcome the limitations of aerobic process and take advantage of their benefits such as enhancing the removal efficiency and lowering the retention time 20 considering the above mentioned points the innovation of this study is the use of the ntp process as a real leachate pretreatment along with the gsbr reactor as an advanced and secondary treatment to determine feed removal models as well as reducing the organic loading rate and heavy metals accordingly this study aims to reduce the organic matter heavy metals of actual landfill leachate in one of the western provinces of iran and to determine feed removal models 2 materials and

estimated to produce about 750 tons of municipal solid waste every day the age of the leachate in the landfill has been evaluated as more than two years 21 table 1 reports the characteristics of raw leachate 2 2 conditions of the non thermal plasma reactor the primary phase of the pilot study involves the usage of a non thermal plasma reactor containing a quartz cylinder 500 ml with a ground connection electrode mounted on the wall the high voltage electrode which was prepared of hollow stainless steel rods was placed in the center of the reactor in a quartz chamber the aeration pump was attached to the lower part of the quartz chamber and the airflow entered the leachate phase of the reactor the electrodes were linked to a high voltage power supply 15 kv two valves were provided in

cocl2 6h2o 0 15 g l 24 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was added to the synthetic wastewater to keep the suspension ph within the neutral range of 7 3 8 0 at the primary phase start up the gsbr and when adding the suitable seed the gsbr reactor operated under a continuous flow regime and complete aeration conditions the gsbr reactor had four 6 h cycles per day details the operating phase presented in table 2 the cycle occurring at 8 am 4 pm was selected as the work cycle to explore the variations in the studied variables in each cycle 80 of the reactor was filled at the beginning of each cycle 1000 ml of synthetic wastewater could enter the reactor by the pump for 5 min and 1000 ml of the treated effluent would be discharged by the pump within 5 min at the close of the cycle 2 4 gsbr reactor operation after the formation of aerobic granules and reduction of output cod to 100 mg l in the reactor starting phase after 50 days the aerobic granules were partially transferred to another reactor synthetic wastewater was progressively supplanted with real leachate at a specific ratio adaptation continued until the color of the fluid in the gsbr reactor turned from black to dark brown then the proportion of the supplanted leachate up to 50 was observed to rise with synthetic wastewater the gsbr reactor operated at room temperature 20 26 c and the concentration of do inside the reactor at the aeration phase was preserved at 1 9 2 8 mg l the daily mixed liquid sludge discharge amount was 120 130 mg regulated around constant for 9 2 days and constant the mixed suspended solids mlss in the reactor the operation of the gsbr reactor throughout the process phase began with loading and was followed by idle phase aeration sedimentation and the discharge of the treated effluent the loading idle aeration settling and unloading periods with times of 5 15 333 2 and 5 min in the design of the reactor through the operational phases were applied in investigating the effects of the organic loading rate olr at three hydraulic retention times hrts 6 4 5 and 2 1 h 2 5 determination of heavy metal concentrations the standard stock solutions for each metal were 1000 ppm hydrochloric acid fluoric acid nitric acid hydrogen peroxide and perchloric acid to measure heavy metals a diluted leachate sample with a specific concentration was injected into the icp ms with the concentration of the metals expressed in ppm 2 6 effect of organic loading on the gsbr we evaluated the effects of the changes in the olr on the performance of the gsbr in the organic load at three leachate concentrations of 20 50 and 100 2 7 measurement of variables the variable of cod 522 c bod5 5210 b ts and tss 2540 a po4 p 4500 p e were determined according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 25 while nh4 n 8038 hach co no3 n 8039 hach co and no2 n 8507 hach co were determined according to the instructions of the hatch company 2 8 kinetic models kinetic studies are essential to examine the influential factors in the reaction rate the monod equation is widely used to determine the biokinetic coefficients of the activated sludge method as well as the correlation between bacterial growth and limited substrate in addition changes in the removal rate of cod in the reactor were evaluated the stover kincannon model is commonly used to assess the correlation between the loading and removing the total organic loading in system in the present study modeling was used to determine the correlation between biological models and speed in substrate removal based on the laboratory results these models are also applied to control and predict performance as well as optimize the refinery units fabricated on a laboratory scale 24 26 2 8 1 first order

represent the inlet and outlet substrate concentration mg l respectively and k1 l d refers to the constants of the first order kinetic with the stability of the biological reactor we would have ds dt

slope respectively and ks could be obtained by the following equation 6 m s 0 k s x 2 8 3 modified stover kincannon model in the modified stover kincannon model the consumption rate of the substrate as a function of organic loading rate is expressed by the kinetics of the single molecules for the biofilm reactor in the 1970s stover and kincannon proposed this kinetic model for aerobic biofilm reactor which was used for anaerobic processes later the kinetic model of carbon removal could be represented in cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc the stover kincannon model is a common mathematical model used to evaluate kinetic constants the equations of the stover kincannon model are as follows 28 7 ds dt q v s 0 s if the reversed elimination organic load versus

monod equation the first step to providing the monod equation based on empirical data is monitoring the disadvantages as well as evaluating the quality and speed of the biodegradability reaction in a controlled environment the quality and speed of the reaction in reactors that the initial concentration of the pollutants s0 in terms of cod and bod relative to the initial concentration mass biological x0 which is controlled by the mlss in general the lower values of s0 x0 cannot assess the growth of microorganisms in the environment on the other hand the high concentration of s0 x0 1 could determine the measurable growth of microorganisms 29 30 the monod equation could be expressed as follows 31 32 12 q x 0 q qw x e qwxr rgvv dx dt where dx dt is the changes in the biomass

carried out in triplicate data were described as mean sd and data comparison was done by one way anova test using spss software version 21 3 result and discussion the influent leachate was achieved from the hamadan landfill every week the necessary cod was prepared at three ratios of low medium and high 20 50 and 100 leachate respectively 3 1 effects of non thermal plasma and gsbr on the removal of heavy metals from leachate the efficiency of ntp reactor and gsbr in reducing heavy metal for three ratios of leachate 20 50 and 100 is presented in tables 3 5 concerning of the mean metal concentrations potassium had the highest concentration 3549 mg l in the leachate followed by sodium zinc nickel magnesium and manganese the plasma reactor was most effective in removing metals and quasi metals e g arsenic antimony selenium cobalt iron strontium tin and silver while showing the lowest efficiency in the removal of nickel zinc aluminum and manganese in addition more than 90 of the metals leaving the plasma reactor and entering the gsbr were reduced to a minimum similar to organic pollutants heavy metals cannot be decomposed in nature through chemical or biological processes one of the critical consequences of their stability is biological concentration in the food chain which magnifies the risk of these metals entering the higher classes of the food chain compared to their concentration in water or air which in turn causes damage to plants and endangers the wildlife as well as humans 33 according to our findings heavy metals including potassium sodium zinc nickel magnesium and manganese had the highest concentrations which could arise from the sources of these elements in wastes during the leachate pretreatment process by the plasma reactor and biological gsbr the reduction of heavy metal concentrations at three concentrations of 20 50 and 100 was considered significant pval 0 001 however removal of heavy metals with the plasma reactor and biological gsbr had no significant difference pval 0 133 one of the key influential factors in the removal of heavy metals from leachate is ph at high ph heavy metals precipitate with the formation of insoluble metal hydroxides in a study in this regard ke et al reported the highest removal of cr vi from samples with a high ph due to the presence of reductive species 34 since the ph of the inlet leachate to the neutral plasma reactor was alkaline in the present study the high removal efficiency could be attributed to this variable also some heavy metals e g aluminum zinc nickel vanadium barium and lead lesser removed in the plasma reactor which could be due to the formation of intermediary metal products or the catalytic properties of metals such as vanadium zinc and copper during the leachate purification process by plasma 35 the results of this part are consistent with the results of vieira cubas et al 2016 on leachate treatment using ntp to reduce the amount of iron and zinc metals 36 the predominant mechanism is the removal of heavy metals using the gsbr reactor biosorption using aerobic granules given the significant efficiency of the gsbr reactor in the removal of heavy metals it can be considered as a desirable option to remove heavy metals from leachate ahn and hong 2015 conducted a study on the biosorption of heavy metals by aerobic granules based on scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray analysis sem edx they found that the adsorption of heavy metals occurs not only on the granules surface but also in the core region of the aerobic granules 37 the heavy metal adsorption through aerobic granules is strongly influenced by the functional groups in aerobic granules such as the carboxylate alcohol and ether groups which act as binding sites for heavy metals in addition the pores in the aerobic granular sludge play an important role in the transport of heavy metals to the granules interior regions 37 in a study in this regard liu et al 2003 examined the bio sorption of divalent cadmium by aerobic granular sludge reporting that the removal of divalent cadmium was affected by the initial concentrations of cadmium and aerobic granular sludge according to the mentioned study 566 mg of dual capacity cadmium could be effectively absorbed by 1 g of aerobic granules 38 another influential factor in the biosorption rate of heavy metals by aerobic granular sludge was reported to be ph the effect of ph on the biosorption of ni2 was also evaluated by xu et al 2006 who found that the adsorption capacity increased at higher phs range 2 6 finally reaching the maximum capacity at the ph of 6 39 3 2 effect of olr on gsbr efficiency our findings regarding the effect of the organic input load on the cod removal efficiency indicated that at the leachate concentrations of 20 50 and 100 and by increasing the organic load from 2 34 to 14 85 g of cod l d the cod removal efficiency diminished from 100 to 98 from 93 5 to 89 18 and from 92 to 88 respectively figs 2 4 initial stage with the low organic load of reactor commissioning the efficiency of organic load consumption sewage sludge was observed to be low since the growth rate of the bacteria was lower than the state of the incoming organic load once the bacteria were adapted to the incoming food and the synthetic wastewater from the fourth week onwards and forming the primary nuclei of the granules the microbial community and bacterial multiplication increased thereby enhancing the organic matter consumption by the microorganisms the delay could be due to the stages of granule formation from the fusion of microorganism cells formation of primary granule nuclei through surface charge neutralization the van der waals force of proton displacement and the production of cellular polymer eps by sensors other possible reasons include the environmental signals of the cell maturation of the aerobic granules due to the effect of air and fluid hydrodynamic forces eps synthesis ion bridge formation hydraulic pressure selection and static biomass growth 30 by replacing leachate with wastewater the organic load removal efficiency was reduced to a minimum by increasing the organic load in the initial cycles due to the exposure of the bacteria to more complex and degradable compounds at this stage the microorganisms that were less resistant to shock from organic matter toxins and growth limiting compounds were eliminated from the catabolic cycle 32 once the bacteria became accustomed to the type of input food leachate and the onset of bacterial activity the organic charge consumed by the bacteria increased thereby causing due to the decay of the adapted granules using cultured granules in the current research the leachate removal efficiency increased to approximately 100 94 and 91 at the leachate ratios of 20 50 and 100 with the hrt of 6 h respectively with decreased hrt diminished aeration time and increased organic loading the organic load consumption also declined which could be attributed to the shorter contact time of the microorganisms with the organic matter the granules formed with glucose based synthetic wastewater decayed in the initial phase of leachate treatment due to phosphate ions po4 3 p in the leachate or the release of phosphorus under anaerobic conditions which replaced the ions furthermore calcium and magnesium were present in the structural bonds of the granules however the granules formed by the seeds produced in the leachate were created within a shorter time compared to synthetic wastewater the results of the present study indicated that the organic load leachate entering the gsbr contained aerobic granules which could be reduced by up to 90 the increase in the organic loading rate olr in the activated sludge cause movement of biomass from the reactor increasing the input cod decreasing the do and resizing flocculation in this study in response to the evaluation of the loading from 2 to more than 14 gcod l d the cod rate also increased by more than 90 initially the increase of the organic loading reduced the size of aerobic granules and the decomposing a significant number of granules further after increasing the organic loading the growth of biofilm in the gsbr reactor wall increased where the biofilm of the reactor wall was regularly and manually separated from the wall once every two days and the reactor wall was cleaned gradually after 10 days operating under controlled conditions small sized average 6 mm and high strength aerobic granules were formed however there was no change in the color of the granules this reveals that aerobic granules can recover quickly even after the increase of organic loading the results of this study are consistent with the research results of thanh et al 2009 on the properties of aerobic granules at different organic loadings 40 3 3 reaction kinetics and kinetic coefficients to investigate the kinetics of the biological reactions in removing organic matter we used four models of first order feed removal second order feed removal grau stover kincannon and the monod equation the grau and stover kincannon feed removal models for feed removal in the gsbr system showed high compliance with these models figs 5 6 as well as figs s1 s3 in the support information depict the regression of these models table 6 reports the kinetic coefficients and their adaptation order to the feed removal rate in the gsbr system in general the model results indicated that the reaction behavior in the purification system was more than matched with the second order and stover kincannon methods where increased substrate led to the higher reaction intensity by increasing the substrate the behavior of the system could also change to second order in the grau feed elimination model organic matter concentration was observed to rise and the nutrient was decisive in addition the growth rate became more dependent on the substrate concentration with high aeration time and retention time microorganisms have the opportunity to hydrolyze the suspended substrate and use it as a solution 31 as mentioned earlier we used the stover kincannon model which suggested that the removal rate of the substrate would be affected by the rate of the organic loading entering the reactor the observation of the regression coefficient also showed that the model well matched the obtained results and only 2 3 of the changes were not described by the regression model at the same time the material analysis in the system followed this model in the present study the value of Œºmax coefficients was low while kb was high which could be due to the presence of cod with rapid degradability in the leachate in addition the reason for the good performance of the plasma reactors was the non biodegradable organic matter 33 in a study of the models the results based on the first order model indicated that at the low concentrations of the output substrate high performance of the reactor the kinetic coefficients did not follow the first order model this model has been used for wastewater with a low substrate concentration 34 with the reduction of the mlss concentration the feed removal follows the first order model since the nutrient concentration grows relative to the microorganism along with the enzyme content and the microbe enters logarithmic growth in the present study k1 values increased at higher biomass concentrations indicating that at low biomass concentrations hrt is required for biological leachate treatment if the mlss concentration is high low hrt could also be effective for the treatment the results of the first order model demonstrated that at low mlss concentrations in this system the hydraulic downtime should increase which is a costly process 34 38 in the review of the monod equation the obtained results revealed that the evaluation of the monod equation was based on the description of organic matter removal during the treatment process as well as the low concentration of the organic matter entering the reactor and its control notably k ks y and kd coefficients were used to predict the variations in the system s behavior based on the wastewater source microbial population and temperature at high substrate concentrations and due to the growth rate control of microorganisms by the biomass concentration the monod equation showed a deviation from the research results the kinetic results of this study are consistent with the kinetic findings of yanjie wei study 2012 41 on the removal of organic matter and nitrogen from leachate using gsbr reactor a khan 2017 42 on the papermaking wastewater treatment using sbr reactor and the study of amin 2014 43 on saline wastewater treatment using the sbr for the first and second order models respectively however it has not been in line with stover kincannon model which can be due to the different characteristics of saline wastewater compared to leachate 4 conclusion in the present study the ntp reactor and gsbr reactor were used for purification of landfill leachate according to the results most of the concentrations of heavy metals in the leachate were k na zn ni mg and mn heavy metals were effectively removed by the two reactors but by increasing the leachate ratio from 20 to 100 the removal rate of heavy metals decreased the factors affecting the reduction of heavy metals included ph and do also increasing leachate concentrations of 20 to 100 and by increasing the olr the cod removal efficiency diminished furthermore the reaction rate of the leachate treatment by the biological reactor was a function of concentration and followed the second order kinetic and stover kincannon models due to the good efficiency of the plasma reactor and gsbr we would propose that full scale studies should be performed at the landfill site for heavy metal and organic loading reduction credit authorship contribution
